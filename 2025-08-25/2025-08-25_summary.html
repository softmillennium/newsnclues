            The House Oversight Committee has deepened its probe into the federal government's investigation of the late, disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, issuing a subpoena to his estate for an array of documents.
    


            The GOP-led committee issued the subpoena to Epstein's estate Monday, demanding a slew of documents that include the so-called “birthday book” – a reported collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday that included a note bearing President Donald Trump's name. Trump has repeatedly denied writing the letter and sued The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on it, for defamation.
    


            “Recent reporting indicates the estate of Mr. Epstein has access to documents relevant to the Committee's investigation, including the alleged ‘birthday book' prepared for Mr. Epstein by Ms. Maxwell,” GOP Chairman James Comer wrote in a letter to Epstein's estate.
    


            The committee is also seeking Epstein's will, all non-disclosure agreements executed by him, his financial documents and “any document or record that could be reasonably construed to be a potential list of clients involved in sex, sex acts, or sex trafficking” facilitated by Epstein.
    


            In a statement, Comer signaled that people involved in Epstein's estate are willing to comply with the subpoena. He set a deadline of September 8 for the estate to hand over the documents.
    


            “It is our understanding that the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is in custody and control of documents that may further the Committee's investigation and legislative goals. Further, it is our understanding the Estate is ready and willing to provide these documents to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena,” Comer said.
    


            “The Epstein Estate received a subpoena this afternoon from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; we are reviewing it. As the Co-Executors have always said, they will comply with all lawful process in this matter, and that includes the Committee's subpoena,” said Daniel Weiner of the law firm Hughes Hubbard and Reed.
    


            The Kentucky Republican also announced that the committee would sit down with Alexander Acosta, who served as secretary of the Department of Labor during Trump's first term, for a transcribed interview. During his time as US attorney in Florida, Acosta oversaw a 2008 plea deal with Epstein.
    


            Acosta, who served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, will appear voluntarily for an interview on September 19, the committee said.
    


            Acosta had been widely criticized during Trump's first term for that plea agreement.
    


            In 2019, then-Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for Acosta's resignation after accusing him of having “cut Epstein a sweetheart deal.”
    


            The escalation of the House committee's Epstein investigation comes after the Department of Justice handed over thousands of pages of Epstein-related documents to the panel last Friday. But Democrats on that panel have said only about “3 percent” have new information, including flight logs from the Customs and Border Protection agency on the location of Epstein's former plane.
    


            Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement, “After weeks of pressure from Oversight Democrats, Chairman Comer has finally issued a subpoena for Jeffrey Epstein's infamous birthday book, which contains critical information about Epstein's social network—and has agreed to hear testimony from Alex Acosta. These are important steps forward to get long-overdue answers about sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. It doesn't matter who you are: If you were involved with Jeffrey Epstein and you hurt people, you need to be held accountable.”

Lil Nas X was charged Monday with four felonies after police say he charged at them when they confronted him for walking naked down a Los Angeles street last week.
    


            Prosecutors charged the musician, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, with three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting an executive officer, the District Attorney's Office said. He was initially booked on suspicion of misdemeanor obstructing an officer on Friday.
    


            He is set to be arraigned later Monday. His representatives have not responded to requests for comment.
    


            Police said officers found the 26-year-old walking naked on Ventura Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in the Studio City neighborhood, shortly before 6 a.m. Friday,
    


            They say he charged at the officers when confronted and was arrested. Police, suspecting a possible overdose, took him to a hospital where he spent several hours before being taken to jail, where he has remained since.
    


            The charges were first reported by TMZ.
    


            The rapper and singer from Atlanta is best known for his huge hit from 2018, “Old Town Road,” which merged country and hip-hop. It spent a record 19 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.
    


            Known for his genre-bending, innovating sounds and style, his first full studio album, 2021's “Montero,” went to No. 2 on the Billboard album chart and was nominated for a Grammy for album of the year.

            Three people died when a helicopter crashed on the Isle of Wight during a flying lesson Monday morning, officials have said.
    


            One person was hospitalized and is in serious condition, according to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary.
    


            Flight operator Northumbria Helicopters said the aircraft took off from the Sandown Airport around 9 a.m. local time, with four people on board as it was undertaking a flying lesson.
    


            About 24 minutes later, police said they were called about a helicopter that had crashed in a field near a road in the Shanklin area.
    


            Aerial footage on British media showed the body of the aircraft – a G-OCLV model – was significantly damaged.
    


            Emergency responders from various agencies were deployed to the accident site and closed off the road.
    


            The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch has sent inspectors to gather evidence and make inquiries.
    


            Northumbria Helicopters said they are cooperating with investigators.
    


            The cause of the crash is not yet known.
    


            The Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said they were unable to provide further information about the people involved.

The 65 biggest banks committed $869 billion to firms expanding the fossil fuel industry last year, a new report says.

Big banks across the world are substantially increasing their financing of the fossil fuel industry, including for the industry's expansion during a time of intensifying climate crisis, all while pulling back from previously stated climate commitments.

These are among the key highlights of the most recent Banking on Climate Chaos report, which found that the 65 biggest banks globally committed a whopping $869 billion to companies conducting business in fossil fuels in 2024, representing a huge $162 billion increase from 2023.

“These financial flows reflect the policy retreat of banks abandoning climate goals for short-term profits,” Campaign Director for the Climate and Energy Program at Rainforest Action Network Dianne Enriquez told Truthout.

Banking on Climate Chaos, co-authored by several organizations including Rainforest Action Network, Oil Change International, Indigenous Environmental Network, and Sierra Club, is an authoritative annual study — endorsed by hundreds of organizations across the world — of how banks finance the fossil fuel industry.

The report also shows that U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo dominated the heights of fossil fuel financing. A Truthout analysis reveals that the CEOs of the top six U.S. banks that are financing fossil fuels together made over a half-billion dollars from 2022 to 2024. CEO pay is astronomically larger than the average incomes of communities most impacted by their fossil fuel financing.

“These billion-dollar industries are making money off of our backs while killing us,” Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which endorsed the report, told Truthout.

The most notable finding in the new report is that, during 2024, global banks “significantly increased their fossil fuel financing, including ramping up finance for fossil fuel expansion,” with the 65 biggest banks globally committing $429 billion to companies expanding fossil fuel production and infrastructure in 2024.

As the report notes, the “growth in fossil fuel finance is troubling because new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in more decades of fossil fuel dependence.”

“Global banks continue to fuel the climate crisis at an alarming scale,” Jessye Waxman, Sustainable Finance Campaign Advisor for the Sierra Club, told Truthout.

This comes amid intensifying climate chaos and the desperate need to vastly ramp down fossil fuel production, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has called for “a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use” without delay.

U.S. banks dominated the list of banks increasing their fossil fuel financing, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Morgan Stanley holding six of the top eight spots. These banks all increased their fossil fuel financing from 2023 to 2024 by a range of 30 percent to 50 percent, amounting to nearly $70 billion more fossil fuel funding between them.

“U.S. banks are leading this surge,” said Waxman, who noted that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo alone “collectively represent over 21 percent of the total global fossil fuel financing covered in the report.”

The report shows that banks based in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan account for around 83 percent of fossil fuel financing globally, highlighting the massive imbalance of fossil financing profiteering that comes from the Global North while disproportionately impacting the Global South. The report includes case studies on the banking behind contested companies and projects worldwide, such as Mozambique LNG and JSW Steel in India.

“Globally, people are paying dearly,” said RAN's Enriquez.

All told, the 65 biggest banks in the report have committed a staggering $7.9 trillion in fossil fuel financing since 2016, the year the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, went into effect, the report notes.

Banking on Climate Chaos also contains findings on howbanks finance fossil fuel corporations — findings that support the claim that banks have been “greenwashing” themselves by giving lip service to climate concerns even as they continue to bankroll climate catastrophe.

Notably, the report found that only 5.3 percent of financing to fossil fuel companies came at the project level, whereas 94.7 percent of it came at the corporate level. This corporate-level financing increased by nearly $117 billion from 2023 to 2024.

In other words, while banks have restricted direct financing of dirty fossil fuel projects that could garner bad publicity, they've simultaneously increased direct, unhindered financing to the corporationsdoing business in fossil fuels.

“Banks' corporate financing loophole is a textbook case of greenwashing,” said Sierra Club's Waxman, noting that the loophole “gives fossil fuel companies unrestricted capital to pursue harmful expansion.”

“It renders banks' climate policies toothless by allowing them to maintain the illusion of responsibility, while behind the scenes, they continue to bankroll the fossil fuel industry,” said Waxman.

All this adds weight to accusations of greenwashing: Banks are making face-saving gestures even as they continue to bolster the corporate coffers of the fossil fuel industry.

Meanwhile, the report also highlights many banks' rapid flight from the net-zero “commitments” that they so adamantly committed themselves to just a few years ago.

The prime evidence of this is the near-total collapse of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a United Nations-supported initiative to align global banks' lending and underwriting practices with the goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Leading fossil fuel financiers like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo had previously celebrated their self-proclaimed climate concerns by joining the NZBA. But in the face of rising opportunities to capitalize on fossil fuel expansion — from corporate mergers and expanded drilling practices to a new oil-friendly Trump administration — these banks and many more have quit the NZBA entirely. U.S. lawmakers have suggested that banks like JPMorgan Chase have misled the public and investors as it backed away from its purported climate commitments.

All told, the report's data and analysis support the notion that banks are not passive actors when it comes to the global climate crisis. Rather, banks are active agents maneuvering to keep bankrolling fossil fuels corporations, and they have revealed their climate commitments to be exceedingly thin.

The report starkly illustrates how U.S. banks dominated global fossil fuel financing in 2024, occupying half of the top dozen slots. JPMorgan Chase was the top bank financing fossil fuels ($53.5 billion), with Bank of America second ($46 billion), Citigroup third ($44.7 billion), Wells Fargo fifth ($39.3 billion), Goldman Sachs tenth ($28.5 billion), and Morgan Stanley twelfth ($27 billion).

Top executives at these banks have also personally profited enormously as they've overseen an expansion in fossil fuel financing in recent years. A Truthout analysis shows that, according to their banks' most recent proxy statements, from 2022 and 2024, the CEOs of these banks together raked in well over a half-billion dollars — $543.75 million in total — in their total compensation.

In 2024, these six banks' CEOs took in a total of $185,350,903 million, or an average of nearly $31 million.

Notably, this CEO compensation is astronomically higher than the per capita incomes of communities most impacted by the fossil fuel projects overseen by companies that their banks are financing.

One of those communities is Lake Charles, Louisiana, which is surrounded by fossil fuel and petrochemical facilities. As Truthout previously reported, local organizers like the Vessel Project's Ozane are resisting the construction of facilities like Venture Global's huge new LNG export terminal, Calcasieu Pass 2.

Banking on Climate Chaos notes that Venture Global LNG's top two bankers in 2024 were Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.

In 2024, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, was the top earner in 2024 with $39 million. (As of April 2025, Dimon also owned 7,186,564 units of JPMorgan stock, worth today around over $2 billion.) By contrast, the per capita income in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is $35,847. This means Dimon took in 1,087 times the per capita income of a Lake Charles resident last year. Ted Pick, CEO of Morgan Stanley, took in $24,881,032 in 2024, or 694 times the income of an average Lake Charles resident. (It's worth noting that while Morgan Stanley's April 2025 proxy statement reported Pick's 2024 compensation at $24,881,032, an earlier February 2025 filing said his 2024 compensation was set as $34 million, which would be 948 times the income of an average Lake Charles resident).

The injustice of these stark disparities resonates with Ozane, who told Truthout she founded the Vessel Project amid the destruction caused by climate-induced disasters that included Hurricanes Laura and Delta. “I started connecting the dots and really looking at the intersection between these low-income neighborhoods facing these crises versus the polluters who are causing these climate-induced disasters,” Ozane said.

Ozane called Jamie Dimon's 2024 compensation of $39 million “staggering,” especially given that it was “based off investments in fossil fuel projects that are not only killing the people in my community, but harming this entire world.”

“It highlights the troubling disconnect between the financial elite like Jamie Dimon and everyday people like myself and my community members,” she said. “It's especially troubling when his bank finances a project like Venture Global, which is the largest polluter when it comes to methane gas, and it's right there in my community, a community that is struggling.”

Banking on Climate Chaos ends with robust demands aimed at curbing bank financing of fossil fuel expansion, instituting policies to advance the transition from fossil fuels and securing climate, protecting human and Indigenous rights, and securing a just and fair energy transition.

“Ultimately, we'd like for banks to immediately halt financing fossil fuel companies that are doing fossil fuel expansion,” Enriquez said.

Waxman also pointed out the need for regulators to “set strong, binding policies — at all levels from regional to state to national — that incentivize banks to clean up their act or face significant penalties.”

Ozane wants to see financial institutions from Citi and JPMorgan in the U.S. to Mizuho and MUFG in Japan take a more responsible approach to their investments and prioritize funding for renewable energy.

“It's time for these institutions to align their practices with the urgent need for climate action and the urgent need to put people before profit,” she said.

Genetically modified lung functioned for nine days, in latest development in xenotransplantation aimed at solving organ shortage crisis

Surgeons have transplanted a lung from a genetically modified pig into a brain dead human recipient for the first time and found it functioned for nine days, researchers have revealed.

The work is the latest development in a technique called xenotransplantation that is aimed at solving the organ shortage crisis: according to the World Health Organization, only up to 10% of the global need for such transplants is being met.

However, experts have stressed there is a long way to go before pig lungs can be used in patients.

Dr Justin Chan, a lung transplant surgeon for the NYU Langone Transplant Institute who was not involved in the work, described the study as “exciting and promising work”, but said the report concerned only one patient and was a “qualified success”.

“These lungs are not able to independently sustain a patient,” he added.

Andrew Fisher, a professor of respiratory transplant medicine at Newcastle University, agreed. “This work is very welcome in furthering our understanding, but it marks an incremental step forward. There is much more work required and we are not on the dawn of an era of lung xenotransplantation using pig lungs,” he said.

Xenotransplantation has become a hot area of research in recent years, with the heart, kidneys and liver among the organs that have been transplanted into humans from pigs. The latter are typically genetically modified by removing certain pig genes and inserting specific human genes, to reduce rejection of the organs by the recipient's body.

Studies are often initially carried out on brain dead human recipients before, in some cases, being used in living patients. While there have been only a handful of living recipients, many have died within weeks or months of such surgery, albeit not necessarily from complications relating to the transplant. However, some with transplanted pig kidneys have survived with the organs still functioning several months after the procedure.

But experts say xenotransplantation using lungs is particularly tricky.

“Every breath you breathe in is bringing the external environment into the body,” said Fisher. This means the lungs need to be very capable of responding to attacks from pollution, infection and other sources. “So the immune system in the lung is very sensitive and very active, which means when you're dealing with organ transplantation, where you know you don't want the immune system to be very active, it poses extra challenges.”

Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in China reported how they transplanted the left lung from a Chinese Bama Xiang donor pig with six genetic modifications into a 39-year-old brain dead male recipient.

The team found the lung remained viable and functional over a 216-hour period and did not trigger hyperacute rejection – a rapid, violent immune response by the recipient's body. There were also no signs of infection.

However, 24 hours after transplantation the lung showed signs of fluid accumulation and damage, possibly initially due to transplant-related inflammation. And despite the recipient being given powerful immunosuppressive medication, the transplanted organ was progressively attacked by antibodies, resulting in significant damage over time.

“The impact of the damage was likely underestimated [because] the human recipient still had one of their own lungs present and this would have compensated for the damaged porcine lung,” said Fisher.

Prof Peter Friend, from the University of Oxford, said the results were complicated by the fact brain death itself causes an acute inflammatory state. “So some of what they are seeing may be a function of the brain dead status of the recipient,” he said.

The researchers behind the work said the approach needed to be refined.

“Continued efforts are needed to optimise immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase,” they wrote.

Friend said other approaches to increasing the availability of organs were being investigated, including remodelling donor organs using stem cells.

Some research groups are also exploring the possibility of growing humanised organs inside pigs or sheep.

Fisher added that while xenotransplantation for lungs held promise, another promising avenue was to treat human donor lungs deemed to be unsuitable for transplantation so they could be used.

“If we get that right, that's something can be implemented within months, and certainly in years could be making very big differences,” he said.

            A rare case of travel-related New World screwworm was identified in Maryland in a patient who traveled from El Salvador, a spokesperson from the US Department of Health and Human Services said.
    


            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Department of Health are investigating the case of the flesh-eating parasite, which was confirmed on August 4, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said.
    


            “This is the first human case of travel-associated New World screwworm myiasis (parasitic infestation of fly larvae) from an outbreak-affected country identified in the United States,” Nixon said in an email. “Currently, the risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low.”
    


            A spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Health said in a statement that the Maryland resident has recovered from the infection and that “there is no indication of transmission to any other individuals or animals.”
    


            An outbreak of New World screwworms — the larval form of a type of fly that's known to nest in the wounds of warm-blooded animals and slowly eat them alive — has been spreading across Central America since early 2023, with infestations recorded in Belize,  Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama. The fly reached southern Mexico late last year, sparking concern among US agricultural industry officials and triggering closures of border-area cattle, horse and bison trading ports this year.
    


The US has a plan to breed millions of flies and drop them from planes. Here's why



            The parasite poses a significant threat to animal populations and the food supply. The United States mostly eradicated New World screwworm populations in the 1960s and 1970s by breeding sterilized males of the species and dispersing them from planes to mate with wild female flies. This month, the US Department of Agriculture announced it would construct a fly production facility in Edinburg, Texas, at Moore Air Force Base, that could produce up to 300 million sterile flies per week. It will work with facilities in Panama and Mexico, the USDA said.
    


            “The construction of a domestic sterile fly production facility will ensure the United States continues to lead the way in combating this devastating pest,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said this month. “If our ranchers are overrun by foreign pests, then we cannot feed ourselves.”
    


            The USDA said it will also provide up to $100 million for additional technologies, including traps and lures, therapeutics and techniques that could bolster fly production. The agency also said it would employ mounted patrol officers known as “Tick Riders” for surveillance and would train screwworm detection dogs to search for outbreaks among livestock.
    


            This month, HHS issued an emergency declaration that allowed the US Food and Drug Administration more flexibility for animal drugs to treat and prevention New World screwworm infestations. There are no FDA-approved drugs for New World screwworm in the United States, but the declaration allows the agency to authorize drugs for emergency authorization.
    


US halts live cattle imports from Mexico to quell screwworm spread



            New World screwworms are the parasitic larva of a metallic blue blow fly species called Cochliomyia hominivorax. Unlike all other blow flies native to the Western Hemisphere, the New World screwworm feeds on the flesh of living animals, rather than dead ones, Dr. Phillip Kaufman, a professor and head of the department of entomology at Texas A&M University, previously told CNN.
    


            The flesh-eating maggots go for most warm-blooded animals, including horses and cows. They can also infect pets and humans.
    


            “After mating, the female fly finds a living host, lands on its wound, and will lay up to 200 to 300 eggs,” Kaufman explained. “After 12 to 24 hours, those eggs all hatch, and they immediately start burrowing and feeding on the tissue of that animal, causing very, very large wounds to form.”
    


            Treatment for infested cattle often involves cleaning, antiseptic treatment and coverings for wounds. If left untreated, the flies can kill an animal in a matter of one to two weeks and spread to others.
    


            “These flies will land on on an animal that has even just a small scratch, just a small break in the skin, to lay the eggs,” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University. “And when the eggs hatch, the maggots will burrow in, and they will very quickly turn living tissue into Swiss cheese.”

Live Updates


            • Law enforcement crackdown: President Donald Trump signed an executive order that the administration says will create specialized National Guard units to “deal with public order issues.” Trump has been looking to take his crime crackdown national, and officials tell CNN the administration has been planning to deploy the National Guard to Chicago.
    


            • Deportation push: The president is also pursuing a sweeping immigration crackdown. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has served as a flashpoint in the debate over Trump's deportation push, was taken into custody by ICE this morning shortly after turning himself in. The Trump administration warned it could send him to Uganda as soon as this week.
    


            • South Korea's leader visits: Trump is hosting Lee Jae Myung of South Korea, a key economic and national security ally. During their summit, Lee asked Trump to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
    


            President Donald Trump repeatedly slammed Illinois lawmakers and said that Chicago is “a disaster” as he signed an executive order that the administration says will create specialized National Guard units to “deal with public order issues.”
    


            Trump called the Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “incompetent” as he pushed back against criticism of his administration's potential plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago. Trump also attacked Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, calling him “corrupt.”
    


            “I hate to barge in on a city and then be treated horribly by corrupt politicians and bad politicians, like a guy like Pritzker,” he said.
    


            Trump went on to say, “Chicago, Illinois is a disaster. I have property there. It's a disaster what's going on in Chicago.”
    


            The president pushed back against Pritzker's criticisms of his administration.
    


                    “When I have some slob like Pritzker criticizing us before we even go there. I made the statement that next should be Chicago because, as you all know, Chicago is a killing field right now. And they don't acknowledge it. And they say, ‘We don't need him. Freedom, freedom. He's a dictator. He's a dictator.' A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we like a dictator.' I don't like a dictator. I'm not a dictator. I'm a man with great common sense and a smart person,” Trump said.
                





            Trump also went after Illinois' cashless bail policy.
    


            “You don't even have to go to court sometimes. No, Illinois. I love that state. It's a great state, but it's run so badly by Pritzker. They threw him out of the family business and he becomes governor. Now he wants to run for president. I don't think that's going to happen,” Trump claimed.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday warned there “could be very big consequences” for Russia if it does not stop its war in Ukraine, telling reporters in the Oval Office he'll “step in very strongly” if an agreement to end the fighting isn't made sometime in the next two weeks.
    


            “There could be very big consequences, but we'll see what happens. There might be very big consequences, because this is something that has to end,” said Trump, pressed on how long he'd allow the conflict to play out.
    


            “We'll see what happens over the next week or two, and at that point, I'll step in very strongly, and if I have to be there, I'll be there, and we'll either have a deal or we won't.”
    


            Trump on Friday said he'd give Russian President Vladimir Putin “a couple of weeks” after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart. The two-week deadline is an oft-repeated refrain from the president.
    


            Trump on Monday acknowledged “tremendous dislike” between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but reiterated that he'd like the two leaders to meet.
    


            “It's very complex, it's very personal from their standpoint. There's tremendous dislike personally between the two men, and we're going to have to straighten that out,” he said.
    


            “But I would like to see them meet first. They'd like me to be there. I may be there, I may not. I'll see.”
    


            President Donald Trump praised South Korean President Lee Jae Myung during their meeting at the White House, commending his leadership and approach to North Korea as a shift from previous South Korean administrations.
    


            “You've had a lot of leaders, I've gone through a lot of leaders in South Korea,” Trump said. “You know, it's been quick. You'll be there for a long time,” he added.
    


            “The various leaders that I've dealt with, they were not approaching it properly, in my opinion, having to do with North Korea, but I think your approach is a much better one,” he said.
    


            Lee said he hoped the US leader would help usher in a new era of diplomacy on the Korean peninsula.
    


            Trump quickly agreed. “I will do that, and we'll have talks. He'd like to meet with me,” the US president said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
    


            “We look forward to meeting with him, and we'll make relations better. You'll help that.”
    


            As he met with Donald Trump in the White House, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung asked the US president to work on establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.
    


            “I think you are the first president to have so much interest in the world's peace issues and actually made achievements,” Lee said.
    


                    “So, I hope you would make peace on the Korean Peninsula, which remains the only separated country in the world, and meet with (North Korea's leader) Kim Jong Un,” he added.
                





            Lee jokingly suggested that a Trump tower should be built in North Korea, “so I can go play golf in Pyongyang as well.”
    


            The South Korean presdient said that the peninsula was stable during Trump's first administration.
    


            “But during the short hiatus where you were out of office, North Korea developed further its nuclear and missile capabilities, and that led to a deterioration of the situation,” Lee said.
    


            President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House today that he's heard “bad things” about a raid of South Korea's church earlier this month, hinting he planned to raise the issue with South Korean president Lee Jae-myung as they meet at the White House.
    


            “Well, I heard that there were raids on churches over the last few days, very vicious raids on churches by the new government in South Korea, that they even went into a military base and got information,” Trump said. “They probably shouldn't have done that, but I heard bad things. I don't know if it's true or not. I'll be finding out.”
    


            Lee's meeting with Trump at the White House began moments ago.
    


            Earlier today, the president took to his Truth Social platform to express concerns over the political climate in South Korea, writing, “Seems like a Purge or Revolution.”
    


            It is unclear what church Trump was referring to, but earlier this month, South Korea's police searched and seized Sarang Jeil Church, led by far-right conservative Reverend Jun Kwang-hun. The search stemmed from the church's alleged connection with the rioters who stormed into the Seoul Western District Court in January in protest of an arrest warrant that was issued for then-President Yoon Suk Yeol.
    


            Yoon's supporters have argued the search of the church was unfair. Two members of the church have been sentenced to prison terms for intruding into the court.
    


            The church denied having any connections with the riot and all allegations. A police investigation is ongoing.
    


            South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has arrived to the White House for his meeting US President Donald Trump.
    


            Trump greeted the South Korean leader, shaking his hand outside. Today marks the first in-person meeting between Trump and Lee since the South Korean president's election.
    


Possibly on the agenda: Lee, who spoke to reporters yesterday, said US demands that South Korea embrace flexibility for American troops based on its shores “cannot be easily agreed on.”
    


            Generally, Seoul's trade and military relationships with the US have faced pressure from Trump's “America First” policies.
    


            President Donald Trump revealed today that he has spoken again with Russian President Vladimir Putin following their conversation last Monday — and made it clear he's frustrated with continued Russian attacks on Ukraine.
    


            “Every conversation I have with him is a good conversation,” Trump told reporters during an executive order signing in the Oval Office, referring to Putin. “And then, unfortunately, a bomb is loaded up into Kyiv or someplace, and then I'd get very angry about it.”
    


            When asked if he had spoken to Putin since last Monday, Trump responded: ”Yes.” He also noted that the Alaska summit with Putin made him think the Russian leader does want a resolution with Ukraine.
    


            But the president offered no further details on any formal bilateral or trilateral summits that would include Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite Trump's multiple recent meetings with those two and European leaders that were partially focused on arranging a sit-down between Zelensky and Putin.
    


            Asked why Putin is reluctant to meet with Zelensky, Trump bluntly said today: “Because he doesn't like him,” adding: “They don't like each other, really.”
    


            Trump also said he and other leaders still need to have discussions about security guarantees for Ukraine. He didn't offer many specifics, though he's previously ruled out US boots on the ground.
    


            “US air assets over the skies of Ukraine is part of a security guarantee,” Trump said. “Those US airmen are also security guarantees, because we haven't even discussed the specifics of it.”
    


            President Donald Trump said he's still deciding on whom to endorse in the Texas Senate race.
    


            He said that he likes both incumbent Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.
    


            “Well, I'll make up my mind. I like them both. The worst situation I have is when I have two people that I get along with well. I hate it. And they all want the endorsement. You know I'm almost — 100% of the people I endorse win. It's a great honor,” the president said. “I'd rather not comment on it right now.”
    


            He continued: “They're both friends of mine. And they're both good and very different.”
    


            President Donald Trump deflected on a question about whether he plans to investigate former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie today over a decade-old political scandal, but appeared to give the green light to the Department of Justice to open a probe.
    


            “I don't know, if they want to look at it. It's not for me. If they want to look at it, they can. You could ask Pam (Bondi). I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder,” Trump said from the Oval Office.
    


            “I always felt he was guilty, but what he did is he took the George Washington bridge — it was very serious. He closed down the George Washington bridge,” he said.
    


            The “Bridgegate” scandal stemmed from the abrupt closure of local traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge, one of the world's busiest bridges, for four days in September 2013.
    


            Prosecutors alleged the lane closures were part of a deliberate effort to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who did not endorse Republican incumbent Christie in his 2013 reelection bid. Christie was never implicated in the scandal and has long denied any connection to it.
    


            Over the weekend, Trump threatened an investigation after Christie criticized the president during an interview on ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.
    


            Trump said Christie “blamed other people” for the bridge incident, but if the Department of Justice wants to investigate “they can.”
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday accused Democratic lawmakers of rallying behind Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, because they think “he's going to be good for votes.”
    


            “They think he's going to be good for votes,” Trump said. “And I think he's very bad for votes.”
    


            Both Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration has Abrego Garcia “under control”
    


            “He will no longer terrorize our country. He's currently charged with human smuggling, including children. The guy needs to be in prison. He doesn't need to be on the streets like all these liberals want him to be,” Bondi said.
    


            Garcia was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Monday morning after turning himself in to a facility in Baltimore. His attorneys then filed a new lawsuit urging a federal judge to order his release and slow down his removal process so he can have a chance to challenge his potential deportation to Uganda.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that his administration will file a lawsuit in response to California's redistricting efforts, which, if successful, would install more Democratic lawmakers to offset a similar move by the GOP in Texas.
    


            Asked by a reporter if there were any federal mechanisms he's planning on using to fight back against the redistricting bills recently passed in the state, Trump said:
    


                    “Well I think I'm going to be filing a lawsuit, pretty soon. And I think we're going to be very successful in it. We're going to be filing it through the Department of Justice, that's going to happen.”
                





Remember: California Democrats have passed a trio of bills backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to temporarily redraw the state's congressional maps — if voters approve the change. The proposal would likely net the party five US House seats, dealing a counterpunch to efforts backed by Trump in GOP-led states.
    


            President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday that the administration says will task Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth with establishing “specialized units” in the National Guard that will be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues.”
    


            This move follows a directive by Hegseth last week that authorized members of the National Guard, who were deployed as part of Trump's anti-crime agenda in Washington, DC, to begin carrying weapons.
    


            National Guard members deployed to DC started carrying sidearms Sunday, a spokesperson for the Joint Task Force carrying out the mission told CNN.
    


            On Monday, Trump suggested he'd ask Congress to codify the action, telling reporters in the Oval Office, “I think Democrats will actually vote for this.”
    


            Trump signed several other executive actions Monday targeting cashless bail, withholding federal grant funding to jurisdictions that have abolished cash bail and moving criminal defendants in DC to federal custody where applicable to ensure they'll be held in federal prison pre-trial.
    


            Another order he signed enacts stricter penalties on American flag-burning, subjecting those who burn the US flag to one year in prison “where there's evidence of criminal activity.”
    


            President Donald Trump said without any evidence that Congress has promised him unlimited funding to revitalize Washington, DC, as he laid out his vision for how to “beautify” the capital city.
    


            “Congress has said that they'll give us whatever money is needed to fix up the capital,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.
    


            “And we're going to also beautify Washington. We're going to rip down the broken medians, fix them, we're going to put asphalt on the roads. We're not ripping them apart,” Trump said.
    


            “We're going to be replacing much of the asphalt in the road in the city, which is in bad shape,” he added.
    


            Congressional leadership has not signaled that DC will have unlimited funds. And House Republicans have yet to restore $1 billion in funding for the District of Columbia, following a budgetary fight in Congress earlier this year. The Senate passed a funding bill that restored funding, but the measure stalled in the House and remains in procedural limbo.
    


            Trump's remarks come as Congress prepares to return next month for what's expected to be a heated budget showdown, with government funding set to expire at the end of September.
    


            President Donald Trump is now signing executive orders in the Oval Office.
    


            You can watch this in our livestream, at the top of this page, and we'll bring you updates as we get them.
    


            The Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, two officials have told CNN.
    


            It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment. The Washington Post first reported on the plans.
    


Reaction: Trump's approach to crime in Chicago is more “performative” than actually crafted to make an impact on the ground, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN yesterday.
    


                    “One of the things that we embrace — my office and other law enforcement agencies throughout the state — is a ‘one team' concept, which includes partnership with federal law enforcement agencies who are trained to deal with crime, which the National Guard is not,” Raoul told CNN's Isabel Rosales, citing the FBI, DEA, ATF and Secret Service as examples.”
                





            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backed Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's assertion that the Trump administration has “no authority” to send the National Guard to Chicago.
    


                    “We should continue to support local law enforcement, and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction, because he's deeply unpopular,” Jeffries said.
                





Washington, DC: Meanwhile, US National Guard members deployed to Washington, DC, started carrying their sidearms on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Joint Task Force carrying out the mission told CNN. Read more on that here.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today cracking down on suspects who desecrate the American flag, a White House official told CNN. We reported earlier on an executive order he's due to sign on the elimination of cashless bail in jurisdictions which have it.



            This order will direct the attorney general to prosecute those who violate the law in ways that involve desecrating the flag and to pursue litigation to clarify the scope of First Amendment in this area, according to a fact sheet on the order provided to CNN.
    


            It also instructs the attorney general to refer flag desecration cases that violate state or local laws to the appropriate state or local authorities.
    


                    “The order directs the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security and the Attorney General to deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits, or naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits, or seek removal from the United States, wherever there has been an appropriate determination that flag desecration by foreign nationals permits the exercise of those remedies under applicable law,” the fact sheet says.
                





Some context: A 1989 Supreme Court ruling determined that burning the American flag in political protest is protected under the First Amendment.
    


            Fox News was first to report that the president is expected to sign the order today.
    


CNN's Alayna Treene contributed to this report. 



            President Donald Trump has expressed concerns this morning over political developments in South Korea ahead of his expected bilateral meeting with President Lee Jae Myung.
    


            “WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can't have that and do business there. I am seeing the new President today at the White House. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!” Trump just wrote in a Truth Social post.



            Lee, who spoke to reporters yesterday ahead of his meeting with Trump, said US demands that South Korea embrace flexibility for American troops based on its shores “cannot be easily agreed on.” Generally, Seoul's trade and military relationships with the US have faced pressure from Trump's “America First” policies.
    


            Trump did not elaborate on what specific events he was referring to, but his remarks appear to allude to the recent impeachment and removal of former conservative South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon was ousted from office by the country's Constitutional Court in April, following a controversial decision to declare martial law in December, a move that drew widespread criticism and sparked mass protests.
    


Some context: Some right-wing figures in South Korea have alleged Yoon's removal was politically motivated and have looked to Trump as a potential ally in challenging the legitimacy of the current administration.
    


            The South Korean government has been saying that Lee's summits with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who he met with on Saturday, and with Trump, as well as sending special envoys to countries including China, are signals that South Korea has returned to international diplomacy efforts after lacking a president for months.
    


            Turning back now to the visit of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to the White House later today.
    


            Lee told reporters ahead of his trip to Washington that he was happy to have “all necessary discussions without limits” about North Korea with his US counterpart Donald Trump.
    


            “Nuclear and North Korean issues, and peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula are all the utmost priority for South Korean security,” Lee said on board his flight to the US.
    


Some context: Lee's trip to Washington comes after a turbulent time in South Korean politics. He took office in June after the previous president, Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative rival who took a far more hawkish stance on North Korea, was impeached for a botched attempt to impose martial law late last year.
    


            Lee's conservative critics and opponents accused him of being soft on North Korea, something he has consistently rejected.
    


            We'll bring you more on Lee's visit to the White House, as we get it.
    


            If you're just joining us, here's a look at what's on President Donald Trump's agenda today.
    


            At 10 a.m. ET, he will sign executive orders in the Oval Office. One of those orders is expected to pressure jurisdictions to eliminate cashless bail, two White House officials told CNN.
    


            Then, at around noon ET, Trump will meet with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House.
    


            The pair are due to take part in a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office at around 12.15 p.m. ET before lunch 30 minutes later.
    


            We'll keep you updated through the day.
    


            A central focus of President Donald Trump's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House will be on an expected deal on shipbuilding, White House National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett told CNN today.

While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines.

As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.

The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.

In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.

“CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” she added.

A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.

“All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.”

Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.

The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.

While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state — at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.

“This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.”

“The CDC Is ‘Stressed' Currently”

Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.

“I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.”

In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.

One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.

“Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5.

“It never hurts to ask the CDC,” said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.

“I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,” Milton wrote. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed' currently.”

Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.

“The CDC had gone dark,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. “We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.”

Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after. 

“There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said.

Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. “Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. “The CDC was gagged,” he said.

Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.

“It's not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. “It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.”

To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. “We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,” she said.

Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records “confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.”

Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.

“Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,” Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.

Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.

Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. “It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,” Holbrooks said.

Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against covid restrictions deepened that mistrust.

Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.

“I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.”

Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.

About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.

Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said.

Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.

In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.

The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.

“I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,” Zucker said.

Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: “I'm so overwhelmed.”

A Death Ignites a Response

On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.

In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were “flying off the shelf.”

Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.

Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including one founded by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.

“How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?” Milton asked in an email.

Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. “HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,” one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. “If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.”

Another CDC official said they've had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.

While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. “We're providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.”

The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.

Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with dangerously inaccurate statements. “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,” he said. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.” There is no evidence that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.

In another interview, Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.

HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.

“Staff Are Exhausted”

Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.

“Local hospitals are at capacity,” wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. “The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,” he added.

“I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.”

The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.

None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.

Then another child in West Texas died of measles.

In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. “There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” Sugarman said. “We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.”

Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn't see the need to confirm it.”

On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.

The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.

More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers on the fringes of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on “medical mismanagement,” without evidence.

At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.

Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. “The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,” she wrote. “Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.”

Ukraine aims to secure at least $1 billion a month from its allies to purchase American-made weapons as it fights off Russia's ongoing invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Aug. 25.

Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Zelensky said Norway had joined NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) program, which allows participating nations to buy weapons from the United States.

"Our goal is to fill this program with no less than $1 billion every month," Zelensky said. "We also discussed our domestic drone production and joint opportunities with partners. Investments now can help not only physically but also force Russia to end this war."

Zelensky added that more Ukrainian-made drones for air defense and long-range strikes would increase pressure on Moscow, as it continues to disregard calls for a ceasefire.

Ukraine's request comes as Kyiv seeks to anchor long-term U.S. security guarantees through a major arms procurement deal. 

Zelensky said on Aug. 18, Ukraine had proposed buying $90 billion worth of U.S. weapons — financed largely by European partners — as the second pillar of its security framework, alongside building a strong domestic army and expanding drone production.

Financial Times earlier reported Kyiv had initially suggested a $100 billion figure before revising it to $90 billion. The proposal aims to tie U.S. support to a massive boost for American industry, framing it as an investment opportunity.

The plan also calls for a $50 billion partnership with Ukrainian companies to produce drones and includes Kyiv's previous request for at least 10 U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems.

The proposals were presented to European allies and the White House ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's Aug. 18 meeting with Zelensky. 

Earlier, in July,  Zelensky said he had reached an agreement with Trump on the sale of Ukrainian drones to the United States, estimating the potential contract to be worth between $10 billion and $30 billion.

Ukraine has expanded drone production across all domains — air, land, and sea — since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.

"They are living in nearly inhumane conditions. We cannot provide any administrative or social services there," Andriy Besedin, head of the Kupiansk military-civil administration, said.

During his Aug. 25 speech, Trump made contradictory statements about the possibility of ending Russia's war against Ukraine. He said he intends to arrange a meeting between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia but then added that it might not happen at all.



"I can't imagine a better gift for (Russia's President Vladimir) Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the Internet," Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said. 

"We also discussed our domestic drone production and joint opportunities with partners. Investments now can help not only physically but also force Russia to end this war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"By taking part in a festival that brings together (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's supporters and mouthpieces, Allen is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine every day for 11 years," Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said. 





The move underscores Norway's growing role in supporting Ukraine's defense as Western partners move closer to finalizing security guarantees amid a push to organize a high-level meeting between Kyiv and Moscow.

"We would like to understand from the American side whether the Russians are ready — and in what format — for a bilateral, and eventually trilateral, meeting," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

A source close to Zaluzhnyi told the Guardian that his refusal was a "principled position" and a sign of unity, reflecting Ukraine's feeling of having been "humiliated."

But another recent announcement may make the "Long Neptune" slightly redundant.

The video showing Russia's fuel crisis, water shortages in occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian strikes on oil refineries and Russia's military losses, was aired simultaneously on 116 television channels on Ukraine's Independence Day, according to the source.

Ukrainian forces downed 76 out of the 104 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

Donald Trump's late announcement left operators with ‘extremely limited timeframe to get prepared'

Postal services across Europe have suspended most parcel shipments to the US, citing widespread uncertainty about the impact of new import tariffs announced by Donald Trump.

France's La Poste on Monday joined other operators, including Germany's Deutsche Post, Spain's Correos, Poste Italiane and the Belgian, Swedish and Danish postal services, which all halted a majority of US-bound shipments over the weekend.

Austria's Österreichische Post and the UK's Royal Mail said they would stop accepting packages on Tuesday, to allow enough time for packages posted before then to arrive in the US before the tariffs, scheduled to come into force at the end of August, kick in.

The US president last month signed an executive order abolishing from 29 August a tax exemption that allowed small packages worth less than $800 – the preferred option for many small European businesses – to enter the US duty-free.

A total of 1.36bn packages were sent last year under the so-called “de minimis” exemption, containing goods worth $64.6bn, according to US Customs, but such parcels will now face a 15% tariff – the same rate as most other imports from the EU.

Analysts have said that the regulatory changes, if they are maintained, are likely to have a considerable impact, particularly on small and medium-sized European companies exporting lower-value goods to the US.

European postal services said they would continue to ship letters and parcels sent by individuals containing gifts worth less than €100, but warned that these would be subject to extra checks to prevent the service being used for commercial goods.

The operators blamed widespread uncertainty about how the new tariffs would work, as well as a lack of time to prepare.

“Key questions remain, particularly regarding who will have to pay the tariffs and how, what additional data will be required, and how data will be transmitted to US Customs,” said DHL, Europe's largest logistics company, which owns Deutsche Post.

The company said it was no longer “accepting or transporting parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US”.

La Poste, which sends 1.6m packages on average to the US each year, 80% of them from businesses and 20% from individuals, said the new rules had been confirmed by US authorities only on 15 August.

The late announcement had left European postal services with “an extremely limited timeframe to get prepared. Moreover, the rules' related documentation still requires further clarification,” the French operator said.

Poste Italiane said it had been “forced to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing merchandise destined for the US”. The Nordic logistics company PostNord said the the pause was “unfortunate but necessary”.

The Dutch postal service, PostNL, said the Trump administration was pressing ahead with the new duties despite US authorities lacking a system to collect them, while Royal Mail said it hoped the interruption would last only a few days.

PostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no practical solutions could be found before 29 August, it was likely that all its members would suspend the bulk of parcel shipments to the US.

Move is an escalation in president's efforts to take control of law enforcement in the capital city and beyond

Donald Trump on Monday signed two executive orders aimed at eliminating cashless bail for people accused of crimes in Washington DC and other jurisdictions, an escalation in his efforts to take control of law enforcement in the capital city and beyond.

The executive orders direct Washington and other localities to end their cashless bail programs, which allow people charged with crimes to leave jail while they await trial without paying what can be large sums of money. The order says that the federal government will reconsider funding decisions, services or approvals if Washington does not comply.

One order also instructs the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to identify jurisdictions across the US that have cashless bail policies and revokes federal funds and grants that go to those jurisdictions, according to the White House.

“They kill people and they get out,” Trump said about cashless bail in the Oval Office when he announced the order. “We're ending it, but we're starting by ending it in DC, and that we have the right to do through federalization,” he added.

Data shows that crime does not increase by any significant margin in places that have implemented cashless bail programs, as Washington did in 1992, and people released from prison without posting bond are extremely unlikely to commit violent crime. Nevertheless, Trump has taken aim at the policy and claimed it has contributed to the city's violent crime rate, which last year hit a 30 year low.

Washington was one of the first jurisdictions to enact cashless bail, starting a trend of cities and states moving to a system that doesn't lock people up for their inability to pay. In 2023, Illinois became the first state to enact cashless bail.

“You don't even have to go to court sometimes,” Trump claimed falsely about Illinois in the White House Monday.

Trump has also falsely said that under cashless bail policies, “somebody murders somebody and they're out on no cash bail before the day is out.” In Washington and other places with cashless bail, a judge can make a determination to detail someone pre-trial if they feel that the accused is a danger to the community or a flight risk, as is often the case with those accused of murder.

Jeremy Cherson, the director of communications for the Bail Project said Trump's executive order would deepen inequities and waste taxpayer dollars. The Bail Project is a national organization that pushes for bail-related policy change and provides free bail assistance to low income people.

“The data is clear that bail reform has not led to increased crime,” he said. “While the president is right that the current system is broken, he is wrong about the solution.”

“What we're pursuing is a system where safety, not wealth, determines release pretrial, and if you look at a lot of the jurisdictions across the country that have minimized or eliminated the use of cash bail, that's what their systems do.”

The memo also mandates that insurers cover “faith-based counseling,” otherwise known as conversion therapy.

On Friday, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management issued a memo announcing that, beginning in 2026, all federal employee health plans will be barred from covering gender-affirming care — including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries — for both transgender youth and adults. The sweeping prohibition affects health benefits for more than 10 million federal workers and their family members, marking one of the largest rollbacks of transgender healthcare access in U.S. history. Even more disturbing, the memo mandates that insurers cover “faith-based counseling” for transgender individuals, otherwise known as conversion therapy. Taken together, the provisions appear designed not just to strip access to necessary medical care, but to coerce federal workers into detransitioning or leaving public service altogether.

“For Plan Year 2026, chemical and surgical modification of an individual's sex traits through medical interventions (to include “gender transition” services) will no longer be covered under the FEHB or PSHB Programs. This exclusion expands upon Carrier Letter 2025-01a and applies regardless of age. As an exception, counseling services for possible or diagnosed gender dysphoria must still be covered. Covered counseling services must be provided by a licensed mental health provider and may include those who provide faith-based counseling,” reads the memo.

The move appears to directly contradict longstanding interpretations of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits healthcare discrimination on the basis of sex. Under previous administrations, this provision has been used to mandate coverage of gender-affirming care for transgender people — both within the federal government and in several states with respect to Medicaid coverage. However, a recent Supreme Court decision, U.S. v. Skrmetti, opened the door to medical discrimination against transgender people by ruling that the denial of such care does not violate equal protection rights. The administration, likely emboldened by that ruling, appears to believe it can now strip gender-affirming care from employee health plans, including for adults, with impunity. If challenged, the administration may anticipate prevailing in a judicial system increasingly hostile to transgender people — setting the stage for yet another wave of legal battles that could shape access to care for years to come.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“This discriminatory policy denying medical care to government employees and their dependents is not only cruel — it is illegal,” said Lambda Legal Counsel and Health Care Strategist Omar Gonzalez-Pagan. “The federal government cannot simply strip away essential healthcare coverage from transgender employees while providing comprehensive medical care to all other federal workers. Beyond the fundamental equal protection guarantees enshrined in our Constitution, which prohibit such animus-laden actions, multiple federal laws also prohibit this type of discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination, including denying equal benefits to LGBTQ+ employees, as confirmed by the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act bars discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded health programs. The federal government cannot simply ignore and violate these laws.”

The inclusion of “faith-based counseling” signals a direct move toward legitimizing and even requiring conversion therapy for transgender people as the only option. Earlier this year, the administration released a rushed and ideologically driven report through the Department of Health and Human Services to justify sweeping bans on gender-affirming care nationwide. Commissioned under a Trump executive order that referred to transgender healthcare as “mutilation,” the report relied heavily on misinformation and junk science. Its conclusions were predetermined, serving not to assess evidence but to rationalize discrimination. Central to its recommendations was the endorsement of “psychotherapy” as the only treatment for being transgender, otherwise known as conversion therapy.

There is no evidence that “psychotherapy” or conversion therapy can treat gender dysphoria. On the contrary, the documented harms of conversion therapy are extensive: LGBTQ+ youth subjected to it are more than 2.5 times as likely to report multiple suicide attempts in the past year. Though many governments have banned conversion therapy for transgender people, some are reviving the practice. In Kentucky, Republicans passed a law overriding a conversion therapy ban this year. Meanwhile, Colorado's conversion therapy ban is set to be heard by the Supreme Court.

For transgender federal employees and their families, the memo signals a chilling and deeply uncertain future. While it allows for vague, undefined exceptions for some of those currently receiving care, it is unclear how many will actually receive those exceptions. Furthermore, it strips provider directories of all gender-affirming clinicians, creating new logistical and psychological barriers to treatment. The expansion of the administration's crackdown — now targeting not only youth but also adult transgender healthcare and mandating conversion therapy coverage — marks a dangerous escalation in its campaign to erase transgender people from public life. When combined with other restrictions for trans federal employees, it sends a clear message to those still in the closet seeking to come out: choose your livelihood, or choose your identity — but you can no longer have both.

Shares drop by 17% after stop-work order on $1.5bn project off Rhode Island, which was 80% complete

Shares in Ørsted hit an all-time low on Monday after the Trump administration ordered Europe's largest wind power company to stop work on a near complete windfarm.

Ørsted's shares plunged 17%, after it was forced to stop construction on its $1.5bn (£741m) Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island.

The order to down tools came despite the fact that the project is 80% complete, with 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

The US government issued its stop-work order late on Friday, citing a need to “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests”, although it did not provide any further detail.

Ørsted, which is 50.1% owned by the Danish state, has been hit hard by Donald Trump's hardline stance on offshore wind projects.

The company, which is behind some of the world's biggest offshore windfarms, typically covers its costs by selling a stake in each project once work is under way. However, the president's cynicism has hurt the values of its US projects.

The stop-work order comes at a critical time for the Danish business as it seeks to raise money for its new projects. Earlier this month, it said it would seek to shore up its finances by selling new shares worth 60bn Danish kroner (£7bn) to existing investors.

Prior to the fall on Monday, Ørsted shares had already dropped by more than 30% in the year to date.

Pierre-Alexandre Ramondenc, an analyst at the research company AlphaValue, said the US government intervention could jeopardise the success of Ørsted's fundraising plans.

“The news came as a major shock and amounts to nothing less than political hostage-taking by the US administration, given the project's advanced stage,” he said.

Trump has a long-held dislike of offshore windfarms, which dates back at least 14 years to a dispute over North Sea wind turbines that were visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland.

He has claimed that windfarms should not be allowed because they generate “the worst form of energy, the most expensive form of energy” and also “kill the birds”. These claims have been refuted by experts.

On his first day in office in January, Trump suspended new offshore wind power leases. He recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects.

Revolution Wind, which was expected to be fully operational next year, is expected to be capable of powering more than 350,000 homes.

In April, the US government also halted the construction of another wind project led by Norway's Equinor, although it lifted the stop-work order on the $5bn windfarm the following month.

In response to the stop-work order, Ørsted said it was “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously”, including through potential legal proceedings.

Two First Nations have formed a joint partnership with a transport company to purchase the Port of Stewart bulk terminal on the Portland Canal that separates British Columbia and Alaska.

The Nisga'a and Tahltan nations and Arrow Transportation Systems said in a statement that the deal to buy Stewart Bulk Terminals Ltd., which owns and operates the facility in Stewart, B.C., is expected to close in coming months.

Kerry Carlick, president of the Tahltan government, said the deal is “making history” and will drive economic growth and self-determination, while Eva Clayton, president of the Nisga'a Lisims government, said it's a chance for “economic reconciliation.”

The three equal partners said the deep-sea terminal's primary purpose is transporting critical minerals such as copper concentrate to market from sources including Newmont's Brucejack and Red Chris mines in Nisga'a and Tahltan territories.

The price of the terminal wasn't included in the statement, but it said the province provided a $5-million grant to the Tahltan and Nisga'a nations to support the purchase.

The statement quoted B.C. Premier David Eby saying the joint venture furthers reconciliation while creating jobs and “demonstrating how British Columbia will become Canada's new economic engine.”

The partnership between the Nisga'a Nation, Tahltan Nation Development Limited Partnership and Arrow Transportation creates a new entity called the Portland Canal Holdings Limited Partnership that is also launching a new transportation business by consolidating two regional trucking operations.

The joint statement says northwest B.C. is home to more than half of the province's exploration and mining sector. 

Arrow's executive vice-president, Tim Bell, said that consolidating the terminal and its trucking operations creates an integrated supply chain, and the project reflects a commitment “to working with Indigenous communities as equal stakeholders.”

The statement says the terminal has six full-time employees and handles about 260,000 tonnes of copper and gold concentrate annually, operating at 50 per cent of rated capacity.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on Aug. 25 condemned American director Woody Allen's participation in the Moscow International Film Week, calling it "a disgrace" amid Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine.

“Ukraine's Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the participation of American director Woody Allen in the Moscow International Film Week. This is a disgrace and an insult to the memory of the Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or injured by Russian war criminals during Russia's aggression against Ukraine,” the ministry said in a statement.

"By taking part in a festival that brings together (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's supporters and mouthpieces, Allen is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine every day for 11 years," it added.

Russian media reported that on Aug. 24, Allen appeared via videoconference at the festival, where he discussed the future of cinema in light of artificial intelligence and expressed admiration for Russian film.

The ministry emphasized that "culture should never be used to whitewash crimes or serve as a tool of propaganda."

Allen, 89, is best known for films such as Annie Hall and Manhattan and has been one of the most prominent figures in American independent cinema for decades. His participation in the Moscow festival comes as Russia continues its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, attacking Ukrainian cities and killing civilians.

"We also discussed our domestic drone production and joint opportunities with partners. Investments now can help not only physically but also force Russia to end this war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"By taking part in a festival that brings together (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's supporters and mouthpieces, Allen is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine every day for 11 years," Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said. 





The move underscores Norway's growing role in supporting Ukraine's defense as Western partners move closer to finalizing security guarantees amid a push to organize a high-level meeting between Kyiv and Moscow.

"We would like to understand from the American side whether the Russians are ready — and in what format — for a bilateral, and eventually trilateral, meeting," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

A source close to Zaluzhnyi told the Guardian that his refusal was a "principled position" and a sign of unity, reflecting Ukraine's feeling of having been "humiliated."

But another recent announcement may make the "Long Neptune" slightly redundant.

The video showing Russia's fuel crisis, water shortages in occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian strikes on oil refineries and Russia's military losses, was aired simultaneously on 116 television channels on Ukraine's Independence Day, according to the source.

Ukrainian forces downed 76 out of the 104 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

The aircraft, operated by Egyptian carrier AlMasria Universal Airlines, had departed from Sharm El Sheikh and landed in Tallinn at 5:33 a.m. local time. It was able to continue its journey to St. Petersburg nearly six hours later.

The number includes 870 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

In an interview with ABC News on Aug. 24, former CIA Director and retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus cast doubt on both the likelihood of a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and on Putin's willingness to negotiate in good faith.

MOSCOW, August 25. /TASS/. Poland will treat Ukrainians who commit crimes in the country the same way it does with other nationalities that disrupt public order – by deporting them, Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski said.

"If anyone violates our laws, they must accept that they will no longer be able to stay here, regardless of their nationality," Kierwinski stated at a ministry meeting broadcast on the Interior Ministry's social media accounts. He stressed that Ukrainians, despite their special status as "war refugees," will not be given any special treatment.

At the same meeting, Border Guard chief Robert Bagan reported that 57 Ukrainians and six Belarusians were subject to deportation following riots at a concert by singer Max Korzh in Warsaw. Of these, 13 people have already been forcibly removed from Poland, while ten left voluntarily. In total, 30 individuals were banned from entering the Schengen area.

The unrest took place on August 9 during Korzh's concert at Warsaw's National Stadium, attended by 60,000 people. Disorder began when some audience members attempted to break through barriers separating the stands from the stage area, leading to scuffles with security guards. Videos and photos later circulated on social media showing a group of young people waving the red-and-black flag of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and its military wing - the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, both banned in Russia.

Polish media widely covered the incident, and opposition as well as far-right politicians strongly condemned it, demanding criminal liability for those involved or their conscription into Ukraine's armed forces. Following the concert, more than 100 people were detained, and deportation proceedings were initiated against 63 Ukrainian and Belarusian citizens.

When Canadian underwear and apparel brand Knix Wear Inc. opened the doors of its first store in New York this month, the company was looking for a bit of a do-over.

It was not the first time the retailer - which designs and manufactures intimates, including its signature leak-proof underwear, as well as swimwear and clothing - had attempted to establish a brick-and-mortar presence south of the border. 

In 2021, Knix opened three stores in California, taking advantage of leases that became available during the pandemic. It eventually exited those locations, which underperformed for various reasons. 

“I would say in hindsight, we bit off more than we could chew, to be honest,” said founder and president Joanna Griffiths. But she also knew that Knix's next phase of growth would require establishing a greater foothold in the world's largest consumer market.

Toronto-based Knix, which has grown from a small e-commerce startup to a retailer valued at roughly half a billion dollars in 2022, has already built an online following among American shoppers, who account for a large portion of its sales. 

But as Knix has expanded in its home market as well, it has seen why physical stores matter. This year, its growth in Canada came mostly from offline channels - both its own stores, and wholesale partners. (Knix is sold at stores such as Holt Renfrew and Sporting Life, and it also has a partnership with Costco.)

In just the last four years, the company went from operating three Canadian stores to 13. Knix will have 20 locations in Canada by the end of this year, with another 8 to 10 openings planned for next year. 

“We have a recipe that's working for us in Canada, that's a combination of retail stores, online, and select wholesale partners,” Ms. Griffiths said. “And we're looking to take that to the United States.”

Swedish hygiene products giant Essity bought a majority stake in Knix in 2022. The year before that deal, Knix's sales reached $133.6-million a year; it has now surpassed $200-million in annual sales in the U.S. and Canada. 

Knix has learned from its last go-round in the States, becoming “much more selective” about locations, Ms. Griffiths said. While operating its new store in Manhattan's Soho neighbourhood, which is on a shorter-term lease, the company is searching for the “perfect spot” in the area to build long-term.

New York has the highest concentration of online customers for Knix; it plans to open two more locations, likely in Manhattan and Brooklyn, before launching more stores farther afield. The brand launched a campaign featuring actress Kristen Bell this month, coinciding with the first store opening.

But Knix is making the move at a tense time for retailers operating in the U.S. The Trump administration's widespread tariffs on imported goods have upended how many companies do business and led to major spikes in cost to bring products into the market.

Knix had to hike its prices for U.S. customers by 7 per cent in response. (Pricing has not risen in Canada.) But like other retailers, it has had to absorb some of the cost increases. 

At the peak of trade tensions between the U.S. and China in the spring, Knix was paying 177-per-cent duties on goods it manufactured in China and sold to American shoppers. Before the U.S. cancelled the “de minimis” exemption – a rule that waived duties on shipments valued under US$800 – Knix paid nothing to ship online orders to the U.S., since they generally fell below that threshold.

As Canada lifts countertariffs on American goods, what does it mean for consumers?

How will Canadian consumers be affected by Trump's de minimis changes?

Two things brought those costs down more recently: The U.S. lowered the tariffs on Chinese imports amid continuing negotiations, and Knix opened its first fulfilment centre south of the border, in Cincinnati, Ohio, in mid-July. That means Knix is now shipping roughly 40 per cent of its products directly to the U.S., instead of paying additional duties on transfer pricing for items that land in Canada first before crossing the border.

“That's a big unlock for us,” Ms. Griffiths said.

Coming out of the height of the pandemic, Knix also had to rethink how centralized its manufacturing was in China. Learning from the supply-chain headaches of COVID-19, the company decided to add new vendors in Sri Lanka, and to work with its main manufacturing partner to launch a Vietnam facility - plans it accelerated as the threats of U.S. tariffs began to ramp up. At the beginning of this year, 90 per cent of Knix's products were made in China; by the end of the year, it will be roughly 30 to 35 per cent.

Diversifying has helped mitigate the tariff impact, although countries remain in active negotiations, and much is still uncertain. At the moment, Knix pays roughly 55-per-cent duties on its Chinese-made apparel imports to the U.S., while for the other countries where it manufactures, the current average duty rate is in the mid-30s percentage range. 

How Knix underwear founder Joanna Griffiths knew it was time to sell

The company is continuing to monitor the situation, Ms. Griffiths said, and is working to keep its products affordable.

“If I have it my way, we won't touch prices again,” she said. “We've done just about everything we can as a brand to avoid that.”

Ms. Griffiths admits it is daunting to expand in the States − where in addition to opening stores, Knix is working on wholesale partnerships to build its presence. Not only is the expansion happening at a turbulent time, but building stores is capital-intensive, and the market is large and complex, with significant geographic differences, she said.

“We've been working at building the brand in the United States for the past 10 years, and we've been spending a lot on advertising and working with different partners. So, it didn't make sense for us to walk away from it,” Ms. Griffiths said. “If anything, we see this as, potentially, an opportunity to double down.”

The full transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with Donald Trump's deputy attorney have been published.

Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein, was interviewed by Todd Blanche in July.

Releasing the full transcripts to the public appears to be an attempt to put an end to weeks' worth of damaging stories which have dogged Donald Trump's administration.

The US president has faced fierce criticism from his base for refusing to publish documents held by the government on Epstein, the paedophile financier who died in 2019.

On Friday, the Department of Justice released hundreds of pages of transcripts and audio recordings of the interview in what Blanche called “the interest of transparency”.

“Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden,” Mr Blanche said.

Below, The Telegraph takes a closer look at the eight key takeaways from the transcripts.

Mr Trump has faced immense political pressure over his former friendship with Epstein, whom he fell out with over a property deal in Palm Beach.

Critics and supporters of the US president alike have called for him to release the so-called “Epstein files” — all of the files the government holds on the late paedophile.

Asked about her knowledge of Mr Trump and Epstein's relationship, Maxwell said she has no incriminating evidence against Donald Trump.

She said: “I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way.

“The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

In the recordings, Maxwell contradicted Prince Andrew's claim that she introduced him to the paedophile Epstein.

“First of all, let's just state, I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew. I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson. That is a flat untruth. I'll start with that.”

The Duke was accused of sexually abusing one of Epstein's first accusers, Virginia Giuffre, on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17. She had sued him for unspecified damages.

The case was settled by the Prince, who has always denied any wrongdoing. Giuffre died this year by suicide.

During a Newsnight interview to address the accusations in 2019, Prince Andrew said the British socialite was the one who acquainted him with Epstein.

Maxwell claimed the Duchess of York, who she described as her “frenemy”, pursued Epstein.

She said: “I thought that Sarah was trying to put the moves on Jeffrey, if I'm being honest, and I thought the whole thing was annoying and I was pissed off.”

She said she believed the duchess “liked Mr Epstein.”

When asked why she thought so, Maxwell responded: “My female intuition.”

Maxwell told Todd Blanche her ex-boyfriend did not ever love her and that she wasn't his “type”.

“There was some indications that [Epstein] would actively tell other people to lie to me or conceal things from me, and that he never loved me and I wasn't his type,” Maxwell said.

The pair had a romantic relationship but after breaking up continued to work together until his arrest in 2019.

The nature of the couple's relationship was brought under the spotlight during Maxwell's trial.

Intimate pictures of the pair together, including the now-infamous photos of Maxwell giving Epstein a foot massage, were presented by attorneys for the US government.

Several witnesses testified that they thought the pair were a couple, while others believed they had just a business relationship.

Maxwell stated that she does not believe Epstein died by suicide in prison in 2019.

The nature of Epstein's death is a contentious point for many Trump supporters, who believe he was murdered in order to suppress in order to cover up a so-called “client list” of high-profile figures.

“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” she said.

She said she did not know who was behind his death but that it was not a difficult thing to arrange.

“In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That's about the going rate for a hit with a lock today.”

Maxwell also denied that Epstein maintained a “client list” or “black book”.

“There is no list,” she told Todd Blanche during the first day of their interviews.

The FBI and justice department last month released a memo drawing the same conclusion last month.

Maxwell did not recall Donald Trump allegedly sending a lewd letter featuring a drawing of a nude woman for Epstein's 50th birthday.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Mr Trump had submitted a note for an album Maxwell was assembling for her then-boyfriend's birthday, in which he told Epstein they had “certain things in common”.

The note allegedly concluded: “May every day be another wonderful secret”.

“I do not remember,” Maxwell answered, when asked whether Mr Trump had sent a message for Epstein's 50th birthday. She added that she had not found a birthday letter from the president among her possessions in New York.

However, she confirmed she had put together a book of birthday messages for Epstein, and that the financier had told her: “I love that idea.”

Mr Trump has fiercely denied writing or sending the letter and has launched legal proceedings against the newspaper and its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch.

In addition to Mr Trump and Prince Andrew, a number of high-profile individuals came up during Maxwell's interview but she did not incriminate any of them.

Israel struck Nasser hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday, killing at least 20 people, including five journalists who worked for Reuters, the Associated Press, Al Jazeera and others.

Cameraman Hussam al-Masri, a Reuters contractor, was killed near a live broadcasting position operated by Reuters on an upper floor just below the roof of the hospital in Khan Younis in an initial strike, according to Palestinian health officials.

Officials at the hospital and witnesses said Israel then struck the site a second time, killing other journalists, as well as rescue workers and medics, who had rushed to the scene to help.

The journalists killed included Mariam Abu Dagga, who freelanced for the Associated Press and other outlets, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera, Moaz Abu Taha, a freelance journalist who worked with several news organisations including occasionally contributing to Reuters, and Ahmed Abu Aziz.

Photographer Hatem Khaled, also a Reuters contractor, was wounded.

Israeli strikes on Nasser Hospital in Gaza on Monday killed at least 15 people, including four journalists, one of whom worked for Reuters, Palestinian health officials said.

Israel's military, the Israel Defense Forces, acknowledged striking the area of Nasser hospital and said the chief of the general staff had ordered an inquiry.

The IDF “regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such. The IDF acts to mitigate harm to uninvolved individuals as much as possible while maintaining the safety of IDF troops,” it said.

A Reuters spokesperson said in a statement: “We are devastated to learn that cameraman Hussam al-Masri, a contractor for Reuters, was killed this morning in Israeli strikes on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in Gaza. Moaz Abu Taha, a freelance journalist whose work had been occasionally published by Reuters, was also killed, and photographer Hatem Khaled, a Reuters contractor, was wounded.”

“We are urgently seeking more information and have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical assistance for Hatem,” the spokesperson added.

The AP said it was “shocked and saddened” to learn of the deaths of Abu Dagga and other journalists, adding that Abu Dagga had often based herself at the hospital for coverage, which recently included stories on starving and malnourished children.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he wasn't aware of the Israeli strike, but that he was not happy about it.

“I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that ... nightmare,” Trump told reporters at the White House. 

The first Israeli strike at around 10:10 a.m. hit the hospital's fourth floor, where surgical operating rooms and doctor's residences are located, killing at least two people, said Zaher al-Waheidi, head of Gaza's Health Ministry's records department.

The second strike on the stairwell killed 17 others, including medical teams, rescuers, journalists and others rushing upstairs, al-Waheidi told the Associated Press.

A British doctor working on the floor that was hit said the second strike came before people could start evacuating from the first.

“Just absolute scenes of chaos, disbelief, and fear,” the doctor said. They described people wounded from the strikes entering the ward and leaving trails of blood. The hospital was already overwhelmed, with patients with IV drips lying on the floor in the corridors in stifling heat.

The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations from their organization to avoid reprisals from Israeli authorities. “It leaves me in another state of shock that hospitals can be a target,” the doctor said. “You go to work as a health care professional and you should be protected in the place you work. But you are not.”

What we know so far as Israel prepares its Gaza City offensive

In Gaza, the only choices are stay under bombardment or flee to overcrowded shelters

Nasser Hospital has withstood raids and bombardment during the war, with officials repeatedly noting critical shortages of supplies and staff. A June strike on the hospital killed three people, according to the Health Ministry. A March strike on its surgical unit days after Israel ended a ceasefire killed two people.

More than 240 Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israeli fire in Gaza since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate.

The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate condemned Israel for the strikes, saying it represented “an open war against free media, with the aim of terrorising journalists and preventing them from fulfilling their professional duty of exposing its crimes to the world.”

Two weeks ago, Israel killed prominent Al Jazeera correspondent Anas Al-Sharif and four other journalists in a strike. In that attack, Israel acknowledged targeting Sharif and said that he worked for the Hamas militant group, which the broadcaster denied.

Masri operated a Reuters live video feed from the hospital, which suddenly shut down at the moment of the initial strike on Monday.

Reuters and other news providers often deliver live video feeds to media outlets worldwide during major news events to show the scene from the ground in real time. Reuters had frequently broadcast a feed from Nasser hospital during the Gaza conflict, and for the past several weeks had been delivering daily feeds from the Nasser hospital position that was hit.

Israel has barred all foreign journalists from entering the Gaza Strip since the start of the war in 2023. Reporting from the territory throughout the war has been produced by Palestinian journalists, many of whom have worked for many years for international media organizations, including wire services such as Reuters and the Associated Press.

Israel has also separately said it is investigating the death of Issam Abdallah, a Reuters journalist killed in southern Lebanon by Israeli tank fire in October, 2023, after the Gaza conflict erupted. Israel has not announced any findings.

BERLIN, August 25. /TASS/. Since February 2022, Germany has provided a total of €50.5 billion to support Ukraine, the DPA news agency reported, citing data from the German Ministry of Finance released during the ministry's chief Lars Klingbeil's visit to Kiev.

Of this sum, about €25 billion was spent on receiving and housing Ukrainian refugees, €17 billion on weapons supplies and troop training, €6.7 billion on civilian aid, and €1.9 billion on direct budgetary support.

According to financial planning, Germany intends to continue providing Kiev with more than €8 billion annually in bilateral military aid until 2027.

On Monday, Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil arrived in Kiev on an unannounced visit, where he is scheduled to meet with government officials, members of the Verkhovna Rada, and representatives of civil society.

WASHINGTON—U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed South Korea's newly elected president, Lee Jae Myung, to the White House on Aug. 25 to discuss trade, investment, and defense collaboration. Ahead of the meeting, Trump commented on Seoul's push to renegotiate a recently finalized trade deal.

“I hear they want to renegotiate the deal, but that's OK. I don't mind that,” Trump said in the Oval Office, sitting alongside Lee. “That doesn't mean they're going to get anything, but I don't mind.”

In late April 2024, Nikolai Patrushev, the longtime head of Russia's Security Council, chaired a meeting in St. Petersburg of top security officials from countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The meeting was about information sovereignty and security—the Kremlin's way of describing cybertechnologies that are designed to protect against Western surveillance, influence, and interference. But Patrushev also had a more specific message. Flanked by Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the Kremlin's SVR Foreign Intelligence Service, Patrushev informed the audience that Russia's top cybersecurity companies could help their governments gain control of their national information space.

At the time, the event was little noted in the United States or Europe. Just days earlier, the U.S. Congress had approved a long-delayed $60 billion aid package to Ukraine, and Europe was preparing its 14th round of sanctions against Russia. Yet governments in many other parts of the world were paying attention. Although the full list was not released, participants in the meeting included national security advisers, the heads of national security councils, and the heads of security and intelligence agencies from a wide variety of countries including Brazil, Sudan, Thailand, and Uganda; close Russian allies such as China and Iran; as well as the Arab League.

For many of these security officials, Patrushev's pitch was welcome: Russia has long excelled at cybertechnologies, and they understood that its resources could be valuable to securing their national digital infrastructures. Some of them had witnessed the “Twitter revolutions” of the last two decades and tended to share Russian President Vladimir Putin's view that such events—enabled by American-owned social media—reflected a U.S. tactic of fomenting mass protests that were often destabilizing. Moreover, many of their governments have maintained business relations with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine and are not particularly concerned about Russian influence in their countries.

As did its Soviet counterpart during the Cold War, Putin's Kremlin views Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia and Latin America as primary battlefields of the global contest with the West. This campaign includes the expansion of Kremlin-affiliated military groups, such as the Wagner paramilitary company, in numerous African countries. It involves an expanded use of soft power, such as the opening of new “Russia Houses” in more than a dozen countries in Africa. These are cultural centers run by the foreign ministry that serve to promote the Kremlin's narratives, including about its war in Ukraine; to work with Russian émigré communities in target countries; and to provide cover for Russian intelligence operatives—a time-honored practice for Russian cultural centers since the Cold War. The campaign also includes a push to expand Russian intelligence capabilities in regions caught between superpowers.

As the St. Petersburg meeting attests, the Kremlin sees Russia's commercial cybertechnologies as an important part of this broader campaign and another way to further its interests around the world. According to past findings by European governments and the United States, several top Russian cybersecurity firms have links to the Kremlin's military and security services. In April 2021, for example, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on the Russian cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies for supporting “Russian government clients, including the FSB,” the Federal Security Service, and alleged that the company “hosts large-scale conventions that are used as recruiting events for the FSB and GRU,” Russia's military intelligence unit.

And in June 2024, the United States put sanctions on Kaspersky Lab, another top Russian firm, for “cooperation with Russian military and intelligence authorities” that Treasury officials said is “contrary to U.S. national security.” Since 2022, the EU and some European countries have also taken steps to limit Russian cyber-companies' access to their markets. Positive Technologies is under EU sanctions; in the case of Kasperky Labs, several countries, including Germany, Italy, and Poland, have sought to ban or discourage the use of the company's software. Both firms have dismissed the findings. In a public statement, Positive Technologies called the Treasury's conclusions “groundless.” A Kaspersky spokesperson told Reuters that the U.S. decision was “unjustified and baseless.”

Despite this pressure from the West, Moscow is seeking to build on the 2024 security meeting and aggressively expand its cyber-influence around the world. With a series of new partnerships between Russian cyber-firms and foreign entities and governments, Russia has gained a growing technological foothold in Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Although it remains unclear how Russia's security services may be exploiting these deals, cybersecurity analysts say that such arrangements could give Moscow new ways to preempt Western intelligence activities.

In recent months, as the Trump administration has softened its stance on Russia and pulled back U.S. foreign and intelligence assets aimed at foreign cybersecurity threats, Moscow has pursued this expansion with relatively little scrutiny. Left unchecked, these new relationships could put Washington and its allies at a significant disadvantage in the developing world, even as they potentially give Russia more ways to conduct cyberwarfare against the United States and Europe.

Russian cyber-companies emerged as global players a few years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. A strong technical education system across the country combined with the collapse of the military-industrial complex pushed hordes of talented engineers into the nascent cybersecurity market. They brought with them both expertise and determination. Some of them built successful international companies such as Kaspersky Lab, founded in 1997, which developed an array of highly advanced Internet security and cybersecurity tools and became known for exposing cybersecurity threats. In 2010, a team of Kaspersky researchers uncovered the Stuxnet virus, a highly sophisticated malware weapon that was used against Iran's nuclear program and was jointly designed by Israel and the United States.

For nearly two decades, Russian cyber-companies were focused on building large markets for their products in Western countries, targeting both corporations and foreign government agencies. Some cyber-firms, such as Kaspersky Lab, which was incorporated in the United Kingdom, also established subsidiaries in the West. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, however, growing Western pressure on Moscow and concerns about cyberwarfare by Russian intelligence made it much harder for these companies to do business in the United States and Europe.

In March 2017, U.S. intelligence officials—including the heads of the FBI and the CIA—said they didn't feel comfortable having Kasper­sky's powerful antivirus software on their computers. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all government agencies to remove Kaspersky software from their systems, citing unspecified “information security risks” presented by Kaspersky-branded products and noting that the company's antivirus and other software “provide broad access to files” that could be exploited by malicious actors.

In October 2017, investigations by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Russian hackers had stolen classified documents related to U.S. cyberdefenses from the National Security Agency, in part by using Kaspersky software on an NSA contractor's computer. Kaspersky strongly denied any knowledge of or involvement in the use of its software to enable hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company told The New York Times.



In the years that followed, Russia's cyber-companies began to focus more on markets outside the United States and Europe. The Russian government was keen to help. The turning point came with the April 2024 security meeting in St. Petersburg, where the Kremlin made a direct bid to offer Russian cybersecurity infrastructure—and specifically the services of seven top Russian cyber-companies—to dozens of security agencies around the world. The firms mentioned by Patrushev included Positive Technologies and its spinoff Cyberus Foundation, Kaspersky Lab, Angara Security, Kod Bezopasnosti, Security Vision, and Solar. By and large, these companies provide products that protect digital infrastructure against cyberattacks—whether from vigilante hackers or hostile foreign governments. Their products generally require deep access to the files and the systems they are protecting.

There are several strategic reasons behind the Kremlin's push. In many cases, when a foreign government acquires cutting-edge surveillance and cybertechnologies from Russia, their local security and law enforcement agencies lack the expertise to operate them. As a result, they rely on the Russian suppliers not just for technical guidance but also for help integrating the technology into their domestic legal frameworks. That kind of relationship offers the Russian cyber-companies a rare level of access to systems and to local contacts within the client country.

Moreover, many of Russia's leading cyber-companies were created by engineers and computer scientists from Russian elite technical universities, which were originally established to supply engineers for the Soviet military and intelligence agency, the KGB. Going back to the Soviet era, these schools have produced generations of engineers who are trained to work in secrecy. Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, studied at the KGB Higher School.

According to Western security officials, Putin has sought to rebuild this tight relationship between the intelligence services and the country's top technology developers. In its sanctions against Kaspersky Lab, the U.S. Treasury did not include personal sanctions against Kaspersky himself. But it did sanction 12 other Russian nationals who are senior executives at the company. Kaspersky Lab denied that the executives have any links to Russia's security services. “It would be weird (and flat-out wrong) to assume these executives were introduced into the company's top management to give Russian spies leverage in Kaspersky Lab's actions,” the company said in a 2018 statement.

The Russian government has also applied more overt pressure on its cybersecurity companies. In 2016, for example, several top Russian cyber officials—including a top manager at Kaspersky Lab—were thrown into Moscow's Lefortovo prison by the FSB on charges of high treason. Kaspersky told the BBC that Kaspersky Lab had not been informed of the investigation and that the arrest of its employee had nothing to do with the employee's work for the company. To cybersecurity experts, the Kremlin appeared to be sending a message to its commercial firms: loyalty to the government was no longer optional.

Under the Biden administration, the United States became increasingly concerned about the links it found between Russia's top cyber-companies and the Russian government. The U.S. Treasury put Positive Technologies and Kaspersky Lab on the U.S. sanctions list, and after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, other Western countries followed suit. In 2023, Positive Technologies was sanctioned by the European Union. Meanwhile, the use of Kaspersky's software on government devices was banned or restricted in Canada and the United Kingdom; Germany and Italy issued warnings against using Kaspersky's software in both the public and the private sectors. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Italy's national cybersecurity agency also banned the use on government devices of various Russian-designed cybersecurity applications—including those of Kaspersky, Positive Technologies, and also Group-IB, another leading Russian company—citing national security concerns.

As in the case of the U.S. measures, the companies denied the findings. In a statement, Positive Technologies described the EU decision as “based on the fact that the company has a license from the Russian Federal Security Service.” The company also said that its business interests are “not related to EU countries and focus on regions ready to work with entities from the Russian Federation, in particular in markets of Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa and Southeast Asia, as well as India, South Africa, China and others.” Following the moves by Italy, Group-IB decided to completely sever its international business from its Russian-based business.

Since the April 2024 meeting in St. Petersburg, Positive Technologies has continued to expand its international reach. In December, the company signed a distribution agreement with Mideast Communication Systems in Cairo, gaining a strategic launch pad for its services in Africa and the Middle East—particularly in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Positive Technologies has been particularly attractive to Riyadh because the company provides protection against so-called advanced persistent threat attacks—cyberattacks in which a malicious actor may remain hidden within a system for a long time to accomplish strategic objectives—which have been particularly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. In 2024, the company found that of the groups it could identify that had launched such attacks, 88 percent had targeted telecommunications and military industries in Saudi Arabia.

In June 2025, Cyberus Foundation, which describes itself as a “tool for consolidating business, the cyber defense industry, and the state to achieve common goals,” signed a strategic agreement with Al-Adid Business, owned by Sheikh Suhaim bin Ahmed bin Sultan bin Jassim Al Thani, a member of the ruling family of Qatar. The deal is designed to develop Qatar's cybersecurity capabilities, including by establishing Cyberdom Qatar and Hackademy, institutions for training cyber experts in the country. There is no direct indication that Russian intelligence was involved in these deals. But they indisputably give Russian companies far-reaching access to these countries' digital infrastructures.

In April 2025, Cyberus also signed a partnership agreement with the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Kremlin-led military alliance of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. The goal of the agreement, according to CSTO Secretary-General Imangali Tasmagambetov, is “to strengthen coordination between the CSTO member states in countering cyber threats and to increase the level of cyber resilience in the region.”



Russia's cyber-expansion has been particularly active in Africa. Kaspersky Lab, for example, has signed an agreement with Smart Africa, a partnership among 40 African countries aimed at developing information and communications technologies. Kaspersky is also involved in the African Network of Cybersecurity Authorities, an initiative established in February 2025 to “tackle cross-border cybersecurity challenges across the Continent.” In making such arrangements, Kaspersky Lab has positioned itself to be the leading shaper of the emerging cyber-industry across Africa.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin has continued to promote the companies on Patrushev's list. For instance, in June, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum—the annual conference sponsored by Putin that has long served as a showcase for Russia's economic and geopolitical power—featured Yury Maksimov, the co-founder of Positive Technologies and Cyberus, as one of its key speakers. Maksimov discussed the need for the countries that “don't have complete technological independence”—meaning countries that are unable to create national online services that are capable of competing with Western platforms—to understand how to maintain digital sovereignty. In the Kremlin's view, much of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East fits into this category.

At the St. Petersburg forum, Cyberus's pitch to those countries was echoed and reinforced by Andrey Bezrukov, the president of the Russian Association for the Export of Technological Sovereignty. Bezrukov is better known in the United States as Donald Heathfield, the identity he used while serving in what the U.S. Department of Justice called the “Illegals Program”: a network of Russian sleeper operatives who attempted to infiltrate U.S. institutions by posing as ordinary Americans. U.S. authorities turned over Bezrukov and nine other operatives to Russia in a prisoner swap in 2010. After the swap, the Kremlin helped Bezrukov reinvent himself as a foreign policy expert specializing in the United States, and he became a constant presence on Russian TV shows.

Bezrukov's current occupation—leading the “export of technological sovereignty”—reflects what the Kremlin, Russian intelligence agencies, and Russian cyber-companies aim to achieve: to provide target countries with cyber-services that would shield their information spaces from the perceived threat of Western influence, including in cybersecurity and social media control. Given that neither Bezrukov nor Naryshkin have hidden their affiliations with the SVR, it appears that Russia's spy agencies think their colleagues in the client countries are little concerned about the possibility of Russian intelligence penetration in their digital infrastructure as long as they can obtain cyberprotection from the West.

The stakes in this quiet yet intense new cyberbattle are high. It is not only about which companies gain access to the national digital infrastructure of dozens of countries outside the West but also about the training of those responsible for protecting that infrastructure. For the Russian government, the influence of Russian firms around the world is clearly a strategic priority. For one thing, the experts who train the next generation of cyber-specialists around the world will play a crucial role in helping those specialists identify what constitutes perceived threats. The differences in the perception of such threats have been political since the early years of this century, when first Russia and then China began promoting a very broad definition of threats to national information security—one that in the Kremlin's version includes, for instance, the activities of foreign media. As the earlier NSA leak shows, Russian technology could also potentially provide a backdoor to Russian intelligence.

Paradoxically, the moves by the United States and its European allies to sanction Russian cybersecurity companies and limit or bar their use in the West may only have accelerated the spread of Russian cybertechnology to other parts of the world. Russian intelligence has a long reach, and the country's leading cyber-companies have been made well aware of it. But the United States and its allies seem far less so, and that neglect could in the long run provide a significant advantage to Putin's Russia as it gains growing influence over the cyber-infrastructure of countries around the world.

Reuters

12:33 JST, August 25, 2025

TAIPEI, Aug 24 (Reuters) – Veteran Pan Cheng-fa says he clearly remembers fighting for China against the Japanese in World War Two, but gets agitated when asked about the role of communist forces who at the time were in an uneasy alliance with his republican government.

“We gave them weapons, equipment – we strengthened them,” Pan, 99, said at an event in Taiwan's capital Taipei to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.

As China gears up for a mass military parade in Beijing next month to mark the war's end, both Taiwan – whose formal name remains Republic of China – and the People's Republic of China are locked in an increasingly bitter war of words about historical narrative and who should really be claiming credit for the victory.

Fighting in China began in earnest in 1937 with the full-scale Japanese invasion and continued until the surrender of Japan in 1945, when the island of Taiwan was handed over to the Republic of China after decades of Japanese rule.

“After Japan was taken down, (the communists') next target was the Republic of China,” Pan added, referring to the resumption of the civil war which led to the victory of Mao Zedong's forces and flight of the republican government to Taiwan in 1949.

The ruling Chinese Communist Party often reminds people of its struggle against the Japanese, but a lot of the fighting was done by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek's republican government, and it was the Republic of China who signed the peace agreement as one of the allied nations.

“During the Republic of China's war of resistance against Japan, the People's Republic of China did not even exist, but the Chinese communist regime has in recent years repeatedly distorted the facts, claiming it was the Communist Party who led the war of resistance,” Taiwan's top China-policy maker Chiu Chui-cheng said on August 15, the Japanese surrender anniversary.

The Mainland Affairs Council, which Chiu heads, said this month that the communists' strategy at the time was “70% about strengthening themselves, 20% dealing with republican government and 10% about opposing Japan”, repeating an old wartime accusation against Mao the Chinese Communist Party has denied.

Taiwan's own anniversary events are much more low key, and don't mention the role of the communists apart from to lambaste them.

A defence ministry concert on Thursday night in Taipei featured performers dressed as World War Two-era republican soldiers, images of the Flying Tigers – volunteer U.S. pilots who flew for the republican Chinese air force – and rap by Taiwanese hip-hop group Nine One One.

“History affirms that the War of Resistance was led and won by the Republic of China,” the ministry said a performance programme.

China has hit back at what it sees as misrepresentation of the Chinese Communist Party's role.

On Tuesday, the party's official People's Daily wrote in an online commentary that vigilance was needed against efforts to “distort and falsify the Chinese Communist Party's role as the country's backbone” in fighting Japan.

China says the victory belongs to all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, and is also celebrating the fact the war's end in 1945 led to Taiwan – a Japanese colony from 1895 – being “returned” to Chinese rule as part of the peace agreement.

Taiwan says nothing in any agreements talked about handing over Taiwan to the Chinese Communist Party-run People's Republic of China which was only founded in late 1949.

Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te marked the surrender anniversary of August 15 with a Facebook post saying aggression will be defeated, in a pointed reference to Beijing's military threats against the island.

The People's Republic of China says it is the successor state to the Republic of China and that Taiwan is an inherent part of Beijing's territory, a view Taipei's government vehemently opposes.

Taiwan's government has urged its people not to attend China's military parade, warning against reinforcing Beijing's territorial claims and backing its version of what the anniversary means.

Veteran Pan, who says family members left behind after the civil war were brutalised while he escaped to Taiwan, sees Beijing's parade as having nothing to do with him.

“I can't say anything good about the communists,” he said.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people for burning the American flag, an activity that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled is legitimate political expression protected by the U.S. Constitution.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order requiring the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people for burning the American flag, an activity that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled is legitimate political expression protected by the U.S. Constitution. 

The order the Republican president signed in the Oval Office acknowledged the court's 5-4 ruling in a case from Texas in 1989, but said there is still room to prosecute flag burning if it “is likely to incite imminent lawless action” or amounts to “fighting words.”

“You burn a flag, you get one year in jail. You don't get 10 years, you don't get one month,” Trump said. “You get one year in jail, and it goes on your record, and you will see flag burning stopping immediately.”

The order also called for Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue litigation to challenge the 1989 ruling, an attempt by Trump to get the issue back in front of the Supreme Court. Today's Supreme Court is much more conservative than the makeup of the court in 1989 and includes three judges Trump appointed in his first term.

Civil liberties advocates and constitutional scholars questioned both the legality and the merit of Trump's action. A lawyer working for a free speech group said Trump does not have the power to rewrite the First Amendment.

“While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity — even if many Americans, including the president, find it ‘uniquely offensive and provocative,'” added Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.




In the 1989 case, the justices ruled 5-4 that the First Amendment protects flag burning as legitimate political expression. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative icon whom Trump has repeatedly praised, was in the majority.

On Monday, Trump described the 1989 court behind the ruling as a “very sad court.”

Trump said burning the U.S. flag “incites riots at levels we've never seen before,” with some people “going crazy” over the act of setting it afire and others expressing anger at people for burning it. He did not offer examples.

A White House fact sheet referenced recent protests, including in Los Angeles in June, where the flag was burned “alongside violent acts and other conduct threatening public safety.” 

“All over the country they're burning flags. All over the world, they burn the American flag,” Trump said, as Vice President JD Vance, Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other administration officials stood behind him as he sat at his desk. 

G.S. Hans, a law professor at Cornell University who focuses on the First Amendment, said the country has not suffered from an “endemic of flag burning.”

“I don't think this is something that has been a big problem,” Hans said in an interview. “It's a solution in search of a problem.”

The executive order states that desecrating the American flag is “uniquely offensive and provocative. It is a statement of contempt, hostility, and violence against our Nation — the clearest possible expression of opposition to the political union that preserves our rights, liberty, and security. Burning this representation of America may incite violence and riot.”

The order calls on the attorney general to prioritize enforcement “to the fullest extent possible” of criminal and civil laws against flag burning that cause harm unrelated to the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. 

“Thank you for protecting the American flag, and we'll do that without running afoul of the First Amendment as well,” Bondi told the president.

Foreign nationals could face having their visas, residency permits, naturalization proceedings and other immigration benefits revoked, according to the order. They could also be deported. 

Flag-burning has been on Trump's mind for years. 

After he was elected president in November 2016, Trump said “there must be consequences” for anyone who burns an American flag, such as jail or loss of citizenship. 

“Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag — if they do, there must be consequences — perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!” Trump wrote on what then was Twitter. 

The Constitution forbids the government from stripping citizenship from natural-born Americans.

A college student's parents died and his siblings injured in a highway crash in North Carolina during a trip to drop him off at school.

Noah Nunney, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was waiting on campus to reunite with his family when he received word of a serious car accident nearby. 

"When I arrived to the scene, I thought all four were gone," Nunney told PEOPLE. "They wouldn't let me out of the car, and the way that they sat me down and the look on the officer's face was truly horrifying."

The accident occurred on Friday, Aug. 15, around 1:18 p.m., as Nunney's family members left their hotel to meet him for lunch.

Police said their vehicle "struck several small trees, traveled down an embankment and collided with a large tree."

Nunney, who told the outlet he was tracking his sister's phone, noticed their location hadn't changed and rushed to the scene with a friend.

Authorities said Maria Nunney, 50, who was in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at the scene. Donald Nunney, 55, was flown to a hospital and later died, reportedly from a heart attack that triggered the crash, his son told PEOPLE.

The Nunneys' younger children, 9 and 15, survived the crash, suffering serious injuries.

After learning that both his parents had died, Nunney told PEOPLE he realized that he "had to focus on what was important in this situation," which was doing anything he could to make sure his siblings were going to be OK.

"Since then, that's been my main priority," he said.

Nunney's 9-year-old brother sustained multiple broken bones and was placed on a ventilator, but is now off the ventilator and "talking nonstop," he said. His 15-year-old sister suffered a brain injury and has begun to walk and communicate. 

"Seeing them improve has really helped me improve mentally with the whole situation," Nunney said, adding she had not yet been told about their parents' deaths. "I want to give her time to heal." 

A spokesperson for the North Carolina State Highway Patrol told Fox News Digital that the crash remains under investigation and further details about what caused the fatal collision were not available.

Nunney said that his family had planned a special day on campus before returning home to Ohio. His sister, a fan of the show, "The Summer I Turned Pretty," had been looking forward to visiting filming locations with her brother. But the family never made it.

As the family grieves, the community is rallying around them. Nunney's parents were beloved, longtime teachers in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. 

Shari Obrenski, the president of the Cleveland Teachers Union, told WOIO that the school community is reeling.

"They were just incredible teachers, loving and attentive and committed parents. They were active in the community. Their loss has hit everyone so hard that it is unimaginable for their family and their children. So shocking and heartbreaking and just devastating," Obrenski told the outlet. 

Within hours of the crash, members of the Morehead-Cain scholarship program, UNC staff and relatives had gathered to offer help.

A GoFundMe campaign to assist the family has raised over $350,000.

The organizers praised Maria and Donald as "amazing and devoted parents," emphasizing their strong commitment both to their family and their roles as educators.

"Maria and Donald leave behind a legacy of community, family, and love, all rooted in the devotion they had for their children and their family," a post on the fundraising page read.

The crash took place shortly before the start of the academic year at UNC, which began on Monday, Aug. 18.

While Nunney plans to take the fall semester off to care for his siblings, he's determined to finish his degree.

"I know that's what my parents would've wanted," he said. 

Reflecting on their final moments together, Nunney shared what it meant to have his parents drop him off last year for his freshman year of college.

"It was the first time they saw me as an adult," he recalled. "They saw me, truthfully, as more of a man than just their kid, and I felt like that was something that will always stick with me."

NEW YORK (AP) — There are some tennis players, such as Frances Tiafoe or Madison Keys or Ben Shelton, who can't wait for the U.S. Open to come around each year, with its boisterous crowds, its bold-faced names in the stands, its music at changeovers, its buzz. To them, the louder, the better. Start the show and bring the noise.

“I operate well in chaos,” said Tiafoe, twice a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows.

Sometimes, it all can get out of control, as happened during a match that ended early Monday. There was a delay of more than five minutes while spectators booed and shouted — egged on by 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev, who was angered by chair umpire Greg Allensworth's ruling after a photographer interrupted play by going on court, of all things.

“They didn't want to stop,” Medvedev said about the fans. “So, whatever.”

Not everyone is able to shrug off that sort of mayhem at a Grand Slam tournament famous — some would say infamous — for the over-served fans, airplanes roaring overhead, the Manhattan-Queens commute and the odors of everything from marijuana to food being grilled.

“It's something you really can't train the brain to kind of deal with,” 1991-92 champion Monica Seles said. “You just adjust to it.”




There also are those, such as 2024 champion Aryna Sabalenka or 2014 champion Marin Cilic or Petra Kvitova, who didn't start out with an affinity for the anarchy — “Really confusing,” was Sabalenka's initial impression — but grew to be OK with it.

And there are even some whose opinion shifted the other way, from embracing to despising.

“In my 20s, I loved coming here. There was so much to do. But the older I get, the less I enjoy being here. It's a little bit chaotic. There's always a lot of noise. A lot of smells everywhere. I've visited most of the places in New York; I don't need to go to Central Park for the 1,003rd time,” said Adrian Mannarino, 37, a Frenchman who began his 15th U.S. Open on Sunday by upsetting 29th-seeded Tallon Griekspoor.

“It used to be fun,” Mannarino said about the tournament, “but sometimes I'm like, ‘Gosh, I wish I could concentrate a little bit more.'”

The hushes that envelope Wimbledon's Centre Court or the French Open's Court Philippe-Chatrier — which hold nearly 10,000 fewer spectators than 23,859-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium — are harder to come by in New York.

“Wimbledon, for example — it's proper, it's elegant, it's elevated. People are definitely more quiet and respectful, I guess you could say,” said Emma Navarro, an American who reached the semifinals at Flushing Meadows last year. “U.S. Open, it feels a bit more casual. Casually rowdy, I guess I would call it.”

There is a constant hum at Ashe and other arenas.

That's just fine with Shelton, whose first of two major semifinals came at the 2023 U.S. Open.

“I guess I find peace in the chaos,” he said, “because I feel more uncomfortable at the quiet tournaments.”

For the retired Agnieszka Radwanksa, the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2012, nothing ever came as easily at the U.S. Open, where she went 0-5 in fourth-round matches.

“Everything takes so much energy from you and just sucks it up. Everything is loud. All the smells around, like the hamburgers. Everything is really noisy. The traffic,” Radwanska said. “I respect the players that don't see the difference and don't feel that and can play like nothing is happening.”

Some find the Big Apple itself as problematic as the tournament site.

Elisabetta Cocciaretto, the Italian who stunned 2024 U.S. Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wimbledon's first round last month, never felt at ease until she stopped staying at an official tournament hotel and switched to a more off-the-beaten-path spot.

“I like to separate myself a bit,” Cocciaretto said. “Because otherwise, you're amid the madness. And if there's too much of that, your head explodes.”

Casper Ruud, the 2022 U.S. Open runner-up, felt “overwhelmed” the first time he came to the event as a junior.

While he's come to enjoy New York, particularly the restaurants, there's one thing that bothers him about the city: “I'm not a big fan of the smell of weed when you walk around. ... Every corner of every street, you smell it.”

Zohran Mamdani, New York City Democratic mayoral nominee, told reporters on Monday how he would fight against the Trump administration in New York City.

Boston and Los Angeles are providing a "model for how to fight" President Donald Trump's sweeping second-term agenda in New York City, Zohran Mamdani claimed on Monday. 

"We have seen that the best way to fight Donald Trump is to do exactly that. It's to fight him. It's not to cower. It's not to collaborate. It's not to call him," Mamdani told reporters in Brooklyn in an apparent jab at his competitor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. 

When asked how the Democratic mayoral nominee would respond if Trump moved to eliminate cashless bail in New York City, as he did in Washington, D.C., on Monday morning, Mamdani vowed to fight. 

"The Trump administration is one that we can see a model for how to fight it across this country. You can see that in Mayor Wu in Boston. We can also see it internationally with President Sheinbaum of Mexico," Mamdani said.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has rejected Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration since he won back the presidency last year.

Specifically, she reaffirmed and strengthened The Trust Act, an ordinance that limits local cooperation with federal immigration authorities, in Dec. 2024 ahead of Trump's second term. 

When Attorney General Pam Bondi sent her and fellow blue-city leaders a letter threatening federal action over Boston's sanctuary city policies, Wu was quick to defend her home city. 

"Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law," Wu fired back. 

Wu was one of several "sanctuary city" mayors who defended Boston's local immigration laws before the House Oversight Committee earlier this year.

"I think you have to use every single tool available to you, and I think we saw in California how effective it can be to use the tools of the law, even though the Trump administration thinks itself above the law," Mamdani said on Monday. 

Earlier this year, protests rejecting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Trump-led deportation rollout delved into riots in Los Angeles. For the first time in 60 years, the president federalized the National Guard without the request of the state's governor. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, widely considered a 2028 presidential hopeful, sued Trump for his so-called "unlawful" deployment of the National Guard without Newsom's consent. 

Newsom and Trump have since been duking out the constitutional legality of such a move, and the California governor has been seizing any opportunity to troll the president.

As Trump continues to push border security, fulfilling his leading campaign promise, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected the Trump administration's attempt to send U.S. troops into Mexico. 

"It is through belief in the convictions that you hold in the very fabric of the city you represent, that you are able to fight back against an administration that is seemingly hellbent on tearing apart the city," Mamdani said on Monday.

The self-described Democratic socialist has joined national Democrats in criticizing Trump's "big, beautiful bill," which Mamdani claimed "will throw millions of New Yorkers off their health insurance, cut SNAP benefits for the hungry, and will make it even more difficult to afford to live in the most expensive city in the United States of America."

While Republicans argue the bill only cuts waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, according to the Congressional Budget Office, about 10 million more people will be uninsured by 2034 due to Trump's megabill.

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

            President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday tasking his secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, with establishing “specialized units” in the National Guard that will be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues” — the clearest sign yet he intends to expand the US military's role in domestic law enforcement activities across the country.
    


            Under the newly signed order, Hegseth is charged with “ensuring that each State's Army National Guard and Air National Guard are resourced, trained, organized, and available to assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order whenever the circumstances necessitate, as appropriate under law.” A primary mission of the National Guard is already to be trained and available to assist law enforcement with public safety, often at the request of their state's governor.
    


            It also orders Hegseth to “designate an appropriate number of each State's trained National Guard members to be reasonably available for rapid mobilization for such purposes” and establish a standing “quick reaction reaction force that shall be “available for rapid nationwide deployment.”
    


            Questions remain, however, about how the order will work in practice. The National Guard already has reaction forces, designed to rapidly respond to incidents requiring law enforcement or security support in each state, territory, and the District of Columbia. These forces primarily perform their mission under the command and control of governors, and Trump's executive order on Monday does not specify what authority the units outside of DC would report to if a state's governor does not wish to use them.
    


            “It seems very performative,” Rachel VanLandingham, a former Air Force judge advocate and current law professor at Southwestern Law School, told CNN on Monday. “It doesn't seem to be telling the National Guard to do anything than it already does. But again, the devil is in the details of how they plan on using them.”
    


            The executive order heightens existing concerns that the Trump administration is seeking to use the National Guard and federal law enforcement agencies for political purposes — particularly as the president appears to exclusively be considering deployments to cities run by Democrats in blue states.
    


            This move follows a directive by Hegseth last week that authorized members of the National Guard deployed in Washington, DC, to begin carrying weapons.
    


            National Guard members deployed to DC started carrying sidearms Sunday, a spokesperson for the Joint Task Force carrying out the mission told CNN. A release from Joint Task Force – DC on Sunday said Hegseth directed guard members to carry their assigned weapons. A US official told CNN on Monday that some troops will carry M4 rifles, as that is their primary weapon, whereas military police, for example, primarily use a M17 handgun. A Joint Task Force spokesperson said the troops are authorized to use their firearms for “personal protection” only, meaning self defense— and “not for policing.”
    


            Hegseth's order marked a notable shift in guidance from the Pentagon, which had previously indicated that National Guard members could be armed if the circumstances warranted.
    


            The defense secretary told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the National Guard is “really proud to be a part of defending the nation's capital and ensuring it is safe and beautiful, and working with law enforcement,” adding guard members deployed to the district “love this mission.”
    


            On Monday, Trump suggested he'd ask Congress to codify the action expanding the National Guard's remit, telling reporters in the Oval Office, “I think Democrats will actually vote for this.”
    


            And he left the door open to deploying military to other cities, such as Chicago, telling reporters they are “ready to go anywhere,” with “less than 24 hours' notice.” However, he suggested he'd wait until governors request National Guard troops before ordering deployments to address crime.
    


            “We may wait, we may or may not — we may just go in and do it, which is probably what we should do,” Trump said. “The problem is, it's not nice when you go in and do it and somebody else is standing there saying, as we give great results, say, ‘Well, we don't want the military.' They need help badly — Chicago desperately needs help. Just look at the crime statistics.”
    


            Trump could send National Guard troops into a state against the governor's wishes, reminiscent of what occurred in Los Angeles this summer, when troops were federalized. But that critical distinction of who the troops report to impacts what guard members can or cannot do while they are mobilized. Federalized troops, like those who mobilized in LA, cannot perform law enforcement activities, as it would be a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. Troops on Title 32 orders, like those mobilized inside DC, are not subject to Posse Comitatus and therefore able to assist in law enforcement.
    


            The DC National Guard is unique in that the president has the authority to activate them under Title 32, though that authority is typically delegated to the secretary of the Army. Otherwise, National Guard troops elsewhere in the country are under the control of their governors while on Title 32.
    


            “DC sets a bad example,” VanLandingham said. “It sets an example of normalizing this when nothing is normal about it, and DC is not representative of other states. … It would just be a whole new world for them to try a Washington, DC-type maneuver in Chicago or anywhere else that's not Washington, DC, because Washington, DC, is so legally different than any other area.”
    


            “He wants to do DC in Chicago, but he doesn't have the statutory authorities in DC unless he finally invokes the Insurrection Act,” she added. The Trump administration left the door open to invoking the Insurrection Act earlier this year in regard to military activity at the southern border, though the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security did not recommend taking the dramatic step, which would allow Trump to use active-duty military forces within the US to perform law enforcement.
    


            Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, forcefully objected Sunday to the possibility of Trump deploying the National Guard to Chicago — something the president has said he is strongly considering.
    


            “It comes as no surprise Donald Trump is once again attacking Chicago, but that doesn't change that Trump's continuing pattern of politicizing and misusing our nation's military for his own partisan gain and to crush dissent is deeply disturbing, is un-American and has no place in any of our cities,” Duckworth, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services, said in a statement ahead of Monday's executive order signing.
    


            Logistically, Monday's executive order also leaves questions unanswered as to how the “specialized units” would train or whether there would be coordination between those units across the states.
    


            “Are you saying each state is going to have its own quick reaction force that can handle everything? Are you looking at an amalgamation of units that come together under a Pentagon official, commander? If so, then you need to have a schoolhouse where they're getting together and training on this, and what are the regulations on it? … This is classically how military missions fail, when you don't have clear guidance and you haven't been training together,” VanLandingham said.
    


            National Guard troops on the DC mission are expected this week to begin assisting more with the “beautification” piece of the mission. A US official told CNN on Monday that the guard is working through what equipment will be needed and what sites they'll assist with, but tasks are expected to include things like painting over graffiti, picking up trash, and removing driftwood from the Tidal Basin by the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial.
    


            The executive order signed in March titled, “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,” directed a “coordinated beautification plan” for facilities, monuments and parks in DC, the removal of graffiti, and to “ensure the cleanliness of public spaces.”
    


            For weeks, Trump has ramped up efforts to crack down on crime in Washington, DC, which has also included a federal takeover of the city's police department and increased federal law enforcement presence. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are lower this year than in 2024.
    


            To assist the DC National Guard, troops from the National Guards in West Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Ohio, Louisiana and Tennessee were called upon. Troops from the GOP-led states began arriving in the nation's capital last week. As of Sunday morning, there were 2,274 National Guardsmen on the mission, more than 1,300 of them from supporting states.
    


            In the week beginning August 12, the first full day the Trump administration had control of the Metropolitan Police Department, the city saw a moderate drop in reported crime — and a far larger surge in arrests of immigrants, a CNN analysis of government data found.

President Donald Trump welcomed Lee Jae Myung, the new president of South Korea, to the White House on Monday afternoon for talks on trade and defense.

Hours ahead of the visit, Trump posted on social media that a “Purge or Revolution” was taking place in South Korea and threatened not to do business with Seoul. It was not immediately clear what Trump was referring to, but South Korea had been in a state of political turmoil for the last several months after its former leader, the conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, was ousted from office after imposing martial law last December.

Before Trump's post, the first in-person meeting between him and the liberal Lee had been expected to help flesh out details of a July trade deal between the two countries that has Seoul investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. The agreement set tariffs on South Korean goods at 15% after Trump threatened rates as high as 25%.

Other news we're following:



The U.S. president responded to a question about whether he would return to the Demilitarized Zone that separates the Koreas by fondly recalling the last time he did so in 2019.

“Remember when I walked across the line and everyone went crazy?” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon.

He recalled that everyone went crazy, “especially Secret Service.”

But “I loved it,” Trump said. He added that he felt safe because he had a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator.

Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot on North Korean soil in June 2019 during an unannounced trip to the DMZ.

The president suggested that the U.S. should do away with a lease covering a large joint American-South Korean military base.

“I would like to see if we could get rid of the lease, and get ownership of the land where we have a massive military base,” Trump said.

Osan Air Base is a joint U.S. Air Force and South Korean base on South Korea's west coast.

“I don't know that they'll meet, Trump said. “Maybe they will. Maybe they won't.”

Trump last week following his hosting of European leaders and Zelenskyy for talks, as well as speaking by phone with Putin, said that he was arranging direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy that might be followed by three-way talks in which he'd take part.

But Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made it clear Friday that Putin won't meet with Zelenskyy until the Ukrainians agree to some of Moscow's longstanding demands to end the conflict.

“It takes two to tango. I always say,” Trump said. “And they, should meet, I think, before I have a meeting and probably close the deal.”

While answering a question about the conflict, Trump said “this is a whole new form of war.”

He highlighted to use of flying drones, which have been widely deployed for reconnaissance and weaponry.

“A drone war never existed before,” he said. “We're actually studying it.”

“I would like to ask for your role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula,” President Lee told Trump. He even added that he'd like to see “construction of a Trump tower in North Korea and playing golf.”

Kim added of a possible upcoming meeting between Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, “I believe that he will be waiting for you.”

Trump said he had a very good relationship in his first term with Kim though he also called him “Little Rocket Man.” 

Trump repeated his suggestions that he could soon meet with Kim and suggested he could help work toward peace.

Lee Jae Myung complimented Trump's decorative touches in the Oval Office, to which Trump has added numerous gold accents around the room.

He told Trump the office “looks very bright and beautiful” and has “the dignity of America.”

He also said, “I think America is becoming great again.”

House Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer wrote that the Republican-led committee will probe “disturbing allegations that DC crime data is inaccurate and intentionally manipulated” in a letter to Metropolitan Police Chief Pam Smith.

Comer cited local reports that a police commander for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department was put on administrative leave after allegedly altering some crime statistics. Mayor Muriel Bowser has confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into the incident.

“In light of these reports and a related whistleblower disclosure made to the committee, the committee requests documents and information, as well as transcribed interviews with the district commanders of each of the seven patrol districts,” Comer wrote.

The move comes two weeks after President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency over crime in the nation's capital. More than 2300 National Guard troops have been deployed to the city along with a surge in federal law enforcement agents from the FBI, ICE, DEA and other agencies.

The Justice Department launched its own investigation into DC's crime statistics. Trump and Republicans have cast doubt on those statistics and scrutinized some local policing policies they allege reduced the reports of criminal acts.

The endowment is “updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the Administration Consequently, we are cancelling existing funding opportunities that fall outside these new priorities,” reads an email sent to novelist Marie Myung-Ok Lee, echoing language received by numerous authors who posted emails from the federal agency.

The fellowships were established in 2001 and have been awarded to hundreds of authors, including such prize winners as Jhumpa Lahiri, Andrew Sean Greer and Terrance Hayes. They offer up to $50,000 to fiction and nonfiction writers.

The NEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Like other federal cultural organizations, the NEA has faced cuts in funding and pressure from the Trump administration to emphasize more patriotic themes.

Lee Jae Myung, the new president of South Korea, has arrived at the White House for his meeting with Trump.

He waved to the gathered press as Trump welcomed him on the West Wing driveway.

They are now headed for their meeting at the Oval Office.

Perhaps, the most significant announcement from last week's White House gathering with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leader was Trump affirming that the U.S. would support Europe's security guarantees for Kyiv once the Russian invasion ends.

But Trump said on Monday, “we haven't even discussed the specifics” of just how the U.S. would be involved in assisting a European-led effort. “But we'll be involved, and from the standpoint of backup, we're going to help them.”

Just before wrapping up his comments in the Oval Office, Trump said the administration would soon be reducing drug prices anywhere from 1,000% to 1,500%. He noted that many other countries pay far less for prescription drugs than people do in the U.S. Trump made a similar promise earlier in August.

Drug prices obviously cannot be reduced more than 100%, but experts have told the Associated Press that while the Trump administration has taken steps to lower prescription drug prices, there's no indication costs have dropped such a massive drop.

“I find it really difficult to translate those numbers into some actual estimates that patients would see at the pharmacy counter,” said Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University who studies the U.S. pharmaceutical market. She added that Trump's math is “really hard to follow.”

“I have very good relationships with Kim Jong Un and North Korea,” Trump told reporters. He even suggested that he had a better relationship with Kim than almost anyone but Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong.

“A lot of people would say, ‘That's terrible.' No it's good,” Trump added, recalling meeting with North Korea's leader during his first term.

“In fact, some day, I'll see him,” Trump said of a possible second-term meeting with Kim. “I look forward to seeing him.”

Israeli officials say of the 50 hostages still held by Hamas, only about 20 remain alive. The rest were either killed during the October 2023 attack or while in captivity, according to Israeli officials.

But Trump on Monday told reporters that are “probably a little bit less than 20 because I think one or two are gone.”

Trump did not elaborate on what his estimate is based on.

In long comments to reporters, Trump mixed up the name of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

“I did a favor for Christie, uh, for Christe Whitman. Uh, Whitmer,” Trump said of the Democratic leader of Michigan.

He was trying to describe an April meeting where Whitmer and the president discussed sparing an Air Force Base in Michigan from being closed.

But the president appeared to be mixing up Whitmer's name with that of Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey.

It was the kind of verbal gaffe Trump routinely says his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, might have made — claiming it was evidence Biden was mentally diminished.

In other comments Monday, Trump suggested Biden “didn't know he was alive” and “didn't know what he was doing.”

In a Truth Social post Monday, the U.S. president blasted critics of the government's new 10% stake in the chipmaker as “stupid,” adding he would make similar deals “all day long.”

Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett signaled the same Monday, telling CNBC that Friday's deal that some conservatives have labeled “socialism” was part of broader strategy of setting up a sovereign wealth fund that would invest in an array of companies.

“I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries,” the National Economic Council director said.

Asked about an overnight Israeli strikes on a hospital in southern Gaza that killed five journalists, including a freelancer who worked for The Associated Press, Trump said initially he wasn't aware the incident before offering: “I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it.”

“And I think he's very bad for votes,” Trump said. He also criticized “liberal courts” for protecting Abrego Garcia, but added, “We have that under control.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking in the Oval Office at Trump's side, said of Abrego Garcia, “He will no longer terrorize our country.”

“The guy needs to be in prison. He doesn't need to be on the streets like all these liberals want him to be,” Bondi said.

The comments followed Abrego Garcia being detained by immigration authorities to face renewed efforts to deport him.

Trump and members of his administration have made unsubstantiated exaggerations in order to justify bringing the military into Democratic run cities such as Washington and Los Angeles. Here are just a couple examples from today:

Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff on Washington: “You have people who can walk freely at night without having to worry about being robbed or mugged, or wearing their watches again. They're wearing jewelry again. They're carrying purses again.”

The administration offered no proof to support these statements.

More than 180 current and former employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency published a letter Monday warning that debilitating cuts to the agency charged with handling federal disaster response risks a catastrophe like the one seen after Hurricane Katrina.

Addressed to the FEMA Review Council and Congress, the letter contains six “statements of opposition” to current policies at FEMA, including a burdensome expenditure approval policy implemented by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem which the signatories say reduces FEMA's ability to perform its missions.

It also critiques a DHS decision to reassign some FEMA employees to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator as stipulated by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and FEMA workforce.

About 140 staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency were placed on administrative leave last month for signing a similar statement.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is applauding the decision to arm National Guard troops deployed to fight crime in Washington.

“It's just common sense to make sure they're armed,” Hegseth said. He added that troops are therefore, “Capable of defending themselves and others.”

Some National Guard units patrolling the nation's capital have started carrying firearms at Trump's direction — a major escalation of his military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by Hegseth.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin is calling on his party to “fight like hell” as he welcomes Democrats from across the nation to the DNC's summer meeting in Minneapolis.

In his welcome address Monday morning, Martin charged that President Trump is dismantling democracy and peoples' lives.

“This is not politics as usual. This is authoritarianism. It's fascism dressed in a red tie,” Martin said. “And all the Democrats throughout this country, we are the only thing standing in his way.”

Martin is focusing his ire on the Republican president, but he's also confronting internal divisions in the DNC's first meeting since he became party chair. His critics believe the party isn't doing enough to push back against Trump.

“I get it. People are pissed off. I'm pissed off,” Martin said Monday morning. “We are still unified despite our differences.”

Vance slammed Democratic governors who've criticized the Trump administration for using National Guard troops to fight crime in big cities, saying “we want people to welcome us, to ask us” for sending in the military.

“They're angrier about the fact the president of the United States is offering to help them get their crime under control than they are about the fact that murderers are running roughshod over their cities and have been for decades,” Vance said of top Democrats.

He said Trump's Washington crackdown meant people who would have been killed are now “living, breathing” and going on with their lives in the nation's capital.

Trump signed the order that charges the Department of Justice with investigating instances of flag burning. Trump said those who burn the United States flag would be charged with inciting a riot and receive one year in jail with no opportunity for early release.

Trump said burning an American flag “incites riots at levels we've never seen before.”

Trump's advisers said the executive order “wouldn't fall afoul of the First Amendment,” which protects the freedom of speech, but did not expand on what that meant.

The 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson ruled flag burning constitutes “symbolic speech” that's protected by the First Amendment.

A White House aide told Trump the order would require the defense secretary to establish specialized units in the DC National Guard and National Guard units across the country that are trained and equipped to deal with “public order issues.”

Some critics of Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops across Washington, D.C., have argued that these troops aren't trained in policing.

The executive order also tasks the U.S. attorney general with reviewing local police orders that are believed to impede law enforcement efforts in the city and take steps to undo them.

He's been complaining about former President Joe Biden's use of an autopen to sign executive orders and pardons, suggesting without evidence that presidential power was hijacked under his predecessor.

Trump suggested that people pardoned by Biden — including some of Trump's political enemies — could still be prosecuted.

“It looks like those pardons are worthless,” he said.

Trump said Biden's pardons went to “very unpatriotic people, very evil people.”

Trump is vowing to improve Washington's roads and medians and undertake a larger city beautification plan quickly and at little cost.

After saying last week that he'd ask Congress for “about $2 billion” in funding to improve Washington, the president declared, “Congress said they'll give us whatever money is needed to fix up the capital.”

Despite the backlash to his crackdown in D.C., Trump insisted his approach is popular. He compared it to debates over transgender athletes, another divisive issue he harnessed during last year's election.

“This is another ‘men in women's sports' things,” he said.

“I think the Democrats better get smart,” Trump said. “Politically, I hope they don't, but actually, in terms of love for the country, I hope they do, because it would be good to work together.”

Responding to critics decrying his crackdown in Washington, Trump said, “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we like a dictator.'”

“I'm not a dictator. I'm a man with great common sense,” Trump said.

He repeated threats to send National Guard troops into Chicago.

Although the topic for Trump's event in the Oval Office was public safety, he started with a broadside against the media. He complained about unfair coverage and said there are “purposely negative stories.”

He also claimed reporters are happy with his law enforcement crackdown but “most of you won't say that because you're radical left.”

Trump said the media has lost its influence because he's won elections despite negative coverage.

“Many of you are corrupt, and there's nothing we can do about, but we keep winning.”

President Trump greeted Lee Jae Myung, the new president of South Korea, by asserting a “Purge or Revolution” was taking place there and threatening to not do business with Seoul as he prepared to host the new leader at the White House later Monday.

It wasn't immediately clear what Trump was referring to, but South Korea had been in a state of political turmoil for the last several months after its former leader, the conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, briefly imposed martial law last December which eventually led to his stunning ouster from office.

“WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can't have that and do business there,” Trump posted on social media Monday morning. “I am seeing the new President today at the White House. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!”

Yoon, who was elected to a five-year term in 2022, was considered more ideologically aligned with Trump and had even taken up golfing again after the U.S. president was reelected last November to try to forge a bond with him.

Special envoy Keith Kellogg was speaking in Kyiv on Monday about efforts to end the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine as a lack of progress fuels doubts about whether a peace settlement could be on the horizon.

Officials are “hoping to get to a position where, in the near term, we have, with a lack of a better term, security guarantees” that address Ukraine's fears of another invasion by Russia in the future, Kellogg said.

“That's a work in progress,” Kellogg said of the potential security guarantees after attending Ukraine's annual National Prayer Breakfast along with politicians, business leaders and diplomats.

A week ago, President Trump said he'd set in motion arrangements for direct peace talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But Russian officials have signaled that such a summit won't happen any time soon.

The president plans to sign an executive order threatening to revoke federal funding from local and state governments that allow cashless bail, according to a White House official. The official requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter before a public announcement later in the morning.

Trump has been escalating his focus on public safety, particularly in Democratic cities such as Washington, where he's deployed National Guard troops and federal agents over the objections of local officials.

The president is scheduled to sign executive orders at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. One involves ending cashless bail, according to the White House Assistant Press Secretary. Another is designed to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is an act protected by the First Amendment.

At noon, he's scheduled to greet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. The two will then participate in a bilateral meeting and a lunch, where they're expected to discuss trade and defense issues.

President Trump will sign an executive order later Monday that's meant to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is protected by the First Amendment.

The order calls on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute those who break laws “in ways that involve desecrating the flag,” according to a White House official.

Under the order, Bondi would also pursue litigation with the intent to potentially change what is allowed on flag burning under the First Amendment. The administration would also be allowed in some cases to deny or revoke visas to foreigners who participate in the act.

Trump has long demanded punishment for those who burn a U.S. flag, although the Supreme Court has ruled that doing so is a form of constitutionally protected free speech.

The court order signed by Chief Judge George Russell III automatically pauses any effort by the Trump administration to immediately deport Abrego Garcia.

Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the U.S. until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. In June, the administration sued all of Maryland's 15 federal judges to challenge the standard order.

Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, says a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there's going to be a status conference very promptly, and we're going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

This latest development makes good on a directive issued late last week by Trump's defense secretary.

A Defense Department official who wasn't authorized to speak publicly said some units on certain missions would be armed — some with handguns and others with rifles. The spokesperson said that all units with firearms have been trained and are operating under strict rules for use of force.

An Associated Press photographer on Sunday saw members of the South Carolina National Guard outside Union Station with holstered handguns.

A statement from the joint task force that has taken over policing in the nation's capital said units began carrying their service weapons on Sunday and that the military's rules say force should be used “only as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.” It said the force is committed to protecting “the safety and wellbeing” of Washington's residents.

But the court documents weren't publicly available. They filed it in the federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, where U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has been presiding over a string of hearings for the original case.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia's story begins in his native El Salvador, but it's become increasingly unclear where it will end.

A local gang, Barrio 18, began extorting his family for “rent money.” When he was 12, the gang threatened to take Abrego Garcia away until his father paid “all of the money that they wanted.” 

Abrego Garcia eventually fled to the U.S. illegally around 2011, the year he turned 16, according to documents in his immigration case. He found work in construction. 

In March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he and three other men were detained by local police, court records say. They were suspected of being in MS-13 based on tattoos and clothing, according to the records.

Abrego Garcia became a flash point in Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The latest filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

On Friday, Abrego Garcia returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was greeted with cheers and flowers following his release from a Tennessee jail on Friday after his case attracted significant attention amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown when he was mistakenly deported in March.

SALISBURY, Mass. (AP) — Hurricane Erin never made landfall but left behind rough ocean conditions along the U.S. East Coast. At least two people died after they had been swimming in the heavy current, and a search continued Monday for a man who was missing after his boat capsized.

Beaches were beginning to reopen Friday after Erin, twice the size of an average hurricane, had weakened into a post-tropical cyclone far from land, but was still capable of causing life-threatening surf and rip currents, the National Hurricane Center in Miami had said. Erin's outer bands had already brushed North Carolina. It caused no widespread damage. 

In Massachusetts, a team of police and U.S. Coast Guard members were resuming their search Monday for a man in his 50s who was missing after a boat capsized off of Salisbury Beach on Saturday. The other person in the boat was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. 

Despite challenging weather and sea conditions including 6- to 8-foot swells, the team performed sonar scans, dives, surface and aerial patrols on Sunday, the state police said in a news release. In Maine, a man was rescued Saturday after his sailboat capsized in high surf in York Harbor.

In New Hampshire, authorities are investigating the death of a 17-year-old boy who had been swimming with family members off of Hampton Beach on Sunday night. 

Witnesses said he was pulled away by a strong ocean current and his father unsuccessfully tried to rescue him. Lifeguards brought both to shore and began livesaving efforts on the teen, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The father was treated there. 




A man drowned Saturday after being caught in a strong rip current off the New York coast, at Sailors Haven in the Fire Island Natoinal Seashore in Suffolk County, authorities said. Ishmoile Mohammed, 59, was visiting from South Carolina. 

Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Juliette formed Monday in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles from Mexico's Baja California peninsula as Tropical Storm Fernand churned in the Atlantic Ocean.

No coastal watches or warnings were in effect for either storm, the hurricane center said. 

Juliette posed no immediate threat to land, forecasters said. The storm was about 450 miles (724 kilometers) south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. It had maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (72 kph).

It was moving west-northwest at 13 mph (21 kph). Some strengthening was forecast through Tuesday, with weakening starting Wednesday.

In the Atlantic basin, Fernand formed Saturday but was also far from land and forecast to remain over open ocean waters. It was about 425 miles (684 kilometers) east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 kph) and heading north-northeast at 13 mph (21 kph).

The storm was expected to turn more to the northeast as it moves away from Bermuda and weaken starting Monday night.

NEW YORK (AP) — There are some tennis players, such as Frances Tiafoe or Madison Keys or Ben Shelton, who can't wait for the U.S. Open to come around each year, with its boisterous crowds, its bold-faced names in the stands, its music at changeovers, its buzz. To them, the louder, the better. Start the show and bring the noise.

“I operate well in chaos,” said Tiafoe, twice a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows.

Sometimes, it all can get out of control, as happened during a match that ended early Monday. There was a delay of more than five minutes while spectators booed and shouted — egged on by 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev, who was angered by chair umpire Greg Allensworth's ruling after a photographer interrupted play by going on court, of all things.

“They didn't want to stop,” Medvedev said about the fans. “So, whatever.”

Not everyone is able to shrug off that sort of mayhem at a Grand Slam tournament famous — some would say infamous — for the over-served fans, airplanes roaring overhead, the Manhattan-Queens commute and the odors of everything from marijuana to food being grilled.

“It's something you really can't train the brain to kind of deal with,” 1991-92 champion Monica Seles said. “You just adjust to it.”

There also are those, such as 2024 champion Aryna Sabalenka or 2014 champion Marin Cilic or Petra Kvitova, who didn't start out with an affinity for the anarchy — “Really confusing,” was Sabalenka's initial impression — but grew to be OK with it. 




And there are even some whose opinion shifted the other way, from embracing to despising.

“In my 20s, I loved coming here. There was so much to do. But the older I get, the less I enjoy being here. It's a little bit chaotic. There's always a lot of noise. A lot of smells everywhere. I've visited most of the places in New York; I don't need to go to Central Park for the 1,003rd time,” said Adrian Mannarino, 37, a Frenchman who began his 15th U.S. Open on Sunday by upsetting 29th-seeded Tallon Griekspoor.

“It used to be fun,” Mannarino said about the tournament, “but sometimes I'm like, ‘Gosh, I wish I could concentrate a little bit more.'”

The hushes that envelope Wimbledon's Centre Court or the French Open's Court Philippe-Chatrier — which hold nearly 10,000 fewer spectators than 23,859-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium — are harder to come by in New York.

“Wimbledon, for example — it's proper, it's elegant, it's elevated. People are definitely more quiet and respectful, I guess you could say,” said Emma Navarro, an American who reached the semifinals at Flushing Meadows last year. “U.S. Open, it feels a bit more casual. Casually rowdy, I guess I would call it.”

There is a constant hum at Ashe and other arenas.

That's just fine with Shelton, whose first of two major semifinals came at the 2023 U.S. Open.

“I guess I find peace in the chaos,” he said, “because I feel more uncomfortable at the quiet tournaments.”

For the retired Agnieszka Radwanksa, the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2012, nothing ever came as easily at the U.S. Open, where she went 0-5 in fourth-round matches.

“Everything takes so much energy from you and just sucks it up. Everything is loud. All the smells around, like the hamburgers. Everything is really noisy. The traffic,” Radwanska said. “I respect the players that don't see the difference and don't feel that and can play like nothing is happening.”

Some find the Big Apple itself as problematic as the tournament site.

Elisabetta Cocciaretto, the Italian who stunned 2024 U.S. Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wimbledon's first round last month, never felt at ease until she stopped staying at an official tournament hotel and switched to a more off-the-beaten-path spot.

“I like to separate myself a bit,” Cocciaretto said. “Because otherwise, you're amid the madness. And if there's too much of that, your head explodes.”

Casper Ruud, the 2022 U.S. Open runner-up, felt “overwhelmed” the first time he came to the event as a junior.

While he's come to enjoy New York, particularly the restaurants, there's one thing that bothers him about the city: “I'm not a big fan of the smell of weed when you walk around. ... Every corner of every street, you smell it.”

The summoning to Paris of Ambassador to France Charles Kushner, following his allegations that the country had not done enough to combat antisemitism, marks his host country's formal displeasure with its top diplomat from the U.S.

Kushner — the father of Jared Kushner, son-in-law to President Donald Trump — wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France's foreign ministry has summoned Kushner to appear Monday at the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, saying in a statement that his allegations “are unacceptable.”

The diplomatic discord comes as French-U.S. relations have faced tensions this year amid Trump's trade war and a split over the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon. France and the U.S. have also been divided on support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, but the split has eased with Trump expressing support for security guarantees and a warm meeting with Macron and other European leaders at the White House last week. 

Here's what to know about Charles Kushner:




In the letter released late Sunday, Kushner wrote that “public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence and endanger Jewish life in France,” urging Macron “to act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception, ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses ... and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.”

In response, the French ministry said that Kushner's allegations violate international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country.

The dustup follows Macron's rejection this past week of accusations from Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that France's intention to recognize a Palestinian state is fueling antisemitism. France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe; its estimated 500,000 Jews marks the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the U.S., as well as approximately 1% of the national population.

State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott on Sunday evening said it stood by Kushner's comments. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Monday.

When he announced his intention to nominate Charles Kushner in November, Trump called him “a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker.” 

In May, the Senate confirmed Kushner's appointment 51-45. During hearings, he told senators that he is a child of Holocaust survivors who came to the United States after World War II, and his grandmothers and other members of his family were executed by Nazis.

As Trump has rattled traditionally solid relationships with European allies, Kushner said he appreciates the history between the two countries and is “dedicated to building an even stronger relationship.”

As he prepared to leave office following his first term in December 2020, Trump pardoned Kushner, following a years-earlier guilty plea to allegations of tax evasion and witness tampering. 

Prosecutors alleged that Kushner had hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation after discovering his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, hiring a prostitute and arranging to have the encounter recorded with a hidden camera and sent to his own sister, the man's wife.

After pleading guilty to 18 counts, Kushner was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison. It was the highest sentence he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought.

Christie, who called it “one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes” he ever prosecuted as U.S. attorney, has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump's 2016 transition team. In 2018, Charles Kushner told The New York Times that he wasn't interested in clemency, saying he “would prefer not to have a pardon” because it would garner publicity.

Kushner founded Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Married to Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, Jared Kushner was a senior adviser in Trump's first White House, working on a wide range of issues and policies, including Middle East peace efforts. 

Inspired by his father's time in prison, Jared Kushner pushed Trump to back criminal justice reform legislation and was an integral part of the first Trump administration's clemency efforts. In his early 20s and a law and business school student in the mid-2000s when his father was sentenced, Jared Kushner suddenly found himself having to run the family's businesses while shuttling back and forth on weekends to see his father in Alabama.

“When you're on the other side of the system, you feel so helpless,” Jared Kushner said in 2018. “I felt like, I was on this side of the system, so how can I try to do whatever I can do to try to be helpful to the people who are going through it” and deserve a second chance.

Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009.

NEW YORK (AP) — Daniil Medvedev's match was delayed more than six minutes between points Sunday night, after a photographer entered the court on match point and the 2021 U.S. Open champion became enraged by the chair umpire's decision to award his opponent a first serve.

The latest Medvedev meltdown on Louis Armstrong Stadium led to a wild change in the match. The No. 13 seed was a point away from being eliminated, then won the next two sets to force a deciding fifth before Benjamin Bonzi eliminated him from a second straight major with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4 victory that ended early Monday. 

“It's kind of crazy, this match,” Bonzi said. “For me, it's like my best victory ever.”

And he blamed Medvedev for making it a tense one, saying he believed the Russian's behavior crossed a line.

“I mean, the rule is the rule. The guy went on the court between two serves,” Bonzi said. “I mean, it's not my call to say first serve. And I think, yes, Daniil started it, and he put oil on the fire.”

Bonzi had just hit his first serve leading 5-4 in the third set. After he missed it, a photographer left his position and began walking along the side of the court.

More tennis players are talking about achieving work-life balance. As the U.S. Open kicks off, an AP reporter asked some players what they do outside of tennis that helps them with that.

Chair umpire Greg Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay — which is common in tennis. Medvedev then approached the chair to complain about the decision.




“He wants to go home, guys. He doesn't like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour,” Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.

Medvedev said after the match that he didn't believe the interference from the photographer was long enough to warrant restarting the point.

“I was not upset with the photographer. I was upset with the decision,” Medvedev said. “The delay from the photographer was probably four seconds and a half. I'm not sure it's enough for a (first) serve.”

Medvedev also shouted “What did Reilly Opelka say? What did Reilly Opelka say?” as he backed away from Allensworth's chair. Opelka was penalized by the ATP Tour in February after calling Allensworth the “worst ump on tour. ”

Medvedev wouldn't elaborate on that part of the exchange during his press conference.

“I'm getting big fine enough, so if I speak I'm in big trouble, so I'm not going to speak,” he said. “Everyone knows what I talked about when I said Reilly. Reilly got fined big-time for this, so I'm going to get a big fine, too.”

Medvedev blew kisses to fans and kept encouraging the loud boos, which lasted so long that he then tried to get fans to quiet down so Bonzi could serve. When Bonzi finally did, he missed the first serve and then lost the point, and Medvedev won the game and later the set to prolong the match.

Bonzi, who had fans chanting his name at times, appeared ready to serve at one point before some started whistling. He explained that he didn't want to hit because it's difficult to play tennis without being able to hear the sound of the ball.

“Every time I went on the line to serve and every time I did that, everyone was booing. I felt I didn't do anything bad in the match to, like, receive this treatment, and I didn't want to serve in those conditions,” Bonzi said. “So I was waiting.” 

It was reminiscent of Medvedev's 2019 match on the same court, when fans booed him for his antics and he later taunted the crowd in his post-match interview, saying the jeers gave him energy. Medvedev had snatched the towel from a ballperson and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire's chair, actions that led to him being fined $9,000 for that match.

Medvedev reached the final that year, then won the title two years later. But he went just 1-4 in Grand Slam tournaments this year and was also upset by Bonzi in the first round at Wimbledon.

Medvedev sat in his chair for a few minutes after the match and repeatedly smashed his racket before eventually departing.

A U.S. Tennis Association spokesman said the photographer was escorted from the court by U.S. Open security and his credential was revoked.

President Donald Trump is cracking down on so-called “cashless bail” and flag burning through three executive orders that he signed on Monday.

One of the cashless bail executive orders covers Washington, D.C., while the other covers the country more broadly, the White House told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

A White House official confirmed that under the two cashless bail executive orders, the federal government would withhold approval, funding, and services if jurisdictions with cashless bail do not repeal their policies, in addition to any “actions” Attorney General Pam Bondi identifies as “necessary and appropriate because of the emergency conditions.”

“The Order directs the Attorney General to submit a list of States and local jurisdictions with cashless bail policies,” the White House wrote in a fact sheet obtained by the Washington Examiner. “The Order instructs the Administration to identify Federal funds currently provided to cashless bail jurisdictions that may be suspended or terminated.”

Under a cashless bail legal and justice system, a person arrested for a crime does not need to pay money to be released from police custody before their respective trial.

The D.C. cashless bail executive order also “tasks the relevant law enforcement agencies and officials that are members of the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force to work to ensure that arrestees in the District of Columbia are held in Federal custody to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, and to pursue Federal charges and pretrial detention for such arrestees whenever possible,” according to the second White House fact sheet.

Trump's cashless bail executive orders coincide with his federal takeover of Washington's law enforcement amid plans to deploy the National Guard to other Democrat-run cities around the country in response to crime and homelessness, including Chicago and Baltimore.

Trump used the executive order signing ceremony Monday to criticize Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), who is speculated to be considering running for president in 2028, advising the governor to “spend more time in the gym.”

“Chicago is a killing field right now, and they don't acknowledge it,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we like a dictator.' I don't like a dictator. I'm not a dictator. I'm a man with great common sense and a smart person.”

The third executive order, regarding flag burning, directs “the Attorney General to vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the flag, and to pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment in this area,” the White House added.

“It also instructs the Attorney General to refer flag desecration cases that violate state or local laws to appropriate state or local authorities,” the White House wrote in a third fact sheet. “Finally, the order directs the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security and the Attorney General to deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits, or naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits, or seek removal from the United States, wherever there has been an appropriate determination that flag desecration by foreign nationals permits the exercise of those remedies under applicable law.”

During the signing ceremony, Trump told reporters, “If you burn a flag, you get one year in jail,” adding, “It goes on your record.”

“They called it freedom of speech,” he said. “But when you burn the American flag, it incites riots at levels that we've never seen before. People go crazy in a way.”

The executive order on flag burning is complicated for Bondi because, while working in the Florida attorney general's office, she defended a decision to drop charges for flag desecration and called the state's law unconstitutional.

“The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that this type of statute is unconstitutional,” Bondi said in 2007. “This defendant's conduct is protected under the First Amendment.”

TRUMP LEVERAGES WHITE HOUSE POWER WITH RED-STATE REDISTRICTING AND MAIL BALLOT PUSH

In its fact sheet on flag burning, the White House underscored that “the Supreme Court has never held that flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or serve as a form of ‘fighting words' is constitutionally protected.”

“Thank you for protecting the American flag, and we'll do that without running afoul of the First Amendment as well,” Bondi told Trump on Monday.

Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Alex Pelbath, who flew the last American plane out of Kabul, joins 'Fox & Friends' to reflect on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan four years later. 

EXCLUSIVE: A retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who commanded the final American evacuation flights out of Afghanistan four years ago on Monday launched a Republican campaign in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District.

Alex Pelbath, who describes himself as a "Trump Conservative," is running in the 2026 race to succeed three-term GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, who is bidding for governor rather than seek re-election in the right-leaning coastal district in South Carolina's Lowcountry.

"In combat, mission is everything. My mission is clear: provide President Trump the reinforcements he needs, deliver leadership that makes the Lowcountry proud, and bring an outsider's perspective to Washington," Pelbath said in a statement shared nationally first with Fox News Digital.

During the much-maligned U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during former President Joe Biden's first year in the White House, Pelbath served as air mission commander for the final evacuation from Kabul, overseeing all aircraft involved. And he personally flew the last American plane out of Afghanistan.

"I was the last one out. But the mission's not over," Pelbath said in his statement and an accompanying video.

The release from Pelbath's campaign highlighted that he helped shape two defense budgets and advised the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during his service at the Pentagon.

"I witnessed the devastation caused by career politicians' weak leadership," Pelbath argued in a statement. "I never planned to run for Congress, but I can't stand by while Washington puts politics before the mission. America needs leaders who will stand with President Trump and deliver on his effort to Make America Great Again – by ending the flow of illegal immigrants, stopping the woke nonsense in our schools and military, and fighting for an economy that works for Lowcountry families."

﻿And why fitness culture is a quintessentially American invention.

Every week, it feels as if there's a hot new fitness trend. The classes are full, there's a line at the squat rack, and there's a good chance you know someone with a stationary bike in a corner of their apartment. When it comes to how we choose to move our bodies, we have options. But our pilates (and barre and weightlighting) obsession did not come out of nowhere.

The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

That's where Danielle Friedman comes in. She's a journalist and author of the book, Let's Get Physical: How Women Discovered Exercise and Reshaped the World. According to Friedman, we're living in a fitness golden age, but it wasn't always this way. In the 1950s, people were actively discouraged from exercising. “For women, exercise was seen as especially dangerous,” she says. “There was a widespread belief that strenuous exercise would make your uterus fall out.” This week on Explain It To Me — Vox's weekly call-in podcast — she tells us how the messaging around movement changed.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Friedman, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

When did we first start to see our ideas around exercise evolve in America?

The post-World War II era was actually a time when Americans were moving less than ever before that then helped give rise to what would come. After all of the hardships of the Great Depression and the war, Americans were really embracing what they called the “modern way of life,” which largely meant exerting yourself physically as little as possible, particularly in the middle and upper classes. Push button appliances became popular, ranch houses eliminated stairs, driving replaced walking, and TV exploded.

So the good life meant a life of little sweat, and it was at that point when the first real fitness influencers stepped onto the scene through TV. The message that exercise was both necessary and good for you was beamed into living rooms across the country, and almost as soon as this period of inactivity began, there were these fitness evangelists who were saying, “Not so fast, we actually need to move our bodies to feel good.” There were a few really popular TV fitness personalities who had to work really hard to convince the country that exercise would not kill you.

Whoa. What? 

Yeah, there was a lot more fear about over-exertion than under-exertion at the time. There were still outdated beliefs that you were only born with a certain number of heartbeats and you didn't want to waste them on exercise. Muscles were seen as unseemly and unladylike.

Heading into the '60s, people like [fitness pioneer] Bonnie Prudden were saying, “No. It's safe. You need to do it.” And as people started discovering that a regular exercise habit made them feel good, and in some cases improved measures of health, slowly the cultural messaging began to take off.

There were still outdated beliefs that you were only born with a certain number of heartbeats and you didn't want to waste them on exercise.

We also had a president at the time, JFK, who famously wrote a piece in Sports Illustrated before he even was inaugurated called “The Soft American.” There were a lot of fears about the fact that basically in this Cold War era, Americans were becoming really physically unfit and soft, and we would have trouble defending ourselves.

All of these cultural forces were helping to shape what happened in the early '60s, and we started to see some of the first really early group fitness classes. So many of these workouts are almost a century or over a century old. Pilates was created basically a hundred years ago.

Let's fast-forward one decade. It's the 1970s. This is a decade you've written that has changed fitness forever. What happened in the '70s? 

There was the rise of the women's movement. Books like Our Bodies, Ourselves, the seminal feminist health tome, actually had a chapter about exercise, and they were telling women, “It's okay for women to have muscles.” It was part of this messaging that women can be independent and self-sufficient. There was the passage of Title IX in 1972, which created so many more opportunities for girls to play high school and college sports, so there was a whole new generation of women who were active and wanted to continue to be active.

There was also the birth of exercise science, which is huge. For a really long time, even as some enlightened doctors knew or suspected that exercise was good for your health, those fears about overexertion were very real. Against that backdrop, there was an explosion [of exercise]. And in the '70s, we saw what we would now look at as almost like the virality of so many workouts and modes of exercise that laid the groundwork for how we move today.

What are some of those exercises? 

Running or jogging. Before the early '70s, it was seen as people who ran for fun and ran in public were really kind of kooky, and they would sometimes have cans thrown at them. The idea that you would run for the sake of running for health, for fitness, was not established yet. Women were not allowed to run most marathons. It was in 1972 that for the first time women were officially allowed to enter the Boston Marathon.

Before the early ‘70s, it was seen as people who ran for fun and ran in public were really kind of kooky, and they would sometimes have cans thrown at them.

What's another?

The '70s was in many ways, the decade of dance. Chorus Line was this huge Broadway hit. There was disco. There was Saturday Night Fever. Dance was cool. Everyday Americans wanted to have good dance skills, and that helped to fuel the rise of aerobic dancing.

At the time, Jazzercise was the most successful of the aerobic dancing brands. It was created by a professional jazz dancer, and she discovered that there were a lot of adult women who had no plans to become professional dancers, but wanted to look like dancers and were kind of captivated by dance. And so this felt very new and fresh. And for a lot of women at that time, going to a jazzercise aerobics dance class was the first time that they had ever worked out as adults.

What about yoga? It's obviously a very old practice, but how did it become popular in America?

The Beatles really had a lot to do with that in the late '60s. They very famously spent time at an ashram in India, and that helped to normalize it a little bit among Americans. A lot of Americans still saw yoga as dangerous. It felt scarily exotic to them, and there was a mystical element to it And then the real turning point was a PBS show called Lilias, Yoga, and You. So a lot of housewives who just had the TV on were exposed to her. For better and maybe for worse, that helped to demystify yoga and make it feel accessible and very American

You've also written about how weightlifting took off in the '70s.

Of all of the workouts we've talked about, bodybuilding was probably the most fringe. Men who really focused on strength training and building muscles were viewed suspiciously either as being narcissists or they were often portrayed as thugs or bodyguards. Enter Arnold Schwarzenegger who was a champion bodybuilder at the time. He defied a lot of the stereotypes that existed about male bodybuilders because he was very charming. He was very articulate. He was kind of a ladies man, and he helped make bodybuilding and strength training aspirational in this country.

There's another celebrity who had a huge impact on fitness at the time.

None of them had quite the impact as Jane Fonda. She was already an Oscar-winning actress, she was the daughter of Henry Fonda, and she had become kind of notorious for her anti-Vietnam War protests. She was the first Hollywood celebrity also to become a fitness influencer. Part of her success was selling herself, and the idea that if you workout like me, you can be like me. Her biggest impact came in 1982 when she released the Jane Fonda workout video. At the time, not that many people even owned VCRs because the idea that you would want to watch the same movie over and over again was new and people couldn't quite wrap their heads around it yet. But to be able to do Jane Fonda's workout, you had to own the tape, which meant you had to own a VCR. She, more than anyone who came before her, made exercise aspirational, especially for women.

Is there anything that stands out that's kind of uniquely American about our exercise culture? 

Fitness culture, as we know it, is an American invention. Some of the popular workouts that we do today, like barre and Pilates, have their roots in other countries, but it was in America that they became commercialized.

I think there is something about always striving for thinner, better, faster, stronger that does feel uniquely American, but hopefully now we're beginning to recognize some of that and we can move away from it a bit.

'Outnumbered' panel reacts to a massive crowd of protesters blocking the 101 freeway in Los Angeles.

FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Monday cracking down on suspects who desecrate the American flag, including burning it, by mandating they face prosecution, Fox News Digital exclusively learned. 

"The American flag is the most sacred and cherished symbol of the United States of America, and desecrating it is uniquely and inherently offensive and provocative," a fact sheet on the order provided to Fox News Digital reads. "It is a statement of contempt and hostility toward our Nation, and an act used by groups of foreign nationals calculated to intimidate and threaten violence against Americans." 

The executive order will direct the attorney general to prosecute those who violate laws "in ways that involve desecrating the flag," and to pursue litigation that would clarify the scope of the First Amendment as it relates to flag desecration. The order additionally directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to refer flag desecration cases that violate state and local laws to appropriate local authorities. 

TRUMP'S RENEWED CALLS TO JAIL AMERICAN FLAG BURNERS CLASHES WITH COURT PRECEDENT

The Supreme Court had already ruled in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson that burning the American flag is a form of symbolic speech that is protected by the First Amendment. Trump's executive order, which directs the attorney general "pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions" in the realm of flag burning, signals there will likely be upcoming litigation challenging the 1989 ruling.

The American flag has been desecrated by protesters in recent months, as captured in video footage, most notably during anti-Israel protests that rocked U.S. cities and college campuses under the Biden administration and during Trump administration ICE raids to remove illegal aliens from the nation. 

The order directs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas or other immigration permits and benefits of non-citizens "wherever there has been an appropriate determination that flag desecration by foreign nationals permits the exercise of those remedies under applicable law," according to the fact sheet. 

Anti-Israel protesters were seen lighting the American flag on fire outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 2024, as well as in Washington, D.C., in July 2024 when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress amid the war that has continued since 2023, as well as flag burning in New York City's Washington Square Park over the Fourth of July weekend in 2024 to protest U.S. support of Israel. 

TRUMP VOWS CONSEQUENCES FOR 'ANIMALS' BURNING AMERICAN FLAGS IN LA, SLAMS THOSE WAVING OTHER COUNTRIES' FLAGS

More recently, anti-ICE protesters were seen in June waving Mexican flags on the streets of Los Angeles while burning Old Glory in response to federal law enforcement raiding the city to remove illegal migrants as part of the Trump administration's efforts to secure the U.S. border. 

"This is not just a gesture, this is something we need to make real. We need to take down this empire once and for all," a protester holding a bullhorn in Los Angeles was heard saying as the American flag laid on the ground engulfed in flames, the New York Post reported in June.

Opposition to the flag and the national anthem grew larger in 2020, when a spate of professional athletes kneeled for "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the start of games while sports fans held their hands over their hearts and directed their attention toward the flag. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first sports player to popularize kneeling during the national anthem back in 2016 before it grew in popularity in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter and defund the police protests that swept the nation following the death of George Floyd. 

Trump's expected executive order Monday follows a handful of other presidential actions and initiatives he has launched to restore and promote patriotism, including banning State Department offices nationwide, such as embassies, from flying any other flag than America's. 

The president additionally installed two massive 88-foot-tall American flags on either side of the White House in June as part of a patriotic endeavor that Trump personally funded.

"President Trump personally paid to install two big, beautiful American Flags to wave proudly over the White House for years to come," White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Fox News Digital of the newly installed White House flags back in July. "This is just one of many projects President Trump selflessly paid for to make the White House even more patriotic and beautiful."

Jessica Knurick explains how to counter MAHA when no one trusts experts.

The way Jessica Knurick sees it, the Make America Healthy Again movement won over Americans on social media — and so that's where public health's battle to win back people's hearts and minds must be fought.

Knurick, a dietitian with a PhD, has become one of the faces of a fledgling counter-MAHA movement. She has 1.1 million Instagram followers and 335,000 followers on TikTok. She serves up snappy videos featuring news clips and charts to debunk the latest claims from US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other MAHA leaders. Her voice is playful but authoritative — making her explanations of basic scientific concepts more engaging and hopefully more likely to help people to navigate the sometimes-deranged social media wellness influencer ecosystem.

But before she began creating her own content, she was troubled by the transformation unfolding on social media. A shift was underway and became especially pronounced in the most personal way. She said that in 2019, during her first pregnancy, she recalled misleading and fear-based content for pregnant women being present but hardly overwhelming. But then the pandemic hit and polarized people about public health even more than they had been. When she had her second child in 2022, it seemed like that was the only kind of content she was being shown.

“A lot of people who maybe trusted science before, maybe trusted our institutions, or never even thought about them and went about their lives, they were in their houses on social media, and saw tons and tons of conspiratorial information and health information taken out of context,” Knurick told me in a recent interview. “That started laying the foundation for this anti-science, anti-public health movement we're seeing now.”

The seeds for this transition had been laid over many years. Facebook and Instagram have overhauled their algorithms in ways that elevate fear-based content — and the wellness businesses that used that kind of marketing to target young women, and moms in particular, have thrived.

When Kennedy launched his presidential campaign in 2024, he gave this broad collection of people who feared toxins and chemicals and a corrupt food and medical industry a name: the Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA). Now he is the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump and is remaking federal health policy in his and MAHA's image.

Knurick and other public health experts believe parts of Kennedy's agenda could actually lead to more sickness based on the available evidence; falling vaccination rates, for example, have already led to a historic measles outbreak this year.

But how do you persuade people when appeals to authority aren't effective anymore, because many people reflexively don't trust the experts?

That is Knurick's project.

She is an expert herself and reads the latest research from reputable scholarly journals, as any trained dietitian would. But that is not the focus of her messaging. Instead, she told me that she is trying to figure out how to use the tools of the MAHA movement to argue that, while its concerns about chronic diseases are sincere and well-founded, its explanations for that crisis and its proposed solutions are misplaced. She knows she won't convert everybody, but her Instagram follower count has grown from 150,000 to more than 1 million in the past two years; she says she receives DMs from previous skeptics, another sign that she may be making some inroads in her mission.

I spoke with Knurick about how she goes about the work of trying to counter MAHA on its own turf. Our conversation is below, edited for clarity and length.

A lot of the concerns underlying the MAHA movement are credible, genuine concerns. Among those, which in particular do you take most seriously?

I think what tends to confuse a lot of people when they first come across my content is the fact that I do sound a lot like the people in MAHA on a surface level — because what I always say is they largely get the problem right.

Now, at times they overstate the problem. RFK Jr. will just cite random statistics, like that nearly 50 percent of American children have Type 2 diabetes when it's really less than 1 percent.

But we do have a chronic disease issue in this country, particularly a lifestyle-related chronic disease issue where more than half of American adults are living with at least one chronic condition and nearly 30 percent are managing multiple chronic illnesses. Many of those are among the leading causes of death in the United States.

I think what MAHA has really tapped into is this idea that we do have a food system that prioritizes profit over people's health. We do have a health care system that largely prioritizes profits, as opposed to most health care systems in the world. We pay twice as much as other countries for health care, and we have worse outcomes.

They really tap into this feeling we all have that our systems are set up for us to fail. Our systems are set up for corporate profits and they're leaving us behind.

Which concerns do you not take seriously?

When I saw this movement coming, it was literally my exact area of expertise; exactly what I've been studying. I've been studying chronic disease prevention, how policy impacts our systems that impact our health, for years.

I saw how they were manipulating the narrative. Where I diverge with them is: The issues are largely right, but what they identify as the causes of those issues are largely wrong and misleading.

MAHA really leans into this idea of corruption, right? Regulatory corruption, scientific corruption, over-medicalization. It's all very focused on this idea that you can't trust experts. You can't trust science. You can't trust regulation. When you look at the original MAHA report, what was supposed to be their scientific report about the causes of childhood chronic disease, it really leaned heavy into this conspiratorial corruption narrative.

“People aren't recognizing the conflicts that we're seeing right in front of us when it comes to wellness and MAHA.”

Whereas if you're actually looking at it from a very evidence-based place, that's not what's causing chronic disease. In public health, we look at things like social determinants of health: income inequality or the built environment or education access or health care access. MAHA doesn't even talk about these things, which are very evidence-based causes of chronic disease. You can't really talk about health disparities because of the Trump administration's opposition to DEI.

They really have this strong focus on things like food dyes and seed oils, and, in fact, the evidence is quite the opposite for something like seed oils. Food dyes are a bit more nuanced, but if I make a list of one to 20 things in our food environment that are causing issues, food dyes are going to be quite low on that list. To put all of our emphasis into that and not talk about the actual issues is just disingenuous.

I will give you one example. They talk about the dietary guidelines as being corrupt, right? The dietary guidelines are in bed with these food corporations. RFK Jr. says they put Froot Loops at the top of the food pyramid — not understanding that the top of the food pyramid is what you are supposed to eat sparingly. And even if he didn't make that mistake, they bring up the food pyramid like we still use it. That pyramid has been discontinued since 2005.

The other thing is less than 10 percent of Americans follow the dietary guidelines. But if they did, research suggests that their diet quality would be greatly improved.

So when you're trying to talk about what the problems are with health in America, and you are very disingenuously saying that it's the dietary guidelines because it plays into this idea of corruption — when it's absolutely not the dietary guidelines, and again, if more people followed them, we'd be better off — it just says to me that this is not a genuine movement to improve health.

It's more to play into this idea of corruption so that we don't trust our public health agencies, we don't trust scientists, and they can insert ideology instead of evidence.

Obviously, nevertheless, they have found an audience. Who do you see being the core audience for MAHA? 

RFK Jr. has his core base that's been with him since he was running for president, and over the last couple of decades with his work at the Children's Health Defense. That core base is really based on an anti-vaccine movement.

Then within the broader MAHA coalition, it is more moms. They really play into this MAHA mom and younger women generally. This isn't all of them, but I would say that a good representation of MAHA is moms with young kids who are middle- to upper-class white women. That's a really strong MAHA coalition. They don't necessarily need to think about all of the factors that play into the health of Americans, particularly low-income Americans. But they genuinely want a healthier food environment. They want to see an improvement in health outcomes for the people they know and, for some of them, Americans overall.

Maybe they have never thought through these issues before. I get DMs from people all the time who are like, I have literally never connected the fact that policy impacts the systems and impacts our health. For a lot of them, this is the first time they've ever thought about these issues. I've also seen people say, Well, at least an administration is talking about our health. So obviously, they weren't paying attention during the Obama administration with Michelle Obama's movement, but a lot of them were probably children.

Moms with young kids are a very vulnerable population. I know this because I'm a mom with young kids. We really just want to do what's best for our children. We are very susceptible to fear-based messaging like, You can't trust this in your food. This is going to hurt your kids. I stitched a video a few months ago that started with the question: Are you poisoning your kids?

That messaging really, really triggers us. We're the audience for it. And the MAHA movement does that quite well.

Who do you see as the audience for your own content?

When I started, I just didn't see a voice opposing the misleading narratives that I saw out there. So I was really trying to reach people who were open to hearing another side but just hadn't had that opportunity. They were concerned, just like I've always been concerned, about our food environment, about policies that are impacting our public health institutions or our public health outcomes. But they were being a bit misled by the narrative. They got into the wrong algorithm, and they were seeing the same thing over and over. They just literally hadn't had an opportunity to hear an evidence-based perspective through a public health lens. People who still care about science and evidence, but maybe they just didn't think about these topics before.

I would love to reach people who have already been misled by this movement, who really do care about changing systems, because I think that if we can diagnose the causes correctly, that will give us more momentum to actually make real change.

One of my goals is to never be condescending or talk down to the people in the MAHA movement who have just been caught up by it because they've never thought of these issues. They really genuinely care, but they've just only ever heard the MAHA rhetoric.

I have very little tolerance for the people at the top of this movement who are spreading this misinformation and are making tons of money off of it.

How do you bring in the people who have been misled without alienating them by being sarcastic about RFK Jr. — somebody they like? You can take a very confrontational tone in some of your content. How do you think about that calibration? 

Yeah, it's something that I've given a lot of thought to. I'll tell you that there's a human component in this where I'm just so distraught at seeing what he's doing to our public health agencies and the science, even if I wanted to be kind in my tone to him.

But what you'll see is that I don't disparage him as a person. I talk about what he's doing and how it's detrimental. The people that I will respond to, I don't attack them personally. I go after the misinformation that they're spreading. I try to really stay focused on that.

My approach will turn people off. I'm not going to get everybody because people who love RFK Jr. will come to my page or they'll watch a video and they'll hear my tone towards him, and they won't even listen to the rest. I know that.

But for every person like that, there are people who you know will be like, Oh my gosh, how can she take such a strong stance about him, and then be more inquisitive and listen more. I've had several people send me DMs, somebody literally said this to me the other day: You know, I came to your page as a hater. But I just kept watching, and you kept backing up your claims and you kept explaining things in a way that I understood.

I don't think you're ever going to get everybody, no matter what approach you take.

A lot of your content is dedicated to explaining foundational scientific concepts, like “correlation does not equal causation.” What are some of the concepts people need to be able to really grasp nutrition science — and all kinds of science — and navigate this chaotic information environment that we all exist in?

It's a media literacy thing. These are things that I see in a lot of these misleading videos, and so I try to point them out to people. I'm not going to be able to debunk everything on the internet, right? But if I can teach people what to look for, then they're going to be more savvy viewers and they're going to be able to say to themselves, Hey, that seems a bit out of context, or, Hey, that's probably misleading.

Correlation vs. causation is probably the biggest one. A lot of people will show graphs of two different variables increasing at the same time and use that to imply causation. Identifying that, I think, can be really important.

I have also noticed that you call out some of these financial conflicts of interest that involve MAHA movement leaders, their businesses, and where the movement diverges with consensus science. Why do you think that is important?

We are so critical of conflicts within pharma or food, which we should be, right? That's fair. But the wellness industry completely flies under the radar, and no one questions it. Many leaders in the MAHA movement who are really getting a lot of people to distrust the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory industries and the food industries, have supplement lines or sell a lot of wellness products on their websites.

Calley Means, one of the leaders in the MAHA movement, for example, has a company called TrueMed that allows FSA and HSA dollars to be spent on any number of wellness products or supplements. His sister [US surgeon general nominee Casey Means] has a company that sells continuous glucose monitors. Now we have HHS coming out recommending more research into supplements and wearable technology.

I think it's really important for people to identify that most of the people who are high up in this MAHA movement are financially benefiting from this. We should be just as critical, if not more critical, because the wellness industry is far less regulated than the pharmaceutical industry and the food industry.

There's a disconnect. People aren't recognizing the conflicts that we're seeing right in front of us when it comes to wellness and MAHA.

            Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted interest rate cuts could be coming soon in a speech on Friday, a move that could affect everyone from global markets to individual Americans.
    


            Powell underscored that any upcoming rate cut would be dependent on the economic data. But Fed watchers took his comments to mean the central bank's monetary policy committee may decide to lower them at its next meeting, in mid-September.
    


            “While a September rate cut is highly probable, it is not a done deal,” cautioned Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
    


            Investors nonetheless welcomed the prospect of a rate cut, sending the Dow soaring 800 points on Friday to close at a record high.
    


            Whenever the Fed does cut interest rates, here's how it could affect your financial life.
    


            When the Fed cuts its key overnight lending rate, lower rates on bank savings and loans tend to follow. But they may even start slipping a little in advance of any decision on your savings.
    


            “Savings rates and CD rates will start to slide, and that will pick up speed as we get closer to the actual resumption of rate cuts,” McBride said.
    


            Whatever happens with rates, one thing likely won't change: You're still likely to get the highest interest rates on your savings if you put your money in a high-yield savings account from an FDIC-insured online bank, which has to compete for deposits more fiercely than behemoths like Chase or Bank of America.
    


Jerome Powell hints long-awaited rate cuts are coming soon — the first during Trump's term



            If you already have money in a CD at a good rate, that rate won't change, and you'll get the interest you signed up for. If you locked in a really high rate already and the CD is “callable,” it's possible the bank may decide to recall it. If so, it will return your principal to you and whatever interest you're owed to date.
    


            Any loan you've already taken out with a fixed rate won't change. Any new loan you're seeking will likely have a lower rate than you would have seen if the Fed hadn't cut.
    


            However, unlike the anticipatory rate declines on the interest a bank has to pay you on savings, you're not likely to see banks drop the interest rates you have to pay them before they have to.
    


            When it is to the advantage of the lender, rates may be slower to move lower than consumers would like,” said Bobbi Rebell, a certified financial planner at CardRates.com.
    


            Take new personal loans. “They tend to lag Fed rate cut changes to the downside,” Rebell noted. But, she added, as in any rate environment, “the stronger your credit, the more you are likely to see a better loan rate, because you are a more desirable consumer for the lender.”
    


            Your credit card issuer will lower your variable rate, mimicking whatever rate cut the Fed makes, though there could be up to a three-month lag, McBride said.
    


            But don't expect to save a ton of money if and when it happens.
    


            Why? Credit card rates are crazy high – the average is still 20.13%, per Bankrate. So a quarter to a half a percentage point cut won't do too much for you if you carry a balance from month to month.
    


Make your money work for you by ‘laddering' bonds or CDs



            “The Fed has to cut rates a lot before it has a measurable impact on households. Remember, the Fed cut rates a full percentage point last year — and the average credit card rate is still over 20%,” McBride said.
    


            In fact, you might have better luck just asking your card issuer for a lower rate. A Lending Tree report last year found that about three-quarters of card holders who asked for a lower rate were successful — by an average of 6.5 percentage points.
    


            Your best bet, as always, is to keep trying to pay your principal down.
    


            If you're shopping for a home or looking to refinance your mortgage, it's not clear how influential a Fed rate cut will be on its own.
    


            Mortgage rates are not tied directly to Fed moves, but rather to moves in the yield of the 10-year US Treasury note. And that yield is influenced by a host of economic expectations.
    


            “Inflation, debt and deficits have kept mortgage rates elevated and will likely limit the extent that mortgage rates come down,” McBride said. “Unless the economy starts to keel over, we probably won't see mortgage rates moving sustainably below 6%. Not for a while.”

            A federal judge said Monday that she will order officials to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia in the United States while she weighs a new legal challenge from him over the Trump administration's plans to quickly deport him to Uganda.
    


            US District Judge Paula Xinis said during a brief hearing Monday afternoon that she's planning to stretch out an existing hold on Abrego Garcia's removal so she can more fully consider whether officials are violating his due process rights, including by deporting him to Uganda even after he said he fears being persecuted or tortured in the African nation.
    


            Minutes after Abrego Garcia was taken into custody by immigration officials in Baltimore on Monday, his attorneys filed a new lawsuit urging Xinis to order his release and slow down his removal process so he can have a chance to challenge his potential deportation to Uganda.
    


            Abrego Garcia is currently being held at a detention facility in Virginia, his attorney said.
    


            Under that new order, the judge said, the government will be “absolutely forbidden to remove Abrego Garcia from the continental United States.” Xinis said she was also worried that sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda would result in an “end run” around a court order barring him from again being sent to El Salvador.
    


            It's unclear how long the new pause will last, but it's likely to remain in effect through at least later this week. The judge has said she wants to receive more written legal arguments from the Justice Department and Abrego Garcia's attorneys. She's also planning to hold an evidentiary hearing with witnesses in coming days.
    


            Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after turning himself in to a facility in Baltimore.
    


            “Regardless of what happens today in my ICE check-in, promise me this,” Abrego Garcia said at a rally with members of his family, immigration activists and community leaders before reporting to the ICE facility on Monday. “Promise me that you will continue to pray, continue to fight, resist and love, not just for me, but for everybody.”
    


            The Trump administration has warned it could send Abrego Garcia to Uganda as soon as this week. Abrego Garcia returned home at the end of last week from Tennessee, where he was being held pending trial in a federal human smuggling case.
    


            Abrego Garcia argues he is being threatened with deportation to Uganda as punishment for his decision to challenge his unlawful removal to El Salvador in March, as well as his decision to go to trial in a human smuggling case brought against him in Tennessee.
    


            His attorneys provided Xinis, an appointee of President Barack Obama, with a copy of notices Abrego Garcia sent over the weekend to immigration officials that said he has a fear of being sent to Uganda and that he preferred to be sent to Costa Rica, a country that has said it would be willing to give him some form of legal status should he be sent there.
    


            “I fear persecution in Uganda on account of my race, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group. I also fear torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official in that country,” Abrego Garcia wrote in the notice sent Saturday.
    


            “Finally, I fear that country will refoul me (re-deport me) to El Salvador, where I also fear persecution on account of the above-mentioned protected grounds and torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official, and where I have been tortured in the past,” he wrote.
    


            That deal also seemed to strike Xinis as being legally dubious.
    


            “You can't condition the relinquishment of constitutional rights in that regard,” she said during Monday's hearing.
    


Abrego Garcia's lawyers urge judge to drop his criminal case, alleging ‘vindictive and selective prosecution'



            Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, the chief of organizing and leadership at CASA, the group behind the rally outside the ICE facility on Monday, argued that Abrego Garcia is being made a “martyr for having the courage to stand up to this administration's illegal deportation practices.”
    


            “They're throwing the entire federal apparatus at one father of three to prove that no one should dare challenge their authority,” she continued in a statement.
    


            The Trump administration brought Abrego Garcia back to the US in June to face the federal charges after sending him in mid-March to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, in violation of a 2019 court order that prohibited his removal to the Central American country.
    


            Activists joining Abrego Garcia on Monday morning accuse the Trump administration of “retaliating” against him for fighting against his deportation and trying to exercise his constitutional rights.
    


            “The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him,” his lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said.
    


            Abrego Garcia's lawyers also argued in court papers Saturday that offers by the administration to eventually deport him to Costa Rica in exchange for his guilty plea were evidence of the government's effort to punish him for challenging his wrongful deportation. They told the judge in his criminal case that their client had until Monday morning “to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
    


            But Abrego Garcia did not take the deal offered to him by the Trump administration that would have seen him eventually deported to Costa Rica, a person familiar with the case told CNN.
    


            Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen said he spoke to Abrego Garcia on Sunday for the first time since they met in El Salvador in April. The Democratic senator said he told the father of three and his wife that “we will stay in this fight for justice and due process.”
    


            “If his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are at risk,” Van Hollen wrote in a statement posted on X.
    


            Before reporting to the ICE facility, Abrego Garcia said memories of his family sustained him during his detention.
    


            “When I was detained, I remembered memories with my family: going to the park with them, going to the trampoline with my children,” he said. “Those moments will continue to give me hope to continue in this fight.”

Vice President JD Vance said Russian President Vladimir Putin will not install a “puppet regime” in Ukraine after the war between Russia and Ukraine has concluded.

The vice president made the remarks in an interview on Sunday with Kristen Welker on NBC News's Meet the Press while discussing the aftermath of President Donald Trump's meeting and subsequent communications with Putin. Vance also praised Trump's “energetic diplomacy” while pursuing peace negotiations to end the conflict. 

Vance said Russia was prepared to make some concessions in peace negotiations, but not everything, as of yet. He stressed that there was still work and a long way to go.

“But what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war,” Vance said. “They've recognized that they're not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning.” 

“And importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he added. “Again, have they made every concession? Of course, they haven't. Should they have started the war? Of course, they haven't. But we're making progress, Kristen.”

Vance then pivoted to praise for Trump, highlighting that the president was more focused on getting a peace deal established to stop the killing, instead of harping on the causes of the war or what transpired over the last 3 1/2 years, including failures by the Biden administration to try to arrange a peace deal.

“And what … I admire about the president in this moment is he's not asking 3 1/2 years ago,” Vance said. “He's not, you know, trying to focus on every nitpicky detail of how this thing started 3 1/2 years ago. He's trying to focus on the nitpicky details of now, of what do the parties disagree on? What do they agree on? And how do you build a foundation from one side of that ledger to the other so that you can stop the killing?”

Vance also acknowledged that Russia has done “a lot of things” that the United States did not support or “like,” including the strike against an American electronics manufacturer in Ukraine. 

“I don't like it, Kristen,” Vance said. “But this is a war. And this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don't like. A lot of civilians have died. We've condemned that stuff from the get-go. And frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 1/2 years when he did nothing but talk, but do nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I'm enraged by. What I'm enraged by is the continuation of the war. What I'm enraged by is a presidency in Joe Biden who, for three years, did nothing to end the killing.”

He then praised Trump's diplomatic efforts and said that such initiatives were a legitimate attempt to end the war and establish a peace deal. He cited the Trump administration's “energetic diplomacy.”

“What I'm actually excited about right now is that we have a president who's engaging in energetic diplomacy to try to stop the killing,” Vance said. “That's as it should be. I think the American people should be proud of it. And whatever the outcome of this, whether the war ends in three months or six months or hopefully not beyond, but maybe, we should be proud that we have a president who's trying to stop the killing.”

“He's done it, by the way, six wars that the president has brought to a close all over the world,” Vance emphasized. “This would be the seventh. It's the most complicated, but we're trying despite that.”

            America's next big showdown is brewing over Donald Trump's zeal to impose unusual presidential power as he eyes big, Democratic-run cities to expand a crime crackdown that sent troops flocking onto the streets of Washington, DC.
    


            Trump's torrid rhetoric claiming that crime is out of control, which is often misleading, is a classic page from the playbook of strongman leaders. It could precipitate high tensions between the federal government and states over the limits of his constitutional and legal authority.
    


            The president's threats prompted alarmed Democrats on Sunday to warn that there would be no justification for him to dispatch troops to a city such as Chicago over local opposition.
    


            “We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            On Friday, Trump told reporters that “Chicago will be our next” target while he would “help” New York after that. Trump last week also name-checked Baltimore and Oakland, California, where he argued crime is “very bad.”
    


            CNN reported Saturday that the Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, according to two officials. It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.
    


            Trump on Sunday lashed out at Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a potential Democratic presidential hopeful in 2028, who had suggested the president walk with him through Baltimore to view local attempts to stem violent crime. The president slammed the city as “out of control (and) crime ridden” and said he wouldn't go there until the “Crime Disaster” was cleaned up.
    


            Trump's critics argue his deployment of National Guard forces in the US capital and in Los Angeles in response to demonstrations earlier this year against his immigration policies are prototype operations for wider national crackdowns.
    


            But the president has smaller legal leeway to surge federal troops into cities and to dictate law enforcement policies in the states than in Washington, a federal district.
    


            Sending troops or dedicating federal agents to police work into a major city such as Chicago or Baltimore against the will of Democratic state and city officials would create a new test of the presidential powers Trump incessantly seeks to expand and would threaten state sovereignty — which Republicans have historically sought to preserve.
    


            Declaring yet another national emergency to federalize National Guard reserve troops normally commanded by a state governor would trigger legal showdowns over Trump's preferred method of unlocking new and questionable executive authority. He suggested last week he might declare a national emergency in Washington, to get around a 30-day limit on troop deployments.
    


            A crackdown in a place like Chicago would also offer Trump the chance to ramp up his mass deportation effort with a surge force at a time when it is increasingly appearing that this is his key goal in Washington. A CNN analysis of government data found that in the first week after the administration took control of the capital's police force and deployed federal agents and troops on the streets, there was a moderate dip in reported crime while arrests of immigrants were up tenfold from typical ICE arrest tallies.
    


            Choosing a big, Democratic city would also allow Trump to choreograph a new political extravaganza in a performative presidency built on televised spectacles from summits to bill signings and dealmaking. The substance often lags the political symbolism.
    


            The risk would be that such moves could disrupt chains of command between local elected officials and police chiefs and upset community policing initiatives designed to stem violent crime. And it would reinforce a growing impression that Trump is seeking to normalize the anomalous use of soldiers in domestic settings to purse his political priorities.
    


            As was the case in Washington, a Chicago crackdown would give Trump another opening to impose his conservative power and autocratic tendencies on a population that voted overwhelmingly for his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.
    


            And it would enable him to put Democrats in a political vise, forcing them to walk a tightrope between rejecting federal takeovers and his hardline tactics while risking alienating voters who are concerned about violent crime and the impact of past lax border policies.
    


            Then there is the question of paying for all this.
    


            Trump's growing zeal for using federal troops and agents will sooner or later raise the question of resources. Prolonged National Guard deployments are expensive. Redeploying federal agents from other duties could affect the FBI's ability to target transnational crime or anti-terrorism investigations. The resource issue raises questions about the administration's capacity to enact long-term reductions in crime since open-ended deployments are unsustainable.
    


            Trump's warnings about supposedly lawless inner cities do not necessarily reflect the true picture of public order. For example, crime in Washington fell in 2024, and again so far this year. In Chicago, the police said Friday that homicides were down 31% this year, and shootings fell 36%. Still, that doesn't mean people who live in big cities feel safe. Many would welcome seeing more police on the streets, and cities and states have been calling on the federal government for more partnerships and resources — but balk at Trump's imposed solutions.
    


            The president's dystopian descriptions increasingly resemble an attempt to create a rhetorical crime emergency that he could then use to justify draconian methods that satisfy his desire to look strong and his attempts to push up deportations.
    


            Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, “I think everybody should take a step back and realize that, as a commander in chief over his two terms, he's only deployed and put boots on the ground in American cities, never overseas. And just think about what that means as a country.”
    


            Emanuel, a CNN senior political and global affairs commentator, suggested that Trump's true purpose was to redouble immigration enforcement in cities — like Chicago — that do not cooperate with federal authorities in crackdowns against undocumented migrants. “This will not be about fighting crime,” he said.
    


            And Emanuel, a former senior member of Democratic House leadership, White House chief of staff and ambassador to Japan, offered some advice for his party, which has sometimes struggled to connect with voters on crime. “We have a strategy for fighting crime: more police on the beat and getting kids, gangs and guns off the street.”
    


            Jeffries, from New York, said on “State of the Union” that Democrats, like all Americans, want safer communities, but opposed Trump's power grabs. “We should make sure that the flood of guns into these communities is cut off. We should make sure that we're dealing with the mental health crisis that exists all across the United States of America, and, by the way, which Donald Trump is exacerbating by cutting funds to actually help people who are dealing with emotional distress.”
    


            Democratic local leaders are trying to discredit the president's claim that crime is so out of control in cities as to merit such a crackdown.
    


            On Saturday, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, issued a statement pointing out that his state had received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking whether it needs help, after Trump named Chicago as a future venue for his surge of military and federal personnel. “There is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the Illinois National Guard, deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active-duty military within our own borders,” he said.
    


            And Pritzker signaled that he'd do everything he could to push back against outside, federal power. “We will continue to follow the law, stand up for the sovereignty of our state, and protect the people of Illinois,” he said.
    


            On Sunday, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN's Isabel Rosales that his office sought to work with federal entities including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Secret Service. He said those agencies were trained to combat crime, while the National Guard is not.
    


            Trump is “operating as a dictator,” Raoul said. “Turning the military against these American citizens in cities on American land is unprecedented.”

Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) claimed on Sunday that mortgage fraud is President Donald Trump‘s “new weapon” as a Department of Justice investigation into the California senator is already well underway.

Since early August, Trump's special attorney Ed Martin has been leading the investigation into Schiff over allegations that he listed more than one property as his primary residence and falsified “bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms” on one of the properties. Schiff has consistently denied wrongdoing but has recently created a legal defense fund as a legal war over the matter looms.

In an appearance on NBC News's Meet the Press on Sunday, Schiff trashed the investigation as manufactured, claiming Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who sent the criminal referral to the DOJ in May, “knows it” and is merely doing Trump's “bidding.”

“He's essentially doing the president's bidding against me, against Letitia James, against this person on the Federal Reserve. Mortgage is their new weapon to go after their critics,” Schiff said. “The common denominator is they will manufacture anything to go after their critics, after members of Congress, to try to silence them, after John Bolton, after people in the Federal Reserve, after generals, after former presidents. They're investigating Comey and Clapper, the Obamas, the Clintons. Basically, it's free rein with a corrupt leadership at the Justice Department.”

Pulte responded to Schiff's latest comments earlier Sunday, vowing not to back down from the investigation.

“Fraud is bad, no matter who does it. I will not be intimidated,” he posted on X.

TRUMP SAYS HE WILL FIRE FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK OVER MORTGAGE FRAUD ALLEGATIONS

Schiff's latest remarks on the investigation come as the DOJ is looking into other high-profile officials over alleged mortgage fraud.

Those include New York Attorney General Letitia James and, most recently, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, whom Trump said he will fire if she doesn't resign.

An online petition is seeking “fair sentencing” for an illegal immigrant accused of causing a fatal highway crash in Florida, saying the charges against him don't align with “the circumstances of the incident.”

On Aug. 12, Harjinder Singh, a truck driver, made an illegal U-turn in a semi-truck on Florida's Turnpike, killing three people in an oncoming minivan. After the crash, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an investigation into it, and Singh was most recently denied bond, with a Florida judge ruling that he constitutes a substantial flight risk. He is currently in custody on state vehicular homicide charges and immigration violations.

The petition in support of Singh, directed to Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and the Florida Board of Executive Clemency, claims the three deaths in the crash were “a tragic accident – not a deliberate act.” The petition also requests a “reasonable” sentence recognizing it was an accident, as well as parole eligibility “after a fair portion of the sentence has been served.”

“By granting clemency, you would reaffirm the value of proportional justice, the power of community advocacy, and the potential for rehabilitation. We believe this case is not just about one individual — it speaks to the broader principles of fairness and mercy in the justice system,” the petition says.

As of Sunday evening, the petition has nearly 2.5 million signatures.

In the wake of the car crash, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he is pausing worker visas for commercial truck drivers. 

The Department of Transportation found that Singh failed the English language proficiency assessment, answering 2 out of 12 verbal questions correctly and identifying one of four highway signs during a compliance investigation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

President Donald Trump said Monday that the Department of Justice will sue California over Gov. Gavin Newsom's efforts to draw a new, Democratic-leaning congressional map.

The redistricting push in California was ignited by a similar effort underway in Texas to gerrymander key House districts to more heavily favor Republicans.

"I think I'm going to be filing a lawsuit pretty soon, and I think we're going to be very successful in it," Trump said of Newsom's redistricting push during a lengthy press event in the Oval Office.

"We're going to be filing it through the Department of Justice. That's going to happen," he said.

Newsom promptly responded on social media: "BRING IT."

Trump's announcement that the government intends to challenge the California plan came just days after he praised Texas Republican legislators' efforts to codify a new map that would give the GOP an advantage in five more U.S. House races in the 2026 midterm elections.

That map passed the Texas state Senate early Saturday morning, sending it to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk to be signed into law.

"The incredible people of Texas will have the opportunity to elect five more Republicans to Congress, thanks to the passage of their much more fair new Map — A BIG WIN for Republicans in Texas, and across the Country!" Trump wrote Thursday, after the map had passed in the state House.

Trump previously told CNBC that the GOP was "entitled to five more seats" in Texas.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's remarks.

House redistricting efforts typically take place every 10 years, after each new U.S. Census reveals changes in population distribution. But the Texas redistricting plan is taking place in the middle of the decade, drawing intense criticism from Democrats across the country.

Newsom, who is widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, has led the charge for the Democratic Party by advocating for California to redraw its own congressional map, to serve as a counterweight to Texas.

Newsom last week signed two redistricting bills, setting up a special election in November on whether to finalize the new California congressional map.

Trump pressured Texas Republicans to push for that state's redistricting, underscoring how crucial the president believes it is for Republicans to maintain control of both chambers of Congress.

But Trump already faces headwinds: His approval ratings are declining, according to numerous polls, and the incumbent president's party tends to lose seats in the midterms.

Warren Buffett is not in the market to buy another railroad but he did meet with the CEO of CSX and discuss greater cooperation, he told CNBC's Becky Quick on Monday.

Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Buffett and CEO designate Greg Abel met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs in Omaha on Aug. 3 in his office alone without any advisors present. They made clear to Hinrichs that they would not make a bid for CSX, but believed they could cooperate more and gain some of the same benefits from combining the two companies.

CSX shares fell more than 5% on the news. Buffett's comments come after Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF and CSX announced a partnership to provide new coast-to-coast rail services on Friday.

President Donald Trump cast doubt Monday on the United States' ability to do business with South Korea, hours before hosting the key trade partner's new leader at the White House for an in-person summit.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June following a snap election, is expected to discuss investment details in the nations' trade agreement and a shipbuilding deal during his visit.

But just before Lee's arrival at the White House, Trump painted South Korea as a nation in turmoil, saying on social media that the country appears to be experiencing a "purge" or a "revolution."

"WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA?" he wrote in the all-caps post on his social media platform.

"We can't have that and do business there," he continued.

When asked about his post later on Monday, Trump said that he heard there were raids on churches in South Korea in recent days and that the government "even went into our military base and got information."

"They probably shouldn't have done that," he said during an executive order signing event in the Oval Office, before his meeting with the South Korean president.

"But I heard bad things, I don't know if it's true or not, I'll be finding out," he continued.

News reports show that investigators have conducted searches at churches and the Osan Air Base as part of its probe into South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, on corruption charges.

South Korea's presidential office, for its part, said that it was "checking [the] the situation" after Trump's remarks, according to the Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency.

Trump's surprise comments could foreshadow a frostier negotiation than what South Korean leaders had wanted.

Coming just months after Lee took office, the Trump meeting is a pivotal foreign policy test for the newly elected president.

The two nations reached a trade deal that capped tariffs on South Korea's exports to the U.S. at 15%.

That tariff rate was lower than the 25% rate that Trump had previously threatened.

But he also said at the time that South Korea "will give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President."

Since then, questions have emerged over the investment pledge and how it would be structured.

The investment is expected to be a key point of negotiations between the two leaders on Monday.

One other point of discussion likely to be front and center at the meeting is a deal to boost U.S. shipbuilding in South Korea.

South Korean officials have announced a $150 billion proposal, which they've dubbed "Make America Shipbuilding Great Again," seeking to revive U.S. shipbuilding.

The offer came as part of the two countries' trade negotiations.

Another topic likely to be discussed is the future of the more than 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.

Trump wants South Korea to take on more responsibility in its defense efforts so that the U.S. troops can focus on China, but South Korea worries that doing so could leave the country more vulnerable to threats from North Korea.

This is a developing story and will be updated.

President Donald Trump said Monday that the United States is with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, "100%," during the leaders' high-stakes meeting just weeks after the two countries reached an 11th hour trade deal.

The bilateral touched on boosting the shipbuilding industry — with Trump saying that the U.S. will buy ships from South Korea — as well as national security and trade.

Lee, who took office in June following a snap election, began his summit with Trump by praising the appearance of the Oval Office as "bright and beautiful," foreshadowing what would be a largely amicable first meeting between the two leaders.

Just months after Lee took office, his meeting with Trump was a pivotal foreign policy test for the newly elected president.

Trump's praise of the new South Korean president came just hours after he painted South Korea as a nation in turmoil, saying on social media that the country appears to be experiencing a "purge" or a "revolution."

Trump appeared to be referring to news reports showing that investigators have conducted searches at churches and the Osan Air Base as part of a probe into South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, on corruption charges.

"It didn't sound to me like South Korea," Trump said during the meeting.

Diplomacy loomed large over the meeting, and Lee asked for Trump's role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula, even suggesting the creation of a Trump Tower in North Korea.

Trump touted his "great relationship" with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, and said he "looks forward to meeting with" him again.

"We can do big progress with North Korea," Trump also said.

While Trump and the South Korean president touted their shipbuilding agreement, the meeting took place against the backdrop of questions about trade between the two nations.

The two nations reached a trade deal last month that capped tariffs on South Korea's exports to the U.S. at 15%.

That tariff rate was lower than the 25% rate that Trump had previously threatened.

But Trump suggested Monday that he is open to holding continued conversations with South Korea, but he appeared unlikely to budge on the tariff rate.

"I hear they want to renegotiate the deal, but that's OK, I don't mind that," Trump said at the beginning of the meeting.

"That doesn't mean they're going to get anything, but I don't mind," he continued.

Trump also said when he announced the deal that South Korea "will give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President."

Since then, questions have emerged over the investment pledge and how it would be structured.

Elon Musk's xAI sued Apple and OpenAI on Monday, accusing the pair of an "anticompetitive scheme" to thwart artificial intelligence rivals.

The lawsuit, filed by Musk's AI startup xAI and its social network business X, alleges Apple and OpenAI have "colluded" to maintain monopolies in the smartphone and generative AI markets.

Musk's xAI acquired X in March in an all-stock transaction.

It accuses Apple of deprioritizing so-called super apps and generative AI chatbot competitors, such as xAI's Grok, in its App Store rankings, while favoring OpenAI by integrating its ChatGPT chatbot into Apple products.

"In a desperate bid to protect its smartphone monopoly, Apple has joined forces with the company that most benefits from inhibiting competition and innovation in AI: OpenAI, a monopolist in the market for generative AI chatbots," according to the complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

An OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement, "This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment."

Representatives from Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Tesla CEO launched xAI in 2023 in a bid to compete with OpenAI and other leading chatbot makers.

Musk earlier this month threatened to sue Apple for "an unequivocal antitrust violation," saying in a post on X that the company "is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store."

After Musk threatened to sue Apple, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded, "This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like."

An Apple spokesperson previously said that its App Store was designed to be "fair and free of bias," and that the company features "thousands of apps" using a variety of signals.

Apple last year partnered with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iPhone, iPad, Mac laptop and desktop products.

Several users replied to Musk's post on X via its Community Notes feature saying that rival chatbot apps such as DeepSeek and Perplexity were ranked No. 1 on the App Store after Apple and OpenAI announced their partnership.

The lawsuit is the latest twist in an ongoing clash between Musk and Altman. Musk co-founded OpenAI alongside Altman in 2015, before leaving the startup in 2018 due to disagreements over OpenAI's direction.

Musk sued OpenAI and Altman last year, accusing them of breach of contract by putting commercial interests ahead of its original mission to develop AI "for the benefit of humanity broadly."

In a counterclaim, OpenAI has alleged that Musk and xAI engaged in "harassment" through litigation, attacks on social media and in the press, and through a "sham bid" to buy the ChatGPT-maker for $97.4 billion designed to harm the company's business relationships.

Nvidia announced Monday that its latest robotics chip module, the Jetson AGX Thor, is now on sale for $3,499 as a developer kit.

The company calls the chip a "robot brain." The first kits ship next month, Nvidia said last week, and the chips will allow customers to create robots.

After a company uses the developer kit to prototype their robot, Nvidia will sell Thor T5000 modules that can be installed in production-ready robots. If a company needs more than 1,000 Thor chips, Nvidia will charge $2,999 per module.

CEO Jensen Huang has said robotics is the company's largest growth opportunity outside of artificial intelligence, which has led to Nvidia's overall sales more than tripling in the past two years.

"We do not build robots, we do not build cars, but we enable the whole industry with our infrastructure computers and the associated software," said Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president of robotics and edge AI, on a call with reporters Friday.

The Jetson Thor chips are based on a Blackwell graphics processor, which is Nvidia's current generation of technology used in its AI chips, as well as its chips for computer games.

Nvidia said that its Jetson Thor chips are 7.5 times faster than its previous generation. That allows them to run generative AI models, including large language models and visual models that can interpret the world around them, which is essential for humanoid robots, Nvidia said. The Jetson Thor chips are equipped with 128GB of memory, which is essential for big AI models.

Companies including Agility Robotics, Amazon, Meta and Boston Dynamics are using its Jetson chips, Nvidia said. Nvidia has also invested in robotics companies such as Field AI.

However, robotics remains a small business for Nvidia, accounting for about 1% of the company's total revenue, despite the fact that it has launched several new robot chips since 2014. But it's growing fast.

Nvidia recently combined its business units to group its automotive and robotics divisions into the same line item. That unit reported $567 million in quarterly sales in May, which represented a 72% increase on an annual basis.

The company said its Jetson Thor chips can be used for self-driving cars as well, especially from Chinese brands. Nvidia calls its car chips Drive AGX, and while they are similar to its robotics chips, they run an operating system called Drive OS that's been tuned for automotive purposes.

WATCH: Nvidia's China risks loom large ahead of earnings

Intel on Monday warned of "adverse reactions" from investors, employees and others to the Trump administration taking a 10% stake in the company, in a filing citing risks involved with the deal.

A key concern area is international sales, with 76% of Intel's revenue in its last fiscal year coming from outside the U.S., according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company had $53.1 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024, down 2% from the year prior.

For Intel's international customers, the company is now directly tied to President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariff and trade policies.

"There could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors," the company wrote in the filing. "There may also be litigation related to the transaction or otherwise and increased public or political scrutiny with respect to the Company."

Intel also said that the potential for a changing political landscape in Washington could challenge or void the deal and create risks to current and future shareholders.

The deal, which was announced Friday, gives the Department of Commerce up to 433.3 million shares of the company, which is dilutive to existing shareholders. The purchase of shares is being funded largely by money already awarded to Intel under President Joe Biden's CHIPS Act.

Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the program and is set for another $5.7 billion. A separate federal program awarded $3.2 billion, for a total of $11.1 billion, according to a release.

Trump called the agreement "a great Deal for America" and said the building of advanced chips "is fundamental to the future of our Nation." 

Shares of Intel rallied as momentum built toward a deal in August, with the stock up about 25% for the month so far.

The agreement requires the government to vote with Intel's board of directors. In the Monday filing, the company noted that the government stake "reduces the voting and other governance rights of stockholders and may limit potential future transactions that may be beneficial to stockholders."

However, the filing notes that Commerce may vote its shares against any move that might unwind the deal or otherwise reject the government's stake in Intel.

Furthermore, the company acknowledged in the filing that it has not completed an analysis of all "financial, tax and accounting implications."

Intel's tumultuous fiscal 2024 included the exit of CEO Pat Gelsinger in December after a four-year tenure during which the stock price tanked and the company lost ground to rivals in the artificial intelligence boom.

CEO Lip-Bu Tan took the helm in March.

Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary revealed on CNBC on Monday that he was one of three buyers to snap up the record-breaking Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan sports card at auction over the weekend.

The card, a signed collectible featuring both NBA legends, sold for nearly $13 million, surpassing the previous record for the most-expensive trading card sold at auction, a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle #311, which went for $12.6 million in August 2022, according to auction house Heritage, which sold both cards.

As of the completion of the Bryant-Jordan sale, the buyers remained anonymous. O'Leary told CNBC he bought the card along with two other investors, Matt Allen and Paul Warshaw, to form a syndicate and avoid competing.

"We bought it together, yes we did," O'Leary said on "Squawk Box" on Monday, adding the three got together on a 3 a.m. Zoom call to buy the card. "I'm very proud to own it."

Sports collectibles have been gaining steam in recent years, with notable jerseys and even personal watches of athletes coming up on the block and fetching millions. The Bryant-Jordan card featured the NBA uniform logos and signatures of both players and came up for sale on the late Bryant's birthday.

O'Leary said he doesn't believe the card will come to the market again in his lifetime.

"It's going to be a part of an index that I'm going to continue to grow along with my partners," he said. "We look at it no different than our bitcoin holdings, our ethereum holdings, our gold holdings."

He added that he doesn't believe sports card trading is only driven by the growing 1% of wealth, like art trading might be, saying that it is getting "institutional in nature."

"It's no different than collectible watches, in some way," he said. "It's so rare that the prices continue to appreciate, and they seem to defy recessions."

O'Leary said he's been looking into owning this asset class for a few years and that he's adding Saturday's card to a host of other basketball cards he already owns.

With the rise of remote work, few employees truly need to be present in their offices for eight hours a day — and it's time for companies to adjust their workplace norms accordingly, says Anessa Fike, founder and CEO of fractional HR consulting firm Fike+ Co and author of "The Revolution of Work."

According to Fike, the standard schedule of working in-office from 9 to 5 is "really archaic."

"We've seen so many changes in every other area of our lives, yet we are still doing the same thing that our parents and some of our grandparents did in the workplace," she says.

The traditional work model can make it difficult and stressful for employees to juggle their other responsibilities: Fike points out that the 9-to-5 schedule doesn't line up with school hours, which makes it challenging for parents to coordinate child care.

"We cannot sustain this working environment with so many people burned out and disengaged," she says.

The Covid-19 pandemic marked a turning point in the workplace, Fike says. After getting a taste of remote or hybrid work during the pandemic, many workers are pushing back against strict schedules and return-to-office mandates.

"I think we are collectively just super tired of being told what to do as humans," Fike says.

There are several reasons that companies may be reluctant to relax their hours and location requirements, Fike says.

In Fike's view, recouping office space costs is a significant factor in RTO mandates: "Lots of people who own real estate want to make money. That's why it's a big push, 100%."

RTO mandates can also be a "control mechanism" for bosses who don't know how to effectively manage their teams without seeing them in-person, she says.

"I think managers and leaders get lazy," Fike says. "They can get creative with a lot of these things; they just don't want to. You hear 'it's hard' a lot, or 'that wouldn't work for us.' What that means to me is 'I just don't feel like figuring it out.'"

Lack of flexibility is a major motivation for employees seek other jobs or leave the workplace altogether in favor of freelance or contract work, Fike says.

"They're really just fed up with someone telling them where and when they can work, and where and when they can have lunch," she says. "We're adults. Do we really want to be told this?"

The key to a successful workplace is "asking people what they need," Fike says.

Many Gen Z employees prioritize coming into the office so that they can learn from their peers. On the other hand, there are plenty of workers "who never want to go to an office again – and that's OK, too," she says.

Not everyone feels most productive between the hours of 9 and 5, Fike says.

"There's so many different ways that our brains work, and yet we want to pigeonhole every single human being that's nuanced and complicated into the exact same way of working — and then we wonder why it doesn't work."

Fike says that she didn't figure out her prime productivity hours until she stopped working in a corporate setting.

"If we could actually help people discover those things in their early 20s, as opposed to their late 30s or early 40s, which is where most people actually discover that, imagine what we could do in productivity in that time," she says.

One successful strategy that she's seen companies implement is setting 'core hours': employees are largely allowed to make their own schedules, but they are asked to be reasonably available during a certain time frame every day.

"I always encourage businesses to just talk to people, set up various ways of working, and try things in in the workplace," Fike says.

President Donald Trump on Monday boasted about the government's new stake in Intel and said he's determined to do similar deals.

"I will make deals like that for our Country all day long," the president posted on Truth Social.

Trump added that "stupid people" are upset with a move that he said will bring more money and jobs to the U.S.

"I will also help those companies that make such lucrative deals with the United States. ... I love seeing their stock price go up, making the USA RICHER, AND RICHER," he said. "More jobs for America!!! Who would not want to make deals like that?"

Earlier in the morning, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said the Intel move is part of a broader strategy to create a sovereign wealth fund that could include more companies.

In a deal that marked a further incursion of federal involvement with private companies, the White House on Friday announced that it was taking a 10% share of the chipmaking giant. The stake is worth around $8.9 billion, some of which will come from grant funding associated with the CHIPS Act while the rest will be under separate government allocations for programs associated with making secure chips.

While stressing that the government won't involve itself in company operations, Hassett said the move is part of an ongoing plan.

"Well, I think this is a very, very special circumstance because of the massive amount of CHIPS Act spending that was coming in," Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "But the president has made it clear all the way back to the campaign, he thinks that in the end, it would be great if the U.S. could start to build up a sovereign wealth fund. So I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries."

Trump signed an executive order in early February to start a sovereign wealth fund, a mechanism primarily used by smaller countries with vast natural resources that are used as funding backstops for transactions. Norway leads the world in such funds with some $1.8 trillion in assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. China is next, and multiple Middle East nations also have large funds.

Though the U.S. government taking large positions in corporations is unusual it is not unheard of, said Hassett, citing the stakes in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac following the financial crisis.

"We're absolutely not in the business of picking winners and losers," he said. "But this is not a thing that is unprecedented."

Hassett added that the move is part of the administration's strategy that includes tariffs to encourage more companies to onshore their production.

When Elon Musk created his artificial intelligence startup xAI in 2023, he incorporated it as a Nevada public benefit corporation, making a formal commitment to positively impact society and to post regular disclosures about progress on its non-financial goals.

The launch of xAI followed Musk's split with OpenAI, which he helped start eight years earlier as a nonprofit before the AI lab went on to take billions of dollars from Microsoft en route to becoming a massive business.

Musk's spat with OpenAI took a legal turn early last year, when he sued the AI startup and CEO Sam Altman for breach of contract, alleging they abandoned the company's founding mission to develop AI "for the benefit of humanity broadly." As part of his lawsuit, Musk sought to block OpenAI from converting into a for-profit entity.

Meanwhile, xAI changed its own structure, terminating its PBC status, according to records on file with Nevada's secretary of state.

Nevada public records show that as of May 9, 2024, xAI's distinction as a PBC was gone. And when xAI merged with X (formerly Twitter) earlier this year, the combined company remained without its PBC structure, according to its articles of incorporation, dated March 28.

Representatives from xAI didn't respond to requests for comment. 

A month after shedding its PBC designation, xAI began using dozens of natural gas turbines to power its data center in Memphis, Tennessee, where the company trains and processes the data behind its Grok chatbot. While xAI, and its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure, initially promised to use pollution controls with the turbines, those haven't yet materialized.

The company's operations in Memphis have added to air pollution woes in the region, according to research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

The NAACP is suing xAI, alleging the company committed Clean Air Act violations.

Executives at Legal Advocates for Safe Science and Technology (LASST), which first obtained the Nevada public records, said that xAI appears to have registered as a PBC when it was helpful for publicity, but then abandoned the distinction without telling the public.

"Once you start funneling billions of dollars into an industry, and follow what is strictly a profit motive, sometimes the better angels take a back seat," LASST programs director Vivian Dong told CNBC.

LASST CEO Tyler Whitmer said his nonprofit works to hold AI companies accountable for the promises they make to users, investors and regulators, and pushes them to be transparent about the safety risks of their AI technology and policies.

Over the last year, xAI has been embroiled in controversy not just for its environmental impact, but also because of the output of its Grok chatbot.

Grok is both a standalone app and is tightly integrated into X as well as in Tesla infotainment systems.

This year, Grok has generated and spread hateful and false content across X including antisemitic posts, praise for Hitler and false claims about alleged "white genocide" in South Africa. Grok has also spread climate change denial talking points.

When Musk's company released a new version of the model underlying its chatbot, Grok 4, on July 9, it did so without making any details available about relevant guardrails or safety testing before the rollout.

Competitors including OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic, which is a Delaware PBC, have published disclosures about their safety testing and the guardrails they're putting in place around new releases before pushing them out. However, companies across the industry have faced criticism for an insufficient amount of focus on AI safety, privacy and the environmental impact of data centers that train and run AI models.

After CNBC sent multiple requests for information to xAI in July and August about its safety practices, the company updated its "model card" for Grok 4 on Aug. 20, providing some information about its testing and guardrails. That was almost two months after its release.

Michal Barzuza, a law professor at University of Virginia and a corporate law and governance expert, told CNBC that a company focused on being accountable to stakeholders wouldn't choose to incorporate in Nevada, where state laws make it hard for shareholders to sue corporations, directors and officers.

That means "less litigation, but it also means less to no accountability," said Barzuza.

A benefit corporation in Nevada is a for-profit legal structure that formally acknowledges a company's commitment to creating positive impacts, alongside its financial goals. Establishing a business as a PBC in the state potentially offers legal protections to officers and directors who prioritize broader goals, but doesn't come with many other obligations, Barzuza said.

XAI hasn't delivered annual reports on its environmental and social impact that would otherwise be expected by a PBC under Nevada's statute.

Musk's retreat from PBC status has been so secretive that even his attorney appeared to be unaware of the change. As recently as May 2025, in an amended complaint that's part of the case against OpenAI, Musk's lawyer, Marc Toberoff, wrote that xAI is "a public benefit corporation founded by Musk to help accelerate scientific research via AI."

The filing says Musk was suing OpenAI partly to "ensure that competition in the marketplace for generative AI remains healthy and that AI development proceeds in a safe and responsible manner for all stakeholders and society at large."

Toberoff didn't respond to requests for comment. 

Also in May, OpenAI bowed to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, announcing in a blog post that its nonprofit would retain control of the company even as it restructures into a PBC.

Public disclosures from the large AI model companies are becoming more critical as their usage expands deeper into the consumer and business markets and larger piles of money pour into the space from investors.

Before employees engage in "quiet quitting," first come signs of "quiet cracking."

"Quiet quitting" refers to the idea of an employee doing the bare minimum at work, according to ResumeBuilder.

Meanwhile, "quiet cracking" is a "persistent feeling of workplace unhappiness that leads to disengagement, poor performance, and an increased desire to quit," according to a new report from cloud learning platform TalentLMS, which coined the term. While they are both different responses to burnout and stress, quiet cracking could lead to quiet quitting in some cases, experts say.

"Unlike burnout, it doesn't always manifest in exhaustion. Unlike quiet quitting, it doesn't show up in performance metrics immediately. But it is just as dangerous," the report notes.

More than half, 54%, of surveyed employees say they experience some level of quiet cracking, according to the TalentLMS report. About 47% said they rarely or never feel that way.

The survey polled 1,000 employees in the U.S. across industries in March.

Frank Giampietro, chief wellbeing officer at the Americas offices of EY, a professional services and accounting firm, said via email that quiet cracking and quiet quitting are "two sides of the same coin."

"Both are responses to burnout in the workplace, and both can be an issue for organizations, if unaddressed," he said.

Terms like quiet cracking, quiet quitting and the so-called great resignation all showcase underlying trends in the broader labor market, said Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed, a job search site. 

"If we look at the great resignation, a lot of that was about people jumping jobs," he said. "And that really mirrors what we saw in the underlying data." 

But now, the job market isn't so good — more people are staying put in current roles, and there's not an easy outlet to remedy the experience of quiet cracking.

Quiet cracking is another way of describing employee detachment, where workers feel "less connected, less satisfied with their employer, more likely to be looking for other work," said Jim Harter, a workplace expert at Gallup.

"They feel detached, but they also feel stuck, and it's not good for employers," he said.

The cost of disengagement in the U.S. is approximately $2 trillion in lost productivity, according to an August report from Gallup.

In late 2021 and throughout 2022, at the height of the great resignation, if a worker felt like it was time for them to move on from a current role, there were plenty of job opportunities to choose from, said Stahle. At the same time, wages were rising at a fast pace, so many individuals engaged in job-hopping. 

Such conditions "encouraged people to resign," said Stahle.

About 60% of workers who switched jobs from April 2021 to March 2022 saw an increase in their real earnings over the same month the year prior, according to a 2022 report by the Pew Research Center. Among workers who stayed at their current roles, 47% experienced wage growth.

However, the economy has slowed down since then. Due to growing economic uncertainty fewer workers have been quitting their jobs and companies have slowed down hiring, experts say.

The idea of job switching to grow your income has also flipped — since February, wages for job stayers have outpaced the earnings of job switchers, according to Federal Reserve data.

"As job postings have become less plentiful, as wages have slowed down, people have been less encouraged to switch jobs," said Stahle.

Several factors can cause worker disengagement and burnout, such as a lack of clear goals, the workload and poor relationships at work, experts say.

There are ways workers can reclaim a sense of agency in the situation, said Harter. Workers who feel disengaged and frustrated need to reach out to their manager, express what they're experiencing and perhaps ask for guidance, he said.

However, it should also be a "two-way street," he said. 

While organizations may be going through business challenges as well, Harter said leaders have the power to impact their organizational structure. 

"Employers can do a lot about it if they've got great leadership and good management that are in touch with people," said Harter.

Taking a road trip in an EV is no easy feat, as two Tesla alumni found out the hard way.

Range is already a significant anxiety for EV owners taking long journeys, and towing a heavy RV can cause an electric vehicle battery to drain even faster.

Toby Kraus and Ben Parker, two ex-Tesla employees who each spent five years working at the EV giant, say they have an answer.

Their startup, Lightship, recently began production of its $250,000 AE.1 Cosmos electric RV, a futuristic towable camper that uses an onboard electric motor to boost the range of electric and gas-powered vehicles.

Kraus and Parker told Business Insider that the AE.1 was partly inspired by a particularly frustrating road trip the pair took during the COVID pandemic. The two founders, who live in California and Colorado, respectively, took a cross-country trip ahead of their first pitch for the new EV startup.

"I rented a Tesla Model X and a trailer, and towed it, laboriously, all the way out to Colorado to meet him," said Parker.

"I spent over half the time on the road getting to Colorado just charging the Model X, and going 55 miles an hour on a 70-mile-an-hour interstate," he added.

After meeting in Boulder, the two ex-Tesla employees began the journey back to California to give their pitch, and again found that the added weight of the trailer meant they were spending more time charging than driving.

Things took a turn outside Grand Junction, Utah, when a strong headwind meant the Model X began to run out of charge just as it began to get dark.

"We'd been deep in conversation about the company we wanted to start, and looked down at the range meter and realized we were not going to make it to the next charger," said Parker.

Parker and Kraus briefly considered using a tiny 1800-watt gas generator to charge the Tesla, one mile at a time, before ditching the trailer at an exit ramp and "crawling" to the nearest supercharger.

"We've experienced it many times since. It is a nightmare to go trailering with an EV today," said Parker, who described the initial road trip as a key part of Lightship's inception.

Kraus, who worked on Tesla's finance team for five years in the early 2010s, told Business Insider that the towing problem was the "Achilles' heel" of EVs.

"There are plenty of products now that have 300, 350-mile range, which is awesome, but guess what? If you use them to tow, all of a sudden your range drops by two-thirds," he said.

Lightship, which has raised over $60 million since it was founded in 2020, now employs around 100 people at its Colorado base.

In addition to the limited edition $250,000 AE.1 "Cosmo", the company is working on more affordable versions of its motorized electric RV, which are set to cost from $151,000 to $184,000 and begin deliveries in the Spring of next year.

Like the rest of the industry, Lightship is facing up to the impact of the Trump administration's tariff spree, which has seen major players including Ford, General Motors, and Toyota take a bit hit from the taxes on imported vehicles, steel, and car parts.

The startup is building its AE.1 electric RVs in a factory in Broomfield, Colorado, meaning it is insulated from the worst of the tariff impact.

Parker added that the tariffs had been a factor in Lightspeed's decision-making as it sets up its supply chain, and said that they had been inspired by Tesla's approach of trying to build vehicles where it sells them.

Despite this, Kraus said the company had still faced tariff-related turmoil.

"For us, it's a couple of points of margin. We're not changing pricing. We're not passing it through to our customers. I think we've built the business plan and overall strategy in manufacturing here to be resilient to this," he said.

"Any complex hardware manufacturing company in the modern age is going to be impacted," he added.

Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.

The company's shares ended the day around 16.7% lower, provisionally, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.

Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had issued a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.

The company also said that it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.

The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.

Orsted had announced plans for a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month. On Monday, the company said it would continue with the proposal, noting that it had the support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.

Shares have pulled back sharply since the rights issue plans were announced.

In a Monday note, Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said the potential financial consequences of the U.S.' order had led to uncertainty about whether Orsted would be able to continue with its capital raising plans.

"The financial consequences of the stop-work order will at best be the ongoing costs of the work being stopped," he said, according to a Google translation. In the worst-case scenario, the Revolution Wind Project would never supply electricity to the U.S., he added.

"In that case, Orsted faces a double-digit billion write-down and significant additional costs to get out of contracts. This will, by all accounts, increase the capital raising requirement to significantly more than DKK 60 billion," Pedersen said.

He that the company's Monday announcement to push ahead with its rights issue plans suggested it did not expect the worst-case outcome and was expecting its 60 billion Danish kroner target to be sufficient.

"Orsted's assessment of this is positive - but it is no guarantee that it will end up like this," Pedersen said.

Keurig Dr Pepper will acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in a roughly $18 billion deal that could give a boost to the U.S. giant's struggling coffee business, the two companies said Monday.

Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper fell roughly 8% in early trading, while the stock of JDE Peet's closed up 15% on the day.

The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet's shareholders 31.85 euros ($37.30) per share in cash, representing a 33% premium on the Dutch's firm's 90-day volume-weighted average stock price, which represents a total equity purchase of 15.7 billion euros ($18.4 billion). JDE Peet's will, meanwhile, pay out a previously declared dividend of euro cents per share prior to the deal closing.

The takeover is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years.

Keurig Dr Pepper, which owns brands such as Dr Pepper, 7Up, Snapple and Green Mountain Coffee, has seen shrinking sales at its U.S. coffee division, down 0.2% to $900 million in the second quarter due to a decline in the shipments of its single-serve coffee pods and Keurig coffee makers.

Keurig Dr Pepper has been looking to raise its appeal with thrifty shoppers who prefer to drink their coffee at home, while also venturing into cold coffee offerings in a bid to attract the Starbucks and Dunkin' clientele.

In addition to their coffee businesses, Keurig Dr Pepper and JDE Peet's also have a shared history with JAB Holding, the investment arm of the Reimann family that at one time owned both companies. These days, JAB owns just 4.4% of KDP and no longer has any seats on its board, although it is still the majority owner of JDE Peet's.

Following the JDE Peet's acquisition, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to split up its beverage and coffee units as two separate, U.S.-listed companies at the earliest opportunity. Such a step would effectively unwind the 2018 merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple, which at the time created the third-largest beverage company in North America with roughly $11 billion in annual revenue.

"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place," Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks]."

After the division, the resulting coffee company is anticipated to turn $16 billion in combined annual net sales and will be led by current Keurig Dr Pepper Chief Financial Officer Sudhanshu Priyadarshi.

The beverages firm is, meanwhile, expected to have $11 billion in annual net sales and will be helmed, upon separation, by incumbent Keurig Dr Pepper CEO Tim Cofer.

JDE Peet's CEO, Rafael Oliveira, will stay in his post to helm the Dutch coffee company until the acquisition closes.

Faced with fierce competition and volatile commodity prices, Keurig Dr Pepper isn't the only the company looking to spin off its coffee business. Sky News reported on Saturday that Coca-Cola is exploring a sale of Costa Coffee, which it bought in 2018 for $5.1 billion.

Defense stocks have soared this year as European governments ramp up military budgets, and the spending spree could deliver a windfall in another corner of the market.

"As markets focus on Russia-Ukraine talks and as European defense spending ramps up, we estimate a large boost to industrial metals demand from rising EU defense spending," wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a Thursday note.

Goldman estimates the defense sector already accounts for about 3% of global demand for industrial metals, ranging from about 2% of global steel demand to 7% of nickel demand.

The MSCI Europe Aerospace and Defense Index has surged 72% higher this year to date. Meanwhile, the US-focused S&P Aerospace and Defense Select Industry Index has climbed 31% over the same period.

The rally in defense stocks followed the European Union's commitments to boost military budgets amid heightened security concerns — and renewed pressure from Washington for NATO allies to spend more.

Goldman's analysts expect euro-area military spending to rise from 1.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.7% by 2027, adding about 167 billion euros, or $196 billion, to annual budgets.

Around 40% of that spending boost is likely to flow into the procurement of metals-heavy equipment — roughly double NATO's typical 20% norm.

Goldman estimates Europe's rearmament will lift the region's overall demand for industrial metals by 6% by 2027 — an "impressive" jump given that defense made up only about 2% of Europe's metals use in 2023.

Globally, Goldman projects Europe's rearmament could add 0.9% to copper demand, 1.3% to nickel, and 0.4% to steel by 2027.

Copper — one of the world's most commonly used metals — stands out.

Goldman estimates the defense-driven bump could lift global copper demand growth from 2% to 2.4% annually. Copper runs through nearly every military system — not just vehicles and weaponry, but also the wiring, power, and communications networks that make them work.

The boom in AI data center infrastructure is also driving demand for copper.

The demand from defense and AI could ripple into prices. Goldman flagged upside risk to its 2026 and 2027 copper price forecasts of $10,000 and $10,750 per metric ton, respectively, even as high inventories may cap gains in the near term.

Benchmark 3-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange are trading around $9,797 per ton.

 Bitcoin's Jackson Hole gains evaporated after an assortment of BTC holder cohorts began to distribute. Is $105,000 the next stop? 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's sharp rebound after Jackson Hole fizzled into a bearish weekly engulfing candle. 

Onchain data shows $105,000 as the key support as mid-size wallets sell.

Seasonal weakness and spot BTC ETF fatigue raise risks of a drop toward $100,000–$92,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) posted a sharp rebound on Friday, gaining 3.91% to $117,300 from $111,700 after dovish commentary from the Jackson Hole symposium boosted risk appetite. 

It marked BTC's strongest daily return since July 10, fueling optimism for another leg toward fresh all-time highs. However, momentum quickly evaporated, with Bitcoin reversing over the weekend and sliding to $110,600 on Monday. 

A bearish weekly engulfing candle underscores downside vulnerability, as onchain data points to broad distribution among holders.  

Data from Glassnode shows all BTC wallet cohorts have now shifted into distribution, led by the 10–100 BTC group. The synchronized behavior across wallet sizes highlights uniform sell-side pressure, weighing on price stability. 

Similarly, analyst Boris Vest notes a split across wallet behavior: smaller holders (0–1 BTC) have steadily accumulated since the peak, while 1–10 BTC wallets resumed buying below $107,000. By contrast, 10–100 BTC wallets flipped to net sellers after $118,000, while large holders above 1,000 BTC remain consistent distributors. 

However, the 100–1,000 BTC group is split between accumulation and distribution around $105,000, marking it as the key support zone and the last stronghold before major corrections. 

Bitcoin realized price data underscores this inflection. The realized price for one to three-month holders sits at $111,900, while the three to six-month and 6–12 month cohorts are anchored much lower at $91,630 and $89,200, respectively.

The wide gap reflects heavy short-term positioning near recent highs, versus longer-term holders with cost bases closer to $90,000.

Market analysis suggests that if Bitcoin loses $105,000, the lack of dense cost support between current levels and $90,000 could accelerate downside momentum. Such a breakdown could force recent buyers to capitulate, leaving the $92,000–$89,000 range as the next major demand zone.

The current pullback also aligns with Bitcoin's seasonal tendencies. Historically, August to September has marked a period of weakness, often amplified by Asia's “ghost month,” which runs this year from Aug. 23 to Sept. 21. Cointelegraph reported that this period has often coincided with softer risk appetite and profit-taking among traders. 

Since 2017, Bitcoin has posted an average ghost month decline of 21.7%, with notable drops of –39.8% in 2017 and –23% in 2021. Based on these averages, a retreat toward the $105,000–$100,000 range remains consistent with seasonal patterns and technical support zones.

Adding to the cautious tone, crypto trader Roman Trading flags structural risks in BTC's current rally. The analyst said that BTC/EUR has not registered a new all-time high since last year, suggesting that recent upside is more closely tied to a weakening US dollar than organic demand. 

Roman further warns that the post-spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch enthusiasm may be fading, with higher-timeframe exhaustion resembling past distribution phases.

ETHZilla Corporation—a publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm formerly known as 180 Life Sciences—announced Monday that its board has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding shares, effective immediately.

The move comes following a substantial dive for the firm's stock price last week. ETHZilla, which trades on the Nasdaq under ETHZ, is down more than 53% on the week to a current price of $3.18, with the drop coming after a surge that tripled the stock's value after billionaire VC Peter Thiel bought a stake in the company.

Last week's price decline came as the company filed with the SEC on Friday to offer 74.8 million convertible shares, as part of an agreement reached on August 8. The filing fueled dilution concerns, as the total amount of outstanding shares is set to grow from 164.4 million to over 239.2 million.

ETHZ stock is down nearly 3.8% on the day following the stock buyback announcement. ETHZilla has given up most of its recent gains following last week's price plunge, with the stock showing a less than 5% rise over the last month.

The Palm Beach, Florida-based company also disclosed it now holds 102,237 ETH at an average acquisition price of $3,948.72, valued at approximately $474 million as of this writing. The firm also has about $215 million in cash equivalents. The Ethereum tally includes 7,600 ETH acquired over the last week.

"At ETHZilla, we continue to deploy capital to accelerate our Ethereum treasury strategy with discipline and record speed," said ETHZilla Executive Chairman McAndrew Rudisill, in a release. "As we continue to scale our ETH reserves and pursue differentiated yield opportunities, we believe an aggressive stock repurchase program at the current stock price underscores our commitment to maximizing value for shareholders."

ETHZilla plans to stake its most recently purchased Ethereum tokens to Electric Capital's proprietary Electric Asset Protocol to generate yield, the company said.

The stock repurchase program is scheduled to expire by June 30, 2026, or when $250 million in shares has been repurchased. The program will be funded through working capital and potential future fundraising efforts.

The price of Ethereum hit an all-time high Friday for the first time in nearly four years, and continued to rise higher on Sunday, peaking at a new record of $4,946 according to data from CoinGecko. It's down more than 4% over the last 24 hours, however, falling to a current price of $4,604 as the broader crypto market sags.

Despite the dip, Myriad users believe that ETH will continue to rise to new peaks and cross the $5,000 milestone by the end of 2025, with 86% of users predicting such a move. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

The next billion-dollar SPX6900 ‘index' coin – TOKEN6900 (T6900) – must end its ICO in just three days, so there's no time to lose to get in on the price action.

Available to purchase for just $0.0071, the token prides itself on being the ultimate ‘vibe liquidity' asset to save your wealth from the avarice and incompetence of legacy finance.

TOKEN6900 makes no pretense about tracking an underlying asset class like stocks, bonds or oil – T6900 is pegged to the meme zeitgeist. 

Sure, there might be an 84% chance that Fed chairman Jerome Powell will cut rates in September, and equity markets will hit new records as a result, but some of that euphoria could be wearing off already. How should you position your portfolio? 

Are we about to see the mother of all sell-offs, or are asset prices about to reach the stars (moon)? Well, if you buy into T6900 token you really don't need to worry your pretty head about such things, because T6900 is a commitment to the raw future of finance, where brain rot is celebrated and degen enthusiasm is a feature, not a bug.

Although it may not yet have sunk in for Warren Buffett and other value investors, the new crypto-led realities of finance mean that there is money to be made from the memeification of everything that moves.

Of course, prices go up and down – and especially in crypto. And that's the attraction. Volatility is another word for risk, but it is also what allows traders to make money.

T6900 is the smart way to speculate about the future of the US economy. The percentage of your net wealth you decide to allocate to this final form of financial regression will depend on exactly what kind of degen you are. 

However, you would have to be terminally ill not to want to take a piece of this particular pie. It has viral meme explosion baked in. 

So, after you've maybe bought a top 10 altcoin like ETH or SOL, don't forget to sprinkle in some meme coin stardust to magnify your portfolio returns and deliver you from the drudgery of the 401(k) blues.

Remember, the FOMO is building with only three days to go before TOKEN6900 starts trading on decentralized exchanges. 

As of the time of writing, $2,563,390 worth of T6900 tokens have been snapped up, demonstrating that it is the natural peak of human thought, or at least the best meme coin to buy right now.

This is the top forever, or is it? The TOKEN6900 website says the end price of the ICO is $0.007125, so any purchase you make today could beat a possible imminent price rise over the next few hours. And when the trading starts in earnest, then it will be time to reach for the top.

As the global benchmark for brain-rot finance and the deliverer of hope and real growth, T6900 is the siren call of danger – not for you, but for the old economy stuck in the past, where Wall Street still rules and Powell still matters.

At a market cap of $1.17 billion, SPX6900 is still the one to watch, for now, as far as index coins go. Its blend of frivolity and poke-in-the-eye irreverence is what has attracted bleary-eyed traders on the hunt for the next big thing. The same thing is happening all over again with T6900.

Although we have our doubts about Buffett's wisdom regarding his analysis of crypto, we agree with him that investors should be greedy when others are fearful. We are at such a moment today, as we start the week in crypto.

Bitcoin has pulled back to $111,434, ETH hit an all-time high at $4,953 yesterday, and then a whale sold big, leading to a flash crash. Yet the meme coin traders who know where the alpha is have seen this all before. OG degens know a buying opportunity when they see one, and this is it.

TOKEN6900 is the ultimate reset. It's the definitive chaos button. It is definitely not a solution – it's the reflective vision of the economic implosion that brought you into the (financial) world. 

Although you are probably not thinking about it yet (leave that to mom and pop), there will be only one true way forward for your future retirement plan – the monetization of viral engagement. 

But you are always thinking about making money, which means that, regardless of pensions, T6900 token is your essential late-capitalism exit liquidity.

If that doesn't get the juices going, then you are playing in the wrong asset class pool. Perhaps you should grab yourself some Nvidia stock instead and cry later when the top pops?

TOKEN6900 is crypto's first Non-Corrupt Token (NCT), although many other coins likely claim similar censorship-resistant attributes. The point is that T6900 is better than the rest because it has the sanity of number 69 behind it – and its concomitant brand power. 

This hot presale is launching very soon, as the Cilinix Crypto YouTube channel reminds its 100k subscribers. Demand for the token is ratcheting higher. These 1,000x opportunities don't come by every day, so you have been warned: don't wait this one out a moment longer than necessary. 

Do your due diligence if you must, but all you need to know is that it is a consciousness parasite like the worm in Robert F. Kennedy Jr's brain worm.

 Onchain data suggests Ethereum is in the  “belief” stage of the bull cycle amid fresh all-time highs, opening the door to potentially even higher prices. 

Key takeaways:

Ether's long-term holder net unrealized profit/loss indicator suggests the price has entered the “belief” phase.

The market value to realized value suggests ETH is undervalued, with room to run toward $5,500.

Ether's rounded bottom pattern targets $12,100.

Ether (ETH) price has rallied more than 240% since April to set a record high above $5,000 on Sunday. As a result, investors' profitability has risen to levels seen in the past bull cycles, suggesting that the ETH market is entering the “belief” phase, increasing the chances of an extended rally.

Onchain data points out similarities between the current stage of the Ether market and previous bull cycles. 

Ether's long-term holder (LTH) net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator has entered the “belief-denial” (green) zone, a position that historically precedes significant price rallies, said popular analyst Gert van Lagen in an X post on Monday.

The LTH NUPL measures the difference between the relative unrealized profit and relative unrealized loss of investors who have held Bitcoin for at least 155 days.

This zone is particularly significant because it suggests ETH has not yet reached the euphoric phase (blue) typically associated with cycle peaks. 

In previous market cycles, the transition from belief to euphoria has coincided with substantial price increases.

For that to occur, ETH price “still needs to climb further,” van Lagen explained, adding:

The market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio adds another layer of validation to the bullish thesis. With a current daily reading of 2.08, significantly lower than a peak of 3.8 in 2021 and 6.49 in 2017, the metric suggests Ethereum remains relatively undervalued. 

This lower MVRV ratio indicates subdued profit-taking and increased potential for sustained price appreciation.

Ether's MVRV extreme deviation pricing bands also suggest that ETH price still has more room for further expansion before the unrealized profit held by investors reaches an extreme level represented by the uppermost MVRV band at $5,500, as shown in the chart below.

But the price can go even higher from a technical perspective. Ether's price action has validated a megaphone, a chart pattern that has been forming on the weekly candle chart since December 2023, as observed by crypto analyst Jelle.

“This bullish megaphone has a target of $10,000, and $ETH has defeated every resistance level standing in its way,” the analyst said in an X post on Monday, adding:

Fellow analyst Mickybull Crypto echoed this view, saying that “ETH delivered as expected,” referring to Ether's run to all-time highs above $5,000 on Sunday.

The analyst added that their cycle targets for Ether are $7,000-$11,000.

The ETH/USD pair displayed strength after breaking above a rounded bottom chart pattern on the daily chart. The price retested the neckline of the pattern at $4,100 to confirm the breakout. 

The bulls will now attempt to push the price toward the technical target of the prevailing chart pattern at $12,130, or a 161% rise from the current price.

Other analysts also predict that Ether could reach $12,000 and even higher in 2025, citing possible interest rate cuts, capital inflows via spot Ethereum ETFs, and demand from ETH treasury companies, which remain notably strong.

Nasdaq-listed firm Sharps Technology (STSS) rallied as much as 70% on Monday on raising $400 million to establish what it says could become the largest corporate digital asset treasury of Solana SOL$196.96.

The firm's fundraising drew backing from some of the most active investors in digital assets, including ParaFi, Pantera, FalconX, CoinFund and Arrington Capital. Under the deal, shares were sold at $6.50 per unit with attached warrants exercisable at $9.75. Closing is expected by August 28.

The stock briefly topped $13 in the morning U.S. hours before paring gains, up 53% from $7.3 at Friday's close.

The company plans to allocate the funds primarily toward acquiring SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain. Alice Zhang, co-founder of Solana-backed project Jambo, also joined the firm as chief investment officer and board member.

The Solana Foundation, the non-profit development organization focusing on the Solana network, has committed to selling $50 million in SOL tokens at a 15% discount to a 30-day time-weighted average price, subject to conditions, according to the press release.

Sharps is the latest public firm pivoting to accumulate cryptocurrencies, a recent trend that has captivated stock markets. These firms, often dubbed digital asset treasuries (DATs), raise money on capital markets to buy cryptos, aiming to replicate the success of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR). Strategy has become the largest corporate owner of bitcoin BTC$112,496.06 with a stash worth north of $70 billion.

The fever has already extended to Solana, with SOL Strategies (HODL), DeFi Development (DFDV) and Upexi (UPXI) being among listed firms stacking SOL.

DATs a as a proxy play on crypto prices and most of them trade at a premium relative to the underlying holdings. However, they could come under pressure during market downturns when the premium contracts, capping their ability to raise funds to fuel purchases.

Sharps' move was not the only Solana treasury-related news on Monday.

Prominent crypto firms Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital and Jump Crypto are reportedly seeking to raise $1 billion to build a treasury focused on SOL. They plan to buy out a listed firm and hired Cantor Fitzgerald as the lead banker.

Meanwhile, DeFi Development (DFDV), led by former executives of Kraken, announced on Monday to raise $125 million by selling equity, seeking to increase its SOL holdings.

The stock tumbled 19% on the news.

SBI partners with Chainlink to develop blockchain tools, enabling tokenized assets, cross-border payments, and transparent finance across Asia.

SBI Group, one of Japan's leading financial companies, has announced a major partnership with Chainlink. Chainlink is a global blockchain platform that helps connect real-world data to smart contracts. Together, they intend to create new crypto solutions for the financial institutions in Japan and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.

First of all, they will concentrate on Japan. The financial market of Japan is highly developed, and the digital asset sector of the country is one of the fastest-growing. Thus, it provides the appropriate setting to trial and release new blockchain-based tools.

The two companies seek to develop frameworks to enable tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to be interoperable across blockchains, including bonds and real estate. The tokenized assets are the digital counterparts of tangible goods. This may be in the form of buildings, bonds, or even funds. These applications may enable the financial firms to make faster and cheaper transactions. In addition, they will utilize the Chainlink technology to guarantee transparency, including on-chain proof of stablecoin reserves.

A survey by SBI Digital Assets Department has revealed that more than 76 percent of financial institutions intend to invest in tokenized securities. These companies are aiming at reducing expenses and settlement periods. A lot of them, however, are also dissatisfied with the state of the existing infrastructure, in which case it is not suitable enough to make serious investments. This is where the services of Chainlink come in.

In this collaboration, SBI and Chainlink will leverage Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This system enables the safe yet confidential transfers between blockchains. Besides, Chainlink SmartData will facilitate bringing crucial data, such as net asset value (NAV), on-chain to tokenized funds. This will increase the liquidity and ease operations.

Furthermore, the two companies will work on improving foreign exchange (FX) and cross-border payments. Chainlink will help them in making the transactions more transparent and safe using its CCIP and Proof of Reserve tools.

Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, said that it has been a good experience collaborating with SBI. He said that SBI is one of the most innovative and progressive firms in the field of blockchain. He also stated that the decision of SBI to adopt the technology of Chainlink asserts that it is well-suited to the requirements of worldwide finance.

Similarly, Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings, reported that Chainlink is an ideal partner. He commended the on-chain capabilities and international scope of Chainlink. He further stated that the collaboration would assist in making safe and regulation-friendly solutions. These tools will facilitate the use of stablecoins and tokenized assets in international trade.

To sum up, this cooperation is likely to introduce significant changes to the digital finance scene in Asia. By integrating the financial capability of SBI with the blockchain technology of Chainlink, they are hoping to create the next generation of finance– more networked, more transparent, and more efficient.

Drug delivery solutions company Sharps Technology, Inc. has announced a private placement financing valued at more than $400 million to support the creation of a digital asset treasury centered on Solana's native token, SOL. 

According to a Monday press release revealing the funding round, the private investment in public equity transaction (PIPE) will include the purchase and sale of common stock, pre-funded warrants, and stapled warrants. Each unit was priced at $6.50, scheduled to close around August 28, 2025, the company's announcement read.

Sharps Technology mentioned that stapled warrants will be exercisable for three years at $9.75, 150% of the per-unit price. Investors who choose to fund their purchases with SOL, locked or unlocked, will receive pre-funded warrants and warrants exercisable once the company receives stockholder approval.

According to Google Finance data, shares of Sharps Technology, STSS, traded 4.4% higher in the US premarket trading session, climbing to $11.90 within the day.

Per the company's release, the proceeds from the offering will be used in SOL token acquisitions from the open market, which will in turn form a dedicated treasury operation for the sixth-largest coin by market cap. 

Sharps Technology is a Nasdaq-listed company in the medical device and pharmaceutical packaging business, where it supplies safety syringe products to healthcare providers. It creates ultra-low waste syringe technologies equipped with safety features, but earlier this year, it announced it could pivot to Blockchain-based investments.

The health technology firm has reportedly signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Solana Foundation, a non-profit based in Zug, Switzerland. Under the agreement, the foundation will sell the company $50 million worth of SOL at a 15% discount to the 30-day time-weighted average price, subject to conditions tied to a public offering.

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is the lead placement agent for the transaction, while Aegis Capital Corp. served as co-placement agent. Madison Global Partners LLC provided financial advisory services to the company.

“Solana defines the standard for digital infrastructure, providing a high-throughput, low-cost, real-time settlement layer for everything from blue-chip equities to bonds to private assets,” Alice Zhang, Sharps Technology's newly appointed Chief Investment Officer and board member, told reporters.

Zhang mentioned that the Solana treasury is an opportunity for the company to join the growing number of institutions interested in the token. She added that the company is building a team “with established connections” within the Solana ecosystem.

The company also appointed James Zhang, co-founder of Jambo, who has previously spoken at Solana Breakpoint, Davos, and Forbes events, in an advisory capacity. He will consult on treasury business alongside asset managers Monarq Asset Management, ParaFi, and Pantera.

Meanwhile, Solana's native token, SOL, is trading at around $195, well below its 5, 10, and 20-hour moving averages, according to Coingecko data. 

The announcement of the PIPE transaction comes against the backdrop of Sharps Technology's release of its Form 10-Q report for the second quarter of 2025. The company reportedly began generating revenues in the quarter, reporting net revenue of $222,722.

According to the document publicized on August 14, Sharps Technology posted a gross margin loss of $1,032,027, attributed to start-up costs tied to revenue generation. Loss from operations totaled $5,028,151, with heavy expenditures falling on research and development, as well as general administrative costs.

However, the company reported a net income of $5,488,141 for the quarter, from a fair market value gain of $11,087,700 on warrants. Basic and diluted net income per share came to $10.45, a figure significantly affected by the warrant valuation.

The crypto treasury rush continues. Sharps Technology, a small medical device and pharmaceutical packaging company, announced Monday that it plans to sell $400 million worth of its stock to fund a treasury for Solana, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Large crypto investment funds like ParaFi, Pantera Capital, and CoinFund contributed to the raise.

The transaction, which would turn the biotech firm's stock into a proxy for the price of Solana, is expected to close on Aug. 28. Alice Zhang, a venture capitalist and cofounder of crypto smartphone maker Jambo, will join the board of Sharps and become the company's chief investment officer. James Zhang, another cofounder of the smartphone company, will join as a strategic advisor and consultant. 





“We will have a team with deep ties to the Solana ecosystem and proven founder-level experience in scaling institutional digital asset platforms,” Alice Zhang said in a statement.





The more-than-$400 million capital injection positions Sharps to potentially become the largest Solana treasury company on the market. Upexi, its closest competitor, has about $394 million worth of the cryptocurrency, according to its most recent update on its balance sheet. DeFi Development Corp., another public company that amasses Solana, has a bit more than $250 million.





But Sharps' position as frontrunner may be short-lived. Crypto heavyweights Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto are in the market to raise $1 billion to start their own Solana treasury company, according to a report from Bloomberg, which cited anonymous sources.




A spokesperson for Jump Crypto declined to comment. Spokespeople for Multicoin Capital and Galaxy Digital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.





The investment into Sharps comes on the heels of a slew of announcements from small public companies to establish so-called digital asset treasuries, or pools of cryptocurrency held on companies' balance sheets. 





The strategy was first popularized by the data analytics software company Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy, which started buying up Bitcoin in 2020. Michael Saylor, Strategy's cofounder and executive chairman, became one of Bitcoin's biggest boosters as his company added more and more of the token to its balance sheet. 





As the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency increased and Strategy added more and more of it to its balance sheet, the company's share price surged, as traders bought up its stock as a proxy for Bitcoin.





Watching the meteoric rise of Strategy, which now boasts a market capitalization of almost $100 billion, copycats followed suit. Other small publicly traded companies began adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet in the hopes of pops in their stocks. And soon firms started to buy more exotic tokens, including Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin.

On Monday, August 25, Sharps Technology announced  that its $400 million private placement offering would support plans to adopt a digital treasury strategy centered on SOL.

The firm called Solana the “fastest and most used public blockchain in the world,” stating that the move was driven by the accelerating adoption of Solana's ecosystem worldwide.

Sharps Technology (Nasdaq: STSS / STSSW) completed a $400M PIPE financing to build the world's largest Solana (SOL) treasury, with investors including ParaFi, Pantera, and Monarq. It signed an MoU with the Solana Foundation to buy $50M SOL at a 15% discount.…

— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 25, 2025 



“Global adoption of Solana's ecosystem is accelerating as it continues to receive institutional support for its vision of a single global market for every tradeable asset, making now the right time to establish a digital asset treasury strategy with SOL,” said Chief Investment Officer Alice Zhang.

Sharps Technology also intends to assemble a team with deep ties to the Solana ecosystem and “proven founder-level experience” in scaling digital asset platforms.

The move represents a dramatic departure for a company best known for developing pharmaceutical packaging.

Sharps has recently faced pressures  related to Nasdaq compliance and strained cash reserves , which may have influenced its pivot into the digital asset space.

In recent months, digital asset treasuries have become a growing strategy among firms seeking new sources of value and visibility.

Ethereum has been a popular choice for many corporate treasuries this year.

Sharplink Gaming has emerged as one of the largest institutional holders of ETH, with a treasury containing  740,760 ETH worth approximately $3.2 billion.

The largest current holder of ETH and second largest crypto treasury, BitMine, has acquired more than 1.5 million ETH , valued at approximately $6.6 billion.

Alongside strong corporate interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is now entering a defining moment.

Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital are reportedly in talks  to raise $1 billion to establish a Solana-focused treasury.

The plan reportedly involves acquiring an existing public company and converting it into a Solana reserve.

Backed by the Solana Foundation, the plan could reportedly be completed as early as September. 

With institutional interest growing  for Solana, the blockchain could become the third major corporate treasury asset.

The rise of blockchain technology has transformed how businesses and investors approach fundraising, with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) emerging as one of the most powerful tools for project financing. At the core of this transformation lies the ERC20 token standard, which has become the foundation for thousands of tokens operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Designed to ensure interoperability, security, and ease of integration, ERC20 has played a crucial role in building investor confidence and providing a framework for developers to create reliable digital assets. In a market often criticized for volatility and lack of regulation, adherence to the ERC20 token standards is not merely a technical decision but a strategic one, as it helps organizations establish credibility, ensure compliance, and foster trust among investors who are increasingly cautious about where they place their capital.

ERC20 standards provide the essential framework that underpins token creation and functionality on the Ethereum blockchain, making them indispensable for ICO fundraising. These standards establish a set of universally recognized rules that allow tokens to interact seamlessly with wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications. For ICOs, this not only means greater accessibility and reduced friction but also an added layer of credibility that reassures investors. In an industry where technical flaws can quickly erode confidence, adopting ERC20 is about creating stability and consistency in the marketplace, enabling projects to grow while maintaining trust and transparency.

Interoperability Across Platforms: ERC20 tokens are universally recognized across wallets and exchanges, meaning investors don't need specialized tools or platforms to interact with them. This ease of use makes ICO participation seamless and attracts a wider investor base.

Reducing Technical Barriers for Developers: With clear guidelines in place, developers don't need to reinvent token mechanics for every project. Instead, they can focus on innovating project features while relying on ERC20's proven framework.

Building Investor Trust: Investors are more likely to participate in ICOs backed by ERC20-compliant tokens because these tokens guarantee compatibility and minimize risks associated with poorly designed smart contracts.

Foundation for Regulation: As global regulators begin to examine the cryptocurrency market, ERC20 provides a solid standard that aligns with the push toward greater accountability, transparency, and compliance.

As ICO fundraising continues to evolve, regulatory compliance has become a central concern for projects and investors alike. The growing scrutiny from governments worldwide highlights the need for standards that can help align blockchain innovation with existing financial regulations. ERC20 offers a foundation that projects can build upon to meet Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and transparency requirements. For startups, this means not only avoiding penalties but also appealing to a broader audience of institutional investors who demand accountability. Ultimately, compliance isn't just about legality—it's about creating long-term trust and stability in the ICO ecosystem.

Global Regulatory Landscape: Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to ICO regulation, with some embracing innovation while others impose strict guidelines. Understanding these differences is vital for ICO organizers who want to operate across multiple regions.

KYC and AML Requirements: Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance are becoming mandatory in many jurisdictions. By embedding these practices, ICOs can protect investors and prevent misuse of funds.

Transparency in Token Distribution: Regulators and investors alike expect clear communication about token allocation, vesting schedules, and use of funds. Following ERC20 standards makes it easier to provide this transparency in a verifiable way.

Long-Term Investor Confidence: ICOs that prioritize compliance not only reduce legal risks but also build stronger relationships with institutional investors who are cautious about regulatory uncertainties.

Trust is at the heart of every successful fundraising initiative, and in the world of ICOs, establishing it can make or break a project. ERC20 tokens help projects foster trust by providing a transparent, secure, and verifiable framework that reassures investors about where and how their funds are being used. With strict coding standards, clear token mechanics, and visibility of transactions on the blockchain, ERC20 makes it easier for investors to verify claims and monitor progress. This transparency, combined with robust community engagement, ensures that projects not only attract investors but also maintain their confidence over the long term.

Security of Smart Contracts: ERC20 defines strict rules for token transactions, which reduces the chance of bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Secure code is vital for protecting investor funds.

Transparency in Token Supply and Movement: Since all ERC20 token movements are visible on the blockchain, investors can independently verify supply, distribution, and transactions. This level of transparency is rarely seen in traditional fundraising.

Reputation and Credibility: Startups using ERC20 tokens automatically signal professionalism and adherence to best practices, making their ICOs more attractive to both retail and institutional investors.

Community Engagement: With clear token standards, projects can easily involve their community in audits, feedback, and verification, further strengthening trust between project teams and investors.

ERC20 doesn't just provide compliance and trust benefits—it also delivers significant technical advantages that make ICO fundraising more efficient. Standardized token functions reduce errors, increase reliability, and simplify integration with platforms across the blockchain ecosystem. For developers, this means faster deployment and reduced costs, while for investors, it ensures smooth participation and transaction consistency. These technical strengths are why ERC20 remains the gold standard in ICO fundraising. By streamlining processes and reducing risks, ERC20 makes it easier for both startups and investors to engage confidently in tokenized fundraising campaigns.

Ease of Integration with Exchanges: Because ERC20 tokens are widely accepted, getting listed on major exchanges becomes more straightforward, improving liquidity for investors.

Standardized Functions for Transactions: Functions like transfer, approve, and balance Of ensure that token interactions are consistent across platforms, reducing the risk of transaction errors.

Lower Development Costs: Instead of creating custom code from scratch, developers can rely on ERC20 templates, cutting down on costs and speeding up ICO launch timelines.

Compatibility with Decentralized Finance (DeFi): ERC20 tokens are easily integrated into the DeFi ecosystem, giving investors more opportunities to stake, lend, or trade their tokens after an ICO.

ICO fundraising involves more than launching a token; it requires strategic planning, clear communication, and long-term vision. ERC20 provides a reliable technical framework, but success comes from how effectively organizers manage transparency, compliance, and investor relations. Organizers must consider how their tokenomics align with project goals, how they communicate with their communities, and how they manage regulatory requirements. Partnering with experts, such as a trc20 token development company, can provide valuable insights into token design and smart contract deployment. Ultimately, these lessons help ensure that ICOs not only raise funds but also deliver lasting value to their investors.

Prioritize Clear Communication: Investors need simple, understandable explanations about how the token works, its utility, and the roadmap for project development.

Adopt Transparent Practices: Open reporting on token distribution, project milestones, and fund usage enhances credibility and accountability.

Leverage Professional Expertise: Collaborating with experienced blockchain consultants or even a trc20 token development company can provide insights into token design, smart contract security, and compliance alignment.

Plan for Long-Term Growth: ICO fundraising is not just about raising initial capital—it's about creating a sustainable token economy that attracts ongoing investor support.

Investor protection has always been a crucial topic in financial markets, and the ICO space is no exception. Many early ICOs were marred by scams, poor execution, and lack of oversight, leaving investors wary of new opportunities. ERC20 standards help mitigate these risks by creating transparency and enforcing a minimum level of quality and reliability in token development. Through standardized rules, smart contract audits, and open verification, ERC20 makes it easier to safeguard investor funds and enhance confidence. For ICOs, this protection translates into stronger participation and more sustainable growth opportunities.

Safeguarding Against Fraudulent Projects: Token standards act as a safeguard by ensuring that tokens meet a minimum set of requirements. Investors can filter out low-quality or non-compliant projects more easily.

Smart Contract Audits and Verification: ERC20 tokens are widely audited, and the community can verify their code. This level of oversight reduces the chance of vulnerabilities and fraudulent modifications.

Improving Investor Education: Since ERC20 has become widely known, investors understand how the tokens work and what to look for, reducing the likelihood of falling into deceptive schemes.

Enabling Safer Multi-Chain Expansion: With the rise of alternative chains, some projects seek expertise from a trc20 token development company to ensure similar standards and investor safeguards when build

The landscape of blockchain tokens has expanded significantly, with various standards emerging to meet different project requirements. ERC20, however, continues to dominate due to its reliability, widespread adoption, and proven track record in ICO fundraising. While newer standards like BEP20, TRC20, and Solana-based tokens offer unique advantages such as lower transaction costs and higher speeds, understanding their interoperability, regulatory recognition, and community support is crucial. This section explores ERC20's benchmark status, the rise of alternatives, challenges in cross-chain integration, and why ERC20 remains the preferred choice for ICO projects.

ERC20 as the Benchmark ERC20 is the most widely adopted and time-tested standard, giving investors confidence and ensuring broad compatibility.

Emergence of BEP20 and TRC20 Binance Smart Chain's BEP20 and TRON's TRC20 offer lower transaction costs and faster speeds, making them attractive alternatives for projects. Partnering with a trc20 token development company ensures smooth adoption for multi-chain projects.

Interoperability Challenges While other standards bring benefits, they also introduce challenges in cross-chain compatibility and exchange listings compared to ERC20.

Why ERC20 Still Leads With its maturity, extensive ecosystem support, and recognition among regulators, ERC20 continues to dominate ICO fundraising.

Best Practices for Launching an ERC20-Compliant ICO

Launching a successful ERC20-compliant ICO requires more than following technical specifications; it involves a strategic approach that ensures security, transparency, and investor confidence. Organizers must focus on smart contract integrity, clear tokenomics, effective community engagement, and strong partnerships to maximize fundraising potential. Understanding the best practices not only mitigates risks but also establishes credibility in a competitive market. This section covers essential strategies that ICO teams should adopt to deliver reliable, investor-friendly, and compliant token offerings that stand out in the blockchain ecosystem.

Smart Contract Auditing Independent audits help detect vulnerabilities before launch, ensuring investor funds remain safe.

Clear Tokenomics Design Transparent allocation, vesting schedules, and use-of-funds statements give investors confidence in the long-term vision.

Community and Investor Relations Engaging with the community through regular updates and transparent communication fosters loyalty and credibility.

Strategic Partnerships Collaborating with exchanges, wallets, and even blockchain specialists strengthens the project's ecosystem and positions it for growth.

Conclusion 

The ERC20 token standard has been a cornerstone of ICO fundraising, ensuring security, transparency, and compatibility across the Ethereum ecosystem. For investors, it provides trust; for developers, it offers efficiency and simplicity; and for regulators, it creates a baseline for accountability. In an environment where the credibility of digital assets is constantly questioned, adhering to ERC20 standards allows projects to stand out as trustworthy and professional. Looking forward, partnerships with experts such as a trc20 token development company can help projects navigate the complexities of compliance, technical implementation, and multi-chain ecosystems. Ultimately, ICOs that embrace strong token standards, prioritize compliance, and foster investor trust are best positioned for long-term success.

Bitcoin BTC$112,573.01 has retraced to roughly where it was before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks on Friday, which briefly sparked a rally in U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies. 

The reversal in BTC price has paused ether's rally and triggered losses across the broader altcoin market. The CoinDesk 20 (CD 20) Index is down 3% on a 24-hour basis, while the broader CoinDesk 80 (CD 80) index has fallen 3.74% as of writing.

Alex Kuptsikevich, senior analyst at FxPro, noted that liquidity appears to be shifting from bitcoin into altcoins. “Bitcoin is trading at $112,000, having fallen to a low of $110,000—its weakest level since early July. Friday's surge attracted fresh sellers, pushing BTC below its 50-day moving average. So far, liquidity seems to be migrating from BTC to Ethereum and other altcoins like Solana. However, we cannot rule out that this is a precursor, with Bitcoin potentially starting a ‘sell-on-rise' phase that may soon extend to altcoins,” Kuptsikevich said in an email.

Adding to the narrative, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a prominent bitcoin whale, who received 100,000 BTC a long while ago, began diversifying into ether over the weekend.

Singapore-based QCP Capital chimed in with a longer-term perspective, stating, “Near term, BTC appears to be ceding momentum to ETH, but our structural outlook on Bitcoin remains optimistic. Similar to July's absorption of roughly 80,000 BTC of legacy supply, we expect institutions to continue buying dips selectively.”

Highlighting institutional interest in dip buying, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet announced the acquisition of an additional 103 BTC, raising its holdings to 18,991 BTC. These developments come on the heels of Japan's Finance Minister endorsing regulated crypto assets as a legitimate diversification tool within broader portfolios.

On the derivatives front, the price swings since Friday have sparked notable activity. Hyperliquid, an on-chain perpetual futures platform, announced hitting a new 24-hour all-time high spot volume of $3.4 billion, driven largely by rises in BTC and ETH deposits. 

The exchange now ranks as the second largest venue for spot BTC trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges, with $1.5 billion in 24-hour BTC volume alone. This surge reflects the growing traction of specialized blockchain-based trading ecosystems.

Meanwhile, in traditional markets, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) edged up 0.22% to 97.94 following a near 1% decline on Friday. Gold prices remained flat, while European stocks and S&P 500 futures traded lower, indicating a measured degree of investor risk aversion. Stay alert!

In the past few months the European Central Bank has frequently cited the expansive US approach to stablecoins as triggering urgency for a digital euro. It seems it is not alone. The 2024 central bank digital currency (CBDC) survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that a third of central banks have intensified efforts on their CBDC work in response to developments with stablecoins and other cryptoassets. Overall work on CBDC has declined a little, from 94% of central banks in 2023 to 91% in 2024. However, the drop was more significant in emerging markets. The definition of ‘work' includes research, pilots or working towards production initiatives.

The survey expanded its coverage from CBDC to include tokenization and briefly covers stablecoins and crypto. For stablecoins, most central banks reported trivial mainstream usage or use by niche groups, with around one fifth saying they are seeing some usage for domestic payments, remittances or cross border retail payments. However, a few emerging market central banks cited more significant usage, with cross border retail payments (2% of central banks) and remittances (4% of respondents) showing the highest responses.

Regarding legislation for stablecoins and crypto, 45% have already enacted legislation, with another 22% in the pipeline. Hence, soon two out of three economies will have rules of the road. Most jurisdictions – almost 80% – have adopted a bespoke approach, rather than relying on or repurposing existing legislation.

Bitcoin price fell below $112,000 as Japanese firm Metaplanet announced the purchase of 103 BTC worth $11.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 18,991 BTC ($2.2 billion), while simultaneously being upgraded to mid-cap status in the FTSE Japan Index. The move highlights the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies.

Bitcoin's price retreated below $112,000 as Japan's Metaplanet announced the purchase of an additional 103 BTC worth approximately $11.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 18,991 BTC valued at roughly $2.2 billion.

The announcement comes as FTSE Russell confirmed Metaplanet's inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index, upgrading the company from small-cap to mid-cap status in its September 2025 semi-annual review. The index inclusion, set to take effect after market close on September 19, marks a significant milestone for corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies.

“Another important milestone on our journey as Japan's leading Bitcoin treasury company,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich wrote on X (formerly Twitter). The company's aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC.

The latest purchase was partially funded through the exercise of 49,000 stock acquisition rights between August 18-22, which added 4.9 million shares to the company's total outstanding shares, now reaching 722 million. This financing mechanism, while diluting existing shareholders, enables continued Bitcoin accumulation without depleting cash reserves.

Metaplanet's inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index creates a regulated route for BTC exposure and paves the way for other Bitcoin-forward companies to join major benchmarks. Passive flows into the FTSE indices could channel institutional capital into Metaplanet, offering indirect Bitcoin exposure.

The company's transformation from a traditional hotel group to Asia's most active Bitcoin treasury firm reflects a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. In the past month alone, five public companies have announced significant Bitcoin treasury initiatives, including Ming Shing Group's $483 million purchase and KindlyMD's $679 million acquisition.

The integration of Bitcoin-heavy companies into traditional equity indices presents new challenges for institutional investors. While passive inflows through index inclusion could boost liquidity and long-term stability, large movements in Bitcoin prices could create unexpected volatility for passive investors.

Eric Trump, who joined Metaplanet as a strategic adviser in March, is expected to attend the company's next shareholder meeting in Tokyo in September. His involvement highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance and Bitcoin treasury strategies.

As more corporations adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies, the line between traditional equity investments and Bitcoin exposure continues to blur. Metaplanet's FTSE inclusion may serve as a template for other companies looking to balance Bitcoin treasury operations with mainstream market participation.

The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption shows no signs of slowing, with analysts expecting more companies to announce Bitcoin treasury initiatives in the coming months. This growing institutional acceptance, coupled with innovative financing structures, suggests that corporate Bitcoin holdings could become an increasingly significant factor in both equity and Bitcoin markets.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Ethereum dominates NFT market with 62% transactions in 2025, but BNB Chain, Mythos, Solana, and Immutable are rapidly gaining ground through specialized use cases and efficiency.

- BNB Chain leads in high-value NFT sales ($19.4M/week) with low fees, while Mythos outperforms Solana in transaction volume ($9.7M/week) via gaming and sports partnerships.

- Immutable focuses on secure gaming NFTs with 19,589 transactions/week, and Solana maintains broad user engagement despite rising competition from niche-focused chains.

- Emerging investment trends include hybrid NFTs, Bitcoin-based Ordinals, and utility-driven tokens, as diversified portfolios combining Ethereum and alternative chains become critical for long-term value capture.

 

The NFT market has entered a new era of diversification, with blockchain networks beyond Ethereum carving out significant niches in sales volume, transaction efficiency, and specialized use cases. While Ethereum remains the dominant force—accounting for 62% of NFT transactions in 2025—the rise of alternative chains like BNB Chain, Mythos, Solana, and Immutable is reshaping the landscape. These platforms are not only outperforming Ethereum in specific metrics but also offering compelling investment opportunities for forward-thinking investors.  

Ethereum's leadership in the NFT space is undeniable. In the week of August 22, 2025, it generated $56.57 million in NFT sales with 258,115 transactions, driven by a robust buyer-seller ratio of 55,264 to 48,631. Its ecosystem hosts blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks and Beeple's Everydays, which continue to command multimillion-dollar sales. OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, operates primarily on Ethereum and reported a trading volume of $14.68 billion in 2025. However, Ethereum's high gas fees and scalability limitations have spurred the growth of alternative blockchains.  

BNB Chain has emerged as a formidable competitor, particularly in high-value NFT trading. In the same week, it recorded $19.395 million in NFT sales with 81,667 transactions, outperforming Polygon's $15.716 million despite having fewer transactions. This suggests a shift toward larger individual sales on BNB Chain, driven by its low fees and fast processing times. BNB Chain's partnerships with NFT marketplaces and gaming platforms have further solidified its position. For investors, BNB Chain's focus on scalability and cross-chain interoperability makes it a strong candidate for long-term growth.  

Mythos, a Polkadot-based blockchain, has outpaced Solana in weekly NFT sales, achieving $9.704 million with 441,450 transactions. Its success stems from a dedicated NFT-centric ecosystem and strategic partnerships with sports franchises like FIFA Rivals and NFL Rivals. Mythos's low fees and high throughput have attracted developers and creators, positioning it as a hub for gaming and virtual fashion. For investors, Mythos's specialization in niche markets and its ability to process more transactions per user highlight its potential to disrupt the NFT gaming sector.  

Solana, while recording $7.984 million in weekly sales, maintains a larger user base with 48,856 buyers and 40,035 sellers. Its high transaction speed and low costs make it ideal for real-time NFT trading and gaming. However, Solana faces increasing competition from more specialized chains like Mythos. Investors should monitor Solana's ability to innovate in cross-chain integrations and developer tooling to sustain its relevance.  

Immutable has carved out a niche in gaming-oriented NFTs, generating $6.908 million in sales with 19,589 transactions. Its Immutable Passport system, which allows users to log in via social media, reduces entry barriers for new users. Partnerships with major game studios and its focus on secure, tamper-proof NFTs make it a compelling investment for those targeting the gaming sector.  

The diversification of the NFT market presents opportunities for investors to capitalize on emerging trends:1. Hybrid NFTs and Real-World Assets (RWAs): Platforms enabling the tokenization of physical assets (e.g., real estate, art) are gaining traction.2. Bitcoin-Based NFTs: The Ordinals protocol has opened Bitcoin to NFTs, expanding the market's reach.3. Utility-Driven NFTs: Platforms offering token-gated content, membership access, and redeemable rewards are seeing sustained engagement.  

While Ethereum's dominance is unlikely to wane, the rise of BNB Chain, Mythos, Solana, and Immutable underscores the NFT market's maturation. Investors should prioritize platforms with strong partnerships, innovative use cases, and scalable infrastructure. BNB Chain's high-value transactions, Mythos's gaming focus, and Immutable's secure NFTs offer distinct advantages in a rapidly evolving ecosystem. As the market continues to diversify, a balanced portfolio that includes both Ethereum and emerging chains will be key to capturing long-term value.

HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) a franchi une étape importante en dépassant les 16 EH/s de hashrate mondial pour le minage de Bitcoin, marquant des progrès notables vers son objectif de 25 EH/s d'ici Thanksgiving aux États-Unis. Depuis mai 2025, la société a doublé sa production quotidienne de Bitcoin pour atteindre plus de 8 BTC.

L'expansion de HIVE au Paraguay inclut plus de 5 EH/s de mineurs Bitmain S21+ Hydro de nouvelle génération déjà opérationnels dans la Phase 2 à Yguazú. La société s'attend à atteindre 18 EH/s dans les prochaines semaines, avec le déploiement de la Phase 3 à Valenzuela qui débutera en septembre. À 25 EH/s, HIVE prévoit une production quotidienne de Bitcoin de 12 BTC, représentant près de 3 % de l'offre mondiale à la difficulté réseau actuelle.

Avec un prix du Bitcoin à 113 000 $ et une difficulté réseau de 129T, la marge de minage de HIVE après les coûts électriques serait d'environ 60%, en fonctionnement avec une efficacité de flotte de 18,4 J/TH.

HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) hat einen wichtigen Meilenstein erreicht und die globale Bitcoin-Mining-Hashrate von 16 EH/s überschritten, womit es deutliche Fortschritte auf dem Weg zum Ziel von 25 EH/s bis zum US-Thanksgiving macht. Seit Mai 2025 hat das Unternehmen seine tägliche Bitcoin-Produktion auf über 8 BTC verdoppelt.

Die Expansion von HIVE in Paraguay umfasst über 5 EH/s an neuen Bitmain S21+ Hydro-Minern, die bereits in Phase 2 in Yguazú im Einsatz sind. Das Unternehmen erwartet, in den kommenden Wochen 18 EH/s zu erreichen; die Phase-3-Bereitstellung in Valenzuela beginnt im September. Bei 25 EH/s prognostiziert HIVE eine tägliche Bitcoin-Produktion von 12 BTC, was bei der aktuellen Netzwerkschwierigkeit fast 3 % des globalen Angebots entsprechen würde.

Bei einem Bitcoin-Preis von $113.000 und einer Netzwerkschwierigkeit von 129T läge die Mining-Marge von HIVE nach Stromkosten bei ungefähr 60%, betrieben mit einer Flotteneffizienz von 18,4 J/TH.

HIVE's Bitcoin mining capacity surge to 16 EH/s doubles daily production, with clear path to 25 EH/s and improved efficiency.

HIVE Digital Technologies has reached a significant operational milestone, scaling its Bitcoin mining capacity to 16 EH/s, more than doubling from earlier this year. This expansion has directly translated to a 100% increase in daily Bitcoin production to over 8 BTC compared to May levels.

The company's growth trajectory is particularly compelling for three reasons. First, they've achieved a rapid deployment in Paraguay, with 5 EH/s of next-generation Bitmain S21+ Hydro miners already energized. Second, they're demonstrating clear execution on their roadmap with Phase 2 at Yguazú nearing completion and Phase 3 at Valenzuela beginning in September. Third, they've improved their fleet efficiency to approximately 18.4 Joules per Terahash (J/TH), enhancing unit economics through better energy utilization.

At current network difficulty of 129T, each exahash generates approximately 0.50 BTC daily. This mathematically predictable relationship between hashrate and production means HIVE's projected 25 EH/s capacity would yield about 12 BTC daily, representing nearly 3% of global supply. The company's emphasis on using next-generation ASICs allows them to generate more hashrate per unit of energy consumed, effectively lowering their cost basis.

With Bitcoin trading at $113,000 and network metrics indicating a hash price of $55 per PH/s per day, HIVE projects a mining margin after electrical costs of approximately 60%. This calculation assumes an average electricity cost of $0.05 per kWh, which represents about 80-90% of their total mining operational expenses.

HIVE's fully-funded expansion demonstrates the scalability of their business model, with significant revenue growth potential without proportional increases in overhead or labor costs. The predictable economics of Bitcoin mining make this capacity expansion a direct driver of increased cash flow generation.

This news release constitutes a "designated news release for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2025, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated September 11, 2024.

San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - August 25, 2025) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the "Company" or "HIVE"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced that it has surpassed 16 Exahash per second ("EH/s") of global Bitcoin mining hashrate, marking another major milestone in its journey toward 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving.

This progress has lifted HIVE's daily Bitcoin output above 8 BTC, doubling the Company's production from May of this year. 

"Our rapid deployment in Paraguay is precision execution at scale and a true testament to the tenacity, velocity, and vision of our team," said Luke Rossy, HIVE's Chief Operating Officer. 

Rossy continued, "With over 5 EH/s of next-generation Bitmain S21+ Hydro miners already energized in Phase 2 at Yguazú, and new machines arriving weekly, our team, under the phenomenal leadership of Country President of Paraguay Operations, Gabriel Lamas, is working around the clock to install new machines as quickly as they arrive."

Deployment will then begin at the Phase 3 Valenzuela site in September, the final stage of HIVE's fully funded path to 25 EH/s. At which point, HIVE's daily Bitcoin production is projected to reach 12 BTC per day (based on current Bitcoin network difficulty), with HIVE having a global fleet efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH, representing nearly 3% of global supply at current network difficulty. The Company's expansion demonstrates the benefits of scale and energy efficiency, with the latest generation ASICs allowing HIVE to improve unit economics by generating more hashrate per joule of energy consumed, realizing additional revenue without additional labor or corporate overhead.

"The team continues to be laser-focused on executing our ambitious growth strategy. After scaling from 6 EH/s to 16 EH/s so far this year, we expect to complete Phase 2 at Yguazu on schedule, and reach 18 EH/s in the coming weeks," added Aydin Kilic, President & CEO. "Clean, green, and funded by our operations, our purpose is clear: to build resilient, decentralized infrastructure that secures the future of Bitcoin while generating robust, lasting cash flow for our shareholders."

Bitcoin mining economics are straightforward.  Miners can calculate the value of each incremental exahash with simple math based on the global network difficulty. At today's network Difficulty of 129T, one exahash generates approximately 0.50 BTC per day, including block rewards and transaction fees. This means that adding just 2 EH/s of new capacity translates into the addition of roughly 1.0 BTC per day. Similarly, in the previous epoch when Difficulty was 127T, one exahash generated approximately 0.51 BTC per day, including block rewards and transaction fees. This data is publicly available from Bitcoin block explorers, which make mining data available (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts#mining%20information is one example) . The daily revenue potential is a function of multiplying the amount of BTC mined per day by the then announced price of BTC.  From that revenue, the analyst subtracts costs to determine mining margin. The costs associated with our mining operations are approximately 80-90% electricity, depending on the site. Cost factors that vary include staff, real estate costs, and operating and maintenance expenses.  Electricity, our primary cost, varies by usage (mining) which means that it is tied to revenue.  

This transparency is what makes the mining industry unique.  Unlike many industry sectors where pricing power is uncertain or revenue forecasting is complex, Bitcoin miners know how each unit of computational power converts into economic output. The variables are public.  They include the block reward, the level of network difficulty, the global hashrate and the market price of Bitcoin. Each exahash deployed represents a measurable contribution to daily Bitcoin production and revenue. With disciplined capital allocation and access to low-cost energy, miners can translate scaling into predictable cash flow. In short, Bitcoin mining economics are not a mystery-they are mathematically determined, with all data being available through the Bitcoin blockchain network statistics, widely available through many popular Bitcoin block explorers. In today's environment, every exahash matters.  We strongly encourage investors in our industry to become familiar with the economic framework of Bitcoin mining.  We especially encourage investors to examine our operating costs, as reflected in our quarterly and annual filings.  

Once Phase 2 at the Yguazú site is fully complete in the coming weeks, HIVE expects to surpass 11.5 EH/s of capacity in Paraguay, with a global total operating hashrate of 18 EH/s, while improving global fleet efficiency to approximately 18.4 Joules per Terahash ("J/TH").  This energy efficiency is a measure of unit economics, representing how much energy the Company uses to produce one Terahash of Bitcoin compute.  Because electricity is our primary cost, this indicator is central to understanding the profitability of HIVE's operations.   With Bitcoin price at $113,000 and Difficulty at 129T, the Bitcoin network hash price is approximately $55 per PH/s per day, with a global fleet efficiency of 18.4 J/TH, and HIVE's mining margin after electrical costs* would be approximately 60%. One resource to reference Bitcoin hash price is the Bitcoin Hashprice Index (https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/bitcoin-hashprice-index).

* As used herein, "Mining Margin" is calculated by dividing the mining profit (revenue generated from mining activities minus power costs related to those activities) by the total revenue generated from mining activities and expressed as a percentage.  In mining, the most significant expense is power costs, in this estimate we are assuming an average of 5 cents per KWHR for indicative purposes. "ARR", as a metric, represents revenue only, and does not represent profitability.  ARR is presented here as a measure of growth. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with and should not be viewed as alternatives to or replacements for measures of operating results and liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP in HIVE's quarterly and annual financial statements. All financial projections reflect current market sentiment and public disclosures as of August 2025; actual outcomes may vary. Investors should conduct their own due diligence.

Blockchains scaled—and then splintered. Liquidity scattered across L2s, bridges kept breaking, and “data availability” turned into the new bottleneck. Avail wants to solve all three at once. Founded to deliver verifiable, scalable data availability, the project now positions itself as a full-stack unification layer: a DA base, Nexus for proof-based interoperability, and Fusion for shared security that can restake ETH, BTC, and rollup tokens. The thesis is simple but ambitious: developers should build once and scale everywhere; users shouldn't have to think about chains at all.

In this CryptoSlate Q&A, Avail co-founder Anurag Arjun walks us through how that thesis is moving from roadmap to reality. We start with a real-world stress test: Sophon's $60 million node sale, which extended Avail's light client to production scale and hinted at new, verifiable fundraising primitives for app-specific chains. From there, we dig into EnigmaDA—encrypted data availability designed to meet institutional privacy mandates without re-introducing trusted intermediaries—along with how banks and TradFi pilots can reconcile encryption, key management, and auditability on-chain.

Interoperability is the other pillar. Rather than another bridge, Nexus promises “one SDK, nine chains, no network switching,” aiming to route flows across multichain stablecoin and DeFi liquidity while minimizing replay and quorum risks with TEE and ZK verification. On the user side, Avail's light client targets <1 MB/s bandwidth and runs on phones and browsers via data-availability sampling and validity proofs—pushing “a full node in your pocket” toward emerging markets.

We also explore the speed-vs-decentralization trade-offs behind TurboDA's 250 ms pre-confirmations and the team's “infinity blocks” research goal of 10 GB blocks in ~600 ms; the validator-set growth path from 105 validators and a Nakamoto coefficient of 34; and what Avail is learning from flagship deployments like Lens Chain (650k profiles) and Sophon. With 50+ integrations in the queue, Arjun outlines how Avail triages partners for technical fit, ecosystem value, and compliance—plus how community growth (600k+ members in year one) is anchored in builder activity rather than vanity metrics.

If Avail is right, the next phase of crypto won't be “L2 vs. L2” but app-centric rollups speaking a common, proof-based language—privacy-aware when needed, credibly neutral by design, and finally usable at internet scale. Read on for the full conversation.

Sophon adapted Avail's light client to power its $60 million node sale. What did this deal teach you about Avail's scalability and developer UX, and what other “real-world money” milestones can we expect next?

The Sophon partnership was a pivotal moment; they needed custom light client infrastructure that could handle massive scale for their node sale and support their validium architecture, which Avail delivered. This proved our technology is not just capable of supporting live networks, it extended the scope of Avail, offering a tangible way to help projects with fundraising.

What it taught us: Our validity proof based architecture can scale to deliver mathematical certainty to all participants in the network. Networks can both fundraise and scale on this technology, even with minimal technical skills (normally running verifying nodes requires server based infra and experience with the command line).The developer UX enabled Sophon to extend the existing light client and add features without friction.

This has sparked a trend with more projects looking to Avail's light client infrastructure to not only support verifiable data requirements but also expand on the fundraising use case pioneered by Sophon.

EnigmaDA lets rollups post fully encrypted blobs while still proving data integrity. How does this satisfy TradFi privacy mandates (KYC, trade confidentiality) without re-introducing central points of trust?

Rollups can post fully encrypted data blobs while cryptographically proving data integrity and availability. The encryption happens at the application layer, so sensitive information is never exposed to the public,  which satisfies regulatory mandates.

However it still uses Avail's public infrastructure as the network to move and verify the data, even without knowledge of what the data is or publicly exposing it. This way, L2s can decide on their privacy model while leveraging Avail's public DA infrastructure. This gives institutions blockchain benefits without introducing new trust assumptions or central failure points.

Avail now markets itself as a full-stack unification layer (DA + Nexus + Fusion). What pain points convinced you to go wider instead of doubling down on DA alone?

The goal of Avail has always been to enable a connected and thriving blockchain ecosystem. This started with a scalable and cryptographically verifiable DA layer because that was the most prominent choke point at the time. However, once you solve that problem, you end up in the situation with a lot of L2s and a further exacerbated fragmentation problem. How will all the liquidity connect? Nexus is our solution to this problem, enabling both ecosystems that are native to Avail, and outside it, to interoperate freely.

The first version of Nexus for example enables interoperability between 9 networks on mainnet, and the only one of those that's native to Avail is Sophon. So through this integration, Sophon (and other Avail Native chains) automatically tap into the multi-chain liquidity enabled by Nexus ($145 Billion in multichain stablecoin TVL and $95 Billion in multichain DeFi TVL). That's what true scaling looks like.

Bridges break; Nexus promises “one SDK, 9 chains, no network switching.” Under the hood, how does Nexus avoid the replay, quorums, and liquidity-fragmentation risks that still plague most bridge tech?

Nexus will offer a comprehensive crosschain solution leveraging TEE and ZK verification that ensures solving fragmentation doesn't compromise the trust and security that make blockchains valuable. We have more to share on this in the coming months.

The result is a system where one SDK integration provides access to multiple chains without requiring users to switch networks, manage multiple wallets, or navigate complex bridging interfaces. Developers integrate once and immediately gain access to users and liquidity across all connected chains, while users experience seamless cross-chain interactions without ever leaving their preferred interface.

Is the future a mesh of “app-centric L2s” all speaking via Nexus-style proofs? What stops competing DA layers from forking the idea?

The future we're building centers on app-centric rollups communicating through proof-based interoperability protocols. Think of this evolution as similar to how TCP/IP became the universal communication protocol for the internet, a standardized approach that enables seamless interaction between diverse systems without requiring them to understand each other's internal architecture. This meta-interoperability layer abstracts away blockchain complexity while maintaining the security and decentralization benefits that make blockchain technology valuable.

This approach becomes the new standard because it aligns with fundamental market demands. Developers consistently express the desire to build once and scale everywhere, rather than rebuilding applications for each blockchain ecosystem. Users expect seamless experiences without needing to understand which chain powers their applications, similar to how internet users don't think about which servers host websites. Economic efficiency emerges through shared liquidity pools and composability across chains, creating network effects that benefit all participants in the ecosystem.

Forking a concept is easy, but the foundation matters. Avail delivers the most elegant, production-ready scaling foundation today, eliminating infrastructure centralization and bottlenecks while paving the way for mass adoption. Avail's technology has been in development for over 4 years and that institutional knowledge is not easy to fork.

Your community hit 600k+ members in Year 1, no small feat in a brutal market. What specific programs or narratives drove that growth, and how do you prevent community bloat from turning into empty hype?

The foundation of our 600K+ member community was built through comprehensive developer education including extensive resources, hackathons, and grants that empowered builders to create applications they couldn't build elsewhere. People joined because our infrastructure enabled genuine utility, from Lens Protocol's social applications to Sophon's gaming ecosystem rather than speculative promises.

Transparent communication has been crucial to our authentic growth. Instead of pure marketing messaging, we provide regular updates on technical progress, sharing both breakthroughs and challenges. This honesty builds trust and attracts community members who understand the technology's real potential. Additionally, our ecosystem benefits create tangible value for community members who see direct advantages from our partnerships and integrations, making their involvement meaningful beyond token appreciation.

To prevent hype bloat, we focus relentlessly on engagement metrics over vanity numbers. Active developers building on our infrastructure, meaningful partnerships that drive real usage, and genuine transaction volume matter far more than follower counts. Our community programs are designed to reward actual contribution, whether through development, education, or ecosystem building, rather than just participation.

With 11 chains live and 50 + queued, what criteria decide who gets in next? How do you vet TradFi-facing dApps for compliance before they tap EnigmaDA? 

With 50+ chains queued for integration, we maintain selective criteria focused on quality and strategic fit rather than simply maximizing numbers. Our chain integration process evaluates four key areas: technical compatibility to ensure new chains can properly support our proof systems and security model; ecosystem value that brings unique use cases or significant user bases to strengthen the overall network; development maturity demonstrated through active development teams with clear roadmaps; and community alignment with values that match our unification vision rather than fragmentation.

Our technical review covers proper implementation of EnigmaDA's encryption features, ensuring sensitive data remains protected while maintaining cryptographic guarantees. We require security audits for applications handling sensitive or institutional use cases, and establish ongoing monitoring capabilities for compliance tracking and reporting to meet regulatory standards.

The fundamental goal isn't maximizing the quantity of integrations,  it's building an ecosystem where every addition strengthens the entire network. Each new chain or application should enhance interoperability, bring new users or use cases, and align with our vision of seamless blockchain connectivity.

Avail's light client claims to run on phones, smart-watches, even browsers, using <1 MB/s bandwidth. What cryptographic shortcuts make that possible, and how big a deal is this for emerging-market adoption?

For decentralized technologies, this is a necessity. What we've done with the Avail Light Client is entirely novel. The light client conducts Data Availability Sampling (DAS) verifying validity proofs from KZG Polynomial commitments. In simple terms, it uses math to check the network is operating correctly, and your phone can find out for itself when it's not. This is what extends the capability of a full-node to a user's pocket.

Traditional light clients rely on a trusted full-node, but because we have DAS and validity proofs (along with erasure coding and some other technologies) we remove the necessity for Avail light clients to have a trusted full node that they're connected to – they instead sample the network directly. We believe this is the only way to create a scalable blockchain ecosystem that extends full node capabilities to every network user.

Speed is addictive, but does slashing block times compromise liveness or validator diversity? Where's the sweet spot between UX and decentralization?

TurboDA offers a fast pre-confirmation which gives immediate UX benefits, however Avail's block time (to date) is still 20 seconds. There is a constant tension between UX and decentralization, but the goal is to improve the decentralized technology to a point where the UX doesn't suffer.

This is why our infinity blocks roadmap has taken a radically different approach to achieving scale, speed and decentralization – aimed at achieving 10GB blocks in 600ms without any centralized infrastructure. This is one of the areas our development team is working hard on, and we've already begun implementing the core foundations.

For banks experimenting with tokenized deposits, how do encrypted blobs, key-management, and auditability co-exist on EnigmaDA?

With EnigmaDA, Avail's encrypted Data Availability upgrade, institutions can encrypt their data before posting to the base layer, keeping sensitive transaction data confidential while maintaining public availability and verifiability

Lens Chain (650 k profiles) and Sophon both stake their core infra on Avail. What have these deployments exposed as the next technical bottlenecks? 

Avail DA is sound and reliable. While we have other projects underway to improve throughput, speed and interoperability, the existing DA infrastructure is extremely solid as it is.

You're at 105 validators and a Nakamoto coefficient of 34. What's the roadmap to triple those numbers without killing performance?

The Nominated Proof of Stake architecture that Avail's mainnet is built on is capable of handling higher validator numbers which will continue to grow as the ecosystem expands.

Benchmarks show 128 MB today and an ambition for 10 GB / 600 ms tomorrow. What engineering breakthroughs (erasure-coding, blob markets, state pruning) must land before that's main-net ready?

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Bitcoin dipped over the weekend following a short-lived rally, as analysts suggested that large holders were shifting their positions from bitcoin to Ethereum.

According to The Block's crypto price page, bitcoin dropped 2.12% to $112,692 as of 12:26 a.m. ET on Sunday. The cryptocurrency had fallen to a low of around $112,500 on Sunday.

Bitcoin's recent drop follows a surge above $117,000 last Friday. The brief rally was fueled by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments at Jackson Hole, where he hinted at a possible interest rate cut in September.

"Bitcoin's [spike] after Powell's speech was driven by thin liquidity, not lasting conviction," said Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu. "Once leverage unwound and no fresh catalysts emerged, momentum quickly faded, leaving BTC back below key levels."

Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that bitcoin's retreat reflects a "market recalibration" as lingering market uncertainties overshadowed Powell's dovish speech.

Meanwhile, posts circulating on social media platform X suggested that a single whale sold over 24,000 BTC over the past several days, causing a "flash crash" in bitcoin price.

According to screenshots shared by WhaleWire CEO Jacob King, wallet address "19D5J…WoZ1C" moved multiple bulks of bitcoin ranging from 3,000 BTC to 6,000 BTC to different addresses across Aug. 16 to 24.

"Once the whale started selling, it triggered a panic cascade, with other traders selling too, amplifying the crash," King said on X. "Most of the money is being moved into Ethereum, $2B bought and $1.3B staked."

However, Kronos' Liu told The Block that it is difficult to pinpoint a "single culprit" when it comes to bitcoin price.

"It's more likely the work of multiple whales or an exchange with significant holdings, rather than a single entity," Liu said. "Large-scale transactions like this often involve institutional players or coordinated actions."

In recent weeks, the market has seen some major holders switching out their bitcoin holdings for Ethereum. 

Last Friday, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet recently rotated part of its 100,784 BTC to buy 62,914 ETH and establish a 135,265 ETH derivatives long position.



Spot exchange-traded funds have shown a similar trend among institutional investors, where ether ETFs have seen larger inflows compared to smaller inflows or outflows spotted among BTC ETFs in August.

"With ETH ETF staking approval on the horizon, expect increased staking activity and potential altcoin outperformance," Liu said. "Ethereum's poised to take center stage."

LVRG's Ruck also said that he sees a trend of high-value holders selling BTC for ETH, betting on Ethereum's upward potential backed by growing corporate reserves.

Bitcoin dominance is currently at 57.94%, down from around 61% at the beginning of this month, suggesting that investors are shifting their focus to altcoins. Ethereum is currently trading at around $4,712, after setting a new all-time high last Friday above $4,946.

In the short to medium term, the market will likely see more volatility as traders keep a more keen eye on key macroeconomic data including Thursday's initial jobless claims, Liu noted.

Bitcoin fees plummet to decade-lows as traders and investors appear to be rotating capital into altcoins.



Bitcoin fees have fallen to their lowest level in more than a decade, reflecting weaker demand. Altcoins are attracting capital as BTC holders diversify, though long-term conviction remains notable.

Bitcoin's [BTC] price action has witnessed fading momentum on its price action recently. Glassnode data indicated that the daily Bitcoin transaction fees, measured on a 14-day average, have dropped to just 3.5 BTC.

The last time fees were this low was in late 2011, when the network was still in its early stages.



The drop points to a shrinking market activity on the chain, suggesting that demand for block space has faded considerably over the past weeks.

Interestingly, alongside the fading transaction fees, the number of active sending addresses has spiked over the last 48 hours according to AMBCrypto's of CryptoQuant data.

This spike in active sending addresses usually signals holders moving coins out of their wallets — often to re-balance or take positions elsewhere.

The timing looks perfect.

Most major altcoins have logged strong gains in the same period, which adds weight to the idea that investors are rotating capital away from Bitcoin in search of higher short-term returns.

Despite the aforementioned on-chain developments, Bitcoin has also recorded a sharp rise in exchange outflows over the past week.

Analysts interpreted that as a bullish sign, since long-term holders move assets into self-custody. But when paired with the uptick in sending activity, the picture becomes less clear.

Part of those outflows could still be headed into altcoins rather than cold storage, reflecting a wider repositioning across the market.

Source: CryptoQuant

All in all, the BTC metrics suggests a market in transition.

Bitcoin appears to be losing some trading momentum to altcoins, which have been the stronger performers over the last 48 hours.

However, the exchange outflows still hint that long-term confidence in BTC has not disappeared.

The discovery changes the whole timeline of the collapse.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Interamna Lirenas has turned out to be far more than a “backwater town” of the Roman Empire. According to a published study in Roman Urbanism in Italy, this central Italian town thrived well beyond previous belief, using its impressive urban features and forward-thinking design to stave off the effects of the empire's collapse well into the 3rd century AD. 

“We started with a site so unpromising that no one had ever tried to excavate it,” Alessandro Launaro, the study's author and Interamna Lirenas Project lead at the University of Cambridge's Classics Faculty, said in a statement. “That's very rare in Italy.” 

The team was astonished by what they found. From a roofed theater and market locations to warehouses and a river port, the discovery tossed aside assumptions previously held about the area and the decline of Roman Italy. It turns out that Interamna Lirenas survived for around 300 years longer than previously believed, and was a flourishing town to boot. 

“There was nothing on the surface, no visible evidence of buildings, just bits of broken pottery,” Launaro said. “But what we discovered wasn't a backwater, far from it. We found a thriving town adapting to every challenge thrown at it for 900 years.” 

The team of archaeologists used magnetic and ground-penetrating radar to survey roughly 60 acres of mostly open fields. They then launched a series of targeted excavations to unearth the history. “We're not saying that this town was special, it's far more exciting than that,” Launaro sadi. “We think many other average Roman towns in Italy were just as resilient. It's just that archaeologists have only recently begun to apply the right techniques and approaches to see this.” 

The team believes that the proof is in the pottery. By focusing on common ware pottery used for cooking—and not the imported pottery that often shows evidence of high-status living—the team could better map the location and dates of citizen movement in the region. This evidence showed that instead of the town's size peaking in the late 2nd or early 1st centuries BC, as previously believed, the town staved off decline until the later part of the 3rd century AD. 

“Based on the relative lack of imported pottery,” Launaro said, “archeologists have assumed that Interamna Lirenas was a declining backwater. We now know that wasn't the case.” Instead of favoring imported pottery, the town—which was likely home to about 2,000 residents—was busy making their own way. 

Thanks to a found inscription, researchers also believe that the town was likely visited by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, likely because Intermana Lirenas was part of a regional urban network and ideally situated between a river and major road. 

“This town continually played its cards right,” Launaro said, “it was always forging relations with communities between Rome and southern Italy while thriving as a trading hub.” Of course, the River Liri may have helped in that department—the town may have served as a river port. Archeologists also found evidence of warehouse measuring 131 feet by 39 feet, which was likely used to hold goods for widespread trade. There was also a temple and bath complex—one of three in the town—near the port. 

“River ports didn't just need warehouses,” Launaro said. “People spent a lot of time working and resting in the vicinity, so they needed all kinds of amenities, just like the ones we found here.”  

Interamna Lirenas wasn't just a port, though. Archaeologists also found a roofed theater, roughly 147 feet by 85 feet in size and large enough to seat 1,500 visitors. “The fact that this town went for a roofed theater, such a refined building, does not fit with a backwater in decline,” Launaro said. “This theater was a major status symbol. It displayed the town's wealth, power, and ambition.” 

The theater was in a state of growth, not decline. The team found evidence of a wealthy donor backing what was likely an improvement to the structure. And combined with other evidence, that shows that the theater was in full use throughout the life of the town. 

Three bath complexes—with evidence of continued use and upkeep beyond Roman Italy's decline—and housing that showed no signs of zoning or separation by social status further contributed to the town's apparently thriving status. Throughout the 60 acres of their survey,  the team identified 19 courtyard buildings that they believe could have been markets, guild houses, warehouses, or apartments. The archaeologists believe they found a sheep and cattle market, which would have been key to the region's thriving wool trade. 

As there was no layer of ash or evidence of a violent end to the town, Launaro believes that it was eventually abandoned as residents grew fearful of marauding armies. The end of Interamna Lirenas wasn't as sudden or as soon as previously believed, which has now opened a new world of understanding.

The rapid growth in artificial intelligence and modern communication systems demands innovative solutions for increased computational power and advanced signalling capabilities. Integrated photonics, leveraging the analogue nature of electromagnetic waves at the chip scale, offers a promising complement to approaches based on digital electronics. To fully unlock their potential as analogue processors, establishing a common technological base between conventional digital electronics and analogue photonics is imperative for building next-generation computing and communications systems. However, the absence of an efficient interface has thus far critically challenged a comprehensive demonstration of the advantages of analogue photonic hardware, with the scalability, speed and energy consumption as primary bottlenecks. Here we address this challenge and demonstrate a general electro-optic digital-to-analogue link enabled using foundry-based lithium niobate nanophotonics. Using purely digital electronic inputs, we achieve the on-demand generation of both analogue optical and electronic waveforms at information rates of up to 186 Gb s−1. The optical waveforms address the digital-to-analogue electro-optic conversion challenge in photonic computing, showcasing high-fidelity Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology image encoding with an ultralow power consumption of 0.058 pJ b−1. The electronic waveforms enable a pulse-shaping-free microwave arbitrary waveform generation method with ultrabroadband tunable delay and gain. Our results pave the way for efficient and compact digital-to-analogue conversion paradigms enabled by integrated photonics, and underscore the transformative impact that analogue photonic hardware may have on various applications, such as computing, optical interconnects and high-speed ranging.

Genetically engineered pig lungs have not previously been transplanted into humans, leaving key questions unanswered regarding the human immune response in the context of a xenotransplanted lung and the possibility of hyperacute rejection. Here, we report a case of pig-to-human lung xenotransplantation, in which a lung from a six-gene-edited pig was transplanted into a 39-year-old brain-dead male human recipient following a brain hemorrhage. The lung xenograft maintained viability and functionality over the course of the 216 hours of the monitoring period, without signs of hyperacute rejection or infection. Severe edema resembling primary graft dysfunction was observed at 24 hours after transplantation, potentially due to ischemia–reperfusion injury. Antibody-mediated rejection appeared to contribute to xenograft damage on postoperative days 3 and 6, with partial recovery by day 9. Immunosuppression included rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, basiliximab, rituximab, eculizumab, tofacitinib, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and tapering steroids, with adjustments made during the postoperative period based on assessments of immune status. Although this study demonstrates the feasibility of pig-to-human lung xenotransplantation, substantial challenges relating to organ rejection and infection remain, and further preclinical studies are necessary before clinical translation of this procedure.

The ATLAS Collaboration finds evidence of Higgs-boson decays to muons and improves sensitivity to Higgs-boson decays to a Z boson and a photon.

Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, physicists have made major strides in exploring its properties. Does that mean the subject is done and dusted? Far from it! In new results presented at the 2025 European Physical Society Conference on High Energy Physics (EPS-HEP), the ATLAS Collaboration narrowed in on two exceptionally rare Higgs-boson decays using data collected in Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These studies offer deep insights into how closely the Higgs boson's behaviour aligns with the Standard Model.

The first process under study was the Higgs-boson decay into a pair of muons (H→μμ). Despite its scarceness - occurring in just 1 out of every 5000 Higgs decays - this process provides the best opportunity to study the Higgs interaction with second-generation fermions and shed light on the origin of mass across different generations. The second investigated process was the Higgs-boson decay into a Z boson and a photon (H→Zγ), where the Z boson subsequently decays into electron or muon pairs. This rare decay is especially intriguing, as it proceeds via an intermediate "loop" of virtual particles. If new particles contribute to this loop, the process could offer hints of physics beyond the Standard Model.

Looking for needles in a haystack

Identifying these rare decays is quite the challenge. For H→μμ, researchers looked for a small excess of events clustering near a muon-pair mass of 125 GeV (the mass of the Higgs boson). This signal can be easily hidden behind the thousands of muon pairs produced through other processes ("background").

The H→Zγ decay is even harder to isolate, as the chances of spotting its signal are complicated by the fact that the Z boson only decays into detectable leptons about 6% of the time. Compounding the challenge are the operation conditions of LHC Run 3, which features more overlapping collisions, making it easier for particle jets to mimic real photons.

To boost the sensitivity of their searches, ATLAS physicists combined the first three years of Run-3 data (165 fb-1, collected between 2022-2024) with the full Run-2 dataset (140 fb-1, from 2015-2018). They also developed a sophisticated method to better model background processes, categorised recorded events by the specific Higgs-production modes, and made further improvements to their event-selection techniques in order to maximize the likelihood of spotting genuine signals.

Finding evidence and enhancing sensitivity

In the previous search for H→μμ using the full Run-2 dataset, the ATLAS Collaboration saw its first hint of this process at the level of 2 standard deviations. The comparable CMS result reached an observed (expected) significance of 3 (2.5) standard deviations. Now, with the combined Run-2 and Run-3 datasets, the ATLAS Collaboration has found evidence for H→μμ with an observed (expected) significance over the background-only hypothesis of 3.4 (2.5) standard deviations. This means that the chance that the result is a statistical fluctuation is less than one in 3000!

As for the H→Zγ process, a previous ATLAS and CMS combined analysis used Run-2 data to find evidence of this decay mode. It reported an observed (expected) excess over the background-only hypothesis of 3.4 (1.6) standard deviations. The latest ATLAS result, combining Run-2 and Run-3 data, reported an observed (expected) excess over the background-only hypothesis of 2.5 (1.9) standard deviations. This outcome provides the most stringent expected sensitivity to date for measuring the decay probability ("branching fraction") of H→Zγ.

These achievements were made possible by the large, excellent dataset provided by the LHC, the outstanding efficiency and performance of the ATLAS experiment, and the use of novel analysis techniques. With more data on the horizon, the journey of exploration continues!

The research, published in the academic journal Nature, represents an essential step in quantum computing and demonstrates its potential by directly simulating fundamental interactions with Google's quantum processor. In the future, researchers could use this approach to gain deeper insights into particle physics, quantum materials, and even the nature of space and time itself. The aim is to understand how nature works at its most fundamental level, described by so-called gauge theories.

"Our work shows how quantum computers can help us explore the fundamental rules that govern our universe," says co-author Michael Knap, Professor of Collective Quantum Dynamics at the TUM School of Natural Sciences. "By simulating these interactions in the laboratory, we can test theories in new ways."

Pedram Roushan, co-author of this work from Google Quantum AI emphasizes: "Harnessing the power of the quantum processor, we studied the dynamics of a specific type of gauge theory and observed how particles and the invisible 'strings' that connect them evolve over time."

Tyler Cochran, first author and graduate student at Princeton, says: "By adjusting effective parameters in the model, we could tune properties of the strings. They can fluctuate strongly, become tightly confined, or even break." He explains that the data from the quantum processor reveals the hallmark behaviors of such strings, which have direct analogs to phenomena in high-energy particle physics. The results underscore the potential for quantum computers to facilitate scientific discovery in fundamental physics and beyond.

Some of the most credible encounters with nonhuman aircraft have happened over the world's oceans. Now, the witnesses want answers. 

In mid-2014, during training flights off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia, F/A-18 pilot and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves began to notice something strange. The radar returns looked off—phantom blips moving with unfathomable speed and precision. At first he dismissed it as a glitch. But then the anomalies returned, recorded by the fighter jets' sophisticated sensors. They would hover in place—and then dart away at supersonic speeds. They were recorded from the ocean's surface to 40,000 feet.

“Sometimes stationary—0.0 Mach. Other times 250 to 350 knots . . .. Sometimes even supersonic—1.1 to 1.2 Mach. All altitudes. And always over the ocean,” Graves says. 

After appearing only as glitches on the jets' radar, the objects on one occasion finally came into view. Graves reported seeing a dark gray or black cube inside a clear sphere, between five and 15 feet in diameter, coming within 50 feet of their jets. “That was the turning point,” Graves says. “We started treating it as a safety issue.”

Over the next year, Graves's squadron recorded sightings of unidentified objects almost daily. Sometimes the objects flew in loose formations. Other times they traveled alone. They had no exhaust, no visible propulsion, no wings. Sometimes the object would rotate in place; others vanished when approached. As it turned out, pilots stationed off the West Coast—on missions aboard the USS Nimitz, the USS Princeton, and other carriers—had been experiencing similar things for years.

Some of these craft—now classified as UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena)—appeared to be capable of transmedium travel, meaning they are able to move from air to sea without slowing, splashing, or emitting heat. They challenged every assumption held by aerospace engineers and radar operators. 

Graves doesn't claim to know what the objects were. But one thing was clear. “This wasn't business as usual,” he says. “There was a serious issue at play. It wasn't just one rogue object. It wasn't just us on the East Coast. It wasn't just my squadron. It was a pattern. This was global.” 

Since at least the 1950s, military sources have reported strange objects plunging into the ocean—what they call USOs (unidentified submerged objects). These phenomena exhibit characteristics that conflict with our understanding of physics and maritime navigation. As radar and similar technologies have advanced, so have the number of sightings.

Today Graves is one of the most vocal advocates for UAP transparency. Now retired from the military, he's the founder of Americans for Safe Aerospace, the largest UAP-focused pilot safety initiative in the world, and works with former Pentagon and naval officials to push for greater transparency. He doesn't claim that these craft are alien, but he's certain that they aren't using known human tech. “Where that leaves us opens up options—extraterrestrial visitors, time travelers, breakaway civilizations . . . things that challenge the status quo and aren't easily accepted at face value,” he says.

Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet, PhD, an oceanographer, was one of the first to view footage from the UAP incidents in 2015 involving fighter jets attached to the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which at the time was conducting training exercises off the coast of Florida. Two videos captured by Navy fighter jets that were made public in 2020 show strange craft flying at incredible speeds with no visible means of propulsion, sometimes rotating in midair. “I knew then that what I saw was not our technology. We don't test experimental aircraft in training ranges—it's too dangerous—and I had access to everything classified. No nation has craft that can move like that,” he says.

Gallaudet, now retired from the Navy and currently the CEO of Ocean STL Consulting, is pushing for the U.S. government to treat these phenomena as a “national research priority.” Despite some public disclosures, many records remain classified, buried within defense contractor vaults or shielded by national security exemptions. If even part of what's been reported is true, then the encounters off Virginia, California, and elsewhere could be the opening chapter in a much deeper mystery—one that spans oceans, navies, and continents.

This spring, Graves and Gallaudet briefed officials in Washington, D.C., on unidentified submerged objects. “We're at a unique moment in history,” Graves says. “People have access to tools that can reveal things. The momentum is building.”

That momentum has already begun reshaping policy. In 2023, Congress passed the UAP Disclosure Act, legislation requiring federal agencies to collect, catalog, and disclose records related to recovered nonhuman craft and biologics. For the first time, U.S. law openly acknowledged the potential existence of off-world or nonhuman intelligence, and even hinted at craft retrieval and reverse engineering programs.

Those newly released records contain a trove of details on previously classified encounters with multiple transmedium UAPs. None definitively prove that otherworldly beings are hiding in or above our oceans, but they do raise questions that neither our military nor scientific experts can explain. 

“The possibility that they exist underwater is very real,” Gallaudet says. “They could come from another galaxy, if they've conquered the engineering challenge of that,” he says. “Or why not—maybe they lived here for a long time, before we even evolved, and sought safety from the Earth's atmospheric and geologic cataclysms by creating a habitat or place to live beneath the seafloor. . .. That's one hypothesis.”

The following four incidents have provided investigators with the most compelling—and perplexing—evidence so far of transmedium encounters with what experts like Gallaudet believe could be nonhuman in origin. 

USS Nimitz, 2004

In November 2004, several U.S. Navy pilots assigned to the USS Nimitz encountered a Tic Tac–shaped UAP darting and dashing over the Pacific. According to reports that followed, the object lacked visible control surfaces and heat signatures that would be typical of jet aircraft or rockets. It never made a sonic boom, although it appeared to be traveling faster than the speed of sound.

The incident began when the USS Princeton, a guided-missile cruiser escorting the Nimitz off the coast of San Diego, picked up strange radar contacts. The objects appeared at 80,000 feet, and then dropped to sea level in less than a second. F/A-18 Commander David Fravor and Lieutenant Commander Jim Slaight scrambled to intercept the object. Each man claims to have seen a smooth, white oblong object around 30 to 40 feet long, with no wings, no windows, no markings. It hung in the air just over the sea.

As Fravor circled downward, the object suddenly shot away, vanishing in seconds. “It just disappeared. Like a bullet out of a gun,” Fravor told Fox News.

The strike group dispatched a second flight. This time the object was captured on an infrared camera showing a white speck flying against the wind, rotating and maneuvering in ways no known aircraft can. 

Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, 2013

One of the most hotly debated encounters of an unidentified submerged object came in April 2013, when an infrared surveillance camera operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection captured something extraordinary over Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. A small spherical object flew inland from the ocean, crossed the airport, and then returned to sea—where it maneuvered in ways that appeared to defy physics. 

The three-minute video, published by the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies, has become a key piece of evidence suggesting the possibility of transmedium travel. It shows the object entering the water without slowing down—no splash, no wake, no disruption. Seconds later it resurfaces, splits in two, and then submerges again. Any object passing between two mediums should generate drag or turbulence or, at the very least, a splash, according to the laws of hydrodynamics. But this one behaved as if those laws didn't apply. 

“It's not that they break the laws,” Gallaudet says. “It's that they demonstrate engineering capabilities we haven't yet developed. We can't build anything that can do that today.”

“I've spoken with the pilots who saw it,” he adds. “The near-instantaneous acceleration of that craft is something we just can't engineer.” 

Caribbean Sea, Unspecified date

In the 1990s, a Navy CH-53 Sea Stallion pilot was flying off the coast of Puerto Rico when he saw something he couldn't explain. His crew, on a routine mission to retrieve a BQM target drone that had previously been dropped into the ocean, had sent a diver into the water to connect the drone to the helicopter's hoist system. But just before the helo was about to lift the 20-foot-long drone out of the sea, something pulled it violently downward. The pilot, whose name has not been disclosed, would later report that the object was a large, dark mass unlike any submarine or marine animal he'd ever seen. 

After F/A-18 Commander David Fravor went public with the previous incident he witnessed flying off the USS Nimitz, he says the Sea Stallion pilot contacted him to relay the story. Fravor then shared details on Joe Rogan's podcast in 2019. 

“The helo drops a swimmer in the water, he hooks the whole thing up, and they fly back,” Fravor said. “The first time they were out and they were going to pick up a BQM, he's sitting in the front—in the CH-53 you can see down by your feet—and as he's looking down, they're 50 feet above the water, he sees this kind of dark mass coming up from the depths.”

As the pilot picked up the BQM, he was apparently at a loss for words. “He's looking at this thing going, ‘What the hell is that?' And then it just goes back down underwater. Once they pull the kid and the BQM out of the water, this object descends back into the depths.”

USS Omaha, 2019

It began as a blip. In July 2019, an infrared camera aboard the USS Omaha captured something that defied explanation: a spherical object moving swiftly over the Pacific before dropping into the ocean—again, no splash, no wake, no debris. The footage, later verified by Pentagon officials, stunned observers. The object didn't resemble any known drone, missile, or aircraft. And its disappearance beneath the waves raised new questions about transmedium tech.

In the incident, the crew of the Omaha (which was also sailing off the San Diego coast) recorded a spherical UAP hovering just over the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The ship's sensor that caught the object was the sophisticated AN/KAX-2—a stabilized sensor turret built for maritime environments that includes a digital video camera, night vision camera, and laser rangefinder.

The video shows a recording of the AN/KAX-2 screen and appears to have been taken with a night vision camera. The object seemingly moves, tracked by the sensor operator, and then hovers just above the ocean's surface. Then the object disappears. 

“It looked nothing like any known aircraft,” Gallaudet says. “After I testified before Congress last year, a sailor who had been on the bridge of the Omaha contacted me. He said the object was just one of many—and that he'd witnessed a similar event aboard the USS Jackson in 2023.”

These cows have some serious bluestone ties.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists sliced open a Neolithic cow's molar, and now they believe they know quite a bit more about the history of Stonehenge.

This particular cow—or, at least, this particular cow's jawbone—was first found in 1924, buried right next to the legendary standing bluestones. The fact that it was found alongside Stonehenge' south entrance (in a prominent ritual location) suggested the animal's importance, and its remains were eventually dated to between 2995 and 2990 B.C. But while that provided the “when,” there were still questions unanswered about why the fossil would have been placed in such an honored position.

Recently, a team from the British Geological Survey, Cardiff University, and University College London used isotope analysis to track this history, chronicling the findings in a new study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.

To begin their inquiry, they sliced into the cow's third molar, since that tooth records chemical signals from the animal's second year of life. By creating nine horizontal sections of the tooth, the team was able to measure carbon, oxygen, strontium, and lead isotopes, each offering a clue regarding the cow's diet, environment, and movement.

Through this method, they were able to determine where this cow spent the early years of its life grazing—and it wasn't always in the fields near Stonehenge. With the data they gathered, these scientists were able to link the cattle's remains to Wales, adding weight to theories that cows played a role in getting the infamous rocks across the country to where they currently rest. 

“This is yet more fascinating evidence for Stonehenge's link with southwest Wales,” Michael Parker Pearson, professor of British later prehistory at the University College London, said in a statement, “where its bluestones come from. It raised the tantalizing possibility that cattle helped to haul the stones.”   

The oxygen isotopes show six months of growth—from winter to summer—and the carbon isotopes display how this cow's diet switched from woodland fodder in the winter to open pasture grazing in summer. Strontium isotopes indicated the seasonal food sources came from different geological areas, indicating that the cow either moved seasonally or the winter fodder was an imported delicacy. 

The lead isotopes revealed spikes in late winter and spring, pointing to a lead source older than the lead in the rest of the tooth. The researchers said this strongly suggests the cow originated from an area with Paleozoic rocks—possibly the same location as where the bluestones were before being moved to Stonehenge.  

“It tells us that very early in its life it incorporated lead into its skeleton and that lead was from old Paleozoic rocks, older than about 400 million years old,” Jane Evans, professor and British Geological Survey honorary research associate, told The Guardian. “Those types of rocks crop up primarily in Britain in Wales, which is the nearest supply, and also in the Lake District and Scotland. That suggest this animal, found in Wiltshire, didn't start life in that kind of area. It must have been grazing at some time on older rocks, and the obvious conclusion, given its Stonehenge, is that Wales is the probable origin of the cow's early life.” 

While the cows may not have been the ones hauling the stones, they were likely at least along for the journey. “I don't know how long it takes to drag stones from Wales to Stonehenge, but you need to be able to feed yourself and so it's going to be a big process,” Evans said. “You have got to have a huge support network to do it.” 

“This study has revealed unprecedented details of six months in a cow's life, providing the first evidence of cattle movement from Wales, as well as documenting dietary changes and life events that happened around 5,000 years ago,” Evans said in a statement. “A slice of one cow tooth has told us an extraordinary tale and, as new scientific tools emerge, we hope there is still more to learn from her long journey.”

Richard Madgwick, professor of archaeological science at Cardiff University, highlighted what makes this bovine approach important in a statement: “So often grand narratives dominate research on major archaeological sites, but this detailed biographical approach on a single animal provides a brand-new facet of the story of Stonehenge.”

AI optimists envision a future where artificial general intelligence (AGI) surpasses human intelligence, but the path remains riddled with scientific and logistical hurdles.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Once upon a time, the world seemed like it was made of larger building blocks. Rain fell from what looked like opaque, puffy masses that also blocked the Sun. The human body seemed self-contained and solid, and there wasn't a way to prove otherwise. Even when alchemists were melting pieces of ore, they thought mercury must be related to silver. How could it not be? They looked the same, after all.

We know that the universe itself moves toward disorder, but our knowledge of the universe moves toward the minuscule. Higher resolutions, more powerful zoom, electron microscopes, particle accelerators, nuclear energy. For technology, powering these levels of detail has fallen into the broad purview of computer chips—and computer chips have also gotten higher-resolution, in a sense.

On a basic level, computers use circuitry—carefully mapped series of connections between different conductive or semiconductive parts—to do tons of arithmetic. Early punchcards (predecessors to the chips we have now) had openings so that portions of circuitry could literally form a connection, like playing certain notes on the piano using certain fingers, or connecting phone lines on an old switchboard. But our knowledge of electronics has grown so minuscule that it's almost hard to fathom.

In the 1960s, in the midst of a global semiconductor boom, engineer Gordon Moore gave a presentation in which he made an observation. Moore was a cofounder of computer chip pioneer Intel, and it was there that he noticed that transistors—switches used to direct the current within electrical devices—were shrinking at a pretty consistent rate. This led to the 1958 invention of the integrated circuit, which could be installed in devices that were previously built one transistor at a time.

Moore showed a now-iconic graph of the number of components on an integrated circuit over time, which predicted an overall rate of growth of doubling about every two years between 1962 and his extrapolated 1970. In the accompanying lecture, he suggested this trend could actually last for the next ten years (until 1975). But Moore's Law, as it was later called, has held for decades past this initial forecast. It's been taught as canon in computer science programs around the world (even though it has never been, nor was it ever intended to be, a hard and fast rule).

1But for the last several years, those in the computing industry (and those who study it) have started to discuss the “end of Moore's Law.” There's a point at which transistors simply can't get any smaller because of the basics of physics itself—these tiny transistors must still be able to communicate with the rest of what's required to build an integrated circuit, be widely manufacturable, and stay cost effective.2

The slowdown of Moore's Law has been notable for a while. From MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL):

But that reality, and the reality of physics itself, is somewhat at odds with the widely promoted corporate technologies of 2025. Companies like OpenAI make opaque promises about how generative AI will change all of our lives, save us hours a week, and make many sectors of human labor obsolete. Venture capitalists have leveraged these promises to attract investors, while companies like Microsoft have started to force their employees to use generative AI in the workplace.

You can counter the slowing shrinkage of transistor design by simply making larger and larger computers. Manufacturers and generative AI companies are already doing this. They're also designing all other elements of these machines to be as efficient as possible. However, that's not a long-term solution to the growing demand for this amount of computing. Like leadership of the late Roman Empire or the icing on a dry cake, our computing components can't be spread too thin.

However, if you're rich and you don't like the idea of a limit on computing, you can turn to futurism, longtermism, or “AI optimism,” depending on your favorite flavor. People in these camps believe in developing AI as fast as possible so we can (they claim) keep guardrails in place that will prevent AI from going rogue or becoming evil. (Today, people can't seem to—or don't want to—control whether or not their chatbots become racist, are “sensual” with children, or induce psychosis in the general population, but sure.)

The goal of these AI boosters is known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. They theorize, or even hope for, an AI so powerful that it thinks like... well... a human mind whose ability is enhanced by a billion computers. If someone ever does develop an AGI that surpasses human intelligence, that moment is known as the AI singularity. (There are other, unrelated singularities in physics.) AI optimists want to accelerate the singularity and usher in this “godlike” AGI.

One of the key facts of computer logic is that, if you can slow the processes down enough and look at it in enough detail, you can track and predict every single thing that a program will do. Algorithms (and not the opaque AI kind) guide everything within a computer. Over the decades, experts have written the exact ways information can be sent, one bit—one minuscule electrical zap—at a time through a central processing unit (CPU).

From there, those bits are assembled into a slightly more concrete format as another type of code. That code becomes another layer, and another, until a solitaire game or streaming video or Microsoft Word document comes out. Networks work the same way, with your video or document broken into pieces, then broken down further and further until tiny packets of data can be carted back and forth as electrical zaps over lengths of wire.

The human brain is, in some ways, another piece of electrical machinery. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) quantifies it as an exaflop caliber computer: “a billion-billion (1 followed by 18 zeros) mathematical operations per second—with just 20 watts of power.” By this standard, you power dozens of human brains by plugging them into a single U.S. household outlet. NIST cites the world-class Oak Ridge Frontier supercomputer as requiring “a million times more power” to do the same level of computing.

It's possible that the human brain is also predictable when you understand all of its parts and influences enough. But our brains have little in common with the abstracted, mathematical way our computers are designed. The earliest computers were mechanical, with physical parts that visibly connected with and moved each other. And despite an iconic, massively influential paper stating otherwise, the cell is not like a machine. (Mitochondria, you can still be the “powerhouse!”)

The California Institute of Technology, Caltech, has a primer on how the brain works:

There are countless ways the human brain could be boosted or hindered by factors we can't even measure yet. We don't even know why many common antidepressants and other medications work in the brain—just that they do. We can't predict when a particular turn of phrase or “certain slant of light“ will remind us of childhood, a popular TV show, what we had for dinner the other day, or a pair of shoes we used to wear. We are many years away from a diagrammatic understanding of the brain the way we understand manufactured computer parts.

Because of that gap in understanding, there's no guarantee that a certain amount of computing power comparable to a human brain (or even a million human brains) would become sentient or have consciousness. That seems especially true when aspiring “AI caretaker” engineers want their AIs to know everything from all of human history.

But let's say that efficiency or quantity of information isn't an issue. Let's say we can build one-million-exaflop computers to run advanced AIs that will mimic human think tanks. How does the end of Moore's Law affect scientists who work toward that technological singularity?

The answer is simple: size. That's both the size of electrical energy required and the physical size associated with storage, processing, cooling, and everything else required to keep a computer running. There are a few directions we could go to solve the size problem, but none of them are easy to achieve.AI boosters push nuclear fusion (another technology that is still far away) as a cure-all for the energy problems associated with large AI computing. But no one knows for sure when (or if) nuclear fusion will produce more energy than what is required to run nuclear fusion facilities. That has not happened yet. It will not happen for years and years.

There's also space-based possibilities. The Kardashev scale is a thought exercise about Solar System- or galaxy-scale civilizations. As humankind advances, the next step on the Kardashev scale would be for us to start to turn entire planets into data farms or harvest the energy of entire stars using Dyson spheres. But while Moore's Law was a forecast based on expertise in both technology and global supply chains, the Kardashev scale and Dyson spheres are thought exercises with no real-life analog at all. They are science fiction dreams.

On a more grounded level, quantum computing has been touted as an advance toward the realm of AI, ultimately leading into the singularity. But quantum computing is in its infancy, to say the least. It currently requires extreme cooling unlike anything in today's traditional computer realm. There is no usable consumer version of a quantum computer, and we're not even close to one. They must be painstakingly assembled by hand by engineers and physicists with things like atomic tweezers.

All of that means we have a lot of options that are at least 10 years away—or even as much as 100 or 1,000 years away. Venture capitalists today are selling a vision of the future. Today, there is no nuclear fusion energy, there is no efficient quantum computing, and there is no Dyson sphere.

“In this head the all-baffling brain,In it and below it the makings of heroes.”—Walt Whitman

In the huge field of artificial intelligence, there are countless ways to define and work toward goals like finding new prescription drugs or faraway galaxies. AGI is a separate, specific idea, but even within that there are variations. The public discourse has grown very muddled because of the ambiguity of terms like “artificial intelligence” outside of their intended engineering contexts.

I personally believe that AGI is very far away—though some very smart people, like Google DeepMind and Imperial College London computer scientist Murray Shanahan, believe it's closer than I think. (Shanahan's book for MIT Press about the technological singularity is a great introduction.)

But others, like OpenAI's Sam Altman, don't seem to know what they're talking about in any detail. Altman waves away questions about specifics of technologies he does not understand, while Shanahan writes detailed papers about the Wittgensteinian philosophical tests that AI models are growing ever more able to pass. Like the meme says, they are not the same.

Altman has suggested a Dyson sphere that encloses our Solar System, for example, as a back-of-the-napkin solution to the rising energy costs of AI. In 2019, over 750 million people on Earth still didn't have access to electricity, an additional over 400 million aren't able to use local available electricity, and both numbers are subject to stagnation or even worsening in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

A Dyson sphere is a science fiction invention with no stable version anywhere near Earth or our stellar neighborhood. We would need to drain the entire Solar System (and more!) of certain elements to even build what Altman suggests. While Moore's Law is real, many factors of the singularity are not—at least, not this decade. Climate change and the global energy crisis, though, are very, very real.

Case Study: YInMn Blue

A lot of claims of “artificial intelligence” come down to highly developed algorithms combined with the ability of computers to test millions or billions of configurations at a time. This is one of its best use cases, because the human mind is just not good at this kind of work. The same way we can look around a room and categorize and remember many details at a glance, computers can plug away at enormous lists of ingredients without missing a beat or losing their place.

In 2024, chemist Mas Subramanian (the creator of the novel pigment YInMn Blue) told Popular Mechanics that algorithms to discover new molecules are difficult to work with because of factors that the public doesn't really understand. It's just not that easy to find a new pigment, for example—YInMn blue has an unusual crystal structure. The chemical reaction that makes the color is found in a bipyramidal shape, Subramanian explains, rather than a tetrahedral or octohedral network. (Bipyramidal is like two tetrahedrons, or “D4” shapes, glued together. The octohedron has eight faces in a different form.)

As a layperson, it's hard to understand how crystal structures like this can make a huge difference in the outcome of a substance. But take carbon, for example. Graphite and diamond are different crystalline forms of the same element. That need for context is a major limitation of algorithms as we know them. Machine learning might tell you to put diamond in your innovative new pencil or graphite in your engagement ring.

So, Subramanian explains, the machine learning algorithm suggests a long list that must be vetted by a human, and many suggestions don't work in real life right off the bat. And because these models are trained on what already exists, they can't innovate, in the most literal sense. “The breakthrough discovery comes from unknowns,” Subramanian said. “If you don't have that in the starting point, how will you predict?”

The end of Moore's Law as an engineering benchmark is as helpful to us today as Moore's original presentation was in the 1960s. Concrete observations based on data and logistics can help manufacturers around the world adjust their planned products, research and development, and even marketing. Indeed, as the transistor industry approaches the limits of physics itself, they highlight a gap we're about to encounter as the human species—there is nothing that can start to replace and surpass our existing computer paradigm in the near future.

Today, people like Sam Altman will tell you they're selling you the building blocks of the singularity. But as the people of Gary, Indiana, found out in The Music Man, someone selling you your first trombone shouldn't tell you it comes with a first-chair position in the New York Philharmonic. The landmarks of expert-level artificial intelligence studies don't sound like sales pitches or soundbytes—they sound more like Shanahan's clarifying note, written after he used some imprecise language in a paper that escaped containment and entered the mainstream press:

Indeed, in a context where large language models (LLMs) are used to “summarize,” Shanahan's care means a great deal. His precision and corrections give others in his field somewhere to start—whether they agree or disagree with his positions. He concludes: “The aim, rather, was to remind readers of how unlike humans LLM-based systems are, how very differently they operate at a fundamental, mechanistic level, and to urge caution when using anthropomorphic language to talk about them.”

It's very different than Altman's public comment that he might need to Dyson-sphere the entire Solar System. The point stands: we don't even know how we'd build a computer big enough to need it.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

For the past few years, Stanford's Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory, led by co-director Frank Willett, has made the habit of translating the untranslatable. 

In 2021, the laboratory revealed a brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of translating the thoughts of attempted handwriting (in those suffering from motor disabilities) into speech by analyzing the neural activity in the motor cortex. Two years later, the same laboratory demonstrated a similar feat with a BCI that translated attempted speech. Now, seemingly like clockwork, the Stanford lab has pushed things yet another step further, eschewing the need for attempted handwriting and speech and instead analyzing the neural activity of the inner monologue directly. The results of this final installment of this (unofficial) BCI trilogy was published last week in the journal Cell. 

“For people with paralysis, attempting to speak can be slow and fatiguing, and if the paralysis is partial, it can produce distracting sounds and breath control difficulties,” Willett, a co-author on all three studies (including the latest one), said in a press statement. “We wanted to know whether a BCI could work based only on neural activity evoked by imagined speech, as opposed to attempts to physically produce speech.”

To translate this world of imagined speech, Willett and his team relied on four participants in the Brain2Gate trial—a study initially designed for developing proof-of-principle for people with tetraplegia to control computer cursors and other assistive devices with their thoughts alone. The study analyzed neural activity of the motor cortex using multiple 64-channel microelectrode arrays originally implanted in the participants' brains for the previous trial. At least two of the volunteers (a 68-year-old woman and a 33-year-old man) were diagnosed with ALS, and either couldn't intelligibly communicate or couldn't move their muscles at all.

Participants were asked to perform speech attempts  or think about simple words. Then, in another test, the participants heard or silently read the same words. The team could then map phonemes—the building blocks of speech—and run them through an AI decoder to reconstitute the inner thoughts of the participants. Willett and his team found that the resulting patterns were similar to (though less robust than) those of attempted speech signals from the 2023 study. They also developed unique in-system code phrases—phrases not common in usual speech (i.e. “Orange you glad I didn't say banana”) that could switch the BCI on and off so that participants' inner monologues remained private at their own discretion.

“We found that we could decode these signals well enough to demonstrate a proof of principle, although still not as well as we could with attempted speech,” Willett said in a press statement. “This gives us hope that future systems could restore fluent, rapid and comfortable speech to people with paralysis via inner speech alone.”

The system still has a ways to go before becoming a full-fledged mind reader. With just a 50-word vocabulary, the BCI produced an error rate up to 33 percent. 

“It's worth pointing out that implanted BCIs are not yet a widely available technology and are still in the earliest phases of research and testing,” Willett said in a press statement. “Improved hardware will enable more neurons to be recorded and will be fully implantable and wireless, increasing BCIs' accuracy, reliability and ease of use.”

Willett also said that future studies will explore how to make the decoding process even more accurate, specifically by exploring regions of the brain beyond just the motor cortex, including those associated with language and hearing. With better science, engineering, and a little luck, science may one day be able to return voices to those who—through accidents or neurodegenerative diseases—have forever lost their own.

How You Search the Internet Can Reinforce Your Beliefs—Without You Realizing It

Users' Internet search questions can strengthen echo chambers, even on factual topics, but there are simple ways to lessen the effect

By Simon Makin edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

People's views are becoming more and more polarized, with “echo chambers”—social bubbles that reinforce existing beliefs—exacerbating differences in opinion. This divergence doesn't just apply to political opinions; it also touches on factual topics, from climate change to vaccination.

And social media is not the sole culprit, according to a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. It turns out that people use search engines in ways that confirm their existing beliefs, potentially amplifying polarization. A simple tweak to search algorithms, the researchers propose, could help deliver a broader range of perspectives.

Online participants were asked to rate their beliefs on six topics, including nuclear energy and caffeine's health effects. They then chose search terms to learn more about each topic. The researchers rated the terms' scope and found that between 9 and 34 percent (depending on the topic) were “narrow.” For example, when researching the health effects of caffeine, one participant used “caffeine negative effects,” whereas others used “benefits of caffeine.”

These narrow terms tended to align with participants' existing beliefs, and generally less than 10 percent did this knowingly. “People often pick search terms that reflect what they believe, without realizing it,” says Eugina Leung of Tulane University's business school, who led the study. “Search algorithms are designed to give the most relevant answers for whatever we type, which ends up reinforcing what we already thought.” The same was true when participants used ChatGPT and Bing for searches aided by artificial intelligence.

When the researchers randomly assigned participants to view different results, they saw those results affect people's opinions and even behavior. For instance, participants who saw search results using “nuclear energy is good” felt better about nuclear energy afterward than those using “nuclear energy is bad.” People who saw results using “caffeine health benefits,” rather than “risks,” were more likely to choose a caffeinated drink afterward.

Pointing out biases in the search terms had only a small effect on people's final opinions. But changing the search algorithm either to always provide broad results or to alternate between results obtained with broad and user-provided terms mitigated the effects of narrow searches.

The researchers “have thought through how these technologies could be optimized for the benefit of users,” says Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, who studies political and science communication. For search technology to do what we need it to do, “this kind of research is very important.”

Participants rated the broader results as just as useful and relevant as standard searches. “People are able to bring in different perspectives when they're exposed to them, which is encouraging,” Leung says. “At least for the topics we tested.” The researchers recommend implementing such strategies, possibly as “search broadly” buttons. “This would be really helpful,” Leung says, but whether it will ever happen “is hard to predict.”

Scientific American Celebrates 180 Years with Stories of Scientific U-turns

In honor of SciAm's 180th birthday, we're spotlighting the biggest “wait, what?” moments in science history.

We're celebrating 180 years of Scientific American. Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Today we're doing something a little different from our usual weekly news roundup. Scientific American turns 180 this year, and we recently celebrated with a collection of print features about times in history when science has seemingly done a complete pivot—a 180-degree turn, if you will. We thought it would be fun to take you on a tour of a few highlights from that package.

First up, we have a story from freelance health and life sciences journalist Diana Kwon about nerve regeneration. For millennia doctors and scientists believed that any damage to the nerve cells that carry signals throughout the body must be irreversible. While many instances of nerve damage are, indeed, difficult to treat, scientists have realized over the past couple of centuries that nerves can and do regenerate.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Throughout this evolution in our understanding of nerves it was still widely believed that neurons within the central nervous system, composed of the brain and spinal cord,were incapable of healing. Now we know that even these most precious neurons can regenerate under the right conditions.

As research continues into exactly which mechanisms encourage (or block) neural regeneration throughout the body, scientists are also engaged in another debate: whether human brains are capable of producing new neurons throughout adulthood. The phenomenon of adult neurogenesis would have been unfathomable mere decades ago, but a growing body of evidence now supports it. Just imagine what secrets we'll have uncovered about the nervous system 180 years from now.

In another example of a scientific turnabout, Scientific American senior features editor Jen Schwartz reminds readers that plastic was, ironically, invented as a sustainable alternative to another material: ivory. In fact, back in 1864 Scientific American published news of a contest from billiard-table manufacturing company Phelan & Collender seeking an alternative for vanishing elephant tusks, which, at the time, were used to make pool balls. The company offered $10,000 as a reward for this feat of materials science.

A printer from Albany, New York, named John Wesley Hyatt came up with celluloid in response, though he chose to patent the invention for himself rather than accepting the prize money. His celluloid billiard ball has been called “the founding object of the plastics industry.” Unfortunately, as Jen's article for SciAm explains, while the demand for ivory in the billiard industry dropped with the introduction of celluloid, elephants were still targeted for their tusks for other products. And as we now know the invention of plastic radically changed the way we produce and consume goods—and not always for the better.

In another scientific 180, detailed by Scientific American contributing editor Sarah Scoles, we learn how the search for alien life has periodically been turned on its head. (So maybe multiple 180s?)

In the late 19th century an Italian astronomer observed groovelike markings on Mars, which convinced an American astronomer that the Red Planet hosted a whole civilization. In 1906 that second astronomer, Percival Lowell, wrote a book positing that Martians had carved out a sophisticated network of watery canals. Even when a closer look at Mars in 1909 revealed that those canal-like markings had actually been an optical illusion, Lowell's theories persisted. In 1916 a Scientific American managing editor wrote in New York Times letters to the editor that he still believed Mars held sophisticated life and an irrigation system to prove it. Of course, when the Mariner 4 spacecraft gave us our first flyby view of Mars in 1965, we saw our planetary neighbor for the desolate world it is.

While we're unlikely to do another 180 on the existence of intelligent life in our solar system anytime soon, scientists have recently become aware of the abundant potential opportunities for microbial life in our cosmic backyard and beyond. We may not be peering up at Mars hoping to see aliens traveling around by gondola anymore, but in some ways the hunt for alien life is more optimistic than ever.

Those are just a few of the 180-degree pivots you can learn about in the latest issue of Scientific American. Check out our 180th-anniversary issue on newsstands, or go to ScientificAmerican.com for more fascinating stories of scientific swerves. We'll have additional anniversary treats popping up online in the next few weeks, too, so stay tuned.

The field of developmental biology is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by groundbreaking advances across multiple disciplines. Light-sheet microscopy enables rapid, large-scale, multicolor imaging of developing embryos in unprecedented detail, allowing scientists to capture dynamic processes as they unfold in real time1,2,3. Simultaneously, the advent of advanced cell tracking technologies, such as Ultrack4, Linajea5, Elephant, TGMM6, Trackmate, Mastodon and TrackAstra, has made it possible to follow individual cells throughout embryonic development with remarkable precision and speed. These innovations, which have emerged in the past two decades, are only now realizing their full potential for embryology. This unprecedented level of detail opens the door to answering fundamental questions about tissue development, organ formation and the intricate orchestration of the cell behaviors that govern the entire embryo7.

While these imaging datasets hold the potential for biological insights, accessing and interacting with such complex data typically demands highly specialized technical expertise and substantial computational resources. Existing software tools allow visualization and analysis of cell tracking data (for example, napari8, TrackMate's TrackScheme, Mastodon and CellTracksColab), However, while powerful in their respective application domains, most of these approaches require native software, have limited 3D support, or are intended for the curation of tracks, not the interactive exploration of large cell tracking datasets. Consequently, only a limited subset of researchers can fully leverage these data, creating a barrier to broader adoption.

Tracking live cells across two-dimensional, three-dimensional (3D) and multichannel time-lapse recordings is crucial for understanding tissue-scale biological processes. Despite advancements in imaging technology, accurately tracking cells remains challenging, particularly in complex and crowded tissues where cell segmentation is often ambiguous. We present Ultrack, a versatile and scalable cell tracking method that tackles this challenge by considering candidate segmentations derived from multiple algorithms and parameter sets. Ultrack leverages temporal consistency to select optimal segments, ensuring robust performance even under segmentation uncertainty. We validate our method on diverse datasets, including terabyte-scale developmental time-lapse recordings of zebrafish, fruit fly and nematode embryos, as well as multicolor and label-free cellular imaging. We demonstrate that Ultrack achieves superior or comparable performance in the cell tracking challenge, particularly when tracking densely packed 3D embryonic cells over extended periods. Moreover, we propose an approach to tracking validation via dual-channel sparse labeling that enables high-fidelity ground-truth generation, pushing the boundaries of long-term cell tracking assessment. Our method is freely available as a Python package with Fiji and Napari plugins and can be deployed in a high-performance computing environment, facilitating widespread adoption by the research community.

Advancements in live imaging technologies1,2,3,4,5,6,7 have enabled the visualization of cellular dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution8 over large fields of view6,7 encompassing thousands of cells5,9, producing vast amounts of multidimensional data10. However, one key challenge remains: the accurate reconstruction of cell trajectories and lineages in complex biological systems11. This ability unlocks deeper insights into cellular state and behavior9,12,13, tissue mechanics14, morphogenesis2,15,16 and regeneration17.

Cell segmentation and tracking have been persistent challenges in bioimage analysis11. While cell segmentation has advanced rapidly with the advent of deep-learning-based methods18,19,20, cell tracking continues to be an open problem11. The primary challenge stems from the association of spurious segmentations over time, hindering long-term tracking, especially in dense and dynamic cellular environments. Most automatic tracking methods use a two-step approach: first segmenting cells, then linking them across time frames21,22,23,24. While computationally efficient, this approach struggles with the compounding of errors over time, particularly in dense tissues25 or when cells divide rapidly.

Simultaneous segmentation and tracking offers a promising alternative26,27,28,29,30, wherein multiple candidate segments and/or inter-segment links are generated, and then optimal candidates are selected by satisfying biological constraints (that is, cells divide but do not merge) and optimizing specific criteria (that is, only keep links best supported by the data). However, existing methods in this category are constrained by their inability to utilize arbitrary segmentation inputs28,31, as well as limitations in data scale or dimensionality due to high computational costs29,30. These factors have limited their applicability to tissue-scale problems.

To address these challenges, we developed Ultrack, a robust and scalable method for large-scale cell tracking that excels even under segmentation uncertainty. Ultrack can track cells (or nuclei) in two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) and multichannel datasets, accommodating a wide range of biological contexts. Ultrack seamlessly integrates with various segmentation algorithms, including state-of-the-art deep-learning-based cell segmentation tools18,19,20,32,33,34 (Fig. 1a). By jointly evaluating candidate segmentations and tracks, Ultrack uses temporal consistency to select the most accurate segments (Fig. 1b). This approach leverages information from adjacent time points to resolve cell segmentation and tracking ambiguities, enhancing performance, particularly in complex, densely packed tissues where cell boundaries are often uncertain (Supplementary Video 1).

a, The Ultrack pipeline can process a variety of input images, including 2D, 3D and multicolor datasets. These images are then processed by any segmentation algorithm or a combination of them. b, Ultrack builds segmentation hypotheses between frames for tracking and solves an ILP problem to identify cell segments and their trajectories. The resulting tracks can be exported in various formats compatible with multiple platforms. c, Illustration of how segmentation hypotheses are built using ultrametric contours: multiple segmentations are provided (first row), their binary contours are extracted (second row), and these are combined into a multilevel contour, equivalent to a hierarchy (third row). d, Joint segmentation and tracking is performed using an ILP formulation, modeling cell behaviors (for example, cell appearance xα., division xδ., death or exit x.β) while finding nonoverlapping cells with maximal association over time. e, Ultrack can process arbitrarily sized datasets and scales from a laptop to a HPC cluster. f, Projection of a 3D image of a developing zebrafish embryo, with cell tracks overlaid and colored to indicate track orientation in the xy plane.

We demonstrate the utility and robustness of Ultrack through a comprehensive set of benchmarks and real-world applications, including top-scoring performances on the cell tracking challenge (CTC)11. Our method shows improved tracking performance across various use cases and scales, from multicolor and label-free 2D datasets to large-scale 3D time-lapse sequences of developing embryos. Additionally, we introduce a new dual-channel sparse labeling approach that enables the generation of high-fidelity ground truth for tracking validation. This method combines ubiquitous fluorescence labeling with sparse, random labeling at a distinct wavelength, allowing for the creation of annotations that would be impossible to produce manually. This innovative validation strategy pushes the limits of cell tracking assessment, enabling the evaluation of tracking performance over extended time periods and in increasingly complex tissue environments.

To ensure broad accessibility and ease of use, we provide intuitive interfaces in Fiji35, Napari36, Python and command line, catering to researchers with diverse computational backgrounds. We also made efforts to ensure interoperability with existing popular cell tracking frameworks such as TrackMate37 and Mastodon38 (Fig. 1b). Thus, by enabling more accurate, scalable and accessible cell tracking, Ultrack can accelerate research in developmental biology, cancer research and regenerative medicine, offering new insights into cellular behavior and tissue dynamics.

Cell tracking accuracy is compromised when cell segmentation (or detection) fails. To address this challenge, Ultrack considers multiple segment hypotheses instead of prematurely committing to a particular choice of segments (Fig. 1a). These hypotheses can be obtained from the original imaging data pixel intensities, multiple algorithms (for example, watershed plus Cellpose) or from one or several algorithms configured with different parameters. This approach allows the integration of various segmentation methods, maintaining compatibility with the growing array of novel off-the-shelf segmentation models39,40. However, the main challenge of this approach and previous joint segmentation and tracking methods, as well as the main obstacle for their practical application, is the potentially large number of possible segmentation hypotheses, especially for large multidimensional datasets.

To address the challenge of managing multiple segmentation hypotheses, we use ultrametric contour maps (UCMs)41,42,43, which provide a compact representation of these hypotheses. Intuitively, UCMs are multilevel contour maps that represent a hierarchy of possible cell boundaries, where the strength of each boundary reflects its likelihood of being a true cell edge (Fig. 1c). This hierarchical structure allows for the efficient encoding of multiple possible segmentations within a single map. More formally, UCMs partition the image space into nested segments, where valid segments do not overlap, or are contained within another. This property enables Ultrack to efficiently consider multiple segmentation possibilities while tracking cells, even in terabyte-scale datasets (Fig. 1e), that are challenging for existing joint segmentation and tracking solutions26,28,29,30.

Hence, the canonical Ultrack input consists of two maps for each time frame: (i) a foreground map distinguishing potential cells from the background and (ii) a grayscale image representing the multilevel contour map (that is, UCM; Fig. 1c). These two input maps can be generated from any method, making Ultrack compatible with a wide range of existing workflows (see Methods for technical details). Therefore, the same algorithm is always applied in every application presented here, and the varying factor is the process of obtaining the multilevel contour map.

Once all candidate segments and links between segments are determined, tracking involves solving a complex combinatorial problem of selecting and associating the correct cell segments across time from the set of multiple segmentation and linkage hypotheses (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Video 1). As shown in Fig. 1d, we formulate this combinatorial problem as an integer linear program (ILP)28,44 that simultaneously solves for the optimal selection of temporally consistent segments while adhering to biological constraints. These constraints include cell division, cells entering (for example, moving into the frame) or exiting (for example, cell death or moving out of the field of view), and ensuring that a pixel is not assigned to more than one cell45, denoted by auxiliary variables xδ., xα. and x.β, respectively (Fig. 1d). This efficient and versatile mathematical formulation leverages highly optimized solvers (Gurobi46, Coin47) and thus can handle tens of millions of segments from terabyte-scale datasets (Fig. 1e). Once solved, the ILP formulation not only selects the most appropriate segments but also encodes the linkage data necessary to reconstruct the cell lineages from the optimal association between the selected segments (see Methods for association score definition and ILP formulation details). A 3D image of a developing zebrafish embryo recapitulating cell lineages and migration patterns is shown in Fig. 1f and Supplementary Video 1.

Image segmentation techniques, from classical methods like watershed to advanced deep-learning models, face considerable challenges in parameter tuning due to several factors: (i) computational: extensive resources are required to explore a large parameter space; (ii) practical: users often lack the expertise to train or tune parameters effectively; and (iii) technical: a single optimal parameter set may not fit all aspects of a diverse dataset, such as when segmenting cells of varying sizes.

Ultrack addresses these challenges by integrating multiple segmentation labels derived from different parameter settings into a single multilevel contour map. This approach leverages the temporal consistency of the tracking process to select the most appropriate segments for each cell (Fig. 1d), resulting in more effective segmentation than what could be achieved with any single parameter setting—even a single optimal one.

To demonstrate this key feature of Ultrack, we tracked human hepatocarcinoma-derived cells expressing YFP-TIA-1 (ref. 48) in their nucleus and cytoplasm from the CTC11 using the Cellpose ‘cyto2r' weights32 without any fine-tuning (that is, deep-learning retraining). In this dataset, cells have varying intensities, impairing the model's ability to consistently segment every cell correctly. For example, using original image intensities (γ = 1.0), the segmentation model fails to detect dimmer cells (Fig. 2c). Conversely, altering the dynamic range by taking the power of the image intensities with values closer to zero (γ = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5) improved the segmentation of dimmer cells but led to incorrect segmentation or non-detection of now-saturated bright cells (Fig. 2c).

a, Segmentation pipeline using gamma correction with varying settings (γ = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0) to generate diverse segmentation hypotheses. b, Ultrack's approach: integrating multiple foreground and contour maps for joint segmentation and tracking. c, Impact of gamma correction on segmentation quality: original images (top row), segmentation results (second and third rows) with errors highlighted by colored arrows, foreground maps (fourth row) and contour maps (fifth row). d, Quantitative comparison of F1 score of detections, TRA and false-negative cell detections for individual gamma settings and Ultrack's combined approach (all four). Arrows within parenthesis indicate whether lower (↓) or higher (↑) values are better.

To segment and track the combination of all parameterizations of gamma, we extracted the binary foreground and contour maps from the Cellpose labels (Fig. 2a). Next, we combined them into a single binary foreground and a multilevel contour map for tracking (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Video 2).

We evaluated the tracking and segmentation performance for each individual gamma setting, as well as for the combined contour map approach. To assess performance, we compared the results against the publicly available ground truth provided by the CTC. Figure 2d summarizes the average results obtained from the two publicly available datasets. We used three metrics for evaluation: the F1 score of detections, the tracking accuracy (TRA)49 and false-negative detection rate. For false-negative detection, lower scores indicate better performance, while for F1 and TRA, higher scores are better (Methods).

These results demonstrate that Ultrack achieves more accurate tracking by leveraging multiple segmentation hypotheses, even outperforming the optimal single parameter setting (γ = 0.5 or 0.25 depending on the metric). This indicates that combining diverse segmentation inputs is often more effective in practice, thus liberating the need for precise parameter tuning and offering a more robust approach to cell tracking.

Multicolor labeling has been shown to enhance cell segmentation and tracking capabilities, particularly in complex cellular environments50,51. However, applying state-of-the-art deep-learning models to such data often requires training on dataset-specific annotations, as pretrained weights are typically optimized for single-channel data. Ultrack addresses this challenge by combining multiple segmentation inputs in two ways: by varying parameters, as demonstrated earlier, and by integrating outputs from different segmentation algorithms applied to separate color channels.

We demonstrate this key feature of Ultrack on a three-channel ‘multicolor' dataset of metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) with red, green and blue markings from a lentiviral gene ontology (LeGO) vector system52, and show that we can effectively use models like Cellpose's ‘cyto2'32 alongside classical algorithms by applying them independently to each channel and then combining the outputs into a single multilevel contour representation. This approach circumvents the need for retraining typically required by other approaches37,53. We combined six segmentation outputs from three image channels—three from Cellpose and three from Otsu54 with watershed55,56—into a single contour and detection map for Ultrack (Fig. 3a). While classical image processing approaches like watershed are generally less precise at splitting cell instances, they provide greater control and allow for the detection of dimmer cells, complementing the more sophisticated Cellpose output. Furthermore, Ultrack can use the three color channels as a feature when associating segments between frames, which helps connect the correct segments across time (Fig. 3b). See Methods for a description of the color features association.

a, Multichannel, multi-algorithm tracking pipeline: individual labels are generated for each color channel (R, red; G, green; B, blue), from which foregrounds and contours are derived and subsequently integrated for joint segmentation and tracking. b, Stepwise improvement of segmentation strategies (left to right): (i) individual algorithms applied to grayscale images, (ii) applications to multicolor data, (iii) combination of labels from both algorithms and colors and (iv) enhancement with color features in association scores. The central diagram illustrates the progression of methods, with numbers indicating improvements in the TRA metric. Colored arrows highlight specific error types. c, Representative subset of lineages recovered by Ultrack, showcasing cells' respective colors, and examples of captured division events. d, Quantitative evaluation of tracking accuracy for the approaches described in b. Final combined results are available at https://t.ly/K-hA7.

We assessed the effectiveness of our multichannel multi-algorithm approach using progressively more sophisticated strategies: (i) individual pipelines using Cellpose and watershed algorithms on a grayscale version (maximum intensity across multiple channels); (ii) each algorithm applied independently on multiple channels; (iii) combination of outputs from both algorithms in the multicolor configuration (Fig. 3a); and (iv) integration of color features into the association scores to improve linking of segments.

We manually curated 413 cell tracks, creating a gold-standard dataset for benchmarking our results. Demonstrating several key improvements. Incorporating color channels enhances cell distinction compared to grayscale versions, notably reducing under-segmentation (Fig. 3b). The combination of watershed and Cellpose algorithms proves particularly effective, improving the detection of dimmer cells while maintaining Cellpose's accurate segmentation. Furthermore, color-feature linking improves tracking in ambiguous scenarios (Fig. 3b). Overall, Ultrack steadily increased accuracy as additional features (that is, segmentation labels, color information) were incorporated. This demonstrates its effectiveness in creating valid lineages (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Video 3) from a large pool of segmentation hypotheses without requiring a fine-tuned segmentation model, highlighting its versatility and robustness in multicolor cell tracking scenarios.

As demonstrated in the previous section, off-the-shelf segmentation models face challenges when datasets deviate greatly from the training distribution. Users then often resort to time-consuming tasks such as annotating multiple segmentation labels to fine-tune a new model or implementing custom algorithms based on their expertise. This is particularly common because of the high diversity of imaging modalities and datasets typically encountered in biology. Here, we show that our approach can avoid these requirements by directly tracking image intensities as if they were multilevel contours, thus circumventing the need for segmentation labels as input.

Our method relies on a single assumption: the intensity map must highlight cell boundaries in some way. This could be achieved through membrane labeling, which delineates cells as a contour map, or through nuclear labeling, which highlights cell interiors. By inverting the latter, we obtain an image where boundaries have higher intensity values than cell interiors.

To evaluate this approach, we tracked A549 cells using quantitative phase imaging (QPI) data acquired with recOrder57 on a widefield transmission microscope. Traditional segmentation models like Cellpose perform poorly on this data because QPI was not part of their training set58. We obtained the intensity map using VSCyto2D58, a convolutional neural network for virtual staining that predicts membrane and nuclear markers from label-free data.

To create the multilevel contour map, we combined both the nuclear and membrane channels by subtracting the normalized and filtered nuclear channel from the filtered membrane channel (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The foreground was computed by manually thresholding the membrane channel and applying morphological filtering to close holes and remove small objects. We then applied Ultrack to the foreground and the intensity map encoding cell contours (Supplementary Video 4).

For benchmarking, we tracked the virtual stained nuclear channel and manually curated a set of 247 tracklets of lineages starting in the first frame to the last frame. The centroids of the tracked cells were used to create reference gold-standard datasets following the CTC format.

We compared these data against Cellpose with ‘livecell_cp3' weights59 applied to the QPI channel, followed by tracking. With Ultrack applied to the combined membrane and nuclear virtual staining channels, we detected most of the cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c), while the off-the-shelf model failed to recognize them. We missed 2,802 fewer associations between cells (that is, false-negative edges) and 3,014 cell detections (that is, false-negative detections) than virtual staining with Ultrack, at the cost of detection of 1,000 false-positive cells yielding a much higher F1 score (0.812 versus 0.347).

This shows that tracking from image intensity directly, in this case from virtual staining, offers a competitive alternative to supervised segmentation and tracking methods, which often fail when presented with unseen imaging modalities, such as label-free quantitative polarization, Zernike phase contrast, differential interference contrast or for different cell types, thus eliminating the need for extensive human annotation to train segmentation models.

Imaging systems must balance multiple factors, including the field of view size, spatial resolution, imaging speed and depth60. A critical limitation often encountered is acquisition speed (that is, temporal resolution), which hampers cell tracking performance. This is especially problematic when cells move rapidly and have similar appearances, complicating the assignment of cells between consecutive frames.

Registration of adjacent frames often compensates for limited time resolution. However, collective cell motion within growing or deforming tissues frequently demonstrates local coherence that does not conform to simple linear or affine transformations. This is due to the complex dynamics of some biological processes. In such cases, nonlinear registration, such as movement vector fields61,62, is more appropriate. This approach effectively minimizes apparent motion when cells present distinct migration patterns.

Computing nonlinear registration can be extremely time-consuming or require complex, specialized algorithms. To address this, Ultrack provides its own graphics-hardware-accelerated (GPU) routines to compute vector fields for 2D and 3D time-lapse recordings. These routines are based on automatic differentiation from deep-learning models63, offering efficient computation without sacrificing accuracy (Methods). The movement vector fields can be integrated into the tracking step, applying local movement to each candidate segmentation. This approach avoids altering the original image data. Moreover, Ultrack accepts any vector fields represented as a grid, allowing users to utilize their preferred registration methods.

We evaluated the effectiveness of using vector fields with Ultrack on the Tribolium castaneum cartography dataset64 from the CTC. This dataset features nuclear-labeled embryo cells imaged using selective plane illumination microscopy. The epithelial cells' ellipsoidal surface was transformed into planar cartography using the ImSAnE toolbox65 to facilitate downstream analysis. However, this cartographic transformation introduced distortion and excessive motion on the polar boundaries (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Video 5).

We compared the tracking accuracy with and without flow registration (Extended Data Fig. 2b) at various temporal resolutions, starting by skipping ten frames (Δt = 10) up to the original frame rate (Δt = 1; Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). The results show: (i) at Δt = 10 tracking accuracy improved from 0.443 to 0.623 with flow registration, in this scenario the most motile cells move more than 150 voxels between frames, a substantial distance given that the median cell diameter of approximately 19.64 voxels; (ii) at Δt = 5 accuracy increased from 0.571 to 0.756; (iii) at original time resolution (Δt = 1) similar results were obtained (0.927 versus 0.929). Extended Data Fig. 2c provides a specific example where the flow field achieves the correct result, while a cell identity switch occurs in the unregistered case.

These results demonstrate that Ultrack's temporal registration capability enhances tracking accuracy, particularly when dealing with complex cell movements or lower temporal resolution datasets.

Concurrent work has shown that Ultrack remains effective even in scenarios that prioritize speed over resolution, such as neural dynamics imaging, where z-resolution is often reduced to enable faster acquisition. The WormID benchmark66 demonstrates Ultrack's robustness across a range of imaging resolutions, from 1 × 0.1604 × 0.1604 μm to 1.5 × 0.32 × 0.32 μm per voxel67.

All these features—including its ability to handle multiple segmentation hypotheses, integrate multichannel data, leverage intensity-based tracking and apply temporal registration—collectively enable robust cell tracking in complex biological contexts. These capabilities are particularly valuable when confronting the challenges posed by dense, 3D tissues with dynamic cellular behaviors. To demonstrate the power and versatility of this approach, we next evaluated Ultrack's performance on one of the highly competitive CTCs11.

The CTC is a long-standing benchmark for cellular segmentation and tracking methods11. It provides participants with training datasets to train and tune their algorithm parameters. However, the test set annotations used for the competitive assessment and final scores are concealed and only accessible to the organizers. This structure prevents information leakage between the training and testing phases and offers an unbiased evaluation of each algorithm's performance. We assessed our method using five 3D datasets: breast cancer cells, Caenorhabditis elegans (worm)68, Drosophila melanogaster (fly)31 and T. castaneum (beetle), as well as cartographic projections of T. castaneum datasets64.

The worm and breast cancer cells datasets include manually curated lineage data and cell coordinates, as well as silver-standard segmentation annotations derived from a consensus among prior challenge submissions69. Using these annotations, we trained a U-Net model45,70 that predicts two outputs per voxel: (i) whether the voxel is on a cell contour and (ii) whether that voxel is in the foreground. We optimized these predictions using three dice losses71: (i) binary foreground prediction, (ii) binary cells' contour prediction and (iii) U-Net's intermediate cell contour predictions72 (Methods). The cells' contours and foreground were then used as inputs for Ultrack. As shown in Extended Data Table 1, Ultrack achieves a top combined segmentation and tracking score of 0.844 for the worm dataset. For the cancer cells dataset, our approach underperformed, most likely because of over-fitting during training the segmentation model on limited data: our cross-validation reported an average TRA of 0.905 while achieving a much lower score of 0.818 on the test set.

In general, sufficient training data for segmentation are not always available or easily obtained, which is a typical situation users face. This is the case for the fly, beetle and beetle projection datasets, which lack ground truth to train segmentation models. To circumvent this limitation, the leading deep-learning-based submissions are based on point coordinates and movement, relying only on track annotations. Instead, we asked whether we could forgo deep learning and use classical image processing techniques for segmentation. We opted for a straightforward method. First, we detected the foreground using a difference of Gaussians filter and applied Otsu's threshold54 to select the foreground voxels. Next, we used image intensity as a proxy for cell boundaries by inverting and normalizing these intensities between 0 and 1, so dimmer voxels, which are more likely to be the cells' contours, represent the highest values.

Combining this simple image processing approach with Ultrack's handling of multiple hypotheses implicit in the contour representation yields noteworthy results compared to competing approaches that require training data. As shown in Extended Data Table 1, for the fly dataset, Ultrack achieved a combined segmentation and tracking score of 0.708, compared to 0.617 for the next best method. Similarly, for the beetle dataset, Ultrack scored 0.841, while the next best result was 0.804 (see Methods for additional details). For the projection dataset, we obtained a lower score of 0.754—likely because of the distortions introduced by the projection.

Overall, these results demonstrate Ultrack's strong performance even without deep-learning models, achieving more first-place rankings on 3D datasets than any other method. The next best performer, MPI, achieved first place only twice on the TRA metric, while never ranking higher than third place in segmentation scores across their submissions (Extended Data Table 2). See Supplementary Video 6 for recordings of the results.

While the CTC provides a valuable unbiased benchmark for evaluating segmentation and tracking, it relies primarily on human-generated annotations. These annotations, while crucial, are inherently limited in scale and potentially in quality due to the challenge of manually annotating the latest-generation 3D live microscopy datasets1,2,6,7,9,15,16. Such datasets often span hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes, recording thousands of cells over hundreds or more time points, making manual annotation a task that is not only time-consuming but often beyond human capability. Moreover, in densely labeled or multidimensional datasets, distinguishing individual cells can be highly uncertain and sometimes impossible15,16,24,31,64.

Encouraged by Ultrack's performance on the CTC, we developed a higher-fidelity ground-truth dataset that could overcome these limitations and potentially provide a more challenging benchmark of a crowded and dynamic cellular environment from a developing zebrafish embryo. We applied a dual-labeling protocol that combines ubiquitous fluorescence nuclear labeling Tg(ef1α:H2B-mNeonGreen) with sparse random nuclear labeling at a distinct wavelength (pMTB-ef1-H2B-mCherry). Sparse labeling was accomplished by early-stage microinjection of a marker (Tol2 transposase-mediated integration; Methods) that propagates to daughter cells upon division, effectively recapitulating their lineage (Fig. 4a).

a, Validation pipeline using sparse fluorescence labeling: (i) Embryos with ubiquitous green nuclear labeling Tg(ef1α:H2B-mNeonGreen) are injected with DNA plasmids expressing red fluorescent protein pMTB-ef1-H2B-mCherry; a single embryo is then selected for imaging. (ii) Simultaneous imaging of red and green channels. b, (iii) Independent tracking of cell nuclei in both channels. (iv) Selection and manual curation of a subset of cell nuclei tracks from the red channel. (v) Comparison of curated tracks to those obtained from ubiquitous labeling. c, Comparative visualization of red (first column) and green (second column) channel segmentation and tracking results at different time points, and combined results overlaid grayscale intensity colored in red and green (last column); cell density and tracking difficulty increase over time (top to bottom), d, Quantitative evaluation of tracking accuracy under different conditions and durations: using deep learning for cell contour estimation (first row) versus direct image intensity-based segmentation (second row); measurements taken up to the first 150 frames (first column) and 500 frames (second column). Metrics shown are proportions of false-negative edges (FN), identity switches (IS), false-positive divisions (FP-D), false-negative divisions (FN-D) and their sum. The red vertical line indicates the baseline sum error rate for 150 frames of 0.078 for comparison with Malin et al.24. Tracking results are available at https://t.ly/WZV-g. Schematic in a created with BioRender.com.

The sparsity of this second channel greatly simplifies tracking and allows for rapid curation into a set of high-quality, or ‘platinum-level', annotations (Fig. 4b). Cells in the sparse channel were automatically tracked using Ultrack and then manually curated to ensure the highest quality standards (Fig. 4b). This curation process involved selecting long, green-overlapping, high-quality lineages, conducting visual inspections and making necessary corrections, resulting in 152 annotated tracklets spanning from 85 to 521 frames. This methodology not only simplifies the manual curation process but also reveals cell trajectories that are challenging to annotate manually using conventional methods on dense datasets (Supplementary Video 7).

As evident in Fig. 4c, tracking is easier at earlier stages of development when cells are less numerous, less densely packed, and when the optical properties of the tissue are more favorable for imaging. Despite these challenges, cell nuclei in the sparse channel are consistently easier to track compared to the dense channel (Fig. 4c).

We used these high-quality sparse-channel-derived tracking labels to evaluate Ultrack's accuracy on the ubiquitously labeled channel. We used two segmentation approaches as in ref. 45: (i) image processing to produce foreground maps and nuclei boundaries directly and (ii) a convolutional neural network to generate foreground and contour maps. Hence, the Ultrack setup was kept the same, and only the input foreground and contour maps were modified. Figure 4c compares the tracking results using the sparse channel (red) and the ubiquitous channel (green) using the deep-learning-based contour map, approach (ii), for three frames (150, 400 and 500), showcasing the disproportionate difficulty of tracking cells in the dense channel versus sparse channel.

To quantitatively assess the performance, we evaluated our automatic dense tracking results against the manually curated sparse tracking over two time periods (Fig. 4d): the first 150 frames as the previous work24 and an extended period of 500 frames, nearly covering the entire time-lapse recording. Assessing tracking performance with five metrics24, all expressed as proportions relative to the total number of annotated edges: (i) false-negative edges (that is, missing connections between cells), (ii) identity switches (that is, incorrect association between cells), (iii) false-positive divisions, (iv) false-negative divisions and (v) the sum error rate that combines the first four metrics.

As expected, tracking accuracy drops for longer imaging periods (500 versus 150 frames; Fig. 4d), reflecting the growing complexity of the developing organism already apparent in Fig. 4c. Notably, Ultrack with a deep-learning-based input, which benefits from available training data, consistently outperforms plain image processing contour and foreground maps, maintaining comparable accuracy over 500 frames to what the image intensity-based approach achieves in just 150 frames.

To contextualize our results within recent advances in cell tracking for embryo-scale 3D datasets, we compared our findings to those reported by Malin et al.24. Their study, which used a similar multi-view light-sheet microscope setup73, established a baseline sum error rate of 0.078 for tracking neuronal cells in zebrafish embryos during 150 frames. As shown in Fig. 4d, Ultrack achieves a lower proportion of sum errors for both deep-learning and intensity-image-based contour maps on 150 frames (0.049 and 0.070, respectively). Moreover, when using deep learning, we maintain accuracy (0.073) comparable to the baseline (0.078) even over a much more challenging 500-frame period. This extended performance is particularly noteworthy, as it underscores the robustness of our method in maintaining high tracking accuracy over prolonged periods of embryonic development despite increasing tissue complexity, cell density and imaging artifacts. These results not only validate the effectiveness of our dual-channel approach but also highlight Ultrack's potential to push the boundaries of long-term cell tracking in complex biological systems.

To demonstrate Ultrack's scalability and performance on massive datasets, we used it to recover cell lineages of nuclear-labeled zebrafish embryos9 acquired using the fast (one stack per minute), high-resolution (×20 magnification and 1.0-NA Olympus objective) and large-imaging-volume (≥1 mm3) DaXi light-sheet microscope6, producing uncompressed time-lapse data ranging from 1.7 to 3.7 terabytes, capturing 8.6 h to 13.2 h of zebrafish development (Fig. 5a,b).

This indicates that, on average, 50% of the lineages are error-free for at least 62 frames. Tracking data results are available at https://t.ly/vXFyb.

Our workflow began with training a U-Net to predict nuclei pixels (foreground) and their contours (Fig. 5a,b). We then applied Ultrack to these network predictions. Leveraging Ultrack's command-line interface (CLI) and SLURM74, we processed these massive datasets within hours using distributed computing in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. For example, a 3.7-TB dataset (791 × 448 × 2,174 × 2,423 voxels, T × Z × Y × X) was processed in approximately 8.2 h (Fig. 1e).

Ultrack's computational scaling extends across computing environments, from high-performance clusters to off-the-shelf laptops. Ultrack supports out-of-core processing: it can process arbitrarily large datasets, even those substantially larger than available memory (RAM)—as long as a single image (2D or 3D) can fit into memory (Methods). We could process the same 3.7-TB dataset on a 32-GB RAM laptop in 5 days, accessing data remotely via a 1-Gbps connection (Fig. 1e; see https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack_supplementary/tree/main/hardware/ for hardware details).

The tracking resulted in millions of segments across hundreds of time frames. To assess performance, we manually evaluated time-lapse recordings until the first tracking mistake, recording the duration of error-free tracks. We used a stratified sampling strategy, manually annotating distinct regions (head, body, tail bud and presomitic mesoderm) at various time points and image qualities. From these strata, we randomly sampled approximately 140 lineages per embryo (n = 3). Figure 5d shows each fish's cumulative proportion of error-free tracks and their mean. On average, it took 62 frames for a tracking error to appear in 50% of the lineages, meaning that for a period of approximately 1 h of development (60 frames), half of the tracks are completely error-free, demonstrating Ultrack's robust performance over extended periods. Figure 5c and Supplementary Video 8 provide a detailed view of an automatically reconstructed lineage, capturing two rounds of cell divisions and illustrating Ultrack's ability to maintain accurate tracking through multiple cell generations.

These results underscore Ultrack's capacity to efficiently process and accurately track cells in multi-terabyte, high-resolution datasets utilizing HPC resources or standard hardware. This scalability and versatility make Ultrack a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale developmental processes at unprecedented resolution and scale.

Cell tracking is often crucial in scenarios with fewer cells, where perfect lineage reconstruction is necessary to uncover precise details of cell behavior, such as division, migration and death75,76. To evaluate Ultrack's performance in such a context, we chose the zebrafish neuromast as our model system, given its well-defined structure and importance in studying sensory organ development. Previous efforts in segmenting and tracking cells in this organ included manual tracking of cells77 or semiautomated segmentation of single frames78. To our knowledge, no other study has reported the fully automatic segmentation and tracking of cells in this complex 3D organ for extended time periods.

We imaged a zebrafish neuromast for 42 h using membrane and nuclei markers. The nuclei marker, Tg(she:H2B-EGFP), only labels the neuromast cells (hair, support and mantle cells), while the membrane marker, Tg(cldnb:lyn-mScarlet), labels the neuromast, surrounding skin cells and ionocytes. Our segmentation model was trained to detect only cells that express both markers.

Imaging was performed on an Olympus IX83 microscope equipped with a microlens-based, super-resolution spinning-disk confocal system (VT iSIM, VisiTech International), using a ×60 1.3-NA silicone-oil objective. This setup yielded a dataset of 500 frames in two colors, with volumes of 73 × 1,024 × 1,024 voxels, at a resolution of 250 × 76.6 × 76.6 μm per voxel. Frames were captured every 5 min.

To ensure optimal segmentation accuracy, we fine-tuned a 3D Cellpose model32 to segment cells using both color channels. We then converted the Cellpose predictions into foreground and contour maps for input into the Ultrack algorithm (Fig. 6a). This approach allowed us to reconstruct lineages spanning the entire time-lapse recording, capturing diverse cellular events such as migration within the organ, cell division and cell death (Fig. 6b,c and Supplementary Video 9).

The bar chart shows error counts for various metrics, with Ultrack obtaining 442 fewer mistakes than TrackMate. e, Two examples demonstrating Ultrack's robustness to over-segmentation, showing the original image (left), fragmented TrackMate results (middle) and accurate Ultrack segmentation and tracking (right) despite imperfect Cellpose input.

To assess Ultrack's accuracy, we visually inspected the generated lineages and manually corrected any errors, creating ground-truth reference lineages. Using the CTC evaluation routines, we quantified Ultrack's performance (Fig. 6d). Ultrack achieved a TRA score of 0.9989, demonstrating its high precision in this challenging scenario.

We compared Ultrack's performance against TrackMate37, using identical Cellpose segmentations as input. To ensure a fair comparison, we first optimized both Ultrack's and TrackMate's parameters using a different 50-frame dataset. Key parameters tuned included minimum and maximum cell size and the maximum movement. We then applied these optimized settings to the full 500-frame dataset reported here.

In this case, Ultrack's tracking results exhibit higher F1 scores of 0.9951 versus 0.9895 and more than twofold reduction in errors (279 versus 721), with 442 fewer mistakes needing manual correction when compared to TrackMate. The primary source of errors in TrackMate's results stemmed from imperfect Cellpose segmentations (Fig. 6d). Despite TrackMate's segmentation filtering options, it struggled to correct issues such as over-segmentation and false merges. In contrast, Ultrack's approach naturally incorporates these imperfect segments into its hypotheses, allowing for more accurate merging and tracking (Fig. 6e).

These results demonstrate Ultrack's ability to maintain high tracking accuracy in this complex, long-term imaging scenario and, thus, its utility for detailed studies of cellular behavior and tissue dynamics.

Cell tracking software often represents one of the most complex components in image analysis pipelines, primarily due to the necessity of handling the time dimension—a factor frequently overlooked in segmentation and other image processing operations. Moreover, it operates on non-matrix data (that is, track lineages), where efficient data processing routines are less prevalent. This complexity has historically restricted accessibility to a broad user base, with only a few long-standing solutions like TrackMate37 and others21,22,31, alongside specialized solutions for handling larger datasets24.

Ultrack addresses these challenges by offering a versatile, user-friendly solution that caters to a wide range of users, from biologists with minimal programming experience to machine learning experts requiring customizable inputs. By providing multiple interfaces and scalable processing capabilities, Ultrack democratizes access to advanced cell tracking technology, enabling efficient analysis of datasets of various sizes across different computational resources (Fig. 1e).

At the heart of Ultrack's accessibility is its multi-interface approach. Ultrack offers two options for users who prefer a graphical interface: Napari and Fiji. The Napari plugin (Extended Data Fig. 3a) integrates transparently with the Python ecosystem, providing a comprehensive set of features for noncoding users. This interface offers graphics-hardware-accelerated preprocessing, vector-field flow computation and full configuration of Ultrack parameters. Complementing this, the Fiji plugin35 (Extended Data Fig. 3b) exposes Ultrack's algorithm to Fiji's mature ecosystem and broad user base, allowing seamless integration with existing Fiji workflows and ensuring compatibility with popular tools like TrackMate37 and Mastodon38. Supplementary Video 10 shows them in action.

For users comfortable with programming, Ultrack provides a user-friendly Python API (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d) that exposes all of its functionalities, allowing for easy customization and reproducible workflows. This API accepts various array formats (for example, NumPy, Zarr and Dask), and can export data into multiple file formats, including networkx79, tables (that is, data frames)80, CTC11 and TrackMate37 formats, enhancing its interoperability with other tools and workflows. Additionally, Ultrack offers a CLI (Extended Data Fig. 3e) designed for batch processing and streamlined workflows, which supports distributed processing in HPC environments. This CLI accommodates any file format supported by existing Napari reader plugins, eliminating the need for data conversion—a crucial feature for handling large datasets.

Ultrack advances cell tracking by offering a robust, scalable solution for analyzing complex cellular dynamics across various scales and dimensions. Its integration of segmentation and tracking, leveraging multilevel contour maps (UCMs), enables effective analysis in challenging scenarios where previous methods often struggled.

The method's versatility is demonstrated through its performance in 3D embryonic CTCs, even when using non-learned classical image processing algorithms. This ability to track without training data or deep fine-tuning addresses a critical challenge in the microscopy field, where 3D annotations are often scarce11. While Ultrack can leverage learned models when available for optimal performance, it remains effective even without them. Furthermore, Ultrack's capacity to combine results from parameter sweeps eliminates the common problem of identifying optimal segmentation parameters. This flexibility extends to working directly with image intensities thus circumventing the need for explicit segmentation in certain scenarios, for example, virtual staining of label-free images. This approach is not limited to label-free imaging, such as QPI, but extends to virtually any imaging method—whether conventional fluorescence microscopy, label-free techniques or virtual staining approaches—that can produce intensity maps highlighting cellular structures, such as nuclei or membranes. By leveraging these intensity-based representations and using direct tracking, Ultrack offers an adaptable and efficient solution to avoid extensive annotation or fine-tuning (that is, deep-learning retraining) of segmentation models. Ultrack also enables processing multichannel data by combining multiple single-channel labels, a feature that, when paired with technologies for engineering multicolored cells50,51, promises a new generation of high-accuracy lineage reconstruction. Finally, Ultrack addresses challenges associated with low temporal resolution through GPU-accelerated flow-field registration between frames, broadening its applicability to more experiments.

The introduction of a dual-channel sparse labeling approach for validation offers a more challenging and heterogeneous benchmark compared to previous studies focused on specific cell subsets or biological contexts15,16,31,64. This approach paves the way for more robust validation of tracking algorithms over extended periods in large datasets.

Ultrack's scalability, tested on both HPC clusters and laptops, addresses the growing demand for tools capable of handling increasingly large and complex datasets produced by advanced imaging technologies1,6,7. This flexibility in computational requirements democratizes access to high-quality cell tracking across diverse research settings.

Ultrack's integration with popular platforms like Fiji35 and compatibility with established tracking frameworks such as TrackMate37 and Mastodon38 positions it for widespread adoption. Its multiple interfaces, ranging from graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to command-line tools for HPC environments, align with community efforts to make complex computational tools more accessible to biologists19,20,33,34,36,81.

Despite its strengths, Ultrack has its limitations. First, the segmentation hypotheses are only as good as the provided foreground and contour maps. While Ultrack is robust to occasional segmentation errors, it may fail when presented with an overwhelming number of incorrect segmentations or systematic errors that persist over time—in such cases, the ILP optimization might converge on erroneous solutions. Additionally, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, large cell movements between adjacent frames violate our assumption of segmentation consistency and can impair tracking performance unless registration is used.

A few strategies can improve Ultrack's effectiveness. For instance, since Ultrack uses region-merging hierarchical segmentation, contour maps that initially over-segment cells are actually beneficial, as they generate more hypotheses for the algorithm to consider. Additionally, as with other tracking approaches, frame registration enhances tracking performance. To help users optimize these aspects, we maintain comprehensive documentation (https://royerlab.github.io/ultrack/optimizing.html), providing guidelines and practical tips for achieving optimal tracking results across different applications.

One might question why we chose to use foreground and contour map prediction models rather than established instance segmentation approaches like Stardist18 or MicroSAM20 in Figs. 4 and 5. The answer lies in the nature of network contour predictions: their probabilistic outputs capture subtle variations in cell boundary likelihood, producing smoothly varying contour values. This continuous representation generates a richer set of segmentation hypotheses compared to instance segmentation methods, which output discrete labels that must then be converted to foreground and contour maps. The probabilistic nature of contour predictions thus provides Ultrack with more information to work with during the optimization process.

Looking ahead, several promising avenues for future development emerge: (i) Integration of advanced deep-learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models for sequence prediction82, could further improve long-term tracking accuracy. (ii) Expansion of the sparse labeling approach to generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for training and benchmarking future tracking algorithms. (iii) Development of interactive correction tools leveraging Ultrack's multiple segmentation hypotheses to facilitate efficient manual curation of tracking results. (iv) Exploration of Ultrack's potential applications beyond developmental biology, including cancer research, immunology and regenerative medicine.

In conclusion, Ultrack's innovative approach for joint segmentation and tracking, combined with its scalability and accessibility, has the potential to accelerate research across a wide range of biological disciplines by enabling more accurate, efficient and accessible cell tracking. Ultrack opens new avenues for investigating complex cellular behaviors, tissue dynamics and developmental processes at unprecedented scales and resolutions.

All zebrafish care and experimental procedures complied with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Adult fish were maintained at 28.5 °C and fed twice daily using an automatic feeder83. Embryos were raised at 28.5 °C, and staged based on hours post fertilization (hpf). For light-sheet microscopy and injection experiments, we used two transgenic lines: Tg(h2afva:h2afva-mCherry; a gift from J. Huisken, University of Göttingen) and Tg(ef1α:H2B-mNeonGreen; a gift from D. Wagner, UCSF). Zebrafish neuromasts were imaged using the transgenic line Tg(cldnb:lyn-mScarlet) crossed with Tg(she:H2B-EGFP)84,85.

MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; VWR) with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm VWR), and penicillin and streptomycin (50 U ml−1; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were stably modified with a variety of red, green and blue markings with a LeGO vector system, as described in Weber et al.52. Lentivirus was prepared as described in Shah et al.86. In brief, pseudoviral particles were generated using 293TN cells (System Biosciences, SBI) co-transfected with lentiviral packaging and envelope plasmids (psPAX and pMD2.G, gifts from D. Trono), and one plasmid of interest containing fluorophore eGFP, mCherry or EBFP2 (Addgene, 25917, 27339 and 85213). Supernatants containing lentivirus were collected, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 200,000g for 4 h at 4 °C, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; VWR) and stored at −80 °C. MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced simultaneously with all three constructs at equal viral titer and a range of multiplicity of infections). To optimize color diversity, a fraction of cells expressing fluorophore was assessed at 5 days after transduction using fluorescence microscopy, and a condition with ≈50% transduction rate of all fluorophores (multiplicity of infection ≈ 0.7) was selected for subsequent experiments. Cells were seeded 12 h before imaging at a density of ≈10,000 per well on a glass-bottom plate coated with 50 μg ml−1 rat tail type I collagen (Corning) in 0.02 N glacial acetic acid (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Imaging was performed on a Keyence BZ- X800 imaging system equipped with temperature, humidity and CO2 control, and images were acquired at a magnification of ×10 at 10-min intervals for 2 days.

DNA plasmids (pMTB-ef1-H2B-mCherry2 gifted by D. Wagner, UCSF) were extracted and purified with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (27104). Purified DNA was diluted to 100 ng l−1 in water (Invitrogen UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water, 10977015) and stored at −20 °C. Zebrafish Tol2 mRNA was prepared using pT3TS-Tol2 plasmids shared by the Ekker lab87. pT3TS-Tol2 plasmid DNA was linearized by the restriction enzyme BamHI digestion. Linearized plasmids were gel-purified with a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (28704). The 5′-capped mRNAs were synthesized using Invitrogen mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 Transcription Kit and purified by lithium included in the kit (Thermo Fisher, AM1348). The purified RNA was dried and dissolved with 20 l DNase/RNase-free water, diluted to 200 ng l−1 and saved as stock at −70 °C. Before the experiment, the stocked DNA and RNA were thawed, and 1 μl DNA plus 1 μl RNA were mixed with 3 μl of DNase/RNase-free water containing 0.05% phenyl red. For each microinjection, a 4-nl mixture was injected into a single cell of a 4–8-cell stage embryo from the Tg(ef1α:H2B-mNeonGreen) strain. All injections were done with an injector (WPI PV830 Pneumatic Pico Pump) and a micromanipulator (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Around 50 to 100 embryos were injected for each experiment. The injected embryos are ready for mounting and imaging at approximately 4.5 hpf.

Embryos are first dechorionated and then gently embedded into a 1% solution of low-gelling-temperature agarose (Sigma, A0701). The samples are then transferred in a glass-bottom cell culture dish (35-mm cell culture dish with glass bottom 20 mm, Stellar Scientific) and positioned at the correct imaging angle using a custom-made capillary. When solid, the agarose surrounding the tail was cut off and removed using a dissection knife and forceps to permit full development and tail elongation. During the time lapses, the embryos are placed in an embryo medium solution with 0.016% tricaine to prevent embryo movement.

The A549 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and maintained between 20% and 90% confluency. The cells were seeded on a 12-well glass-bottom plate (Cellvis, P12-1.5H-N) and imaged using a widefield microscope (Leica Dmi8). The quantitative phase volumes are virtually stained using the VSCyto2D model to highlight landmark channel organelles such as the nuclei and cell plasma58.

Four hours after microinjection, injected embryos (~4 hpf) were screened using a Thunder Imager Model Organism (Leica Microsystems). An embryo with 20–30% H2B-mCherry2-expressing cells (compared to ubiquitous H2B-mNeonGreen cells) was selected and transferred to a glass-bottom petri dish (35-mm cell culture dish with glass bottom 20 mm, Stellar Scientific) containing 0.3× Danieau's embryo medium. The embryo's chorion was removed using sharp forceps under the same microscope. The dechorionated embryo was then gently transferred to a petri dish containing 0.1% low-temperature melting agarose (Sigma, A0701) using a glass pipette. Subsequently, the embryo was transferred to FEP tubes (Valco-TFEP130; outer diameter, 1/16 inch; internal diameter, 0.03 inch; Vici Metronics) with agarose via a micropipette through a 200-μl tip (Eppendorf). Both ends of the FEP tube were sealed with 2% low-temperature melting agarose to secure the embryo. The tube was placed in the chamber of an adaptive multi-view multicolor light-sheet platform9 using a customized holder insertion tool filled with low-toxicity silicone (Kwik-Sil, World Precision Instrument). The mounting system was similar to that previously described in Zebrahub9, but with an upside-down mounting direction. The chamber was filled with embryo water, which was circulated with 0.016% tricaine during imaging. For whole-embryo imaging, the multicolor-interleaved mode was used with an exposure time of 20 ms per channel with the OpenSimView9 microscope. The imaging volume comprised 493 z-planes with 1.625-μm z-steps. Images were captured at 90-s intervals, starting at the shield stage (6 hpf), and ending after 24 hpf.

We used our DaXi imaging platform6 to perform high-resolution tail development imaging (1.0 NA). We use two orthogonal, oblique light sheets for each time point to improve the image field of view coverage. During imaging, the exposure was set to 20 ms, the z-step to 1.24 ms, the imaging volume was adapted to each sample and the time step was around 60 s. Time-lapse sessions are about 10-h long and usually cover a developmental window from 1 or 2 somites to 27 somites.

The Ultrack package, including its REST API, and additional image analysis routine and plotting were implemented using Blosc, CuPy, FastAPI, imagecodecs, iohub, inTRACKtive, httpx, ggplot2, Napari, networkx, Numba, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, scikit-image, SciPy, SLURM, tifffile, traccuracy, uvicorn, websockets and Zarr36,63,74,79,80,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95.

Extended Data Table 3 presents the datasets evaluated in this paper. While not a requirement, some images of the CTC were upsampled for improved accuracy.

Upon acquisition, the imaging data are converted to the OME-Zarr format96,97 using the iohub89 Python package. Next, the raw multi-view images are fused. Phase cross-correlation techniques are applied to correct inter-frame movements to ensure stability throughout the time-lapse sequence. In cases where deep-learning methodologies are utilized, image normalization is performed, scaling pixel intensities to the range between 0 and 1 using user-specified lower and upper quantiles of 0.005 and 0.99999, respectively, and their background is subtracted using the subtract_background function from dexpv2 with σ = 20, which approximates a white tophat transform using morphological reconstruction by dilation. These preprocessing routines and other image processing operations are implemented and accessible via https://github.com/royerlab/dexpv2/.

Flow-field estimation of large 3D volumes can be extremely challenging and computationally intensive, often following particle image velocimetry strategies that estimate local translation using phase cross-correlation for small patches of the data61. Instead of maximizing cross-correlation, which minimizes the mean-squared error between frames given a field in the coordinate space, we use gradient descent to optimize the coordinate space directly. This choice, justified by its enhanced computational efficiency and simplicity, allows for the integration of any differentiable function within the coordinate space. The loss function is defined according to equation (1):

where It denotes the frame at time t, C represents the identity coordinates (that is, no movement), θ indicates the movement flow field we optimize, and TV denotes the L1 total variation loss on the flow field. The grid_sample function, a differentiable data sampling method from PyTorch63, enables this process. This routine is tailored for specialized GPU hardware, greatly enhancing processing speed. The θ optimization is performed for a fixed number of iterations over multiple image resolutions, starting from the lowest resolution, which is then used to initialize the next θ optimization stage. For our experiment (Extended Data Fig. 2), the gradient descent learning rate was set to 1 × 10−2, the number of scales to 2 and the iterations to 2,000. A detailed Jupyter notebook is available at https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack_supplementary/tree/main/configuration/flow_registration/.

The conversion of multiple segmentation labels into foreground and contour maps involves two main processes. For the foreground map generation: (i) each label is transformed into a binary map, with nonzero pixels assigned a value of one (foreground) and zero pixels remaining as background; (ii) these individual maps are merged into a single foreground map by taking the maximum value across corresponding pixels from all individual foreground maps; (iii) this logical OR operation ensures that any pixel belonging to at least one segment is included in the final foreground map. For the contour map generation: (i) to preserve each label and its dual contour, we process each label map to create a binary contour map, where pixels are set to one if their neighboring pixels have differing labels, indicating a boundary; (ii) the final contour map is then created by averaging these individual binary contour maps—summing would yield the same results because the hierarchical segmentation reconstruction is based on ordering of values and not their absolute values, the benefit of averaging is to keep pixel values within the 0 to 1 range.

We also implemented a deep-learning approach to generate foreground and contour maps, which we used for both the CTC submissions (where 3D segmentation annotations were available) and the large zebrafish dataset (Fig. 5). Our implementation uses a U-Net architecture70 that processes single-channel grayscale images to produce two-channel outputs: foreground prediction and contour prediction, each with its sigmoid activation layer.

The network architecture consists of four stages of encoding and decoding, with channel depths of 32, 64, 128 and 256, using 5 × 5 convolution kernels. During decoding, we upsample intermediate representations using linear interpolation and combine them with corresponding encoder features via skip connections. Network training minimizes a dice loss71, supplemented with auxiliary supervision at three intermediate resolutions during decoding, following the approach detailed in ref. 72.

All network weights and architectural details are publicly available at our supplementary repository (https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack_supplementary/), with the complete implementation available at our CTC submission repository (https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack_CTC_submission/).

The goal of hierarchical segmentation is to compute a set of nested partitions (that is, segmentations) from a multilevel contour map, where each level corresponds to a different segmentation threshold. While a naive approach resorts to binarizing the contour map at each level and computing the connected components of the binary images, Ultrack uses a more sophisticated and computationally efficient method: the hierarchical watershed algorithm43,98. This algorithm represents the image as a graph G = (V, E), where V are the pixels or voxels, and E denotes the edges connecting adjacent voxels (four neighbors for 2D and six neighbors for 3D). It defines a non-decreasing order of edge weights as shown in equation (2):

where p, q ∈ E and I(p) is the image intensity at a pixel p of a contour map. The algorithm then recovers nested segmentations using a region-merging approach based on Kruskal's minimum-spanning tree99 and Tarjan's union-find algorithms100. The process begins with an initial segmentation where each pixel forms its own segment. It then iteratively: (i) selects the minimum unseen edge (p, q); (ii) merges the segments of p and q if they are not already in the same segment; (iii) continues until all edges have been processed. This segmentation process operates within each connected component of the binary foreground map, allowing the algorithm to ignore background regions and thereby greatly speeding up the process in non-dense labeling (for example, nuclei). For further details on hierarchical segmentation processing and implementation, see ref. 45.

For each candidate segmentation, we compute the potential temporal associations (that is, tracks). Let \({\boldsymbol{{\mathcal{H}}}}\) represent the set of all segmentations derived from hierarchical segmentations. We define ET as the set of pairs representing potential associations between these segmentations, with w(⋅,⋅) denoting their respective weights. The association process involves the following steps: (i) For each segmentation \(i\in {\boldsymbol{{\mathcal{H}}}}\), where t denotes the time point of segment i, we compute its candidates 2k-nearest neighbors within a predefined radius using their centroid coordinates at time t − 1; (ii) Optional step for additional filtering of neighbors, for example, color-feature association section. (iii) The association score between every segment i and their candidate neighbor j is calculated as w(i, j) = IoU(i, j)γ. Where

and Si is the binary mask of region i (that is, segmentation hypothesis) and γ is consistently set to four throughout our study; (iv) Include into ET the k pairs per segment in t with the largest IoU, using their distance as a tie-breaker.

Given \({\boldsymbol{{\mathcal{H}}}}\) and ET, as defined previously, we compute the joint segmentation and tracking by solving an ILP optimization problem. This ILP framework aims to find the optimal pairing between segments that maximizes their association while adhering to biological constraints. The ILP is formulated as follows in equations (3)–(9):

In this formulation, yi indicates whether a segment is selected, and xij indicates the selected associations, xαi, xiβ and xδi are slack variables indicating an appearing, disappearing and dividing cell, respectively. Equation (3) is the objective function to maximize the association between segmentations. The first term in the objective function represents the weight of segmentation associations, whereas the subsequent terms account for appearance, disappearance and division events, which are user-defined non-positive penalization weights. Equations (4) and (5) ensure flow conservation, stipulating that an appearance, division or incoming association must correspond to at least an outgoing association or a cell disappearance. Equation (6) restricts cell division to preexisting cells, and equation (7) prevents selecting overlapping segmentations, thereby enforcing that each pixel is uniquely selected.

The evaluation scores were calculated using official binaries from the CTC for datasets submitted to the competition. Additional calculations were performed using the traccuracy Python package101. The TRA metric quantifies the cost-effectiveness of editing a predicted lineage into the reference lineage, divided by the cost of constructing the lineage from scratch, AOGM0. This is mathematically defined according to equations (10) and (11):

where nNS represents the number of node splits (that is, undersegmented cells), nFN and nFP are false-negative and false-positive nodes respectively, nED and nEA denote false-positive and false-negative edges, and nEC represents nodes with incorrect semantics. The weights are set as follows: wNS = 5, wFN = 10, wFP = 1, wED = 1, wEA = 1.5 and wEC = 1, emphasizing the greater complexity in correcting missing units compared to deleting extra ones. For further details, refer to Matula et al.49. The combined CTC score averages the TRA and SEG scores. The SEG score calculates the average intersection over union (Jaccard index) across all segmentation instances. A ground-truth (gt) segmentation instance, Gj, is paired to a predicted instance Pi, as in equation (12), if:

This criterion ensures that the overlap between the predicted and gt instances is more than half the size of the gt instance, guaranteeing a single match for each gt instance. The same criterion matches nodes in the AOGM metric calculation.

From the segmentation detections obtained through the CTC procedure, we also computed the F1 score, where

which provides a less-biased assessment of performance102 that combines the evaluation of both nFN and nFP.

In the multicolor and label-free cell culture experiments where not all lineages are annotated, we applied the recommended CTC protocol, where the first frame of the ground truth is provided to indicate which lineages should be kept, all the remaining lineages are removed, and the CTC metric is computed between this subset of lineages and the annotated data.

The sparse tracking data evaluation uses implementation from the Python package linajea24. The metrics are the proportion of different types of mistakes over the total number of edges (that is, connections between cells of adjacent frames) of the ground-truth data. Because the data are sparse, only a subset of metrics are valid estimates for the remaining unlabeled data:

FN: Proportion of false negative (that is, missing edges);

IS: Proportion of identity switches (that is, edges associating incorrect cells);

FP-D: Proportion of false-positive divisions (that is, fake division) within a one-frame tolerance;

FN-D: Proportion of false-negative divisions (that is, missing division) within a one-frame tolerance;

Sum: the sum of all the above.

The image intensity information can be used to filter out segments between adjacent frames that are unlikely to represent the same cell. To do that, we compute a normalized distance between the average intensities of segments, akin to a standard normal distribution z-score; if this distance exceeds a predefined threshold z, their association is excluded from the ILP formulation. Specifically, the relationship must satisfy the following conditions as in equation (13):

where μj is the mean intensity vector within the mask of a segment Sj (represented as set) at time t and σj is the standard deviation. The operations are done element-wise per channel, and \(\max\) results in a scalar from it, here, compared to a neighboring segment Si at t − 1. Therefore, j is the reference node and i is the candidate neighbor node. We formalized the elements in the color vectors according to equations (14) and (15):

where Ip is the intensity values at voxel p, such that for a three-channeled image Ip is a 3D vector.

The motivation behind this formulation is the need for an intensity-invariant distance between colored cells. Hence, using a z-score formulation was a natural choice because the threshold z can be interpreted as how many standard deviations that a color distribution within a cell differs from other distributions of cells. The use of \(\max\) is a conservative choice, so that if any channel independently exceeds the threshold z, the candidate link is rejected.

This can be efficiently computed by making the pairwise comparison only between the 2k candidate pairs of each segment because the default linking already excluded the rest, thus reducing the Nt − 1 × Nt comparisons to Nt × 2k, where k is the number of candidate links defined at the linking step.

The threshold z was set to 3.0 throughout the multicolor experiments, a symmetric quantile threshold equivalent to a 0.0027 probability under our z-score estimation.

Fiji35 is a Java-based software that can be extended through plugins developed in the same language. To integrate Ultrack with Fiji, we developed a RESTful API103 using the FastAPI framework91, facilitating communication between Java and Python. This API uses websockets104 for persistent communication, enabling real-time event logging and output streaming from Ultrack to Fiji. We created a GUI in Java that serves as a Fiji plugin, leveraging the API provided with the Ultrack Python package. This interface grants access to features and functionalities of both systems. The GUI components and user experience are implemented using the Bootstrap 5 (ref. 105) front-end framework. To promote broader interoperability, Ultrack adheres to API specifications detailed in our documentation (https://royerlab.github.io/ultrack/rest_api.html), allowing integration with various programming languages beyond Java and Python.

Napari36 is a Python library for n-dimensional image visualization, annotation and analysis. It features a GUI built with Qt106, which is extensible with Qt primitives in Python. We developed a custom plugin for Napari integration that still scales with large datasets. In addition to the tracking standard workflow, the plugin offers basic preprocessing operations to fit most users' needs, which can benefit from GPU speedups, if any are available. Ultrack's parameters can be tuned through the GUI. The processing runs in the background in a separate thread and, consequently, the intermediate results can be visualized using the native Napari viewer. By the tracking execution finish, the results can be exported to several formats, such as TrackMate37, NetworkX graph79 and Zarr array.

a, Pipeline for intensity-based joint segmentation and tracking from label-free quantitative phase imaging: Quantitative phase image (top left) is processed by VisCy58 to generate virtual staining of nuclei and membrane (second from left). These virtual stains are used to derive contours (third from left) and foreground maps (not shown) through filtering, subtraction, and thresholding. Ultrack uses these inputs to perform tracking (right). b, We compare the above against first applying a Cellpose segmentation to the quantitative phase image (bottom left), then deriving contours (and foreground map, not shown), and then applying Ultrack (right). False positives (over-segmentation) are indicated in magenta, and false negatives in blue. c, Quantitative comparison of tracking errors using Cellpose59 segmentations (gray) versus virtually stained membranes (orange) as input. The bar chart shows the F1-score of detections, upper y-axis and the number of false negative (FN) edges, false negative (FN) detections, and false positive (FP) detections for each method, lower y-axis, from 247 tracklets spanning 48 frames.

a, Consecutive frames, t (magenta) and t + 1 (cyan), highlighting divergent motion along the right boundary. b, Vector field generated by non-linear registration, colored by orientation. c, Qualitative comparison of cell identity preservation: top row shows a cell identity switch in unregistered frames, identity switch indicated by red arrow, bottom row demonstrates improved consistency with flow registration. d, Comparative analysis of tracking accuracy for registered and unregistered data across different cell velocities (Δt), illustrating enhanced performance with registration. The left y-axis corresponds to the colored lines showing TRA scores, while the right y-axis and boxplots show cell movement distributions between adjacent frames in voxels. At Δt = 10.0, some cells move more than 150 voxels between frames - a substantial distance given the median cell diameter of approximately 19.64 voxels. Boxplots followed Tukey's original definition107 using the median for the center line, first (q1) and third quantile (q3) for the box limits and whiskers at q1 - 1.5IQR and q3 + 1.5IQR, where IQR = q3 - q1. Considering a total population size of 100915 and an average size of 10091.5 per group (Δt).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a substantial genetic basis, with APOE4 homozygotes increasingly recognized as a distinct genetic subtype. To identify genotype-specific metabolic pathways and modifiable risk factors, we integrated genetic, plasma metabolomic and dietary data from 4,215 women and 1,490 men in prospective cohorts. Here we show that the associations of 57 metabolites with dementia risk varied by APOE4 genotype or other AD/ADRD risk variants. For example, cholesteryl esters and sphingomyelins were most strongly associated with increased dementia risk in APOE4 homozygotes, whereas inverse associations with glycerides were specific to this genotype. Dimethylguanidino-valeric acid was more strongly associated with dementia risk among carriers of the rs2154481-C allele (APP). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet more effectively modulated dementia-related metabolites in APOE4 homozygotes, suggesting targeted prevention strategies. Incorporating metabolomic data modestly improved dementia risk prediction, particularly during early follow-up. Mendelian randomization analysis identified 19 putative causal relationships between metabolites and cognitive outcomes, including protective effects of 4-guanidinobutanoate, carotenoids and N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine. These findings reveal genotype-dependent metabolic profiles of cognitive health and support precision nutrition approaches for ADRD prevention.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive decline in memory, cognitive function and the ability to perform daily activities1. AD/ADRD has a substantial genetic basis, with heritability estimated at up to 80% from twin studies2. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD3; carrying 1 APOE-ε4 (APOE4) allele increases risk 3–4-fold and 2 alleles increase risk 8–12-fold compared to the common APOE-ε3 allele4. APOE4 exacerbates amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology in the brain5 and is strongly linked to dysregulation in lipid metabolism and impaired cerebral glucose metabolism6, highlighting its multifaceted role in the pathology of ADRD. Recent studies further suggest that APOE4 homozygotes exhibit unique clinical, pathological and biomarker changes that begin at younger ages7. Beyond APOE, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common genetic variants at >80 loci associated with AD/ADRD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1 and CR1, confirming its polygenic basis and implicating key pathogenic pathways such as immune response and endocytosis8,9. However, previous research has predominantly focused on the genetic effects of a limited set of biomarkers that primarily capture Aβ and tau pathologies, often assessed during the prodromal stages of the disease or with limited duration of prospective follow-up. There is a notable lack of evidence about the impact of genetic factors on early stage biomarkers derived from high-throughput omics approaches, such as metabolomics, and their associations with ADRD risk. Furthermore, the potential to leverage identified gene–biomarker interactions to develop individualized prevention and treatment strategies remains largely unexplored.

Metabolomics provides a readout of the combined effects of genetic and environmental factors, offering an expansive snapshot of metabolic states10. Genetic variations, particularly in genes involved in enzyme and transporter functions, directly influence metabolite production, degradation and circulation11. Environmental factors, especially diet, interact with genetics to further shape the metabolome by introducing exogenous metabolites and modulating key metabolic processes, such as inflammation, energy production and oxidative stress12,13. Metabolomic profiles across various tissues, including plasma14, brain15 and cerebrospinal fluid16, have shown associations with ADRD risk and cognitive function. Emerging evidence suggests that the APOE4 genotype may modulate associations between plasma metabolites and dementia risk17,18,19,20. For example, recent findings indicate that females carrying the APOE4 allele have distinct metabolomic profiles, reflecting alterations in lipid and amino acid metabolism, potentially increasing susceptibility to AD17,19. Despite these findings, there is a lack of data from large prospective studies investigating the extent to which associations between the metabolome and cognitive outcomes vary by genetic background. In addition, it remains unclear whether certain modifiable risk factors, such as diet, can mitigate ADRD risk and cognitive decline by targeting specific metabolic pathways across different genetic risk groups.

To examine the interplay of genetics, the plasma metabolome and diet in relation to dementia risk and cognitive function, we conducted a prospective analysis of 4,215 women during a 34-year follow-up in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). Notably, we observed widespread variations in associations between metabolites and cognitive outcomes across genotypes, most notably among APOE4 homozygotes. Associations of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with metabolites and dementia risk were also genotype dependent, with metabolites mediating the MedDiet–dementia risk association only among APOE4 carriers. Integration of genetics with metabolomics improved the prediction of cognitive outcomes. Key findings were replicated in 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) further supported causal relationships between plasma metabolites and cognitive outcomes. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to demonstrate genotype-dependent associations between metabolites and ADRD risk, with additional findings that inform individualized dietary approaches for ADRD prevention.

We prospectively followed 4,215 women in the NHS from 1989 to 2023 (mean age, at baseline, 57 years; Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1), during which 485 participants developed dementia. In addition, we longitudinally assessed objective cognitive function using a telephone-based battery, including the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS), in a subset of 1,037 participants (1995–2008). In the replication analyses in the HPFS, 1,490 men (mean age 63 years at baseline) were prospectively followed from 1993 to 2023, with 121 dementia cases documented (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2). Details of baseline characteristics in both cohorts are provided in Supplementary Text.

a, Prospective follow-up of 4,215 women in the NHS from 1989 to 2023. Genetic and metabolomic profiles were generated from blood samples collected at baseline. Detailed demographic, lifestyle, dietary, medical history and medication use data were collected via questionnaires. Dementia cases were ascertained through the follow-up as a composite endpoint of incident dementia and death due to dementia. In addition, a telephone-based neuropsychological assessment battery was administered longitudinally from 1995 to 2008 to assess cognitive function in a subset of 1,037 participants. A total of 1,490 men from the HPFS were included as a replication cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1a). b, Distribution of plasma metabolites (n = 401).

Source data

Metabolomic data were generated from plasma samples using a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based platform in both the NHS and the HPFS; a total of 401 metabolites from 10 Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) superclasses were included in the NHS analyses after quality control (QC), with 254 of the metabolites available in the HPFS (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 3). Genotyping data were generated from blood samples, followed by QC and imputation (Methods). We extracted the two APOE variants along with 73 other common variants identified from AD/ADRD GWASs9,21 and calculated two polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for ADRD; one included the two APOE variants and one excluded the APOE region, using weights from published studies9,21. We first investigated the global influence of genetic variations on the plasma metabolome, using principal components (PCs) to capture genetic structure. Strong correlations were observed between genetic PC1 or PC2 and metabolites previously linked to ADRD risk, such as trimethylamine N-oxide22 and lithocholate23 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). We next assessed the specific influence of APOE4 genotype on the metabolome. As expected, APOE4 homozygosity was broadly associated with elevated lipid metabolites compared to noncarriers (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

To validate the dementia outcome, we examined plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), an established biomarker for early AD diagnosis24, in 103 NHS participants and found an approximately 3-fold higher dementia risk comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of p-tau217. We further confirmed that carrying APOE4 alleles or having a higher PRS of ADRD was associated with significantly increased risk of dementia and poorer cognitive function in both cohorts (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Text).

We collected long-term dietary data using extensively validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires (SFFQs) in both cohorts. To assess dietary quality, we employed the MedDiet index, the only dietary pattern causally linked to delayed cognitive decline in a long-term, randomized controlled trial25. A widespread distribution of MedDiet adherence was observed (Fig. 1e), with higher MedDiet index scores associated with older age, lower body mass index, higher education level and more physical activity (Supplementary Tables 2 and 5).

We identified 49 significant interactions of metabolites with APOE4 genotypes in relation to dementia risk at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 (Fig. 2a,b, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6). All significant interactions were specific to APOE4 homozygotes, aligning with recent findings on this isoform in AD pathology7 and suggesting that it exhibits a distinct plasma metabolomic profile associated with ADRD risk, evident even decades before disease onset.

Left, in the two heatmaps, the color gradient denoting the HR for dementia risk per 1-s.d. increment in metabolite levels among individuals with different genetic predispositions, as defined by APOE4 genotype or PRS of ADRD (including the APOE variants), estimated using Cox PH model. Only metabolites with FDR < 0.05 for their interaction terms with genotype are displayed in the heatmaps. Right, the color gradient in the two heatmaps representing the product of the β coefficient and the −log10(FDR) of the interaction term between each metabolite and genotype, as defined by the APOE4 genotype or other common AD/ADRD genetic variants, from Cox PH model. In all heatmaps, associations or interactions with FDR < 0.05 are indicated by double asterisks (**) and those with FDR < 0.25 by a single asterisk (*). Metabolites are grouped according to HMDB superclasses. The analyses were conducted among 4,215 NHS participants. b, Gene–metabolite interactions related to dementia risk widely distributed across metabolite superclasses and genotypes.

Each dot represents a metabolite colored by the direction of interaction and grouped by HMDB superclass. Top, for the APOE4 genotype, the data point with the lower FDR between heterozygous (diamond) and homozygous (square) APOE4 interactions included for each metabolite. Bottom, for other common AD/ADRD variants, the most significant interaction across all 73 variants shown for each metabolite.

The first row presents stratified HRs and 95% CIs for dementia risk per 1-s.d. increment in metabolite level, categorized by the APOE4 genotype, with FDR values for interaction terms between APOE4 heterozygosity and homozygosity annotated (using the noncarrier as the reference group). The second row displays stratified results (HR and 95% CIs per 1-s.d. increment in metabolite level) by AD/ADRD variants, with FDR values for interaction terms with the variant effect allele dosage annotated. Genotype groups were defined based on rounded allele dosages. Results for the rs1800978 GG genotype group are excluded due to data sparsity.

APOE4 carriers were not further divided into heterozygotes and homozygotes due to data sparsity among homozygotes with non-missing values for each metabolite in the cognitive function subset. Dementia risk analyses were conducted among 4,215 NHS participants and cognitive function analyses among 1,037 NHS participants. All statistical tests were two sided.

Source data

Subgroup analyses further confirmed distinct association patterns between metabolites and dementia risk among APOE4 homozygotes compared to others, with variations in both the magnitude and, in some cases, the direction of associations (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 7). For example, a significant positive association between betaine and dementia risk was observed only among APOE4 homozygotes (Fig. 2c). Plasma betaine levels reflect both dietary intake and one-carbon metabolism activity26. The protective, albeit nonsignificant, association observed among APOE4 noncarriers and heterozygotes may primarily reflect dietary betaine's benefit for cognitive health27, whereas, in APOE4 homozygotes, elevated betaine may indicate methylation imbalance and metabolic dysregulation, contributing to an increased dementia risk26,28. We observed broadly positive associations across cholesteryl esters (CEs), sphingomyelins (SMs) and dementia risk in all genetic risk groups, with the strongest associations in APOE4 homozygotes. The APOE4 allele promotes the accumulation of cholesterol and CEs in the brain29, activating inflammatory pathways that exacerbate neuronal damage and contributing to the formation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, thereby increasing dementia risk30. We observed inverse associations between glycerides and dementia risk, specifically among APOE4 homozygotes, where elevated glyceride levels likely reflect this reduced delipidation, which may, in turn, limit the aggregation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the formation of amyloid plaques31.

Replication of the findings for dementia risk in objective cognitive function yielded broadly consistent results (Pearson's r ranging from −0.78 to −0.63 for the interaction effect estimates; Fig. 2d and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). Sensitivity analyses, excluding family history of dementia from the covariates or modeling dementia case and death separately, showed similar results (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Independent replication of the NHS findings in the HPFS yielded broadly consistent results (Pearson's r = 0.40), with 32 out of 38 significant interactions (84.2%) in the same direction. Notably, 4 interactions reached P < 0.05 and 10 reached P < 0.10, including inverse interactions with glycerides, although some variation between women and men remained (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 10).

Although APOE4 is the major contributor to the genetic risk of dementia, recent GWASs have identified many other common variants linked to AD/ADRD risk8,9. We examined how these risk variants, either aggregated into PRSs or as individual variants, may modify the associations between metabolites and dementia risk (Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). Although no significant interaction between PRSs and metabolites was detected after multiple testing correction (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Tables 13 and 14), we identified eight significant interactions between individual AD/ADRD variants, including those mapped to ABCA1, APP, ADAMTS1, CTSH and USP6NL, and metabolites in relation to dementia risk with an FDR < 0.05 (Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 15).

We observed that the positive association between 1-methylhistamine, a metabolite involved in immune and inflammatory responses in the brain32 (Fig. 2c), and dementia risk was significantly more pronounced in individuals carrying the rs1800978-G allele mapped to ABCA1, a gene that plays a crucial role in clearing Aβ peptide from the brain33. Dimethylguanidino-valeric acid, a metabolite associated with impaired fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, showed a stronger positive association with dementia risk among individuals carrying the C allele at rs2154481, a variant mapped to the APP gene that encodes Aβ precursor protein (APP), suggesting that dysregulated lipid and glucose metabolism may influence the processing of APP, leading to increased Aβ production34. In addition, lipid metabolites showed significant interactions with AD/ADRD genetic variants. For example, C32:2 phosphatidylcholine exhibited a positive interaction with an ADAMTS1-linked variant (rs2830489-T), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling and neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration35 (Supplementary Text).

A key distinction between metabolomics and genetics is that metabolites can be modified by exogenous factors and may serve as targets for intervention; in particular, diet significantly impacts the metabolome36. We thus examined whether diet, specifically the MedDiet, which has been implicated in cognitive health25, could modulate metabolite levels in individuals with different genetic predispositions to AD/ADRD.

We found that individuals with greater adherence to the MedDiet had a significantly lower risk of dementia and better cognitive function (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6). Notably, these protective associations for dementia risk were more pronounced among APOE4 homozygotes compared to noncarriers and heterozygotes (Fig. 3b), although no clear trend was observed when stratifying by ADRD PRS (Extended Data Fig. 5). The same patterns were observed in the HPFS (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Next, to evaluate MedDiet's impact on the overall metabolomic profile, we used a random Forest (RF) classifier to distinguish individuals with high versus low MedDiet adherence based on plasma metabolite levels. This classifier demonstrated excellent performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.76 in the NHS (Fig. 3c) and 0.72 when replicating in the HPFS (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In addition, individual components of the MedDiet, such as nuts, fruit and monounsaturated fats, were strongly associated with overall metabolomic patterns, as captured by the top two metabolite PCs (Extended Data Fig. 7).

a, Higher adherence to the MedDiet prospectively associated with a lower risk of dementia and enhanced cognitive performance, as assessed by the telephone-based neuropsychological assessment battery (TICS). For dementia risk analysis, a restricted cubic spline Cox PH model estimated HRs and 95% CIs across varying levels of the MedDiet index, using 0 as the reference. The P value from a likelihood ratio test comparing the model without the MedDiet index and the model with its spline term is annotated. For the TICS score analysis, a generalized linear model estimated the adjusted TICS score and corresponding 95% CI across MedDiet index levels, with P values annotated. The analyses were conducted among NHS participants with cognitive and dietary data (n = 86,740 for dementia analysis and n = 16,244 for cognitive function analysis). b, The protective association between adherence to the MedDiet and risk of dementia most pronounced among APOE4 homozygotes. Stratified HR and 95% CIs for dementia risk per a 1-unit increment in the MedDiet index score, categorized by the APOE4 genotype, were estimated from Cox PH models, with stratified P values annotated (unadjusted for multiple comparisons in the hypothesis-driven analysis). The analyses were conducted among NHS participants with genetic, dietary and dementia outcome data (n = 16,497). c, Strong association between adherence to MedDiet and the overall plasma metabolome from an RF model to classify individuals in the top versus the bottom quartile of the MedDiet index based on plasma metabolites.

The analyses were conducted across 4,215 NHS participants. All statistical tests were two sided.

Source data

To assess whether the metabolic response to MedDiet is genotype dependent, particularly in relation to APOE4, we examined the association between MedDiet adherence and metabolite levels across APOE4 genotypes. As anticipated, the overall association patterns differed among APOE4 homozygotes and heterozygotes compared to noncarriers (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 16), with interaction analysis supporting these distinctions (Supplementary Table 17). Similar patterns were observed in the HPFS (Extended Data Fig. 6d, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 18). Consistent with findings from the PREDIMED trial involving a randomized MedDiet37, greater adherence to the MedDiet was associated with higher levels of unsaturated glycerides and lower levels of saturated glycerides, lipid patterns potentially beneficial for cognitive health, as well as increased levels of established neuroprotective compounds, including piperine, betaine and pantothenic acid38,39 (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 16). Among the metabolites showing suggestive APOE4–MedDiet interactions (P < 0.05), we observed an inverse association between MedDiet and asparagine levels exclusively among APOE4 homozygotes (Fig. 3e). This may reflect MedDiet-driven changes in amino acid metabolism, including glutaminolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which are key to asparagine regulation. Given asparagine's role in protein and nucleotide synthesis, its reduction may signal broader metabolic benefits specific to APOE4 homozygotes40. We also identified nominally significant interactions between MedDiet and the APOE4 genotype in relation to 1,7-dimethyluric acid, a derivative of caffeine metabolism with established antioxidant properties and potential neuroprotective effects41 (Supplementary Text).

Furthermore, we found that 39.5% of the association between MedDiet adherence and dementia risk was mediated by a set of metabolites among APOE4 carriers (P = 0.05), whereas no mediation effect was observed among noncarriers or in the full dataset (Methods). Besides the APOE4 genotype, broad interactions were also observed for ADRD PRS and individual variants (Supplementary Tables 19–21). These findings collectively indicated that the MedDiet's potential to modulate cognitive health-related metabolites varied by APOE4 genotype, suggesting that this dietary pattern could be an effective strategy to delay dementia onset in APOE4 homozygotes, despite their higher risk profile.

Given that genetics, metabolites and MedDiet adherence are all linked to dementia risk, we further examined how incorporating these factors could enhance the prediction of cognitive outcomes. Compared to a baseline model, which included age, family history of dementia, education level, smoking status, history of depression or regular antidepressant drug use and the MedDiet index, adding APOE4 and ADRD PRS to Cox model moderately improved the performance for predicting dementia risk (Fig. 4a; average AUC improved from 0.75 to 0.77). This also demonstrated that genetic factors capture additional information beyond family history of dementia and that the ADRD PRS adds modest but incremental predictive value beyond APOE4. Adding metabolites predictive of dementia risk to the model further improved the time-specific model performance, indicating that metabolites provide additional predictive value beyond the MedDiet and other major dementia risk factors (average AUC = 0.78; Supplementary Table 22). As expected, these baseline characteristics were better at predicting short-term dementia risk, that is, 15-year risk, compared to long-term risk, which may be attributed to the inherent within-individual variability of metabolomic measurements over longer follow-up periods, potentially introducing random measurement error. Similar patterns were observed for Harrell's C-index (Extended Data Fig. 9). The performance of different models in APOE4 subgroups did not substantially deviate, likely due to the limited sample size and number of cases within these subgroups, which may have introduced substantial instability. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to more reliably evaluate prediction performance within APOE4 subgroups.

Time-dependent ROC curve analyses were conducted for dementia risk over both the entire follow-up period and the first 15 years of follow-up. The baseline model predictors included age, family history of dementia, education level, smoking status, history of depression or regular antidepressant use and MedDiet index. The PRS of ADRD excluded variants in the APOE region (see Methods for selection of metabolite predictors). b, Plasma metabolites among the top contributors for predicting dementia risk as quantified by the SHAP value. Feature contributions were evaluated for Cox PH model to predict overall and 15-year dementia risk, including the full list of predictors. SHAP values were calculated for each category of predictors by summing the SHAP value of all predictors in that category. Features were ranked by the SHAP value from the highest to the lowest for predicting the overall and 15-year dementia risk. c, Integration of genetic and metabolomic data enhancing cognitive status prediction within APOE4 subgroups. The heatmap displays AUCs from an RF model classifying participants in the highest versus the lowest tertile of the overall TICS score. In subgroup analyses by APOE4 carrier status, APOE4 genotype was excluded as a predictor. For all analyses, the NHS dataset (n = 4,215) was randomly divided into training (60%) and test (40%) sets; models were fitted on the training set and evaluated on the test set. All results shown are from the test set.

Source data

We employed the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values to quantify the contributions of individual predictors to dementia risk predictions. As anticipated, age, APOE4 and ADRD PRS were among the top contributors (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 23). Plasma metabolites meaningfully contributed to the prediction throughout the entire follow-up period, with their overall contribution ranking just below age and genetic factors. In contrast, for short-term risk prediction, MedDiet emerged as a major predictor. The relatively modest contribution of MedDiet to overall follow-up predictions likely reflects the use of baseline dietary data only, which does not account for changes in dietary behavior over time. We observed similar patterns in the HPFS (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b) and when predicting a dichotomized TICS score (highest versus lowest tertile) within APOE4 subgroups, whereas no improvement was observed in the full dataset (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 8). The unstable results for cognitive score prediction likely reflect limited sample size in the subset. Larger studies are needed to further assess the predictive utility of these models for cognitive function.

Last, genetics can offer mechanistic insights by using variants as instrumental variables to test whether associations between metabolites and cognitive outcomes are causal using the MR approach. To maximize the statistical power and mitigate biases, we implemented a two-sample MR design leveraging data from published GWASs and selected genetic instruments for 657 metabolites and 133 ratios of metabolite pairs sharing an enzyme or transporter (reflecting metabolic flux; Supplementary Tables 24 and 25)11. Cognitive outcomes included overall dementia, AD, vascular dementia and cognitive function (Fig. 5a and Methods).

a, Schematic of the two-sample MR and colocalization analyses. Genetic instruments were selected for 657 metabolites and 133 metabolite ratios from a published GWAS. Summary statistics for overall dementia, AD, vascular dementia and cognitive performance were also obtained from published GWASs (Methods). Two-sample MR was performed to identify putative causal relationships between metabolites or ratios and cognitive outcomes, followed by colocalization analysis for the causal associations with an FDR < 0.05. b, Identification of numerous putative causal interrelationships of various metabolites, metabolite ratios and cognitive outcome using genetic instruments. The chord diagram displays causal relationships with an FDR < 0.05 from MR analyses using Wald ratio, inverse variance-weighted or MR Egger methods, where each arc represents an identified link between a metabolite or ratio and a cognitive outcome. Arcs and nodes are color coded by the HMDB superclasses. c, Colocalization analyses strengthening evidence of causality, suggesting that the identified putative causal relationships between metabolites or ratios and cognitive outcomes have potential shared causal variants and biology. Putative causal relationships, represented by the odds ratios (ORs) or β coefficients with 95% CIs, are shown for associations with FDR < 0.05 and colocalization signals. Bayesian colocalization analysis was performed within the ±500-kb region around a genetic instrument (Methods). If multiple instruments were used, a causal association was reported if the metabolite or ratio and cognitive outcomes colocalized at least one genetic locus. Colocalization signals were reported for a locus if the conditional probability of colocalization, PP.H4/(PP.H3 + PP.H4), was >70%, where PP.H3 is posterior probability that the two traits have independent causal variants and PP.H4 is the posterior probability that the two traits share a single causal variant. d, Regional genetic association plots providing evidence of potential shared causal variants affecting both metabolites or ratios and cognitive outcomes at specific genetic loci. The plots display genetic association results for metabolites or ratios and cognitive outcomes at three colocalized loci with PP.H4/(PP.H3 + PP.H4) > 70%. Each plot is annotated with the genetic instrument and dots are color coded according to their linkage disequilibrium with the instrumental variant. The −log10(P) values for both metabolites or ratios and cognitive outcomes were obtained from the original GWASs. The sample sizes for the original GWASs are as follows: metabolites or ratios (n = 8,299), cognitive performance (n = 257,841), dementia (5,933 cases and 166,584 controls), AD (90,338 cases and 1,036,225 controls) and vascular dementia (881 cases and 211,508 controls) (Methods). All statistical tests were two sided. Panel a created using BioRender.com.

Source data

We identified 99 significant causal relationships involving 95 metabolites or ratios across all 4 outcomes at an FDR < 0.05 (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 26). A colocalization analysis was further performed to prioritize metabolite–outcome pairs with potential shared genetic basis and biology; we identified 19 pairs with a conditional posterior probability of colocalization >70% under a single causal variant assumption (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 27).

A notable finding was the protective causal effect of 4-guanidinobutanoate (4-GBA) on dementia, supported by colocalization signals (Fig. 5d); 4-GBA is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related metabolite involved in inhibitory neurotransmission42 and may counteract excitotoxicity, a known contributor to dementia pathogenesis43. The genetic instrument, rs140527149, is mapped to AGMAT, which encodes agmatinase, an enzyme involved in the degradation of agmatine in the brain44. Evidence suggests that agmatine may have therapeutic potential for AD by modulating Aβ production, aggregation and clearance45. Our findings highlight potential shared pathways involving 4-GBA, GABA and agmatine in dementia pathology. Carotene diol (1) and (2), naturally occurring carotenoids with potent antioxidant properties46, showed protective effects against AD, consistent with randomized controlled trial evidence causally linking carotenoid intake to reduced cognitive decline47. Building on studies showing altered glutamine levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with AD48, our findings also highlighted glutamine's potentially neuroprotective role in AD (Supplementary Fig. 9). For cognitive function, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine exhibited a strong beneficial effect, with colocalization signals allowing for multiple causal variants (Methods and Supplementary Table 28). A number of causal relationships were identified between metabolites involved in ATP metabolism, suggesting a causal role for the interplay between disrupted energy metabolism and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline (Supplementary Text). Future investigations into these pathways could inform targeted therapeutic strategies.

Elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ADRD and identifying modifiable factors capable of targeting these mechanisms are critical for prevention. Given the strong genetic basis of ADRD, accounting for genetic predisposition is essential when investigating these mechanisms. In this study, we leveraged up to 34 years of follow-up and multiomics data from the NHS, with independent replication in the HPFS, to comprehensively examine gene–metabolite interactions in relation to ADRD risk. We identified distinct plasma metabolomic profiles of dementia risk among APOE4 homozygotes. Beyond APOE4, we found that the metabolite–dementia associations are also modified by other common AD/ADRD risk variants implicated in cholesterol homeostasis, mitochondrial function, APP production and extracellular matrix integrity. Notably, adherence to the MedDiet contributed to cognitive health in an APOE4-dependent manner, potentially mediated by metabolites. We further demonstrated that incorporating metabolites into predictive models alongside traditional and genetic predictors improved the prediction performance. Our two-sample MR analysis further supported the causal effects of specific metabolites, such as 4-guanidinobutanoate, carotene diol and glutamine, on cognitive outcomes.

ADRD has long been considered a metabolic disease, largely due to the central role of APOE4 in lipid transport and metabolism6. Emerging evidence indicates that the metabolomic contributions to ADRD risk are modulated by APOE4 status17,18,19,20. A recent study further highlights that APOE4 homozygosity represents a distinct genetic subtype which exhibits significantly higher levels of AD pathological markers at a younger age7. Our study extends those findings, revealing that APOE4 not only distorts lipid metabolism but also affects other pathways, including betaine and the urea cycle (for example, citrulline) metabolism. These findings suggest a broader role for APOE4, implicating its involvement in neuroinflammation, gut-derived choline metabolism and neurotoxic pathways that elevate ADRD risk5,49. Furthermore, our findings, aligned with the recent study7, indicate that APOE4 homozygosity uniquely alters the plasma metabolome and its associations with ADRD risk, underscoring the necessity of distinguishing homozygotes from heterozygotes in investigations of APOE4's role in AD pathology. Although APOE4 homozygotes exhibit a high penetrance of AD biology, not all individuals progress to clinical AD6. This resilience presents an opportunity to identify protective mechanisms specific to APOE4 homozygosity. Our findings highlight the potential for preventive strategies targeting specific metabolic pathways in this high-risk group. Beyond APOE4, examination of other common risk variants identified additional findings pointing to broader pathogenic mechanisms.

Consistent with the results from the PREDIMED trial25, we found that long-term adherence to the MedDiet was strongly associated with lower ADRD risk. We further examined whether this association varied by genetic predisposition. A key distinction of our study, compared to previous studies with mixed findings50,51,52, is that we went beyond the binary classification of APOE4 carrier status and found particularly strong associations only among APOE4 homozygotes. The strongest association in APOE4 homozygotes may reflect more effective modulation of ADRD-related metabolic profiles by the MedDiet in this genotype. Thus, our study not only identifies mechanistic insights, but also proposes actionable prevention strategies targeting these pathways. This has important implications for public health messaging, highlighting the overall benefit of adhering to the MedDiet for ADRD prevention, as well as the potential for targeted interventions in genetically vulnerable populations. In addition, our findings underscore the value of metabolites in predicting ADRD risk decades before disease onset. Last, our two-sample MR analysis corroborated established mechanisms in ADRD pathology, such as the role of GABAergic signaling, reinforcing causality derived from mechanistic studies and randomized controlled trials, including evidence of carotenoids' neuroprotective effects. We also identified new causal biomarkers, including metabolites involved in glutamine, urate and hypotaurine metabolism (Supplementary Text). Collectively, these findings suggest potential druggable targets and inform pathways for more effective and precise prevention and treatment strategies for ADRD.

Our study has limitations. It was conducted in well-educated individuals of European ancestry, which may limit generalizability but enhances internal validity. Ascertainment bias is possible given the exclusion of participants with dementia at baseline, although the baseline age was relatively young and APOE4 homozygotes did not differ significantly in health status, making major bias unlikely. Dementia outcomes were based on self-reported physician diagnoses and death records, which may introduce misclassification, but validity is supported by participants' professional backgrounds, strong associations with known genetic factors and p-tau217 and consistency across data sources. Although omics-based models are not yet widely implemented clinically, emerging tools such as PRSs and aging clocks show translational promise (Supplementary Text). Despite these limitations, our large, prospective design enabled robust examination of gene–metabolite–diet interactions over decades of follow-up. Importantly, key findings in women were independently validated in men, supporting generalizability across sexes, particularly relevant given the sex-based differences in both metabolite profiles53 and dementia risk54.

In conclusion, our study highlights the substantial influence of genetic variants, particularly APOE4 homozygosity, on plasma metabolites and their associations with ADRD risk. These genetic effects are widespread across the plasma metabolome and our findings identify the MedDiet as a promising approach to mitigate genetically dependent ADRD risk by targeting a broad spectrum of metabolic pathways. Moreover, this work provides a uniquely valuable resource for advancing the early prediction of ADRD risk through emerging omics-based biomarkers and identifying causal mechanisms underlying ADRD risk, which hold potential as prevention targets and druggable pathways.

This study included de-identified data from participants who had consented to the use of their anonymized information for research purposes. Participants were not financially compensated for their participation. Approvals for the study protocol of the NHS and the HPFS were granted by the institutional review boards of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (institutional review board protocol nos. 1999P011114/BWH for the NHS and HSPH 22067-102 for the HPFS).

The NHS is a prospective cohort study that enrolled 121,700 US female registered nurses aged 30–55 years in 197655. The participants were followed biennially to collect information on diet, lifestyle, medication use and newly diagnosed diseases through mailed self-administered questionnaires. We included 4,215 women who were aged <75 years and free from dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke and cancer at baseline when the blood samples were collected (1989–1992); the blood was assayed for genetics and metabolomics, as described in detail below.

The HPFS is a prospective cohort study that enrolled 51,529 US male health professionals aged 40–75 years in 1986. Similar to the NHS, the participants were followed biennially via mailed questionnaires. We included 1,490 men who met the same inclusion and exclusion criteria at baseline (1993–1996), when the blood samples were collected, as a replication cohort.

The participants were followed from the baseline to 2023 for a composite dementia endpoint, which included self-reported dementia and deaths due to dementia. Participants self-reported a physician diagnosis of AD or other forms of dementia (ADRD) every 2 years via questionnaires. Deaths were identified through state vital statistics records, the National Death Index, family reports and the postal system. A study physician reviewed medical records and death certificates to determine whether dementia was listed as the primary or contributing cause of death. Our system for death ascertainment and death cause adjudication is validated and >98% of deaths were identified56.

Objective cognitive function was assessed through a telephone cognitive interview in a subset of 1,037 NHS participants aged ≥70 years, with four telephone interviews conducted between 1995 and 2008. The telephone cognitive battery initially included the TICS, which is a telephone adaptation of the Mini-Mental State Examination57. Five other tests were added later, including (1) immediate recall of the East Boston Memory Test (EBMT), (2) delayed recall of the EBMT, (3) delayed recall of the TICS ten-word list, (4) a test of verbal fluency and (5) the digit span backward test. We assessed three cognitive measures, including the TICS score and the composite scores for global cognition and verbal memory. Global cognition included all six tests. Verbal memory included four tests: immediate recall of the ten-word list in the TICS, delayed recall of the TICS ten-word list and immediate and delayed recalls of the EBMT. To calculate the composite scores for global cognition and verbal memory, we first calculated z-scores for each test at each measurement, based on the baseline mean and the s.d. We then averaged these z-scores across all relevant tests at each measurement and calculated the overall mean value across all measurements.

Details of genotyping, QC and imputation for the NHS and HPFS are described elsewhere58 (https://github.com/cturman15/ChanGWASlab) and in Supplementary Text. Blood samples were genotyped using one of six genotyping platforms. We restricted the samples to inferred European ancestry based on genetic PCs. Post-QC data were imputed using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 v5 reference panel. APOE4 genotype was determined using two SNPs: rs429358 and rs7412. APOE4 homozygotes carried C/C alleles for both SNPs and APOE4 heterozygotes carried C/T for rs429358 and C/C or C/T for rs7412. All other combinations of alleles were considered APOE4 noncarriers. The average imputation quality score for rs429358 and rs7412 was 0.91 and 0.87 across genotyping platforms, respectively. We calculated PRSs for ADRD using weights from two published studies9,21,59. The PRS developed by Bellenguez et al. (PGS002280) comprised 83 variants and excluded any variants from the APOE region9. The PRS developed by Zhang et al. (PGS000334) comprised 22 variants and included the two APOE variants21. Only variants available in the imputed genetic data were included in the PRS calculation (Supplementary Table 11). The PRS was calculated as a weighted sum of the effect allele dosage across all included variants for each individual and was standardized to have a mean of 0 and an s.d. of 1 within each genotyping platform to maximize comparability. We further extracted individual variants from these two PRSs, which were identified in previous GWASs of AD/ADRD. Duplicated variants and those with a minor allele frequency <0.01 were removed from the combined list, followed by linkage disequilibrium pruning (r2 < 0.1 with the 1000 Genomes European population as the linkage disequilibrium reference) using the SNPclip function in the LDlinkR package in R, leaving a total of 73 variants for subsequent analyses (Supplementary Table 12).

Plasma metabolomic profiling was performed for nested case–control studies within the NHS and HPFS using high-throughput LC–MS techniques at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Cambridge, MA, USA). Additional details of metabolomic profiling are provided in Supplementary Text. For metabolites with <25% missing data in an individual study, missing values were imputed with half of the minimum measured value for that metabolite in that study; metabolites with <100 samples were removed. A probit transformation was applied to metabolites within each study to correct for batch effects, reduce the impact of skewed distributions and heavy tails on the results and scale the metabolite values to the same range. After merging the metabolite data with other types of data (n = 4,215 for the NHS and n = 1,490 for the HPFS), we excluded metabolites with ≥90% missing values among dementia cases with genetic data. We further excluded metabolites with an intraclass correlation coefficient <0.4 or coefficient of variation in the top 10 percentiles of all remaining metabolites. A total of 401 metabolites was included in the final analysis for the NHS, of which 254 were available in the HPFS. We created another set of metabolomics data for the NHS by selecting those with ≥100 samples and <25% missing values from the 401 metabolites in the final dataset, followed by RF imputation with 100 trees using the missRanger package in R; 237 metabolites were retained for subsequent analyses of the overall metabolomic profile that required no missing data. Using the same approach, we retained 164 non-missing metabolites in the HPFS.

Dietary intakes were assessed using SFFQs. The validity and reproducibility of the SFFQs have been demonstrated in previous publications60. We calculated the average dietary intakes from the first dietary assessment (1980 for the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS) to the SFFQ closest to the blood draw time to reflect the long-term diet. The MedDiet was assessed using the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score, which was calculated based on nine components61. For vegetables, fruit, nuts, whole grains, legumes, fish and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat, a score of 1 was given if the intake was at or above the SFFQ-specific median; otherwise, 0 was given. For red and processed meat consumption, a score of 1 was assigned if the intake was below the SFFQ-specific median; otherwise, a score of 0 was assigned. For alcohol intake, a score of 1 was assigned if the intake was between 5 and 15 g d−1; otherwise, a score of 0 was assigned. The scores of individual components were summed to obtain the overall MedDiet index, which ranged from 0 to 9.

We assessed the overall correlation of genetic data, the MedDiet index and the plasma metabolome in the NHS. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for each of the 401 metabolites with genetic PC1 and PC2. Correlation coefficients were then ranked from highest to lowest for PC1 and PC2, respectively. The overall rank was determined by summing the ranks of PC1 and PC2 and ranking them from lowest to highest.

Leveraging the 237 metabolites with no missing values in the NHS (see above), we assessed the overall correlation between metabolites and the MedDiet index, as well as the predictive performance of metabolites on the MedDiet index. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for the MedDiet index and its individual components (monounsaturated and saturated fat calculated separately) with metabolites PC1 and PC2 calculated from the 237 metabolites. RF regression was performed to evaluate the predictive performance of the metabolites on the MedDiet index. The dataset was first randomly split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets. A dichotomized MedDiet index outcome was derived from the top and bottom quartiles of the continuous score. RF regression with five-fold cross-validation was performed on the training set to tune the parameter using the train and trainControl functions in the caret package in R. The tuned model was then applied to the test set to evaluate performance using the AUC. The same approach was applied to the HPFS to assess the predictive performance of metabolites on the MedDiet index.

Cox PH models were fitted to assess the associations between each of the 401 metabolites and the time-to-event outcome of dementia among 4,215 women in the NHS using the coxph function in the survival package in R. Details of covariate assessment and adjustment are provided in Supplementary Text. The FDR correction was applied to the P value for metabolites using the Benjamini–Hochberg approach, with an FDR < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The same approach and FDR threshold were used for all other analyses involving multiple testing corrections in this study, including all interaction tests. All statistical tests in this study were two sided. For the interaction analysis of metabolites and APOE4 status, interaction terms between APOE4 carrier status (or APOE4 heterozygote and homozygote) and the metabolite were added to the model, along with ADRD PRS (excluding the APOE region) and its interaction term with the metabolite. For the models of APOE4 heterozygote and homozygote, FDR correction was applied jointly to the interaction P value of the two APOE4 terms. In addition, likelihood ratio tests were performed comparing the model with and without the APOE4 interaction terms. For the interaction analysis of metabolites with ADRD PRS or other AD/ADRD variants, the relevant gene–metabolite interaction terms (PRS or effect allele dosage) were added to the model, along with APOE4 heterozygote and homozygote. All interaction models were additionally adjusted for the top four genetic PCs and genotyping platforms. For the subgroup analyses within APOE4 noncarriers, carriers and heterozygotes, the models were further adjusted for the ADRD PRS (excluding the APOE region), the top four genetic PCs and genotyping platforms. For APOE4 homozygotes, the models were adjusted for only continuous covariates, ADRD PRS and the top four genetic PCs due to the limited sample size. For analyses within ADRD PRS tertiles (defined using genetic PC-adjusted scores), no additional covariate was adjusted.

Generalized linear models (Gaussian family) were fitted to assess the association between each objective cognitive function score and each of the 401 metabolites among a subset of 1,037 women with cognitive function measurements using the glm function of the stats package in R. The models were adjusted for the same covariates as in the dementia risk analysis. Interaction analysis was performed for APOE4 carrier status with the same additional covariates as in the dementia risk analysis. APOE4 carriers were not further stratified into heterozygotes and homozygotes due to data sparsity among homozygotes in this subset. FDR correction was applied to the interaction P value per cognitive outcome. Interaction analysis with other genetic factors or subgroup analysis was not performed due to the limited power.

As a replication, interaction analysis of the 254 available metabolites was conducted in 1,490 men from the HPFS, with additional adjustment for profession. Due to data sparsity in non-missing values for each metabolite, only interactions with APOE4 carrier status were assessed.

In the analysis of the associations of the MedDiet index score with dementia risk and objective cognitive function, we leveraged data from the full NHS cohort and excluded participants who had dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke, cancer or missing components for the MedDiet index at baseline, which was 1980 for the dementia endpoint and 1994 for the objective cognitive function. For the analysis of the objective cognitive function, we further excluded participants aged <70 years at baseline. A total of 86,740 participants were included in the analysis of dementia risk and 16,244 participants in the analysis of objective cognitive function.

Cox PH model was fitted to prospectively assess the association between the continuous MedDiet index and the time-to-event outcome of dementia risk. Details of covariate adjustment are provided in Supplementary Text. A cubic spline regression model was fitted to assess the nonlinear trend. Subgroup analyses were performed by APOE4 genotype and tertiles of ADRD PRSs.

Generalized linear models were fitted to assess the association between the continuous MedDiet index and the objective cognitive function scores. These models adjusted for the same covariates as the dementia risk model. Subgroup analyses were performed by APOE4 genotype and tertiles of ADRD PRSs.

As a replication, a total of 43,500 male participants from the HPFS were included in the analysis of the association between MedDiet adherence and dementia risk, applying the same exclusion criteria as in the NHS. The same Cox PH and cubic spline models were fitted, with additional adjustment for profession. Subgroup analyses were performed by APOE4 genotype.

Generalized linear models were fitted to assess the association between the MedDiet index and each of the 401 metabolites among 4,215 women in the NHS, adjusting for the same covariates as the above linear model for cognitive function and metabolites. Subgroup analyses were performed by APOE4 genotype and tertiles of ADRD PRS (excluding APOE region). As a replication, the same models were fitted to assess the association between the MedDiet index and each of the 254 overlapping metabolites among 1,490 men in the HPFS, additionally adjusted for profession.

We conducted a mediation analysis to quantify the extent to which metabolites mediate the association between MedDiet adherence and dementia risk in the NHS. Metabolites associated with both dementia risk (P < 0.05) and MedDiet adherence (FDR < 0.05) were selected as candidate mediators, followed by orthogonal filtering using a correlation threshold of r < 0.5 to exclude highly correlated metabolites, resulting in seven metabolites: allantoin, C16:1 CE, C18:0 SM, 1-methylguanine, 1,7-dimethyluric acid, C34:5 phosphatidylcholine plasmalogen and piperine. Regression-based mediation analyses were then conducted by comparing a full model (including both MedDiet and selected metabolites) with a reduced model (excluding metabolites), with dementia risk as the dependent variable to quantify the proportion of the effect of MedDiet adherence on dementia risk, explained by these selected metabolites in the full dataset, as well as stratified by APOE4 carrier status.

Cox PH models were built for predicting dementia risk among 4,215 women in the NHS. The dataset was first randomly split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, including within APOE4 subgroups. A 15-year outcome-free attainment was defined by censoring participants without event by year 15. We built four prediction models: the baseline model included age, family history of dementia, educational attainments of nurses, smoking status, history of depression or regular antidepressant drug use and the MedDiet index; the APOE4 model further included the APOE4 heterozygote and homozygote indicators, the PRS model the ADRD PRS (excluding the APOE region) and the metabolite model the selected metabolites, including 12 metabolites for predicting overall outcomes and 4 metabolites for predicting the 15-year outcome-free attainment (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Table 22). APOE4 predictors were not included in the models for APOE4 subgroups. All models were built in the training set and evaluated on the test set. Time-dependent AUC was calculated based on an incident/dynamic version of sensitivity and specificity within distinct risk sets, defined as groups of participants who remained at risk for developing dementia at specified time points, which provides a dynamic view of model performance across the follow-up period62, using the risksetAUC function in the risksetROC package in R. Harrell's C-index63 was calculated to quantify the overall discriminative ability of the model by assessing how well the model can rank individuals by their risk of the event using the survival package in R. Feature contributions were quantified by the SHAP value64 for Cox PH model in predicting overall and 15-year dementia risk, including the full list of predictors using the fastshap package in R. SHAP values were calculated for each category of predictors by summing the SHAP value of all predictors in that category.

RF models with 500 trees were built for predicting the dichotomized outcomes of the highest versus the lowest tertile of the continuous cognitive function scores, using the randomForest package in R. The same predictors and analysis strategy were used as in the prediction models for dementia risk. The AUC was calculated to evaluate the model performance in the test set.

As a replication, Cox PH models were built to predict dementia risk among 1,490 men in the HPFS. The same modeling approaches were applied, with profession included in the baseline model instead of education level. Due to data sparsity, prediction models were constructed only for the overall dementia risk in the full dataset. The 164 RF-imputed metabolites with no missing values were considered as candidate predictors and 5 metabolites were selected in the final model, following the same procedure used in the NHS (Supplementary Table 22).

Two-sample MR analysis65 was conducted to assess the causal relationships between plasma metabolites and cognitive outcomes using published GWAS summary statistics. GWAS summary statistics for the exposures, including plasma metabolites and metabolite ratios, were obtained from ref. 11 and for the cognitive outcomes were obtained from GWASs of overall dementia66, AD8, vascular dementia66 and cognitive performance67. There was no overlap of the participants between the GWAS cohorts of the exposures and the outcomes. All GWAS populations were of European ancestry.

In the original study11, GWASs were performed for 1,091 plasma metabolites and 309 metabolite ratios. In this study, we included all the variant–metabolite and variant–metabolite ratio pairs selected by the original study for MR analyses, with additional selection applied to metabolites and ratios not included in the original set (Supplementary Text). A total of 1,431 variant–metabolite pairs for 657 metabolites and 186 variant–metabolite pairs for 133 metabolites ratios were selected for the MR analysis.

We used three MR methods to assess the causal effect of each metabolite or ratio on each cognitive outcome. Wald ratio method was used when there was only one genetic instrument. The inverse variance-weighted method was used when there were at least two instruments. The MR Egger method was used when there were at least three instruments and potential pleiotropy was detected. MR analysis was performed using the mr function in the TwoSampleMR package in R. Details of the sensitivity analyses are described in Supplementary Text.

Colocalization analysis was performed for exposure–outcome pairs that passed FDR < 0.05 in the MR analysis. For each pair, Bayesian colocalization analysis was performed in the ±500-kb region around each genetic instrument, restricting to variants with minor allele frequency <0.01, using the coloc.abf function with default prior probabilities in the coloc package in R. Colocalization signals were reported for a locus if the conditional probability of colocalization, PP.H4/(PP.H3 + PP.H4), was >70%, where PP.H3 is posterior probability that the two traits have independent causal variants and PP.H4 is the posterior probability that the two traits share a single causal variant. These colocalized exposure–outcome pairs were considered to have putative causal relationships. If there were instruments at multiple loci for a pair, the causal relationship was reported if the exposure and outcome were colocalized at at least one genetic locus. The coloc.abf function assumes that there is a single causal variant for each trait. We further conducted a sensitivity analysis that relaxed the single causal variant assumption using the coloc.susie function in the coloc package in R, which calculates posterior probabilities under the assumption of multiple causal variants.

(a) We prospectively followed 1,490 men in Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) from 1993 through 2023. Genetic and metabolomic profiles were generated from blood samples collected at baseline. Detailed demographic, lifestyle, dietary, medical history and medication use data were collected via questionnaires. Dementia cases were ascertained through the follow-up as a composite endpoint of incident dementia and death due to dementia. (b) Associations between established genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and dementia risk. Lines indicate cumulative incidence across APOE4 genotypes and tertiles of polygenic risk score (PRS) of ADRD (excluding the APOE region) over the follow-up period, with shaded areas representing 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and P from the log-rank test annotated. Consistent with the curves, unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models; covariate-adjusted HRs with 95% CIs are provided in Supplementary Table 4. Person-time was accrued from baseline until the earliest occurrence of an incident dementia case, dementia death or the end of follow-up. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons, as this was a hypothesis-driven analysis. The analyses were conducted among 1,490 HPFS participants. All statistical tests were two-sided. Panel a created using BioRender.com.

Source data

(a) Correlations between genetic principal components (PCs) and metabolites: PC1 (top panel) and PC2 (bottom panel). The dashed lines denote false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons, based on Pearson's correlation tests. (b) Associations of APOE4 heterozygosity (top panel) and homozygosity (bottom panel) with metabolites, with APOE4 noncarrier as the reference group from Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, the top 4 genetic PCs, and genotyping platforms. The dashed lines denote nominal P = 0.05 (none with FDR < 0.05). All analyses were conducted among 4,215 NHS participants. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Source data

(a) Number of metabolites with significant interactions with APOE4 genotype. (b) Number of metabolites with significant interactions with other common AD/ADRD variants. Bars indicate the number of associations that reached nominal significance (P < 0.05) based on the Cox proportional hazards models, and those that remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate <0.05). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Source data

Each dot represents a metabolite with significant APOE4 interactions in Nurses' Health Study (NHS; n = 38 out of 49 available in Health Professionals Follow-Up Study [HPFS]), colored by the Human Metabolome Database superclass (see Fig. 2 for legend). Pearson's correlation coefficients in the β coefficients for interaction terms between metabolites and APOE4 carrier status estimated from Cox proportional hazards models with dementia as the dependent variable in NHS and HPFS is annotated on the figure. APOE4 carriers were not further stratified into heterozygotes and homozygotes due to data sparsity among homozygotes with non-missing values for each metabolite in HPFS. Analyses were conducted among 4,215 NHS and 1,490 HPFS participants. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Source data

(a) Associations between Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) index score and cognitive function scores by APOE4 genotype from generalized linear models. (b) Associations between MedDiet index score and dementia risk by tertiles of ADRD PRSs from Cox proportional hazards models. (c) Associations between MedDiet index score and cognitive function scores by tertiles of ADRD PRSs from generalized linear models. Stratified β coefficients (for cognitive function) and hazard ratios (HRs; for dementia risk), along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per one-unit increase in the MedDiet index score, are shown by APOE4 genotype or PRS categories. The analyses were conducted among NHS participants with genetic, dietary, and cognitive outcome data (n = 16,497 for dementia analyses and n = 3,770 for cognitive function analyses).

Source data

(a) Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was prospectively associated with a lower risk of dementia. A restricted cubic spline Cox proportional hazards (PH) model estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across varying levels of the MedDiet index. The P value from the likelihood ratio test comparing the model without the MedDiet index and the model with its spline term is annotated. This analysis was conducted among Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) participants with dementia and dietary data (n = 43,500). (b) The protective association between adherence to the MedDiet and risk of dementia was most pronounced among APOE4 homozygotes. Stratified HR and 95% CIs for dementia risk per one-unit increment in the MedDiet index score, categorized by APOE4 genotype, were estimated from Cox PH models, with stratified P annotated (unadjusted for multiple comparisons in the hypothesis-driven analysis). The analyses were conducted among HPFS participants with genetic, dietary, and dementia outcome data (n = 9,828). (c) Strong association between adherence to MedDiet and the overall plasma metabolome profile identified by a random forest (RF) model to classify individuals in the top versus bottom quartile of the MedDiet index based on plasma metabolites. For the RF classification, the dataset was randomly divided into training (60%) and test (40%) sets. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the test set is shown, with the area under the curve (AUC) and 95% CI annotated on the plot. The analyses were conducted among 1,490 HPFS participants. (d) Associations between MedDiet adherence and plasma metabolite levels are consistent in NHS and HPFS and differ by APOE4 genotype. The heatmap shows β coefficients representing a 1-s.d. increment in the MedDiet index from a generalized linear model, with plasma metabolite levels as the dependent variable, restricting to the 254 metabolites available in both cohorts. In the metabolite analysis, APOE4 carriers were not further stratified into heterozygotes and homozygotes due to data sparsity among homozygotes with non-missing values for each metabolite in HPFS. The analyses were conducted among 4,215 NHS and 1,490 HPFS participants. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Source data

Metabolite principal component (PC) plot with correlation coefficients between metabolite PC1 and PC2 and Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) score and its components. Each dot represents an individual and is colored by the MedDiet score. MedDiet score and its components are shown on the plot as arrows; the coordinates of the arrow heads represent their Pearson's correlation coefficients with metabolite PC1 and PC2. The analyses were conducted among 4,215 participants in Nurses' Health Study.

Source data

Each dot represents a metabolite (diglycerides on the left panel and triglycerides on the right panel), color-coded by the direction and significance level of its association with the Mediterranean diet index. The size of each dot represents the effect size of the association. The P value is unadjusted for multiple comparisons given the exploratory nature of the analysis. The analyses were conducted among 4,215 NHS participants. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Source data

APOE4 genotype was not included as a predictor in the subgroup analysis within APOE4 carrier and noncarrier subgroups. The full NHS dataset (n = 4,215) was randomly split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets. All prediction models were fitted in the training set and were evaluated in the test set. All results shown are from the test set.

(a) The inclusion of genetic factors improved dementia risk prediction using Cox proportional hazards (PH) model, with an additional modest enhancement when plasma metabolites were also included. The baseline model predictors included age, family history of dementia, profession, smoking status, history of depression or regular antidepressant use, and Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) index. The polygenic risk score (PRS) of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias excluded variants in the APOE region. (b) Plasma metabolites are among the top contributors for predicting dementia risk as quantified by the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value. Feature contributions were evaluated for the Cox PH model for predicting dementia risk including the full list of predictors. SHAP values were calculated for each category of predictors by summing the SHAP value of all predictors in that category. Features were ranked by the SHAP value from the highest to the lowest for predicting dementia risk. We did not assess 15-year dementia risk in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) due to the limited number of dementia cases. For all analyses, the HPFS dataset (n = 1,490) was randomly divided into training (60%) and test (40%) sets; models were fitted on the training set and evaluated on the test set. All results shown are from the test set.

Researchers have uncovered the magnetic properties and underlying mechanisms of a novel magnet using advanced optical techniques. Their study focused on an organic crystal believed to be a promising candidate for an "altermagnet"- a recently proposed third class of magnetic materials. Unlike conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnets exhibit unique magnetic behavior.

Details of their breakthrough were published recently in the journal Physical Review Research.

"Unlike typical magnets that attract each other, altermagnets do not exhibit net magnetization, yet they can still influence the polarization of reflected light," points out Satoshi Iguchi, associate professor at Tohoku University's Institute for Materials Research. "This makes them difficult to study using conventional optical techniques."

To overcome this, Iguchi and his colleagues applied a newly derived general formula for light reflection to the organic crystal, successfully clarifying its magnetic properties and origin.

The group also comprised Yuka Ikemoto and Taro Moriwaki from the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute; Hirotake Itoh from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Kwansei Gakuin University; Shinichiro Iwai from the Department of Physics at Tohoku University; and Tetsuya Furukawa and Takahiko Sasaki, also from the Institute for Materials Research.

The team's newly derived general formula for light reflection was based on Maxwell's equations and is applicable to a wide range of materials, including those with low crystal symmetry, such as the organic compound studied here.

This new theoretical framework also allowed the team to develop a precise optical measurement method and apply it to the organic crystal κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Cl. They successfully measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and extracted the off-diagonal optical conductivity spectrum, which provides detailed information about the material's magnetic and electronic properties.

The results revealed three key features in the spectrum: (1) edge peaks indicating spin band splitting, (2) a real component associated with crystal distortion and piezomagnetic effects, and (3) an imaginary component linked to rotational currents. These findings not only confirm the altermagnetic nature of the material but also demonstrate the power of the newly developed optical method.

"This research opens the door to exploring magnetism in a broader class of materials, including organic compounds, and lays the groundwork for future development of high-performance magnetic devices based on lightweight, flexible materials," adds Iguchi.

Scientists have turned a longstanding challenge in electronics -- material defects -- into a quantum-enhanced solution, paving the way for new-generation ultra-low-power spintronic devices.

Spintronics, short for "spin electronics," is a field of technology that aims to go beyond the limits of conventional electronics. Traditional devices rely only on the electric charge of electrons to store and process information. Spintronics takes advantage of two additional quantum properties: spin angular momentum, which can be imagined as a built-in "up" or "down" orientation of the electron, and orbital angular momentum, which describes how electrons move around atomic nuclei. By using these extra degrees of freedom, spintronic devices can store more data in smaller spaces, operate faster, consume less energy, and retain information even when the power is switched off.

A longstanding challenge in spintronics has been the role of material defects. Introducing imperfections into a material can sometimes make it easier to "write" data into memory bits by reducing the current needed, but this typically comes at a cost: electrical resistance increases, spin Hall conductivity declines, and overall power consumption goes up. This trade-off has been a major obstacle to developing ultra-low-power spintronic devices.

Now, the Flexible Magnetic-Electronic Materials and Devices Group from the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have found a way to turn this problem into an advantage. Their study, published in Nature Materials, focused on the orbital Hall effect in strontium ruthenate (SrRuO3), a transition metal oxide whose properties can be finely tuned. This quantum phenomenon causes electrons to move in a way determined by their orbital angular momentum.

Using custom-designed devices and precision measurement techniques, the researchers uncovered an unconventional scaling law that achieves a "two birds with one stone" outcome: Defect engineering simultaneously boosts both orbital Hall conductivity and orbital Hall angle, a stark contrast to conventional spin-based systems.

To explain this finding, the team linked it to the Dyakonov-Perel-like orbital relaxation mechanism. "Scattering processes that typically degrade performance actually extend the lifetime of orbital angular momentum, thereby enhancing orbital current," said Dr. Xuan Zheng, a co-first author of the study.

"This work essentially rewrites the rulebook for designing these devices," said Prof. Zhiming Wang, a corresponding author of the study. "Instead of fighting material imperfections, we can now exploit them."

Experimental measurements confirm the technology's potential: tailored conductivity modulation yielded a threefold improvement in switching energy efficiency.

This study not only provides new insights into orbital transport physics but also redefines design strategies for energy-efficient spintronics.

This study received support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and other funding bodies.

AI automation giant UiPath announced Monday that it hired Seattle-based marketing vet Michael Atalla as its new chief marketing officer and separately confirmed it is moving its Bellevue, Wash., offices to the city's Lincoln Square development in September.

Atalla is joining UiPath from Seattle-based application and delivery company F5, where he worked for nearly four years and resigned from the role of senior vice president and head of worldwide marketing. 

Atalla's career includes nearly 14 years at Microsoft, ending in 2016 as a director with the Office 365 group. Atalla also co-founded The MJJM Group, which advised early-stage clients on product growth and investment efforts.

“Michael [Atalla] brings deep product marketing expertise and technical credibility, making him the ideal leader to help us transform customer outcomes and drive the agentic category leadership that will define our future,” said Daniel Dines, UiPath founder and CEO, in a statement.

New York-based UiPath first opened a Bellevue office in the Plaza Center in 2018. 

The company's new Lincoln Square office will operate as its product and engineering hub, spanning two floors and 44,735 square feet. The space will be home to 210 employees, including Atalla and other senior executives: Chief Product Officer Graham Sheldon; Chief Technology Officer Raghu Malpani and Chief Information Security Officer Scott Roberts. UiPath has 4,900 workers worldwide.

The company, which went public in 2021, uses AI to automate digital tasks such as data entry, file management and system integration.

“The new location gives these leaders and their teams greater space and amenities to continue to build and innovate our platform for agentic automation, delivering high-impact solutions for our customers that transform complex business processes and improve outcomes,” said spokesperson Christian Potts, via email. 

The Lincoln Square complex includes a 28-story downtown office building that was once primarily occupied by Microsoft. The tech giant has since downsized to two floors housing LinkedIn employees, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. The development also includes retail businesses, restaurants, hotels and residential units.

UiPath's expansion comes as multiple Seattle-area companies tackle the challenge of teaching machines to perform repetitive computer operations. That includes Vercept, a startup launched by former Allen Institute for AI research leaders, and Caddi, which emerged from the AI2 Incubator. Both companies are developing agentic AI software that observes users performing basic tasks and automates those workflows.

Google is tightening security measures around Android app distribution, the company announced on Monday. Starting next year, Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store. The changes will affect all certified Android devices once live, though the global rollout will be more gradual.

The tech giant stresses that this does not mean developers can't distribute outside of the Play Store through other app stores or via sideloading — Android will remain open in that regard. However, developers who appreciated the anonymity of alternative distribution methods will no longer have that option. Google says this will help to cut down on bad actors who hide their identity to distribute malware, commit financial fraud, or steal users' personal data. 

According to its own survey, Google says that more than 50 times more malware came through internet-sideloaded sources compared with Google Play, where it has required developer verification since 2023.

Initially, Google will allow interested developers to sign up for early access starting in October 2025 to test the system and provide feedback. In March 2026, verification will go live for all developers. By September 2026, any app installed on an Android device in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand will have to meet the new requirements. Starting in 2027, the requirements will begin rolling out globally.

Developers will have to provide their legal name, address, email, and phone number, which could push independent developers to register as a business for their own privacy's sake. Apple implemented a similar change for the EU App Store earlier this year to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), a regulation that now requires app developers to provide their “trader status” to submit new apps or app updates for distribution.

Google notes that student and hobbyist developers will be able to use a separate type of Android Developer Console account when this system rolls out, as their needs differ from commercial developers.

The changes could have a significant impact on the Android app ecosystem and app distribution, as Google works to cut down on the security issues and malware that have typically plagued its platform.

This weekend, movie history was made. For the first time ever, Netflix had the number one movie at the box office with its megahit KPop Demon Hunters. However, while every single other film distributor would've celebrated this fact, the streamer didn't report the numbers. Instead, it put the version of the film in theaters immediately onto its streamer. The message was clear. This wasn't meant to be a huge money grab or play for theatrical dominance. It was more of a thank you to the fans who streamed the film in record numbers and an elaborate advertisement for Netflix. But the film's undeniable success brings up many questions about how and why this happened, if it could be repeated, and what all that means.

The biggest question among those is whether KPop Demon Hunters would have been as big a success had it been exclusively released in theaters? The film debuted on Netflix in late June and was immediately embraced by everyone who watched it. Critics, fans, and anyone who saw it loved it, and its Rotten Tomatoes score remains at 97%. At that time, Netflix also released the film in three theaters for one week back in June to qualify it for the Academy Awards. The streamer never reported that data, but we can tell you, it was not number one at the box office. The awareness and popularity were just beginning, and they haven't stopped.

Slowly but surely, KPop Demon Hunters became one of Netflix's biggest hits ever. Word of mouth, coupled with ease of accessibility, made it arguably the pop culture sensation of the summer. Songs from the film are on the Billboard Top 10, gaining airplay on national radio and streaming services. Toy companies have come calling to make merchandise. There's talk of sequels, spin-offs, and over two months since its initial release, it's on its way to being Netflix's most successful original movie of all time, live action or animated.

All of which happened before this weekend. In Hollywood today, the traditional way of thinking is that a film being on streaming kills its box office prospects. If people can stream it at home, they will not go to the theaters. And there is surely data to back that up. Most people think the perfect formula is for something to be released exclusively in theaters, where it can generate great buzz and box office, which then drives interest towards the home release. So a studio makes money on a film in theaters, for its digital release, physical release, and then the streaming release. A quadruple dip with excitement and publicity, ideally, driving new viewers to each format.

KPop Demon Hunters, though, changes all that. It wasn't released on Netflix with a ton of publicity. Even its recent theatrical release wasn't backed with hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing. The film became a hit on Netflix because a) it's good, obviously, and b) people could watch it immediately after their friends told them about it. It was there. It was available. We were already paying for it. And by the time, months later, the film got a larger theatrical release, it had permeated the culture to become less a first-run hit and almost a repertory movie. A movie that fans are so familiar with, they pay to see it in theaters just for the experience.

Historically, those kinds of movies can be box office successes, but not always. Star Wars, for example, going all the way back to the 1980s, through the Special Editions of the 1990s, and to the prequel releases in recent years, proves that. But those movies had already been available at home for a long time. KPop Demon Hunters is generally thought of as a new title. Which it is, in terms of days. But in terms of popularity and awareness, thanks to the incredible speed with which we consume content in 2025, it's already well established beyond its age.

Twenty-six million watched KPop Demon Hunters over its ninth week of release from August 11 to 17 (which is the most recent data Netflix has released as of publication). Crudely, if you pretend each one of those people paid $10 to see the movie, that's $260 million, about what Spider-Man: No Way Home made in its opening weekend. The point being, months after release, people are still streaming the crap out of it in wild numbers. Would the film have made even close to that if it had gone the traditional route to theaters? Not in its ninth week, to be sure. Would kids of all ages have gone to theaters over and over to watch the movie in record numbers? Maybe. But the fact that it had already become something everyone could enjoy certainly aided in this case.

If a movie can debut on streaming first, find its audience, and then retroactively become a box office hit, all bets are off. It's a complete inversion of the traditional way of thinking in Hollywood. No one wants to give something away for free if people are willing to pay for it. Well, the message with KPop Demon Hunters is that people will pay for it even if it is free because it's so good and fun and they love it. In this case, Netflix was the ultimate marketing tool for the weekend's biggest box office hit.

KPop Demon Hunters, as well as the new sing-along version, which played in theaters this weekend, is on Netflix.

Newegg is promoting one of the best CPU bargains of the year right now, featuring Intel's previous-generation Core i5-14600K discounted to historically low prices, combined with Intel's Gamer Days Bundle, worth $315 by itself.

At Newegg, you can grab Intel's Core i5-14600K for just $189.99 right now as part of its shell shocker sale. But on top of that, the listing also includes a $40 promo code you can enter at checkout, dropping the price of the CPU all the way down to $149. Paired with the Core i5-14600K is Intel's Gamer Days bundle, which includes several games and apps: Battlefield 6 Phantom Edition, Assassin's Creed Shadows Digital Deluxe Edition, Canvid, XSplit Premium Suite, and Vegas Pro 365.

All-time low price 

The Intel Core i5-14600K is at an all-time low price. This 14-core processor has 6 P-cores and 8 E-cores with 20 threads. The chip peaks at up to 5.3GHz, making this chip a highly capable gaming CPU.

The Core i5-14600K is still one of the fastest gaming CPUs in Intel's arsenal, despite being a generation old. Our gaming results reveal that the Core i5-14600K is capable of producing gaming performance well within the ballpark of the fastest gaming CPU models Intel makes and the latest CPUs AMD makes -- except for AMD's pricier X3D parts.

Intel's fumble with Arrow Lake-S has put the Core i5-14600K in the unusual spotlight of being Intel's fastest mid-range gaming chip across two generations. The Core i5-14600K outperforms its successor, the Core Ultra 5 245K, and virtually matches the Core Ultra 9 285K in our game-focused performance tests.

Productivity performance is not bad either; thanks to the inclusion of eight E-cores, the 14600K boasts multi-core performance, approaching the Ryzen 7 9700X and outperforming the Ryzen 7 7800X3D in our testing with Cinebench.

Newegg's combo is hard to ignore if you are in the market for a mid-range CPU for your next build or CPU upgrade. Not even factoring in the game/app bundle, the Core i5-14600K deal alone is very competitive and makes the Raptor Lake chip arguably the best gaming CPU for $150.

The Intel Gamer Days bundle is the cherry on top, even if you only plan to play Battlefield 6. The cost of that game alone nearly cuts the 14600K's $150 price tag in half. There is so much content in the Gamer Days bundle that it's worth more than the CPU if you were going to buy it all.

In fact, the Intel Gamer Days bundle is being promoted on several Intel products right now, including the ASRock Challenger Arc B570 going for $229 and the Core Ultra 5 245K (which also happens to have a $50 promo code). Even with these higher-priced products, the software bundle is more valuable than the actual products themselves.

Elon Musk's X and xAI filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI on Monday, alleging that the two companies are colluding to stifle competition.

“In a desperate bid to protect its smartphone monopoly, Apple has joined forces with the company that most benefits from inhibiting competition and innovation in AI: OpenAI, a monopolist in the market for generative AI chatbots,” the lawsuit reads, referring to Apple's partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its systems.

This lawsuit is part of a long series of disputes between Musk and Altman, who continue to throw public jabs at one another. Once a co-founder and co-chair of OpenAI, Musk has sued to block OpenAI's transition into a for-profit company. He also submitted an unsolicited bid to take over OpenAI for $97.4 billion, which the company rejected.

This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like. https://t.co/HlgzO4c2iC

Musk posted anticompetitive allegations against OpenAI and Apple on X earlier this month, claiming that it's “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.” 

The partnership between Apple and OpenAI was announced last June, with collaborative features expected to ship in December.

OpenAI and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Though Black Mirror: Bandersnatch was removed from Netflix earlier this year as part of the streamer's pivot away from interactive programming, there may be yet another chance to choose Stefan Butler's '80s video game creation adventure anew. According to Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker, a comeback may be on the horizon.

Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Brooker was asked about rumblings that Bandersnatch may return to Netflix soon, perhaps classified as a game this time around.

“Reports of its death were exaggerated. Watch this space, things are brewing,” Brooker told THR. “It's not gone. I think over time, all these things are going to slightly merge.”

By “these things,” he seemingly means narrative programming and games, because he then went on to talk about “Plaything,” an episode from the most recent Black Mirror season. It's about Thronglets, a video game that aims to take over the world, and Netflix released a tie-in game to go with it.

“It's a '90s game like the one you see in the episode, but it goes way further than we do in the show. There are bespoke video clips you can unlock,” Brooker said. “I used to be a video games journalist and I still play lots of games, so I'm thrilled by anything like that. I think you'll see more and more of that.”

“Plaything” also ties back to Bandersnatch, with Will Poulter reprising his mad-genius character Colin Ritman.

“Will Poulter showing up as a living Easter egg showed me that we can continue to break the format to bring back characters or revisit worlds,” Brooker said. “Bandersnatch was also executed seamlessly by the Netflix engineers. It was very accessible to people. It was startling how well it worked, it felt like a bit of a magic trick.”

The creator is also open to doing more interactive episodes of Black Mirror down the line. “I had a whole idea for an interactive sequel to Bandersnatch. The interactive form generally is something I wouldn't rule out for the future, because I'd have to be crazy to rule that out,” he said. “You need a good narrative reason for why it's happening within the story, because it's such a different hat you're wearing as a viewer when you're playing a game versus sitting back and absorbing and getting lost in a story.”

Black Mirror seasons one through seven (but not, for now at least, the interactive special Bandersnatch) are streaming on Netflix.

The Switch 2 may be Nintendo's modern iteration of its gaming hardware, but a handheld is still a handheld. No matter what, a mobile design will lead to tradeoffs. You can't expect PlayStation 5 performance from a handheld, at least not one as light as the Switch 2 and for $450. Games running well on Nintendo's Switch 2 have less to do with its hardware and more to do with how developers make games to fit Nintendo's unique design.

Last week's Gamescom conference was mobbed by players hoping to take a few upcoming Switch 2 ports for a spin. First on the list for many was Elden Ring, and it didn't take long for the port to drive users mad. Numerous gamers started flooding social feeds with news that the game did not run well on Switch 2 in handheld mode. Nintendo Life and IGN, which had hands-on with the game, further fueled the cinders with claims of sub-30 frame rates in Elden Ring's open areas. Nintendo and developers FromSoftware did not allow anybody to take footage of the game being played.

Don't worry, cause videos eventually leak through Nintendo's castle walls. YouTuber MDee14 broadcasted Elden Ring played on the Switch 2 in docked mode from Fan Expo Canada. The game seemed to perform slightly better with the added fans of the Switch 2 dock, though it's difficult to parse frame rate from a video of a screen. Finally, on Sunday, a separate YouTuber dropped gameplay of Elden Ring in handheld mode, saying the frame rate was “awful,” though it's nearly impossible to judge merely through video.

The clamor only grew more with reports that the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 was supposedly running poorly. All players' anxieties stem from a single tweet by user EpicNNG on X. The player posted a video, explaining they weren't allowed to show off gameplay footage from the event. EpicNNG added that it was clear the developer, Gearbox Studios, likely wasn't presenting the latest builds of the game. That doesn't mean there aren't concerns the game may not be up to snuff at release on Oct. 3. We simply don't know what the case will be until closer to release.

Players have every right to be concerned they won't get as good an experience with their games as other consoles. However, so far most Switch 2 ports have proved playable. Other upcoming ports seem like they haven't faced these same performance dilemmas. Digital Foundry recorded gameplay of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and called it “the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2.” Intergrade first hit the scene in 2021, and it seems the current version plays at least 40 fps on Nintendo's handheld, according to people who went hands-on at Gamescom.

The current builds of Elden Ring on Steam Deck can hit around 40 fps with the settings dialed in, so it would only make sense the Switch 2 could at least achieve some level of playable frame rate. Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 manages to hit frame rates between 30 and 40 fps, depending on your choice of graphics settings. Developers at CD Projekt Red specifically worked directly with Nintendo on the port. A video by Digital Foundry shows how devs managed to get better frame rates by limiting unnecessary background detail and relying on Nvidia's DLSS upscaling. Which leads to the lingering question: if Square Enix and CD Projekt Red can craft quality handheld ports, why can't other developers do the same?

The devil is in the details. The Switch 2's system on a chip, or SoC, was crafted in partnership with Nvidia. That T239 chip is built with eight ARM Cortex A78C cores. The fact these are ARM cores means porting games to the Switch 2 isn't as simple as it may seem. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are built using AMD-made x86 chips. That is an instruction set you see on most modern Intel and AMD processors for PCs. ARM designs run on a completely separate instruction set that uses a RISC (or reduced instruction set compute) microarchitecture. These chips are specifically designed for the system type itself, which helps reduce power consumption and save on battery life.

Porting games from x86 to ARM isn't necessarily a massive undertaking, but it shows how much of a specific platform the Switch 2 can be. Developers need to understand the Switch 2's hardware and design for it. Nintendo has reportedly offered dev kits to teams looking to make games that emphasize the Switch 2's most unique features. That puts even more onus on developers to work within the bounds of Nintendo's design, likely more than any other platform.

If you could compare Switch 2 to other consoles, it has similar graphical capabilities just beyond the original PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. That still doesn't tell the whole story. Nintendo's device in handheld mode will have to run at lower clock speeds and TDP, or thermal design power. This keeps the device from overheating or dying too quickly. Benchmarks show the Switch 2 can meet or beat other handhelds like the Steam Deck OLED at the same TDP in handheld mode. At higher TDP, the Steam Deck may still be superior, as it should be for any device that can overclock to any degree. Developers have the tough task of making games fit Nintendo's design, not to mention deciding how to distribute a title. Inevitably, we will find better or worse examples of ports. That is the tradeoff for being able to take your games with you wherever you go.

Error may signify this was a pay monthly deal console that never got paid off, but the latest official update generously removes this keyvault flag.

A Microsoft Xbox 360 console that refuses to play games due to ‘bad debt' has raised a few eyebrows on social media. Cody, a co-owner of a retro and import video games retail business, remarked upon his surprise at booting up this particular Xbox 360 and finding “an error I've never seen before.” However, a Microsoft MVP has piped up to explain that the system's 17559 update removes any such restrictions.

Repairing Xbox 360s today and found an error I've never seen before. So apparently the previous owner somehow has bad debt with Microsoft and so this 360 is locked out forever. pic.twitter.com/ZrPgbsDB7qAugust 23, 2025

The tide of collective wisdom following Cody's post suggests that the restricted Xbox 360 was purchased through an affordable offer from Microsoft. Under the program, you would maintain monthly payments for a minimum term to eventually own your console, without further restrictions.

According to an Xbox 360 era report published by GamesRadar, Microsoft launched the new easy payment schemes for wannabe console owners in Q4 2012. Under the agreement, purchasers would put down a modest initial sum, starting from $150. Then they would commit to “a contractual obligation for two years of Xbox Live membership, adding up to $360 by the end of the agreement.”

The article doesn't say what would happen if the contract were broken. Now, 13 years later, we are seeing what would happen. Perhaps people generally stuck to their obligations, as this ‘bad debt' message has stirred a lot of interest.

Many commenters suggested that Cody ‘hack' the Xbox 360 to bypass any restrictions. Just two weeks ago, Modern Vintage Gamer (MVG) published a video on the Badupdate Exploit. The hack has now reached version 1.2, and is enhanced so that “Any Xbox 360 can now be hacked in less than one minute,” he explained.

However, there's a little problem with that plan. The exploit requires the user to run the Rock Band Blitz trial from a USB flash drive. This particular Xbox 360 appears to be so locked down that even running a trial wouldn't be possible.

Yep, the block is set in the console keyvault. The rental program was shutdown and msft at the end of things just cut their losses on any blocked consoles. Latest update no longer honors that flag in the keyvault.August 25, 2025

Thankfully, no hacking shenanigans should be necessary to get Cody's Xbox 360 back into a fully enabled state. Eric Marsi, a Microsoft MVP, piped up to explain that “If you update it to 17559, the lock will go away.” Marsi later explained that this update for the 360, which was released in Nov 2019, cuts Microsoft's losses on any blocked consoles, as it no longer honors the rental program flag in the keyvault.

Fans of The Witcher may be waiting awhile for the show to return to Netflix, but something just as exciting is coming very soon: Andrzej Sapkowski‘s first new Witcher book in over a decade, Crossroads of Ravens. It's getting a global release September 30, translated into various languages (the English version is from series veteran David French), and io9 has an exclusive excerpt to share today.

Here's a summary of what you can expect from this standalone work:

“Before he was the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken, Geralt of Rivia was simply a fresh graduate of Kaer Morhen, stepping into a world that neither understands nor welcomes his kind.

And when an act of naïve heroism goes gravely wrong, Geralt is only saved from the noose by Preston Holt, a grizzled witcher with a buried past and an agenda of his own.

Under Holt's guiding hand, Geralt begins to learn what it truly means to walk the Path—to protect a world that fears him, and to survive in it on his own terms. But as the line between right and wrong begins to blur, Geralt must decide to become the monster everyone expects, or something else entirely.

This is the story of how legends are made—and what they cost.”

Read on for an exclusive excerpt from Crossroads of Ravens, where a young Geralt has recently been rescued from the noose by a mysterious Witcher named Preston Holt…

The Kingdom of Kaedwen was known throughout the inhabited world for its cold and capricious weather. Enclosed from the north by the barrier of the Dragon Mountains, and from the east by the great massif of the Blue Mountains, the land suffered from erratic and frequent visitations of air masses causing long and bitter winters, cold springs and short, rainy summers. As regards autumn, it varied—once sunny, warm and pleasant—once nothing of the kind.

Now, in the month of March, called “Birke” by the elves, the snow still remained here and there in ravines and hollows, while white patches lay in depressions in glades. Ice still covered some puddles and dykes in yellowing sheets. Although the sun gave off some warmth, when frosty winds blew from the mountains, they stung no less than in January.

Geralt had set off from Kaer Morhen the day before the Equinox. That was the custom of witchers. It was thus practised because after the winter monsters were at their hungriest, and so vicious that folk in villages and settlements were inclined to indulge in the hiring of a witcher, even though during the hungry gap they had eaten their stores and were practically destitute. But Geralt never got the chance to be hired. For things went as they went; barely two days' ride from the mountains and bang! the peasant and his daughter, the marauders, the bald enforcer with the rotten teeth, wham, bam, and here we are. He had found himself being judged by Alderman Bulava of Neuhold, and then being rescued from that and the threat of being lynched by soldiers from the nearby fort by the strange white-haired individual with two swords on his back, riding a black horse, whom Geralt was now following.

“I suggest,” said the strange individual, turning around in the saddle, “that we ride together for a time. Captain Carleton may still want to hang you; it was apparent he wants it very much. He isn't stupid enough to come after me, but you, alone, could be an easy target. So, if my company doesn't bother you—”

“Not a bit,” said Geralt hurriedly, urging on his dun mare. “Gladly . . . I . . . I am—”

“I know who you are. Did your hair turn white after the mutations? After the Transformations? Loss of pigment, like I had?”

“Aye . . . But how—”

“How did I know there was someone like you there? Because I follow what goes on up there in the Stronghold. And it reached my ears that some wunderkind called Geralt had finished his training and was soon to venture abroad.”

“But Vesemir—”

“Never mentioned me? He never let slip the name ‘Preston Holt'? I'll explain: Vesemir and I have been moving in different orbits, so to speak, for some time. If you know what I mean.”

Geralt didn't actually know what an orbit was, but nodded wisely.

They rode on for a while in silence. Side by side.

“So, you set off from Kaer Morhen,” Preston Holt said finally. “You perhaps didn't have the best beginning, but that's the way it is with beginnings. In any case, I don't mean to chide you. Quite the opposite; I had a look at that marauder's body and your cuts may be considered faultless. Unnecessary, perhaps; ill-considered, perhaps; inelegant, perhaps—but actually faultless.”

They fell silent again, watched a herd of cattle being driven onto a mountain pasture and the cowherd running from cow to cow in order to warm his frozen little feet in fresh, warm cowpats. The cowpats didn't warm him up much, but the running did.

“They're driving cows, though the grass is barely peeping out of the ground,” observed Holt. “It's a sign the season's begun and you'll have no difficulty finding work, Geralt. The villages will soon be willing to pay for their herdsmen and livestock to be protected. Let's ride over there into the birchwood, near the opening of the sough.”

“The opening of the what?”

“The sough. That open channel there leads to a sough, a tunnel once used to drain water from a mine. We are—as you no doubt know—in the part of the Kingdom of Kaedwen called the Upper March. The wealth of the Upper March is mines: mainly salt, but also silver, nickel, zinc, lead, lapis lazuli and others. At least that's how things were; today most mines are close to being worked out. Nothing lasts for ever.”

Geralt didn't comment.

“Do you see that hill up ahead? It's called Podkurek, that's how it appears on official maps. And it came about because around a hundred years ago a peasant named Podkurek quite by chance dug up there a nugget of silver the size of a large cabbage. A mine was established here right away, extending into the mountainside. Large amounts of silver and galena, which is lead ore, were mined. But the deeper the miners dug, the more problems they had with water. There are more soughs like this one, you'll see them. Finally, the costs of drainage made the entire extraction unprofitable. The miners moved to other places. They left a labyrinth of corridors and goafs, now partly flooded. And now the best part: the abandoned and flooded mine has been occupied and taken over by roving cynocephaly. I imagine you know what they are, don't you?”

“Cynocephaly,” recited Geralt, after taking a deep breath, “are small creatures resembling dog-headed monkeys. They are gregarious and live underground in the dark. They're dangerous in packs—”

“Infernally dangerous,” interrupted Preston Holt. “And quite often torment the amateur miners that come here to dig in the slopes of Podkurek in search of silver, which you can still find here. Look, there's the proof of my lecture: those light patches over there are the canvas sheets of wagons and tents. We're heading right for a camp of intrepid diggers. The first this spring.”

The intrepid diggers greeted them initially with a delegation armed with shovels and stout cudgels. The menacing expressions of the welcome party sent a simple message: get out of here, strangers, we was 'ere first. Their expressions soon softened, however, when they saw that the newcomers weren't unwanted competitors. Indeed, joy appeared on their previously unfriendly faces.

“Goodness me, thank the gods!” cried the chief digger, hiding behind his back a mattock, which only a moment earlier he had been twirling warningly. “Thanks be to the gods! Goodness me, why it's the Most Honourable Witcher! And because we heard you were in the neighbourhood, we were meaning to send word to you. But instead, you arrive out of nowhere, out of nowhere!”

“That is my custom,” said Preston Holt, straightening up in the saddle. “To appear from nowhere to help those in need. For I am a witcher.”

In the meantime, several lamenting women had joined the diggers. The clamour became louder and louder and more and more incoherent. Preston Holt began to call for order using his voice and gestures. It was some time before it became possible to discern what it was all about and what the diggers and the women were trying to express.

“We're in need of a witcher!” called the chief digger, brandishing his mattock. “Those underground creatures what live under the mountain carried off a boy! They attacked, seized him and dragged him into the abyss! Who will rescue him now, if not you?”

“It's not two weeks ago,” said Holt, “that I warned you to stay well away from the shaft and the gallery. Well? Didn't I tell you? To dig on the other side of the mountain? The cynocephaly have seized a boy, you say? How old? Five? When was it? Ah, the day before yesterday? Why, you didn't hurry to send word to me. Dismount, Geralt.”

Preston Holt got off his horse. Geralt couldn't help noticing it caused him difficulty. And that his left leg was very lame. With a gesture, he shooed away the women who were surrounding him, wailing. He spoke for a while to the chief digger and then tugged Geralt by the sleeve.

“Well, young witcher,” he said. “It's time to help people in need, the victims of monsters. For we have just been hired.”

“If the cynocephaly took the boy the day before yesterday,” grunted Geralt, “the chances are slim that he's still—”

“Alive? Yes, it's doubtful. But perhaps we'll at least find him . . . Hmm . . . It'll give the mother the chance to bury whatever is left . . . Why the hesitation, young Geralt? Not long ago, you waded in to defend a maiden's virtue and hack a man to death without a second thought, and now you hesitate?”

“Have I said anything?” said Geralt, shrugging. “Am I hesitating? I am not.”

Crossroads of Ravens will be released September 30; you can pre-order a copy now.

A majority of school districts in Washington state will have policies in place this school year to limit students' use of cellphones and other devices such as smart watches.

The Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction released results last week from a survey that found that 75% of districts will have a policy in place by the start of the school year that limits the use of smart devices during class time. The survey found 53% of districts that will have a policy that restricts access to smart devices during instructional time only, while 31% said that devices must be put away for the entire school day.

“Our educators, parents, and families are seeing, on a daily basis, how students' learning is disrupted — repeatedly — by their smart devices,” State Superintendent Chris Reykdal said in a news release. “As an education system, we have a responsibility to protect the learning environment, removing disruptions and ensuring our policies are updated regularly to address emerging needs.”

Reykdal first issued a call to school leaders a year ago, to come up with a plan to limit or ban the use of such devices. 

The move comes amid mounting scientific and anecdotal evidence of the academic, mental health, and social harms caused to kids by cellphones and social media, and as more schools, districts and entire states are already taking action.

Seattle Public Schools, the largest K-12 school system in Washington state, previously told GeekWire that it leaves it to school administrators to set campus policies, and in May a spokesperson said the district was “evaluating whether a district wide ‘away for the day' cellphone policy is necessary. … As part of this process, the district is conducting thorough research and analysis to understand the impact of cellphone use in schools.”

Two public middle schools in Seattle implemented restrictions last year — Hamilton International and Robert Eagle Staff both introduced Yondr pouches, which allow students to lock away their phones, limiting their use throughout school hours. Pouches can only be unlocked by school staff or at designated stations at the end of the school day.

A year into that policy at Robert Eagle Staff, GeekWire found educators and parents who said the new rules made a huge difference in limiting distractions and shifting the culture of the school. The response from students was mixed.

In a University of Washington study on the effect of cellphone policies, teachers reported feeling less stressed and said they're more effective in the classroom without phone-related disruptions. Students said there were academic improvements when phone use was curbed, but most did not report emotional and mental-health benefits.

Oregon is among states taking a hardline stance. Gov. Tina Koteck signed an executive order this summer prohibiting cellphone use during school hours in the state's K-12 public schools. Districts must adopt policies banning student cellphone use by Oct. 31, with full implementation required by Jan. 1, 2026.

According to Washington's office of the superintendent, of the school districts with policies in place, 61% said that their community is satisfied with the approach the district has taken. 

“Our young people are navigating a deeply connected online world where they have 24/7 access right at their fingertips,” Reykdal said last week. “There are benefits to these powerful technologies if used responsibly. There are also tremendous risks. Studies have found negative impacts on mental health, learning, sleep, and more. I'm proud of our school district leaders who are tackling this problem head-on.”

Brave and Guardio have revealed serious vulnerabilities in the AI-powered Comet browser.

Brave and Guardio have revealed serious vulnerabilities in the Comet AI browser that Perplexity released in July. Perplexity said that Comet "transforms how businesses interact with the internet" by "combining enterprise-grade security, powerful AI capabilities, and intuitive user experiences."

That alone should have been enough to make users wary about the browser's security. Highlighting "enterprise-grade security" is like bragging about "military-grade encryption" in that it's a red flag, not a green one.

It didn't take long to prove those suspicions correct. "When users ask [Comet] to 'Summarize this webpage,' Comet feeds a part of the webpage directly to its LLM without distinguishing between the user's instructions and untrusted content from the webpage," Brave said a month after the browser's debut. "This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands."

Brave demonstrated the potential impact of this vulnerability by embedding a malicious command in a Reddit post that could take over a Comet user's Perplexity account if they asked the browser to summarize the web page. Usually, the biggest threat from spending too much time on social platforms is brain rot, yet trying to avoid that with Comet's summarization features posed even greater risks.

"This attack presents significant challenges to existing Web security mechanisms," Brave said. "When an AI assistant follows malicious instructions from untrusted webpage content, traditional protections such as same-origin policy (SOP) or cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) are all effectively useless. The AI operates with the user's full privileges across authenticated sessions, providing potential access to banking accounts, corporate systems, private emails, cloud storage, and other services."

Guardio's research went a step further. The company demonstrated that Comet would also be willing to purchase a fake Apple Watch from a website that any human browser would likely identify as a potential scam. It also showed that Comet would scan an obvious phishing email, visit the malicious website, and prompt its user for their banking account credentials without any indication that something might be amiss.

"These two cases prove that even the oldest tricks in the scammer's playbook become more dangerous in the hands of AI Browsing. The trust chain is the real game-changer: the human no longer engages directly with the suspicious content, never sees the red flags, and never gets the chance to make their own judgment," Guardio said. "Human intuition to evade harm is excluded from the process and AI becomes the single point of decision. Without strong AI guardrails, that decision is essentially a coin toss - and when your security is left to chance, it's only a matter of time before it lands on the wrong side."

Let's be clear: Comet is currently limited to Perplexity's Pro and Enterprise Pro customers, meaning people and businesses pay for access to the browser. In return, they have received a browser riddled with vulnerabilities independently discovered by two organizations that benefited more from disclosing them to the company and the public than they would have from exploiting the flaws themselves.

It should also be said that Perplexity has bid more than twice its current valuation for Google's Chrome browser. Comet is already built on top of Chromium, so it's not trying to buy a foundation for its AI browser; it's specifically looking to buy Chrome's existing market share. Given the findings from Brave, Guardio, and who-knows-who-else, that should be a terrifying prospect for anyone still using Chrome to browse the web.

Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman are among the Silicon Valley veterans putting more than $100 million into a network of political-action committees (PACs) that will advocate against strict AI regulations in next year's midterm elections, reports The Wall Street Journal. 

The new pro-AI super-PAC network dubbed “Leading the Future” aims to use campaign donations and digital ads to advocate for favorable AI regulation and oppose candidates that the group thinks will stifle the industry.

Both Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI were part of a push earlier this year to implement a 10-year moratorium on states' rights to create their own AI regulations. The ban was ultimately struck down, but the AI industry continues to fight against a “patchwork of regulations,” which they say would slow down innovation and put the U.S. at risk of losing the AI race to China.

The group hopes to mirror its approach on pro-crypto super-PAC network Fairshake, which helped cement a victory for Donald Trump. It will generally align with the policies of White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, per The Journal.

Robomart, a startup that builds self-driving delivery robots, is unveiling its latest robot with an ambitious goal of using it to make on-demand delivery profitable.

The Los Angeles-based company announced its patented Robomart RM5 on Monday. The level-four autonomous vehicle can carry up to 500 pounds and is made up of 10 individual lockers that hold customer orders. This structure is designed to allow for batch ordering so a robot can work on multiple deliveries at the same time.

Robomart plans to use these new robots to operate an on-demand delivery business model similar to those of established food delivery platforms, Ali Ahmed, Robomart co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. This model involves retailers partnering with Robomart to open their own storefronts on Robomart's app — which is similar to apps like UberEats or DoorDash.

What is different is the cost structure for the customers. Each time a customer orders from Robomart they pay a flat $3 delivery fee, which the company hopes will be a much more attractive option than the multiple fees typically charged by other delivery apps, Ahmed said.

“We see this as building our own autonomous marketplace,” Ahmed said. “That is something that is pretty unique in this space, an autonomous marketplace for on-demand delivery using self-driving robots.”

Robomart plans to start onboarding retailers in its first market, Austin, Texas, over the next few months ahead of launching the delivery service later this year.

This announcement marks an expansion from Robomart's roots. The company was founded in 2017 and started piloting an autonomous “store on wheels” in 2020, which brought a mobile autonomous store stocked with goods like pharmacy items and ice cream direct to customers who requested it.

While the company started with its “store on wheels” model, this move into on-demand delivery was a natural progression, Ahmed said. He added that the company knew it wanted to tackle on-demand delivery from the beginning.

Prior to Robomart, Ahmed founded Dispatch Messenger, an on-demand delivery platform in the U.K., in 2015. Ahmed said that his previous company just couldn't make the economics to remain profitable while still relying on human delivery drivers. That focused his attention on automation to cut costs. Now, Ahmed believes they've cracked the code.

“Our robots bring the cost of a delivery down by up to 70%,” Ahmed said. “That is a critical difference. If you are paying a driver $18 an hour, your cost, just for that driver, is $9 to $10 per delivery.”

Robomart has gotten to this point with very little funding, something that Ahmed said he's really proud of. The company has raised less than $5 million in funding from firms including Hustle Fund, SOSV, and Wasabi Ventures, among others.

“We have raised almost $4 million in funding, and that has enabled us to build five generations of robots and now deploy the first autonomous marketplace for the road,” Ahmed said. “I'm proud of our team, and it's a testament to how much we have been able to achieve.”

While the on-demand delivery sector is a crowded space with several large legacy players, including UberEats and GrubHub, Ahmed thinks Robomart is bringing a totally new product to market at a price he thinks consumers will be attracted to.

“To give them this incredible proposition of $3 and no other charges, just [price] markups in themselves can be prohibitively expensive,” Ahmed said. “They don't even realize they are paying that markup and the other fees and the tips. This makes [our model] very attractive to the retailers and customers.”

From AI to EVs, the world's demand for power is soaring, and the electrical grid is feeling the squeeze. 

Enter Yottar, a startup that maps electrical grid capacity to help companies figure out where they can plug in new data centers, EV charging stations, and other power-hungry equipment.

“The electrification super cycle is colliding with the AI data center boom. That's making the grid operators really struggle to deal with the backlog,” Peter Clutton-Brock, Yottar's co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. 

“Just as an example, around London, pretty much all of the capacity for things like large-scale data centers has been taken up,” he said. “It's not a question of, is there spare capacity? It's like, when will those upgrades be in place?”

As ancient grids grow increasingly strained, startups like Yottar have sprung up to help energy users cope with these shortcomings. Some companies, like Gridcare, focus on finding unused capacity that already exists — convincing utilities that they actually have more space available than they claim.

Yottar takes a different approach. Rather than arguing about existing capacity, the company creates detailed maps showing exactly where grid capacity exists and how much power is available at each location.

“There are a few other people playing in the space. Different people tackled slightly different use cases,” Clutton-Brock said. “The use case that we're after is what we've called medium-sized demand developers, so people using electricity rather than generating it.” Generally, the projects range between 1 and 5 megawatts, he said.

Among Yottar's customers are Tesla and the U.K.'s National Health Service. Tesla uses the startup's SaaS offering to select sites for new Superchargers and to upgrade existing ones. The NHS uses Yottar to identify clinics and hospitals that can accommodate EV chargers, and it also uses the platform when planning solar panel and battery installations or determining where to build new radiology units.

“They can't afford to go through each of those site by site,” Clutton-Brock said.

The startup recently raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by Haatch with participation from Cape Capital and angel investors. Yottar is also launching a new feature that will allow companies to quickly determine which locations might be capable of supporting upgrades or new equipment, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.

Yottar gets much of its data directly from the distribution networks themselves, which have been required by regulators to make this information available. The company also licenses private data that is not public, and it updates its own records using anonymized data from successful grid connections made by its customers.

At the moment, customers pay a per-seat fee and a usage charge based on the number of sites they're evaluating. Clutton-Brock said that consultants are the company's main competition at this point. “That's the alternative that people have at the moment, which, especially for smaller-scale demand developers, isn't viable.”

For now, Yottar operates in the U.K., but Clutton-Brock has his eye on expansion in the U.S. and elsewhere. “The problem is absolutely an international problem and needs an international solution,” he said.

Apple made a big splash in 2017 by introducing an all-screen iPhone with a notch and no physical home button for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. The company is now preparing to introduce another major overhaul for the iPhone's 20th anniversary, featuring a new curved glass design, according to a Bloomberg report.

The iPhone 20, set to be launched in 2027, will have curved glass edges all around, likely to suit the new “Liquid Glass” design philosophy of iOS, according to Bloomberg.

The publication's report also noted that before the 20th anniversary iPhone's release, Apple will launch its first foldable phone in 2026. It said that Apple is in the process of switching screen technology for its upcoming foldable, which might result in a display that hides the crease well.

Seattle voters will decide this November on a major overhaul of the city's business-and-occupation (B&O) tax. Supporters pitch it as relief for small businesses and a safeguard for city services; opponents warn it risks driving away companies.

For tech startups, the impact is more nuanced as companies scale.

The ballot measure, known as the Seattle Shield initiative, would raise the B&O tax threshold exemption from $100,000 to $2 million — temporarily wiping out B&O taxes for small- and medium-sized businesses with gross receipts of $2 million or less.

To offset the revenue loss, businesses above the $2 million threshold would face a rate increase — from 0.427% to 0.65% for service businesses — applied only to revenue above $2 million.

So what does it all mean for tech startups?

Smaller companies and those just getting off the ground would no longer pay B&O taxes, potentially saving them thousands of dollars per year. A services company with $1 million in revenue pays $4,270 in B&O tax annually at the current rate.

But for tech companies that have higher revenues — from more mature startups to corporations such as Amazon — their tax obligation will increase. 

“So for your early stage startups that are not realizing much revenue yet, the proposal looks good,” said Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance at the University of Washington. “It's as a business is transitioning to the 8-figure revenue level where the proposed tax system starts to bite.”

Under the proposal, a company with $100 million in annual revenue would owe an additional $213,920 in B&O tax — about 50% more than under the current rate.

The measure comes amid a wave of new business taxes in Washington state. Earlier this year, Seattle voters also approved a payroll tax on high earners to fund social housing, adding to the JumpStart payroll tax passed in 2020.

Kelly Fukai, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association, said she appreciates the city's attempt at reducing the burden for small businesses. But she said the B&O tax proposal may not be as helpful to tech startups given that it is applied to gross receipts versus profit.

“Startups do not have net income for years as there is heavy investment made upfront in development,” she said. 

Companies may weigh whether to reallocate resources — or even relocate to a different city with a friendlier tax climate, said Vladimir Dashkeev, an assistant professor of economics at Seattle University.

“The question is: Is the cost of this tax optimization for the business worth the benefit of saving on these tax payments?” Dashkeev said. 

Vigdor said there are many other tax-related factors a tech company has to consider. For example, if a company wants to move to California, there's a state income tax. And if they want to relocate to Bellevue, office rents may be higher relative to Seattle given vacancy rates, he said.

The new tax changes would raise about $81 million per year for human services and other city programs.

The city, which is trying to address a substantial budget shortfall over the next two years, says about 90% of small- and medium-sized businesses in Seattle will pay fewer B&O taxes if the proposal passes.

Mayor Bruce Harrell and Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck unveiled the Seattle Shield initiative in June, framing it as a way to protect Seattle's small businesses while shielding from potential federal funding cuts. 

The city council approved the proposal earlier this month with several amendments. 

Rachel Smith, CEO of the Seattle Chamber, voiced support for the proposed exemption but said it should be funded from the payroll tax fund or through the “normal budgeting process” instead of larger companies — pointing to broader trends on employment, office vacancies, and economic uncertainty.

Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association, called it “a boneheaded proposal of epic proportions” in a post on LinkedIn.

Scholes also supported exempting small businesses from the B&O tax. But he said raising taxes on larger companies “will ultimately result in Seattle defunding its tax base.”

“This is an unnecessary tax on downtown Seattle's revitalization that comes with big risks to the fragile commercial tax base,” Scholes said. “As the commercial tax base withers, the tax burden will shift to Seattle residents.”

Harrell pushed back on the criticism from DSA.

“We're not trying to run businesses out of Seattle. We are open for businesses,” he said in June.

When it comes to desktops, bigger doesn't always mean better. If you're just looking for a reliable machine to help you with your everyday tasks, a full-sized tower isn't really necessary. A mini PC can get the job done just as well, and right now, you can grab one for less.

The GMKtec G3 Plus Mini PC is currently going for just $157 on Amazon, after a 25% discount. That's more than $50 in savings, but the deal might be ending soon.

This compact PC, which looks quite like a charging dock, boasts a rich interface with four USB 3.2 ports, dual HDMI 2.0 outputs, a 3.5mm audio jack, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and a 2.5GbE Ethernet port. Powering it up is a quad-core chip – Intel's latest Twin Lake N150 processor – with speeds up to 3.6GHz. It's a significant improvement over the previous N100 processor, and is ideal for everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, working with moderate-sized data files, etc.

Smooth multitasking is made possible with the efficient 16GB DDR4 RAM, while the built-in 512GB PCIe 3.0 M.2 2280 NVMe SSD ensures sufficient storage with fast load times. The PC boots up in seconds, and you will be able to access your files and switch between tabs without those painfully slow load times.

Intel Graphics supports 4K video playback and AV1 decoding, so entertainment gets a boost too. You can even connect a projector with it for an at-home cinema experience. If you work across multiple screens, you will also appreciate the dual 4K display support that lets you use up to two monitors via HDMI at once.

For connectivity, there's WiFi 6 for a more stable connection, and Bluetooth 5.2 for quickly pairing the PC with accessories. Overheating won't be an issue, either. The PC includes an upgraded cooling fan and improved thermal paste to keep things cool and quiet as you multitask away.

You also get a 1 year limited warranty from GMKtec with your purchase, so you will be covered if something related to the design or workmanship goes wrong.

All in all, the GMKtec G3 Plus packs a punch in a compact, portable form factor. It offers impressive performance with its improved processor, great visuals, a decent selection of ports, and stable connectivity options. If you're looking for an everyday setup that doesn't break the bank, this PC at just $157 can be a great investment. The deal is a limited-time one, so act fast before it's gone.

Each prisoner is allowed 20 floppy disks, but flash drives are verboten.

A prisoner incarcerated at the New Jersey State Prison has written about the trials and tribulations of corresponding with his legal representatives while being shackled by ancient computer technology. Namely, floppy diskettes.

Jorge Luis Alvarado, writing for the PJP (Prison Journalism Project), says it is difficult to keep abreast of developments in his case due to a prison-imposed digital divide. Alvarado's lawyers send documents on flash drives, which must be decanted to (sometimes multiple) floppy disks on a special computer in the law library. Getting library computer access can take days, and time can be crucial during legal appeals.

The prison allows inmates to have up to 20 floppy disks in their cells, but no flash drives.

“Inside New Jersey State Prison, it's like 1985, where we rely on out-of-date word processors, electric typewriters and floppy disks that are going extinct in the free world,” laments Alvarado in his opinion piece, recently published by the PJP. While we can understand why prisons don't have the latest computer technologies at the disposal of every inmate, the preference for floppy disks over flash drives seems kind of arbitrary.

We'd say the general public's use of USB flash drive technology became mainstream 20 years ago. Their ascendancy neatly crosses over the removal of the humble floppy drive as a standard component of a pre-built PC.

Moreover, any advantages USB flash drives had over floppies 20 years ago have scaled dizzyingly new heights of usability. Now flash drives are faster, more capacious, and extremely affordable. They are even sold in multipacks – not quite up to a common 50x or 100x pack like floppy disks, but people don't need so many.

Alvarado underlines the issues with floppy disks in 2025 from his personal point of view. “A single legal brief can easily take up the memory of two floppy disks,” he complains. Remember, PC HD floppy disk capacity was only up to 1.44MB. For better capacity removables in the floppy era, you would have to invest in more expensive media like Zip disks or SyQuests. The great home PC CD writing boom would occur around the year 2000.

Another issue Alvarado has with floppies is that “floppy disks also get corrupted easily.” Lessons learned the hard way mean prisoners will need to make backups among their limited floppy disk supplies. The PJP author also notes that floppies are inherently circling the plughole, as no company has been producing new media since 2011. Indeed, Sony shut down its floppy production lines in that year.

Some will argue that prisons shouldn't have all the latest computer technologies available to inmates. However, that has to be balanced by allowing those behind bars sufficient resources to advocate for their freedom. Some studies suggest that between 4 and 6% of those incarcerated in US prisons are innocent.

Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) has reportedly reached a legal settlement with former Twitter workers who sued the platform after the billionaire bought it and fired them all. The settlements come after a longstanding effort by the platform to resist any sort of payout.

Most of us remember the shock and awe of 2022, when Musk, the world's richest man, decided he had to own one of the internet's most popular websites. Elon's hostile takeover of the Bird app led to much rancor within the organization, followed by a massive purge of the company's leadership and lower ranks. Nearly 6,000 staffers were culled from the company in the wake of Musk's takeover.

Many of those pissed off former employees ultimately pooled their resources and launched a class-action lawsuit in 2023 that accused the company of owing them some $500 million in severance payouts. The litigation was filed by Courtney McMillian, who had previously overseen Twitter's employee benefits programs before her own layoff, Reuters writes.

Well, this week, the social media site moved to settle with those former staffers, the New York Times reports. It's unclear what the terms of the settlement are, the newspaper notes. Another legal case along similar lines is also being settled, it writes:

The company also reached a settlement agreement with more than 2,000 former employees who were fighting for severance in arbitration cases, according to terms communicated to former workers on Thursday, two people familiar with the case said. That settlement amount, which has not been made public, would cover almost all of the severance payments for workers involved in the case, including interest, the people said.

Yet another legal case with former senior Twitter executives is ongoing, the outlet writes. Gizmodo reached out to X for comment.

At this point, Musk's procurement of Twitter feels like ancient history. So many things have happened between then and now. In the interim, Musk has gone on to use the platform to help get Donald Trump elected president, become an “unofficial” part of Trump's cabinet, and launch DOGE. Then he flamed out, left the cabinet, and proceeded to use the platform to tar Trump and link him to Jeffrey Epstein. Even the ongoing resistance to calling the website “X” (for a long time afterward, many of us still referred to the site as “Twitter”) seems to have mostly faded.

There aren't many all-in-one soundbar solutions that give you as much sonic immersion for your money as LG's S95. Many modern soundbar brands prefer to sell high-priced single bars, with add-on speakers available for an additional fee. LG provides a subwoofer, dual surrounds, and LG's unique mix of five (not four) height channels to put you in the center of the action for 3D sound formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X from the get-go.

The latest-model S95AR offers a modest upgrade over last year's S95TR (8/10, WIRED Recommends), including a revamped subwoofer and a $200 price hike to go with it. It's perhaps no coincidence that the S95's biggest rival, Samsung's 11.1.4-channel Q990, has also raised its price in recent years, keeping LG's slightly less elaborate 9.1.5-channel setup the more affordable option at full price.

I still prefer Samsung's warmer, more musical sound signature, but the S95AR is a thrilling performer that offers similar (if not better) value, along with exclusive features for owners of newer LG TVs. If you're looking for a one-stop setup that gets you close to a multi-component home theater solution, but with much less hassle, the S95AR is among the best soundbars around.

For the second time in two products from LG, the S95AR landed on my doorstep in a somewhat abused state, with notable dents to its metallic acoustic grille. The system seemed otherwise no worse for wear, and while its 50-inch width pushes to the edges of midsize consoles, its height of less than 3 inches fits neatly below most TVs. Setup was mostly uneventful, allowing me to get it connected and spinning sound through the four-piece system in short order.

I say mostly uneventful because, as was the case with the last LG soundbar I reviewed, the S95AR requires you to plug in its components in a certain order: subwoofer first, then surrounds, then the bar. I did not do this, and the left rear surround wouldn't connect. Unplugging everything and reconnecting it in order fixed things (or perhaps it was just the power cycling), and I had no other connection issues over several weeks.

LG's ThinQ app has grown up over the years, now standing as a capable and mostly stable control center for all software setup and settings. The app found the bar nearly instantly and made it easy to connect to my network, futz with speaker channel levels, and perform LG's AI Calibration that tunes the soundbar to your space. You can easily change inputs or sound modes and “Effects” from Music and Cinema modes to Night mode for softening the bass when the kids (or neighbors) are tucked in.

There's also a separate remote for many of these controls, but due to the bar's lack of any real visual display, using it for anything more than a quick volume adjustment or input switch is a hassle, as you're relying on voice cues. That could be helpful for those with accessibility issues, but otherwise, the app is your interface.

Nestled within the main bar are front, left, and center channels that handle the majority of your music and TV content, dual side-firing drivers to bounce sound off your walls, and a trio of “height” channels to bounce effects off your ceiling, including LG's unique center height channel for enhanced immersion with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X mixes. You'll get three more channels in each football-sized surround speaker, including front, side, and height channels, and an 8-inch side-firing subwoofer.

At the main bar's back side, you'll find an optical port (good for connecting legacy audio devices and older TVs) and dual HDMI ports, one of which connects the system to any modern TV over HDMI eARC/ARC. You'll want to choose HDMI over the optical port, as it's necessary for high-end formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and should also let you control power and volume on the bar with your TV remote.

I was pleased to find that the S95AR's spare HDMI port offers high-bandwidth pass-through for gaming features like VRR at up to 120 Hz, so serious gamers won't lose a TV input. If you own one of LG's best TVs from the past few years, you may also be able to connect the soundbar wirelessly over LG's WowCast system, but I was unable to get this to work with my LG B5 review model—the TV could see the bar and attempted to connect, but would ultimately just spin out.

WowCast aside, I wish the S95AR offered one more HDMI input, especially since LG's 2025 TVs don't support DTS decoding, even though its soundbars do. That means a Blu-ray player or other device sending a DTS signal needs to be connected directly to the soundbar to decode the signal for new LG TV owners to get the full benefit of formats like DTS:X. It's not detrimental, but it is an annoying (and inconsistent) limitation.

The S95AR supports all major DTS and Dolby audio formats, and just about any other audio files you'll encounter, including WAV and FLAC files at up to 24-bit/192-kHz resolution. An abundance of streaming options includes AirPlay and Google Cast, as well as Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, and Bluetooth, covering nearly every angle. Amazon Alexa is supported with a third-party device, but there's no built-in smart assistant.

LG TV exclusives include the previously mentioned WowCast, Wow Interface for controlling some settings directly from the TV, and Wow Orchestra for using LG TV speakers and the soundbar in tandem. I've never understood the appeal of the latter, and that was again the case with the B5—avoiding TV speakers is the main reason to get a soundbar, after all. But hey, it's there if you want to add even more (worse) speakers to the S95AR's already expansive configuration.

Right out of the box, the S95AR submerges you in the action with impressive clarity, punch, and fluidity. I found myself tweaking the surround sound channels a bit, especially when faced with loud effects like the almost invasive babbling brooks of my latest gaming obsession, Ghost of Tsushima. Otherwise, the system is remarkably hands-off by default, offering poise and balance between registers and seamless movement between its multitude of speakers.

The height channels were the biggest standouts, providing striking overhead effects in Dolby Atmos demo scenes that translated to thrilling cinematics in regular mixes. The first time Scott Lang puts on the suit in Ant-Man seemed to pull me into the scene by the collar, surrounding me in a barrage of overhead sweeps and swirling effects like the cyclone of air in the old-school vacuum he gets sucked into. The rat growling in the walls popped up so realistically from the left surround speaker, I was almost tricked into looking down the hallway.

The system continued to impress over several days of testing, offering clear and detailed effects, rich symphonic soundtracks, and decisive dialog in everything from action flicks to sitcoms, without the need for the available Clear Voice mode. Not once did I worry about the action overriding the details, even as the boomy subwoofer poured forth earth-shaking explosions and barreling freight trains.

The bass was sometimes less articulate than I'd hoped for, especially with music streaming where the sub had trouble keeping up with tricky bass lines or drum beats. Music in general can sound flat in the Standard mode, but experimenting with the different options was delightfully effective. The Music mode is much more spacious for stereo playback, while AI Sound Pro adds some fun virtualization, particularly successful with complex electronic mixes.

You'll get better all-around performance from the often pricier Q990, not to mention add-on systems like the Sonos' Arc Ultra and Era 300s, but the S95AR is a great setup for the money, especially for newer LG TV owners—and as usual, don't sleep on last year's model.

I was on a panel recently discussing the future of work when a fellow panelist shared a chilling statistic. In their research, they had monitored the social media platform Discord and found a server with approximately 5,000 children actively and openly discussing suicide.

These conversations were unfolding in a digital space with virtually no adult supervision — a dark corner of the internet where despair was festering among the generation expected to build our future. That reality is more than a tragic footnote in the story of technology; it is a blaring siren signaling a catastrophic failure of both parenting and education.

As we stand on the precipice of an AI revolution that will reshape society, we are failing to equip our children with the emotional resilience to navigate the world today, let alone the skills and purpose to thrive in the world of tomorrow.

Let's talk about the urgent need to build emotional and digital resilience in our children as they head back to school, and then close with my Product of the Week: the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

The Discord anecdote is a symptom of a much larger disease. While parents of previous generations worried about what their kids were doing at the park, today's parents must contend with a borderless, anonymous digital world that operates 24/7.

Platforms like Discord are designed for community, but without vigilant oversight, they can become echo chambers for the most dangerous aspects of adolescent angst. The platform's safety features often require a teen's cooperation to be effective, leaving a massive gap where parental guidance should be.

This lack of oversight is happening against the backdrop of a well-documented youth mental health crisis, exacerbated by the pressures of social media.

We are allowing our children to be raised by algorithms and anonymous peers in environments we don't understand and can't control. Before we can even begin to prepare them for a future shaped by AI, we must first pull them back from the digital abyss by re-engaging in their online lives, establishing firm boundaries, and fostering open communication about the dangers they face online.

While parents are struggling on the home front, our education system is failing on a systemic level. We are still operating on an industrial-era model of schooling, designed to produce compliant workers for jobs that are rapidly disappearing. The curriculum is focused on rote memorization and standardized testing—skills that AI can already perform better than any human.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month revealed that 71% of Americans are concerned that AI will lead to too many people losing jobs, yet our schools continue to guide students down career paths that may not exist by the time they graduate.

Career counseling, if it exists at all, is often an underfunded afterthought, incapable of providing relevant guidance for an AI-driven job market. We are teaching students what to think, but not how to think. We are preparing them for a world of predictable, linear careers, while the reality they will face is one of constant change and disruption.

The result is a generation armed with obsolete knowledge and a broken compass pointed toward a future that no longer exists.

This trend leads to a deeply concerning cultural shift. Many young people today see work not as a source of fulfillment but as something to endure or avoid altogether. Viewing work as something to endure isn't laziness; it's a rational response to the world they see. They are graduating with crushing debt into a gig economy, looking at a future where their skills could be automated away, and seeing a corporate world that often seems to offer little more than burnout.

Surveys of Gen Zs and millennials consistently show a deep desire for purpose-driven work and a healthy work-life balance — things the current system seems ill-equipped to provide. When education fails to connect learning to passion and purpose, and when the future of work appears precarious and unfulfilling, it is no wonder that a sentiment of disillusionment takes hold.

If we do not fix this crisis of purpose, we risk raising a generation that is not only unemployable due to a skills mismatch but also unwilling to work because they have never been shown that a career can be a source of joy and meaning.

The challenge is immense, but the path forward is clear. We need a radical overhaul of our education system, one that shifts the focus from what AI can do to what it can't. The curriculum of the future must be built on a foundation of uniquely human skills.

First, we must prioritize critical thinking and complex problem-solving. Instead of asking students to memorize the answer, we need to teach them how to ask the right questions and evaluate information from multiple sources. AI itself can be a powerful tool in this process.

Educators can leverage AI as a Socratic partner for students, a tireless tutor that can challenge their assumptions, ask probing questions, and force them to defend their reasoning. Rather than using AI to get an answer, students can learn to use it to refine their thinking.

Second, we must foster creativity and emotional intelligence. These skills build empathy, collaboration, and innovation that will allow humans to work alongside AI to create new value. As one report notes, schools must integrate these “soft skills” into the core curriculum.

Third, we can use technology to bridge the gap between the classroom and the real world through AI-powered simulations. The world awaiting our children is complex and dynamic. Immersive simulations can provide a safe and controlled environment for them to practice making difficult decisions with real-time feedback.

Imagine students navigating a complex business negotiation, managing a response to a simulated climate crisis, or collaborating to solve an ethical dilemma in a virtual workplace. These experiences build not just knowledge, but practical wisdom and resilience, preparing them for the pressures and ambiguities of their future careers in a way that lectures and textbooks never could.

Finally, we need to teach adaptability and lifelong learning. The idea of learning a single trade for life is dead. Education must instill a “growth mindset,” teaching students how to learn, unlearn, and relearn continuously. Achieving that goal requires embracing new, personalized learning technologies and creating a system that supports individuals throughout their entire careers, not just for the first 18 years.

The image of thousands of children lost in a digital world of despair is a stark reflection of our collective failure. We are standing by as a generation grows up unsupervised online and unprepared for the profound economic and social shifts that AI will bring.

That crisis is not a problem that technology can solve; it is a human problem that requires a human solution. It demands that parents reassert their role as guides in both the real and digital worlds. It requires that our education system shed its industrial-age skin and transform to cultivate the skills that will matter most in the coming century.

If we fail to act, we risk a future defined not by the incredible promise of AI, but by the lost potential of a generation we left behind.





The Pixel 10 Pro Fold combines large dual screens with AI-powered features. (Image Credit: Google)

Speaking as someone who has used and loved the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for the last year, the bar for its successor was incredibly high. Yet, after its reveal last week, the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold has cleared that bar with room to spare, cementing its place as this week's standout product.

This phone isn't just an iterative update; it's a confident stride forward that perfects the phone/tablet hybrid, wrapping bleeding-edge AI and photography into a stunningly refined package.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold solidifies its position as the best hybrid device on the market by focusing on what matters: the screens. With a larger 6.4-inch outer display and a sprawling 8-inch internal screen, it functions perfectly as a premium smartphone when closed and a powerful, multitasking tablet when open. This duality is its superpower, offering a level of versatility that a standard slab phone simply can't match.

Under the hood, the new Tensor G5 chip unlocks a suite of AI features that feel like magic. New tools like “Camera Coach” provide real-time suggestions to improve your photo composition, while “Magic Cue” proactively surfaces information from your apps when you need it. The photography hardware gets a boost with a new 48MP main sensor, but it's the AI-driven software like “Instant View” — which uses the large screen to show a preview gallery as you shoot — that truly elevates the experience.

This year's launch event in New York was the most Apple-like yet — a polished, confident presentation that showcased not just a phone but an entire ecosystem. From the new Pixel Watch 4 (I wear the 3) to the Pixelsnap magnetic charging accessories that echo Apple's MagSafe, Google presented a cohesive vision of hardware and software working in perfect harmony.

This polish addresses one of the few remaining hardware gaps, leaving the core reasons users prefer Pixel phones over their Apple alternatives shining brighter than ever. It comes down to the software experience and intelligent assistance. The clean, bloatware-free version of Android, combined with the deep integration of a beneficial AI like Gemini, offers a level of customization and proactive help that iOS can't match.

For users who value a smarter, more personalized device that works for them, the Pixel remains the undisputed champion. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the ultimate expression of that philosophy and my Product of the Week.

Shortly after US president Donald Trump hung up a call with Russia's Vladimir Putin this spring, an obscure shortwave radio channel, broadcasting from a military base somewhere in Russia, sprang to life.

Through a fog of static, at 4625 kHz on the shortwave dial, a man's voice spoke in monotone: “Nikolai, Zhenya, Tatiana, Ivan.” He repeats the message—spelled out in the Russian phonetic alphabet—followed by a series of numbers and letters. The whole message reads: “NZhTI 01263 BOLTANKA 4430 9529.” What it means is anyone's guess, but lots of people were guessing.

This radio station, dubbed UVB-76, has spent much of 2025 broadcasting cryptic messages, strange music, and pirate interruptions. The channel has elicited fascination for decades. This time, however, something is different. Now, Moscow's network of propagandists and warmongers are suddenly fascinated by this obscure channel.

UVB-76's real purpose is almost certainly innocuous and mundane. But in recent weeks, Moscow has capitalized on the eerie fixation with the channel to stoke fears of nuclear armageddon.

Shortwave radio, which operates on a different frequency and a wider spectrum than AM or FM radio broadcasts, has always had a particularly dedicated fandom. Because shortwave broadcasts can traverse huge distances, it became a favorite medium for soldiers and spies.

Throughout the Cold War, ham radio hobbyists searched the shortwave dial in search of agencies communicating with their agents. Tune in to the right frequency, and you could hear a KGB officer reading out coded messages for their undercover operatives in America, a Cuban intelligence officer relaying a message to Moscow, or a CIA asset in eastern Europe trying to get in touch with Langley.

The end of the Cold War and the advent of modern technology made secure communication easier—making these shortwave radio stations largely, though not entirely, obsolete. At the same time, however, amateur radio fans began congregating online, and they scoured for spy stations on the radio dial.

“What have you stumbled on to?” reads a message posted to curious visitors to Spynumbers.com. “Instructions to spies? Messages exchanged between drug dealers? Deliberate attempts at deception and mis-information? Chances are, all of the above!” The website's users kept a meticulous database of the shortwave stations that, they believed, were used by spooks. Operators around the world logged the station at 4625 Khz as “The Buzzer.”

The station, which was categorized only as “Slavic,” is thought to have come online in the 1970s. The fact that it could be heard straight across the globe—from London to Sydney—suggested that it had some pretty powerful transmitters behind it. A perpetual tone, an incessant buzzing, was thought to be a way for the operator to reserve the frequency, even when it wasn't actively being used. The buzzing would infrequently stop, perhaps once a week, replaced with other tones or a man reading a message using the Russian phonetic alphabet. Try as they might, listeners never decoded those messages.

Starting in the late 1990s, the station used the call sign УЗБ-76—later mistranslated as UVB-76—although it would change that handle repeatedly over the years. Nevertheless, the incorrect title stuck. As did the station's mythos, which has grown over the decades to try to explain UVB-76's mysterious signal.

As a 2011 feature in WIRED explained, theories about UVB-76's true purpose went from the decidedly unsexy, such as the idea that the station was testing atmospheric changes in the ionosphere (as reported in a 2008 academic paper); to the truly cinematic—that it was either a way to contact aliens or a “doomsday device, which had been programmed to launch a wave of nuclear missiles at the US in the event the Kremlin was flattened by a sneak attack.”

For years, the station's main signal emanated from a military outpost some 50 miles north of Moscow. When urban explorers reached the site in 2011, they found it abandoned—but forgotten radio equipment and log books suggested that it had once been the headquarters of UVB-76. (“In general, it was boring,” the explorers wrote.) Russian broadcaster RT also visited the site that year, reporting that the site was, most likely, just a mundane part of Russia's military communication apparatus.

In the years since, an online community has sprung up across YouTube, Reddit, X, VKontakte, and across multiple dedicated podcasts and online forums. Its fanbase stretches across history buffs, ham radio operators, and those obsessed with creepypasta. A dedicated site, Priyom.org, sprang up to meticulously catalog UVB-76's many mysterious messages.

With the publicity came radio pirates, who have spent years interrupting the signal with meowing and the band REM and have even knocked it offline altogether. In at least one case, a frequency hijacker seemed to communicate with UVB-76's operator. (Or, possibly, another pirate.)

The online buzz has driven mainstream coverage. News outlets have, over the years, called the station “chilling” and “ghostly,” writing that it “baffles scientists.”

“It's natural to be fascinated with things you don't have a clear answer to,” says Māris Goldmanis, a historian who runs a website devoted to tracking these shortwave stations, including UVB-76.

The fascination with the station was offset only by the fact that its transmissions weren't very interesting. Of the hundreds of messages logged on Priyom, none have actually been decoded. There is little doubt that the channel is used by the Russian military, because it has admitted as much. A military journal obliquely references the site as part of a program to maintain communication between Russia's various military assets, even amid warfare. “Its main goal is indeed to serve the Russian strategic military radio network,” Goldmanis says.

Given Russia's huge territory, Goldmanis says, shortwave networks like UVB-76 are useful for connecting far-flung outposts. “This is a normal peacetime operation,” he says.

It's impossible to say whether the channel has an axillary purpose, as the Russian military is understandably secretive about its communication systems. That has left lots of room for speculation. This includes the unsubstantiated idea that UVB-76 was a central part of Moscow's nuclear failsafe. And it has kept growing more popular.

On December 11, 2024, UVB-76 once again sprang to life. After a quiet month, the station delivered 24 transmissions in a single day—a record, according to its fan club on Russian social media network VK. The transmissions themselves were standard fare (“alphabet,” “billiards,” or just nonsense words), but the volume caused a stir among those who monitor the channel.

Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti published what appears to be its first-ever article on UVB-76, summarizing the new broadcasts and explaining to its readers that “it is called a ‘Doomsday Station' because it is believed to have been allegedly created as part of the Dead Hand system.”

Since early this year, RIA-Novosti has published roughly one story per week on UVB-76, suggesting its coded messages are related to missile strikes on Iran, the war in Ukraine, and negotiations with Trump.

RT, which had once pooh-poohed the idea that UVB-76 was part of Moscow's nuclear deterrence, began regularly posting its broadcasts on X, writing in April that the station often broadcasts “coded alerts pre-major events”—particularly around phone calls between Trump and Putin—and suggesting that it operates as a “nuke failsafe.”

Chatter about the station grew on Telegram, the messaging app popular in Russia. Channels claimed that UVB-76 grew active “during periods of escalation” of military activity and that it served as a kind of oracle, sending its coded messages “before global events.” Some of these channels, some with millions of subscribers, are themselves close to the Russian Ministry of Defense.

“In the time of tension between Russia and the West,” Goldmanis says, “such articles are ideal for mounting tension and fear.” There is some irony in the fact that Russians seem to be spooking themselves with tales of their own military communications network, but he argues that it speaks to a deeper fear in Russia: “Fear of losing the war, fear of the state collapse, fear of Western nuclear action, fear of their own government and military.”

All of this domestic shadowboxing, in turn, drove international headlines. The British tabloid The Sun proclaimed that Russia's “doomsday radio station” had transmitted its “cryptic ‘nuke' code.” Belgium's Het Laatste Nieuws reported that the radio messages had caused “heightened alertness among military analysts worldwide.” Politika, a Serbian daily newspaper, penned a lengthy article that claimed that UVB-76 “put fear in the hearts of NATO generals and the Pentagon,” which have been powerless to crack its code. (That article was republished in Russian by RT's foreign translation service.)

Amid this new attention, Moscow's communications regulator Roskomnadzor—responsible for monitoring, regulating, and censoring all mass media, including both shortwave radio and the internet—commented on UVB-76 for the first time. A spokesperson for the agency didn't say much, telling RT that information about the frequency and its purpose “is not publicly available.”

As public interest increased, UVB-76 kept churning out messages. On May 23, an operator read out the code “БЕЗЗЛОБИЕ,” roughly translated to “the absence of malice,” and “ХРЮКОСТЯГ,” or “oink,” followed by a series of numbers. This message, in particular, caught the attention of Dmitry Medvedev.

Medvedev has served as both president and prime minister of Russia and now serves on the hawkish Security Council of Russia as deputy chairman. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War say Medvedev is frequently deployed by the Kremlin to “inflammatory rhetoric, often including nuclear blackmail, into the information space to spread fear among Western decision-makers and discourage future military aid to Ukraine.”

“Doomsday Radio: May's ‘lack of malice' has been replaced by a fierce ‘oink,'” Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel. Invoking a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks that had roiled Moscow, Medvedev levied thematic insults against the Ukrainians and their backers in Europe: “Pigs,” “hogs,” and “boars.” He ended the post: “Password: ‘БЕЗЗЛОБИЕ.' Answer: ‘ХРЮКОСТЯГ,'” the two UVB-76 codewords.

Coincidental or intentional, Russia's new fascination with UVB-76 comes just as it attempts to ratchet up fear of nuclear armageddon. To do that, Moscow is turning to that bit of Cold War lore: The Dead Hand.

Throughout the Cold War, there was a pervasive idea that the Soviets had built some kind of doomsday device. Popularized by films like Fail Safe and Dr. Strangelove, the idea went that Moscow had developed the ability to launch its ballistic missiles, even if all the Communist Party leadership were dead. Such a response could effectively end life on Earth.

When those films were released, in 1964, Moscow had no such program. It would take another two decades before the USSR completed its response system, codename Perimeter.

The Russian nuclear retaliation program was not quite as nefarious as the movies imagined. It was not a fully automatic nuclear response but rather a semiautomated system of real safeguards. Perimeter, housed in a deep bunker in the Ural mountains, was connected to a series of inputs: Seismic and radiation sensors, which monitored for warhead impacts on Soviet soil; and radio links back to the Kremlin. If, and only if, the system was switched on, if it detected evidence of nuclear strikes, and if the communication channel with central command was severed, Perimeter would launch a series of command rockets. These missiles, equipped with radio transmitters, would buzz through Soviet airspace broadcasting launch codes to the Soviet nuclear arsenal.

Perimeter was revealed in a 1993 op-ed in The New York Times by Bruce G. Blair, an American nuclear expert who had been handed details of the program by a Soviet scientist. He described the design of this system as the “spasms of the dead hand.”

“There's no question in my mind that the system was built,” David Hoffman, contributing editor to The Washington Post and author of The Dead Hand, tells WIRED. “Perimeter exists, and it was a real system that was put on combat duty shortly after Mikael Gorbachev took office in 1985.”

Hoffman, who based his book on extensive interviews with those familiar with the program, says there is good evidence that Perimeter was maintained, though switched off, after the end of the Cold War. Putin's ascent to the presidency, however, marked a “gray zone,” he says. In recent years, Russian commanders have said that the system remains operational, and Moscow has upgraded the command bunker where Perimeter was based.

And it was UVB-76 that thrust the Dead Hand program back into the news. It's particularly conspicuous because, based on everything we know about Perimeter, there's no way UVB-76 has any role in launching nuclear weapons.

Goldmanis concedes that UVB-76 could certainly be useful if a nuclear strike destroys Russia's communications network, but the idea that it could automatically order missile launches is “neither logical nor technically possible,” he says. (The bunker which houses Perimeter communicates with the outside world using very-low-frequency radio, not shortwave.)

So there is no real mystery about UVB-76's role in Russia's Perimeter system. The only mystery is why Russian propagandists seem so intent on convincing the world that the two are related.

Since its inception, the Kremlin has actually been notoriously mum about Perimeter—odd, because part of the utility of such a weapon is its power to deter a first strike. “It is absolutely a completely absurd situation,” Hoffman says. But that has changed recently.

On July 31, Trump and Medvedev traded rambling posts on their respective social media platforms. The president fired off a Truth Social post calling India and Russia “dead economies” and excoriating Medvedev to “watch his words.”

The Russian official, meanwhile, took to Telegram to warn the American of “how dangerous the non-existent ‘dead hand' can be 😂.”

Despite the arms race of the Cold War, the world maintained an unspoken understanding that the use of a first-strike nuclear weapon would be immoral, irrational, and likely world-ending. Academic Nina Tannenwald calls this the “nuclear taboo.”

That taboo generally extended to threats of nuclear warfare as well. Until very recently.

Between 2022 and 2023, the Center for Strategic and International Studies tracked nearly 200 instances where Russian officials issued threats around the use of nuclear weapons, particularly as it tried to dissuade Western support for the Ukrainian government amid its ill-fated invasion. That culminated in changes to the Russian nuclear doctrine last year. The new orders, approved by Putin, allow Moscow to launch a nuclear strike in response to certain large-scale conventional attacks on Russian territory.

“Breaking the nuclear taboo—using nuclear signaling and threats—is very dangerous,” Hoffman says. It increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, misperception, and miscalculation.

While UVB-76 continued to gurgle out messages over the past week, amid an extraordinary meeting in Alaska between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, speculation about its true purpose has noticeably quieted on pro-Kremlin channels.

Hoffman is skeptical that this most recent fascination with UVB-76 and Perimeter is anything more than marginal, given that Putin himself has already begun the nuclear saber-rattling. He calls it “cartoonish” by comparison. Still, Hoffman says, “the whole lore of the Dead Hand is that it's a monster out of control.” It's not true, of course—“it was built as a retaliatory system,” he notes, “as a second strike”—but the idea of the Russian doomsday machine continues to loom large.

Goldmanis came around to a similar metaphor.

“The Dead Hand is also a great myth,” he says. It may be based on a real system, but secrecy breeds mystery. Like a fabled monster in a dark, impassible cave, fears can feed on themselves. “No one can be sure, as they can't access it.”

The Sun's most complex mysteries could soon be solved thanks to artificial intelligence. On August 20, IBM and NASA announced the launch of Surya, a foundation model for the sun. Having been trained on large datasets of solar activity, this AI tool aims to deepen humanity's understanding of solar weather and accurately predict solar flares—bursts of electromagnetic radiation emitted by our star that threaten both astronauts in orbit and communications infrastructure on Earth.

Surya was trained with nine years of data collected by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), an instrument that has orbited the sun since 2010, taking high-resolution images every 12 seconds. The SDO captures observations of the sun at various different electromagnetic wavelengths to estimate the temperature of the star's layers. It also takes precise measurements of the sun's magnetic field—essential data for understanding how energy moves through the star, and for predicting solar storms.

Historically, interpreting this vast amount of diverse and complex data has been a challenge for heliophysicists. To address this challenge, IBM says that Surya's developers used the SDO data to create a digital twin of the sun—a dynamic virtual replica of the star that is updated when new data is captured, and which can be manipulated and more easily studied.

The process began with unifying the various data formats fed into the model, allowing it to process them consistently. Next, a long-range vision transformer was employed—AI architecture that enables detailed analysis of very high-resolution images and the identification of relationships between their components, regardless of their distance.

The model's performance was optimized using a mechanism called spectral gating, which reduces memory usage by up to 5 percent by filtering out noise in the data, thereby increasing the quality of the processed information.

Its developers say that this design gives Surya a significant advantage: Unlike other algorithms that require extensive labeling of the data that's fed to them, Surya can learn directly from raw data. This allows it to quickly adapt to different tasks and deliver reliable results in less time.

During testing, Surya demonstrated its versatility in integrating data from other instruments, such as the Parker Solar Probe and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), two other spacecraft that observe the sun. Surya also proved to be effective in various predictive functions, including predicting flare activity and solar wind speed.

According to IBM, traditional prediction models can only predict a flare one hour in advance based on signals detected in specific regions of the sun. In contrast, “Surya provided a two-hour lead by using visual information. The model is thought to be the first to provide a warning of this kind. In early testing of the model, the team said they achieved a 16 percent improvement in solar flare classification accuracy, a marked improvement over existing methods,” the company said in a statement.

NASA stresses that, although the model was designed to study heliophysics, its architecture is adaptable to different fields, from planetary science to Earth observation. “By developing a foundation model trained on NASA's heliophysics data, we're making it easier to analyze the complexities of the sun's behavior with unprecedented speed and precision,” said Kevin Murphy, NASA's director of data science, in a statement. “This model empowers broader understanding of how solar activity impacts critical systems and technologies that we all rely on here on Earth.”

The risk posed by abnormal solar activity is not minor. A major solar storm could directly affect global telecommunications, collapse electrical grids, and disturb GPS navigation, satellite operations, internet connections, and radio transmissions.

Andrés Muñoz-Jaramillo, a solar physicist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and lead scientist on the project, emphasized that Surya's goal is to maximize the lead time for these possible scenarios. “We want to give Earth the longest lead time possible. Our hope is that the model has learned all the critical processes behind our star's evolution through time so that we can extract actionable insights.”

People tend to be self-preoccupied. Self-interest is good when it ensures that one's needs are met, but it can also be maladaptive; research shows that the tendency to self-focus promotes the occurrence of depression and anxiety and can even prolong these conditions. Is there a neural representation of self-preoccupation? Danika Geisler and Meghan Meyer, from Colombia University, explored this question in their new JNeurosci paper. 

The researchers first identified a pattern of neural activity that frequently appeared in a sample of 32 people while they took a mental break. This activity could predict whether people started thinking about themselves during the break a few seconds later. Geisler and Meyer then turned to a broadly used publicly available database called the Human Connectome project. From the data of 1,086 people, the researchers found that people who scored high on internalizing-a maladaptive form of self-preoccupied thinking-also moved in and out of this neural activity pattern during rest. Thus, the tendency to engage in self-centric thinking may be reflected by fluctuating activity in distinct brain areas during rest. 

We are excited to see what other aspects of everyday life our neural signature of self-preoccupation can predict. For example, Danika is working on an exciting project examining whether engaging this neural signature predicts people's real-world social network positions. We are also interested in seeing if this neural signature can prospectively predict the onset of depression or anxiety; if so, intervening on this neural signature could offset the development of these mental health conditions."

A team of scientists led by the Institute for Glial Sciences (IGS) at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine has discovered a built-in "brake" that controls when key brain cells mature. In multiple sclerosis (MS), this brake appears to stay on too long, leaving the cells unable to repair the damage the disease causes.

The study, published today in the journal Cell, identifies a new framework for how cells control when they mature. The discovery also presents a potential regenerative medicine approach to repair the damage caused by MS and similar diseases affecting the nervous system.

Myelin damage drives disability in MS, and the only cells that can repair it are glial cells called oligodendrocytes. By identifying the molecular brake that controls when oligodendrocytes mature, we reveal a clear path to unlocking the brain's own repair program."

Paul Tesar, study's senior author, director of the Institute for Glial Sciences and the Dr. Donald and Ruth Weber Goodman Professor of Innovative Therapeutics, School of Medicine

The team is now working to understand why this immature state is heightened in MS brains and whether this same framework operates in other cell types or contributes to stalled repair in other diseases.

"MS is a progressive disease that gets worse over time and patients still lack therapies that can restore the myelin they've lost," Tesar said. "We believe these new insights will help deliver on the promise of regenerative therapies that MS patients so urgently need."

The study focused on oligodendrocytes, which wrap neurons in protective myelin sheaths that are lost in MS. Oligodendrocytes belong to a category of cells known as glia, which comprise over half of the cells in our nervous system but have largely been overlooked by scientists in favor of neurons. The IGS was created last year at Case Western Reserve to understand how these vital cells function in health and disease.

To understand how oligodendrocytes acquire their ability to myelinate neurons, the IGS scientists tracked thousands of molecular changes as immature cells developed into mature, myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. One protein, called SOX6, stood out.

The team found that SOX6 acted like a brake, stalling cells in an immature state through a phenomenon known as "gene melting." This brake is essential in healthy brain development because it prevents premature myelin formation and ensures that oligodendrocytes mature at the right place and time. But in MS, this normally protective timing mechanism appears to get stuck.

"We were surprised to find that SOX6 can so tightly control when oligodendrocytes mature," said Kevin Allan, the study's co-lead author and recent graduate of the School of Medicine's Medical Scientist Training Program. "This gives us a potential explanation for why these cells often cannot remyelinate damaged neurons in diseases like MS."

When the researchers examined brain tissue data from people with MS, they saw an unusually high number of cells stuck in this SOX6-linked immature state. But this stalled maturation seems to be specific to MS: there was no evidence of it in samples from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients.

To test whether releasing the brake could accelerate development, the team used a targeted molecular drug called an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to reduce SOX6 in mouse models. Within days, the treated cells matured and began to myelinate nearby neurons.

"Our findings suggest that oligodendrocytes in MS are not permanently broken, but may simply be stalled," said Jesse Zhan, the study's co-lead author and medical student in the School of Medicine's Medical Scientist Training Program. "More importantly, we show that it is possible to release the brakes on these cells to resume their vital functions in the brain."

Researchers led by Hiroshi Ohno at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences (IMS) in Japan have discovered why smoking tobacco helps people suffering from ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease typified by inflammation of the large intestine. Published in the scientific journal Gut on August 25, the study shows that smoking produces metabolites that encourage bacteria from the mouth to grow in the large intestines where they trigger an immune response. These findings imply that protection against ulcerative colitis can be achieved through prebiotics like hydroquinone or probiotic therapy with bacteria like Streptococcus mitis, thus eliminating the need to smoke and all the associated risks for other diseases.

Inflammatory bowel disease comes in two main varieties, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Although both cause chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue and weight loss, their causes and the exact type and location of the inflammation differ. Along with these differences is a mystery that has puzzled doctors and scientists for over 40 years; smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease but somehow protects against ulcerative colitis. As both diseases are related to gut inflammation—which is an immune response— and gut immunity depends in part on the types of bacteria in the gut, Ohno and his team at RIKEN IMS set out to investigate whether the differential effects of smoking on these diseases can be explained by gut bacteria.The researchers used a combination of human clinical data and experiments with mice to reach their conclusions. Among those with ulcerative colitis, they found that smokers had certain bacteria usually found in the mouth, such as Streptococcus, growing in the gut, specifically in the colonic mucosa that cover the inner lining of the intestines. This phenomenon did not occur in ex-smokers. Thus, while these bacteria normally pass all the way through the digestive system as we swallow saliva throughout the day, smoking somehow allows them to settle down in the gut mucosa.The next question was why? The researchers also examined gut metabolites—small substances produced in the gut when food is broken down and processed by the body and gut bacteria. They found that levels of several gut metabolites were higher in smokers with ulcerative colitis than in ex-smokers with colitis. In mice, the researchers found that one of these metabolites, called hydroquinone, promoted the growth of Streptococcus in the gut mucosa. So, smoking-related metabolites like hydroquinone allow mouth bacteria like Streptococcus to flourish in the mucus layer that covers the inner lining of the intestines. But how do these bacteria help reduce inflammation? And why don't they help in Crohn's disease?The researchers then went back to the oral bacteria that they had discovered was growing in the gut mucosa of smokers with ulcerative colitis, and isolated 10 strains from the saliva of smokers. When they treated mouse models of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each of these 10 strains for five days, they found that giving the mice Streptococcusmitis had almost the same effect as smoking. Inflammation was reduced in mice with ulcerative colitis and exacerbated in mice with Crohn's disease.Analysis showed that S. mitis triggered the emergence of helper Th1 cells, which are an important part of the gut's immune response to invaders. In Crohn's disease this likely worsens the condition because the original inflammation is actually caused by these same helper Th1 cells. But in colitis, the Th1 cells fight against an initial Th2-immune response, and this ends up reducing inflammation.As smoking poses high risks for cancer, heart disease, and many other illnesses, it is not a sustainable treatment for ulcerative colitis.

Our results indicate the relocation of bacteria from the mouth to the gut, particularly those of the Streptococcus genus, and the subsequent immune response in the gut, is the mechanism through which smoking helps protect against the disease. Logically, direct treatment with this kind of bacteria, or indirect treatment with hydroquinone, is thus likely to mimic the beneficial effects of smoking but avoid all the negative effects."

For the first time, a research team at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities demonstrated a groundbreaking process that combines 3D printing, stem cell biology, and lab-grown tissues for spinal cord injury recovery. 

The study was recently published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, more than 300,000 people in the United States suffer from spinal cord injuries, yet there is no way to completely reverse the damage and paralysis from the injury. A major challenge is the death of nerve cells and the inability for nerve fibers to regrow across the injury site. This new research tackles this problem head-on.

The method involves creating a unique 3D-printed framework for lab-grown organs, called an organoid scaffold, with microscopic channels. These channels are then populated with regionally specific spinal neural progenitor cells (sNPCs), which are cells derived from human adult stem cells that have the capacity to divide and differentiate into specific types of mature cells.

"We use the 3D printed channels of the scaffold to direct the growth of the stem cells, which ensures the new nerve fibers grow in the desired way," said Guebum Han, a former University of Minnesota mechanical engineering postdoctoral researcher and first author on the paper who currently works at Intel Corporation. "This method creates a relay system that when placed in the spinal cord bypasses the damaged area."

In their study, the researchers transplanted these scaffolds into rats with spinal cords that were completely severed. The cells successfully differentiated into neurons and extended their nerve fibers in both directions-rostral (toward the head) and caudal (toward the tail)-to form new connections with the host's existing nerve circuits. 

The new nerve cells integrated seamlessly into the host spinal cord tissue over time, leading to significant functional recovery in the rats.

Regenerative medicine has brought about a new era in spinal cord injury research. Our laboratory is excited to explore the future potential of our 'mini spinal cords' for clinical translation."

Ann Parr, professor of neurosurgery, University of Minnesota

While the research is in its beginning stages, it offers a new avenue of hope for those with spinal cord injuries. The team hopes to scale up production and continue developing this combination of technologies for future clinical applications.

In addition to Han and Parr, the team included Hyunjun Kim and Michael McAlpine from the University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering; Nicolas S. Lavoie, Nandadevi Patil and Olivia G. Korenfeld from the University of Minnesota Department of Neurosurgery; Manuel Esguerra from the University of Minnesota Department of Neuroscience; and Daeha Joung from the Department of Physics at Virginia Commonwealth University.

This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the State of Minnesota Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury Research Grant Program and the Spinal Cord Society.

New research indicates that many patients with advanced cancer report receiving treatment focusing on longevity over comfort, even when their goal is the opposite. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Treatment of serious illnesses generally aims to optimize longevity and quality of life, but in some cases, these goals are at odds with each other. Therefore, clinicians must strive to understand each individual's objectives so that patients do not receive burdensome treatments that go against their wishes.

When treating advanced cancer, the goal is to help patients live as long and as well as possible. But sometimes, patients and oncologists face tough choices, especially when the goals of living longer and staying comfortable begin to compete with one another."

Manan P. Shah, MD, lead author, University of California, Los Angeles

To assess the relationship between patients' preferences and their treatment, Dr. Shah and his colleagues analyzed survey responses from adults with advanced cancer and other serious illnesses who were enrolled in a multi-site trial of advance care planning.

Among 1,099 patients in the study, 49% of the 231 patients with advanced cancer preferred comfort-focused care, and 16% of the 231 patients died within 2 years. These proportions were similar to those observed in the 868 patients with other serious illnesses (48% and 13%). Among patients preferring comfort-focused care, patients with cancer were more likely than patients with other illnesses to report receiving discordant life-extending care (37% versus 19%).

Also, life-extending care did not appear to actually extend life in patients who did not wish to receive it. Among patients with cancer preferring comfort-focused care, there was no significant difference in 2-year mortality between those who reported receiving discordant life-extending versus concordant comfort-focused care.

"This disconnect between what patients want and what they feel they're getting is an important issue," Dr. Shah said. "One takeaway is that doctors need to have open conversations with patients about their goals, clearly explain the intent of the treatment they are providing, and try to reconcile any real or perceived discordance between goals and treatment."

Tobacco smoking is the number one cause of preventable disease and death in Canada; it is highly addictive and hard to stop. Recognizing these challenges, a new guideline from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care provides a menu of effective options to help people quit smoking, with behavioural and medication options and a natural health product that can be tailored and combined for personal choice. The guideline is published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241584.

Quitting smoking can be hard, and people may need to try to quit many times with a variety of options like counselling, medication or in combination. We have created a menu of options that work to address tobacco smoking and can be tailored to personal preferences to help people quit."

Dr. Eddy Lang, task force member, emergency physician at the University of Calgary and guideline coauthor

Tobacco smoking increases the risk of cancers such as lung, mouth, throat and bladder cancers; respiratory disease; cardiovascular disease; and more. Tobacco contains more than 7000 chemicals and 70 carcinogens.

In 2022, 11% of Canadians aged 15 years or older smoked tobacco, and about 75% of those smoked daily. Populations at higher risk of smoking include single, separated, divorced, or widowed people; people who identify as gay or bisexual; First Nations, Inuit or Métis people; people with mental health issues or substance use disorders; and those who work in jobs that do not require specific training or education levels.

Targeted at clinicians, smoking cessation practitioners, and patients, the guideline includes tools to help people decide which options are best for them, alone or in conversation with a health care provider. It is based on the latest evidence and aligns well with international guidelines.

What should clinicians do to help patients?

What interventions does the guideline recommend?

The guideline recommends against acupuncture, hypnosis, laser therapy, electric current stimulation to the head, ear acupressure, St. John's Wort, or S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) for smoking cessation.

The recommendations do not apply to traditional or ceremonial tobacco use by Indigenous peoples.

The task force engaged members of the public who smoke or had recently quit smoking to help rate potential outcomes such as success in quitting and quality of life. The guideline working group also involved 2 external content experts, a physician-scientist who treats people with tobacco addiction and another physician-scientist with expertise in implementing hospital-based smoking cessation programs. Many organizational interest holders also provided input into the guideline.

What about e-cigarettes?

The guideline recommends that most people first use behavioural and pharmacotherapy options known to be effective. Although e-cigarettes may help people quit, their use should be for those who could not quit using other ways or who express a strong preference for e-cigarettes. There are important uncertainties for people to consider, including the lack of approved products with consistent formulations and lack of long-term safety information, and e-cigarettes may not address nicotine addiction.

"Using these practical, evidence-based options will help people achieve their goal to quit smoking," said task force member Dr. Donna Reynolds, a family physician, specialist in public health and preventive medicine, and guideline vice-chair. "Clinicians can use the menu of options that we've made available as a patient–clinician discussion tool for shared decision-making with patients to discuss what is best for them. Quitting smoking may be just an intervention away."

In a related editorial https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251171, Dr. Matthew Stanbrook, a respirologist at Toronto Western Hospital and deputy editor, CMAJ, writes "laudably, the guideline authors make a conditional recommendation against electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for smoking cessation for most patients." 

This new guideline will be helpful in supporting patients to quit tobacco smoking.

"Although Canada has succeeded in substantially reducing the prevalence and incidence of smoking over the last half century, more work remains to help people who continue to smoke. Using this new guideline, clinicians will be better equipped to partner with their patients to enable them to free themselves from Canada's leading preventable cause of death and disease," concludes Dr. Stanbrook.

Having a hard time bending over to put your shoes on? Experiencing pain in the knees, groin, thigh or back? A new survey by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center reveals many people don't realize these symptoms can mean there's a problem in the hip.

The survey of 1,004 people in the United States shows 72% are not aware that knee pain can actually be a sign of a hip problem. Similarly, 69% miss groin pain and 66% miss thigh pain as rooted in the hip.

Patients will be referred to me for knee pain. When I examine the patient, I will rotate their hip and the patient will feel pain. We'll also do X-rays to determine arthritis in the hip and if a replacement would be beneficial."

Matthew Beal, MD, orthopedic surgeon, Ohio State Wexner Medical Center

The Ohio State survey also showed that four out of 10 people respond to unexplained pain by just "pushing through it." While more than half (52%) say they take over-the-counter medications to manage their pain.

Ohio State experts say it's important for people to consult a medical expert if they are having any unexplained pain so that a correct diagnosis is made and patients can lead fuller lives.

"Although hip replacement surgery may sound daunting, it's actually one of the easiest procedures to recover from," said Beal, also an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Ohio State College of Medicine. "Getting up and walking after the surgery can serve as ample physical therapy for most patients."

The survey also revealed most Americans (71%) knew a "catching" or clicking sensation in the hip is a sign of a hip problem. A lesser group, though still a majority (59%), identified difficulty bending or tying shoes as a sign as well as lower back pain (53%). Lesser-known symptoms that people thought could be a sign of a hip issue included:

Night pain or difficulty sleeping (45%)

Thigh pain (34%)

Groin pain (31%)

Knee pain (28%)

The survey was conducted by SSRS on its Opinion Panel Omnibus platform. The SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus is a national, twice-per-month, probability-based survey. Data collection was conducted from June 6-9, 2025, among a sample of 1,004 respondents. The survey was conducted via web (n=974) and telephone (n=30) and administered in English. The margin of error for total respondents is +/-3.5 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus data are weighted to represent the target population of U.S. adults ages 18 or older.

Feelings of shame are linked to reduced quality of life - as shown by the first study to measure shame as a factor influencing the connection between chronic gastrointestinal disorders and mental health.

The results highlight the importance of compassion in healthcare for these patients and their painful experiences of shame."

Inês Trindade, psychology researcher at örebro University

The study is published in the scientific journal Gastroenterology and is a collaboration with researchers at the University of Gothenburg, led by Professor Magnus Simrén.Inês Trindade has examined how feeling of shame affect people with "Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction" (DGBI) - a group of disorders of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal problems where clinical examinations are not able to identify the underlying causes. One example is IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).The study builds on the understanding that quality of life and psychological well-being interact with symptoms from the gut. More severe symptoms can lead to greater psychological distress. The same is true for the reverse - worsening mental health can exacerbate physical symptoms."We also know that gastrointestinal problems are often perceived as shameful due to judgmental societal attitudes. This creates a stigma that can cause individuals to feel shame," says Inês Trindade.These types of gastrointestinal disorders (DGBI) can have various consequences. They include needing to use the bathroom frequently, having diarrhoea or constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating. As a result, individuals with DGBI avoid certain foods and social situations to prevent discomfort or for fear of exposing symptoms to others. These physical problems are associated with psychological conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and with overall quality of life.The study shows that different levels of perceived shame among participants impact quality of life. The same level of physical symptoms resulted in different levels of quality of life, depending on the level of shame felt by the person. Individuals with higher levels of shame experienced significantly lower quality of life than individuals with a lower level of shame - even with the same severity of symptoms."We demonstrate that shame is an important explanatory factor - a mechanism linking these gastrointestinal problems to poor mental health and reduced quality of life. But there is also a direct link between gastrointestinal symptoms and mental health that is not associated with shame," says Inês Trindade.She emphasizes that it is normal to feel shame because we are social beings. However, this feeling can also have a corrosive effect leading to a range of negative psychological states. One example is the tendency to avoid contact with others.Inês Trindade sees potential implications for healthcare based on the study's results, even though patient-provider interactions were not the focus of this research project. Instead, she draws on results from other studies in interpreting the significance of her findings:"Empathy and compassion are crucial remedies for feelings of shame. Acknowledging the patient's experience and showing genuine interest are ways to provide support and help their condition. Even if it only is a ten-minute appointment, it can make all the difference. Empathy in healthcare is not a luxury - it's part of evidence-based care," says Inês Trindade.More than 2,400 Swedish people participated in the study, and 537 met the criteria for a DGBI diagnosis related to gastrointestinal problems.

A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard suggests that a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce dementia risk. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease benefited more from following a Mediterranean-style diet, showing a greater reduction in dementia risk compared to those at lower genetic risk.

One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial. We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions."

Over the last few decades, researchers have learned more about the genetic and metabolic basis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. Alzheimer's disease is known to have a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.

One gene in particular, apolipoprotein E (APOE), has emerged as the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease - the more common type develops later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern. People who carry one copy of the APOE4 variant have a 3-to-4-fold higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. People with two copies of the APOE4 variant (called APOE4 homozygous) have a 12-fold higher risk of Alzheimer's than those without.

To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses' Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). To validate their findings, the researchers analyzed similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed from 1993 to 2023.

Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants' blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant's inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.

They found that the people following a more Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing dementia and showed slower cognitive decline. The protective effect of the diet was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.

"These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," Liu said. "This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the APOE4 genetic variant."

A study limitation was that the cohort consisted of well-educated individuals of European ancestry. More research is needed in diverse populations.

In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer's disease. People often don't know their APOE genetics. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.

"In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," Liu said.

As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.

The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.

In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.

"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally," Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. "My staff feels like we are out here all alone," she added.

A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.

"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak," one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. "All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything."

Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.

The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.

While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state — at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.

"This is absolutely outrageous," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. "When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything."

Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.

"I think this may be very large," she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations around town: "According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November."

In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.

One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.

"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.

"It never hurts to ask the CDC," said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.

"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified," Milton wrote. "Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently."

Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.

"The CDC had gone dark," said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. "We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit."

Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after. 

"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed," one CDC scientist said.

Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. "Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February," he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. "The CDC was gagged," he said.

Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.

"It's not that the CDC was delinquent," Benjamin said. "It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs."

To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. "We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do," she said.

Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records "confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code."

Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.

"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC," Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.

Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.

Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. "It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it," Holbrooks said.

Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against covid restrictions deepened that mistrust.

Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.

"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community," Holbrooks said. "There's a lot of people in the shadows out here."

Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.

About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.

Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. "We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public," he said.

Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.

In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.

The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.

"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented," Zucker said.

Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: "I'm so overwhelmed."

On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.

In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were "flying off the shelf."

Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.

Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including one founded by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.

"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?" Milton asked in an email.

Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. "HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials," one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. "If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet."

Another CDC official said they've had to "walk a fine line" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.

While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. "We're providing vitamin A," Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. "There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness," he claimed, "against serious disease and death."

The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.

Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with dangerously inaccurate statements. "There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year," he said. "It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera." There is no evidence that measles vaccines "cause deaths every year." Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.

In another interview, Kennedy said, "The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris." The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.

HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.

Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.

"Local hospitals are at capacity," wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. "The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now," he added.

"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding," Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. "Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted."

The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.

None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.

Then another child in West Texas died of measles.

In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. "There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas," Sugarman said. "We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions."

Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. "A lot of people presumed their kids had measles," he said, "and didn't see the need to confirm it."

On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.

The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.

More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers on the fringes of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on "medical mismanagement," without evidence.

At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.

Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. "The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us," she wrote. "Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience."

A major study reveals that prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos, once widely used in homes and farms, may have lasting effects on children's brains, from disrupted metabolism to weaker motor skills.



Study: Brain Abnormalities in Children Exposed Prenatally to the Pesticide Chlorpyrifos. Image credit: hedgehog94/Shutterstock.com

A JAMA Neurology study used a sample of school-aged children to examine the associations between prenatal chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure and brain abnormalities. CPF exposure during prenatal development was associated with changes in neuronal tissue differentiation, enhanced myelination of the internal capsule, reduced fine motor speed and motor programming skills, and significantly disrupted regional blood flow and localized neuronal metabolism throughout the brain.

CPF is a very common insecticide used globally, so it is typically found everywhere, including in non-organic grains, vegetables, and fruits, as well as in air and dust. In this study's New York City cohort, prenatal exposure largely came from indoor residential spraying before its 2001 U.S. residential ban. In pregnant women, it has been seen to cross the placenta and reach the fetal brain. In rodent models, prenatal and neonatal CPF exposure has adversely impacted the brain, hampering neuron and glia generation and interfering with neuronal differentiation. Early exposure to CPF is more toxic to glial cells than to neurons.

The adverse effects of CPF exposure could be mediated at the molecular level, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, altered responses to neurotrophins, and impaired mitochondrial function. Research using rodent models has shown that these molecular effects lead to motor hyperactivity, learning and memory problems, and adulthood behaviors resembling anxiety and depression.

Prenatal exposure to CPF in humans has been linked to lower fetal growth, lower birth weight, smaller head size, abnormal newborn reflexes, and other disorders. The preclinical and clinical research conducted so far has shed light on the neurotoxicity of prenatal CPF exposure, but its effects on the human brain are unknown.

This prospective, longitudinal pregnancy cohort study examined the impact of prenatal CPF exposure on offspring brain metabolism, structure, and function in middle childhood. The study was conducted between January 1998 and July 2015 among pregnant women (N = 727) of African American or Dominican descent aged between 18 and 35.

During pregnancy, women completed questionnaires and self-identified their race and ethnicity. These data were collected to assess the representativeness of the sample. Within one day postpartum, maternal blood was collected, and umbilical cord blood was also obtained at delivery; CPF plasma levels from either source were measured. Of the original 727 women, 512 had CPF levels measured, and MRI analyses were conducted on 270 children aged 6-14.

Cortical thickness and local white matter volumes at the cerebral surface were evaluated using anatomical MRI measures. The direction and rate of water diffusion were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) in DTI represented the directional preference of diffusion, and the mean diffusion rate over three spatial directions was represented using the average diffusion coefficient (ADC).

Furthermore, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL), and the brain metabolite concentrations were measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).

A positive association was observed between prenatal CPF exposure and cortical thickness in frontal, temporal, and posteroinferior regions. An inverse association was noted between CPF exposure and cortical thickness in the dorsal parietal region. Concerning local white matter volumes in the frontal, temporal, and posteroinferior regions, an inverse association was noted with CPF exposure.

CPF exposure is inversely associated with ADC and positively associated with FA values in the internal capsule (IC). This was particularly true for IC's anterior limb and genu for FA, and for the anterior limb, genu, and posterior limb for ADC. The long axis of IC fiber bundles exhibited reduced diffusion in both the radial and axial directions, contributing to lower ADC values. Across most brain regions, there was an inverse association between prenatal CPF exposure and rCBF values.

The concentration of N-acetylL-aspartate (NAA), an index of healthy neuron density, was measured using MRSI. Within deep white matter tracts and gray matter of the insular cortex, NAA was inversely associated with CPF exposure. The findings for other metabolites were sparse. A positive association was found between CPF and glutamate/glutamine (Glx) concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex, after normalizing metabolite concentrations to creatine. The association between CPF and MRI measures in any modality was not significantly moderated by age or sex.

Concerning behavioral outcomes, a significant inverse association was noted between CPF values and fine motor speed and motor programming in both hands. The effects were disproportionate in the nondominant hand for motor programming.

Prenatal CPF exposure was associated with higher myelination of the internal capsule, changed differentiation of neuronal tissue into cortical white and gray matter, and poorer fine motor and motor programming performance. Widespread reductions in brain blood flow and scattered, localized reductions in neuronal density (NAA) suggest metabolic disruption. Some of the observed associations are accounted for by the molecular and cellular effects of CPF, including oxidative stress, inflammation, impaired mitochondrial functioning, and oligodendrocyte dysregulation.

A key limitation of the current study is the lack of generalizability of the findings, as the sample consisted of urban Dominican and African American women. There could have been selection bias regarding which individuals in the cohort could be contacted and who agreed to participate in MRI scanning. Furthermore, postnatal CPF exposure and exposure to other insecticides were not accounted for and could have influenced the results.

Teens from families experiencing financial hardship were more likely to develop eating disorders, with each additional hardship linked to a 6% higher risk. Children whose parents had only compulsory education were 1.64 times more likely to develop eating disorders than those with university-educated parents.

“Identifying and addressing existing barriers that might prevent young people from deprived backgrounds from accessing eating disorder services should be research and policy priority,” the study authors wrote. “Provision of comprehensive medical training might facilitate identification of a broader spectrum of eating disorder presentations in primary care, particularly in populations who are more likely to be missed.”

The study was led by Jane S. Hahn, MSc of the Division of Psychiatry, at the University College London, England. It was published online on August 20 in JAMA Network Open.

Several people from low-income backgrounds dropped out of the study, which could have created bias in results. The tool used to measure restrictive eating may not have captured extreme restrictive behaviors like anorexia. 

Various study authors reported receiving grants from the National Institute for Health and Care Research, grants from Wellcome Trust, and personal fees from the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology outside of the submitted work. No other disclosures were reported.

DISCLOSURES August 25, 2025  

It's been known for millennia that the human body accumulates waste as a result of day-to-day functioning, but it's now recognized that the awake, active brain also builds up waste that negatively affects neural function if not removed.

Thankfully, it was recently discovered that the brain has a garbage removal mechanism.

“The glymphatic system is a brain-wide network of perivascular spaces that facilitates the clearance of waste products from the brain during sleep,” Jeffrey Iliff, PhD, professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences/Department of Neurology, University of Washington School of Medicine, and researcher at the VA Puget Sound, Seattle, told Medscape Medical News.

This system “serves a similar function in the brain as the lymphatic system does in the rest of the body,” Iliff continued.

As a medical student he learned about the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the brain “we thought of it as an inert fluid with a primarily protective purpose, functioning as a sort of shock absorber,” he said. The reality is far more complex, and it's now known that the CSF plays “an important part in cleansing brain tissue by removing waste products and conveying nutrients throughout brain tissue.”

When first described in 2012, there was skepticism that a brain waste clearance system existed in humans but a new proof-of-principle study used contrast MRI imaging to visualize the glymphatic system.

Senior author Juan Piantino, MD, MCR, associate professor of pediatrics, Division of Neurology, School of Medicine and physician scientist, Neuroscience Division, Papé Family Research Institute, both in Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, said their study was the first to “definitively reveal” the network of perivascular spaces in human beings.

Five patients consented to receiving a gadolinium-based contrast agent through a lumbar drain that was already in place for tumor removal. The tracer was carried via the CSF into the brain and analyzed at different time points following their surgery. The images revealed that fluid moved along defined pathways rather than diffusing uniformly through brain tissue. This finding was documented with fluid attenuated inversion recovery, which showed the perivascular spaces brighten when perfused with the CSF.

Both Iliff and Piantino believe that better understanding the glymphatic system may shed light on the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may ultimately lead to drugs or other strategies to enhance healthy brain function.

Iliff explained that because there's no lymphatic circulation within the brain itself, extracellular proteins must be cleared by some alternative mechanism. “[The] CSF might be seen as the ‘sink' by which extracellular solutes are ‘washed away,' but it wasn't clear until relatively recently how these solutes move from the parenchyma to the CSF.”

His research used imaging techniques and fluorescent tracers in a mouse model to demonstrate the drainage pathways.

The glymphatic model suggests that arterial pulsations propel CSF through perivascular spaces formed by the vascular end feet of astrocytes. These spaces, although continuous with the subarachnoid space, also provide “distinct channels” for the rapid flow of CSF into the parenchyma. “The blood vessels in the brain serve as a kind of ‘scaffold' to organize and support the process,” Iliff said.

CSF flow is enabled through the expression of a water transporter called aquaporin-4 (AQP4). The CSF enters the brain, mixes with the interstitial fluid, and exits via perivenous spaces draining through meningeal and cervical lymphatic vessels or arachnoid granulations. The exiting fluid carries the waste.

Sleep is the most important time during which this “brain housekeeping” takes place, Iliff said. Impairment in this system or in normal sleep can raise the risk for accumulation of undesirable solutes (eg, amyloid-beta), resulting in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.

The term “glymphatic” was coined to join two ideas: “lymphatic” function which supports waste clearance and “glia” because it's the brain's glial cells that support these processes, Iliff recounted.

The term may be new, but there were published reports of a nascent concept. “We collected some of those threads and consolidated them into a single model and connected it to the biology of astrocytes and the biology of sleep” he said. The name ‘glymphatic system' was coined by Stephen Goldman and Maiken Nedergaard, but the neologism wasn't well received by all. “Some members of the field felt that by renaming this biology, we were claiming it as our own, and not adequately acknowledging prior research,” added Iliff.

The glymphatic system is connected to a downstream authentic lymphatic network that is associated with the meninges covering the brain as well as cranial nerves and large vessels that exit the skull. Although the anatomical and functional connections between these two networks “aren't completely understood,” a powerful body of evidence supports the existence of a glymphatic system and its relationship with the meningeal lymphatic network.

Iliff noted additional controversies, adding that “controversy can be a sign that we're on to something that matters — which is exciting.”

One concerns the presence of AQP4. Its role was demonstrated in multiple lines of research. For example, AQP4 gene deletion exacerbated glymphatic pathway dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and promoted the development of neurofibrillary pathology and neurodegeneration. The deletion of AQP4 was found to exacerbate amyloid-beta plaque accumulation in a mouse model of AD. But a 2017 paper called the glymphatic model into question, noting that not all AQP4 data could be replicated. “The discrepancy between findings may lie in differences in experimental methods, rather than being a flaw in understanding the role of APQ4,” Iliff commented.

Another study challenged the notion that a function of sleep is to actively clear metabolites and toxins from the brain. Those researchers used fluorescent tracers to measure clearance and movement of these molecules in the brains of mice and found that movement was actually independent of sleeping, waking, or anesthesia and that brain clearance was markedly reduced, not increased, during sleep and anesthesia.

Iliff believes the study is flawed. “The researchers are essentially quantifying the movement of solutes from one part of the brain to another part of the brain, which we would regard as ‘transport,' not ‘clearance.'” Additionally, the mice were anesthetized for an hour or so, but studied over many hours, after it had worn off. The authors concept of ‘clearance,' and ‘sleep,' “are different from what the rest of the field is doing,” he said.

There has been a long-standing clinical association between sleep disruption and dementing disorders such as AD. It was initially assumed that this is due to degeneration in brain regions that regulate sleep. But Iliff pointed to more recent data that suggests that sleep disruption might actually drive the development of the pathology that underlies diseases like AD.

He has reported that the glymphatic system clears amyloid-beta during sleep. More recent data found it clears tau and alpha-synuclein as well.

Conditions that are risk factors for neurodegeneration are also associated with impairment of glymphatic function in animal models, he said, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — a modifiable risk factor for AD and Parkinson's disease (PD).

A wide range of neurologic conditions are associated with impaired glymphatic function, including AD, PD, normal pressure hydrocephalus, stroke, cerebral small vessel disease, multiple sclerosis, TBI, migraine, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Additional diseases associated with alterations in the glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic system interplay include Huntington disease, frontotemporal dementia, the neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorders, and even brain tumors — particularly gliomas.

There are clinical associations between poor sleep, excessively long or short sleep durations or OSA and dementia. “That, on its own, would suggest paying attention to sleep problems, particularly in midlife, as a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia,” Iliff said.

Piantino agrees. He encourages his patients to “take steps to improve the quality of sleep now, including establishing a relaxing routine and minimizing screens in the bedroom before sleep.”

Other suggestions for keeping your glymphatic system healthy are to improve cardiovascular health since the system relies on arterial pulsatility and physical exercise, which has a positive impact on sleep architecture as well as cardiovascular benefits.

In the future, Iliff envisages being able to identify impairment early using a blood test, imaging scan, or device for example.

He is involved in research on a device described in a recent Nature paper. Healthy older adults wore a head-cap fitted with electrodes to continuously measure sleep-active changes in parenchymal resistance. In two crossover studies participants were subjected to one night of natural sleep and one night of wakefulness, separated by at least 2 weeks. Across both studies, it was found that parenchymal resistance remained constant or increased during periods of waking but declined steadily through periods of sleep.

“We found that the glymphatic system was functioning in deep and REM [rapid eye movement] sleep, and as the person was waking up,” Iliff said. “But the clearance function appeared to accelerate the longer the subject slept and then gradually slow down as the person was waking up.” This was the first time anyone was able to actually track glymphatic function in people at different levels of sleep during a single night.

Applied Cognition, the company that developed the device, is also developing drugs to enhance glymphatic clearance of amyloid and tau in human beings, according to Iliff.

He looks forward to ongoing “exciting” developments, which will pave the way for new therapeutic approaches to the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Iliff reported receiving research funding from the National Institutes of Health, US Department of Defense, US Department of Veteran's Affairs, and the Leducq Foundation. He reported serving as the chair for the Scientific Advisory Board for the company Applied Cognition, from which he received compensation and in which he holds equity. Piantino reported receiving research funding from the National Institutes of Health; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and the Papé Family Foundation.

A breakthrough discovery reveals how the SLC45A4 gene fine-tunes polyamine transport in sensory neurons, reshaping our understanding of pain and opening new paths for targeted therapies.

In a recent study published in the journal Nature, an international team of researchers showed that solute carrier family 45 member 4 (SLC45A4) is a pain gene that encodes a neuronal polyamine transporter.

Chronic pain affects one in five adults and has an adverse effect on the quality of life. Unfortunately, available treatments are often inadequate, with poor tolerability and efficacy. Polyamines, such as spermidine, spermine, and putrescine, are regulatory metabolites reported to contribute to chronic pain. They play crucial roles in nucleic acid synthesis and stability, cell signaling, and growth.

Polyamines are implicated in neurological disorders, such as stroke and epilepsy. They can regulate neuronal excitability through ion channel interactions and have been linked to pain. Polyamines exhibit altered levels in pain states in humans and modulate pain behavior in animal models. Nevertheless, the systems influencing polyamine transport in the nervous system remain unclear.

In the present study, researchers showed that SLC45A4 encodes a neuronal membrane polyamine transporter genetically linked to human chronic pain. First, they performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the enhanced pain phenotyping questionnaire data from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB).

The team identified 29 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) at a genome-wide significance level associated with pain intensity. These included two independent loci with lead SNVs: rs3905668 near the MSL complex subunit 2 (MSL2) gene and rs10625280 (previously misstated as rs1062580) that maps to the SLC45A4 gene. This association was replicated in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and FinnGen cohorts. rs10625280 was located within an SLC45A4 intron, with a subset of SNVs exhibiting linkage disequilibrium. One of these, a missense variant, rs3739238, showed significant associations with pain intensity and broader health traits like osteoarthritis and immune dysfunction in phenome-wide analyses.

SLC45A4 has been proposed as a proton-coupled sucrose transporter based on homology to the Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose transporter, but recent studies report conflicting functions. As such, the researchers performed a correlation analysis between expression and metabolomics datasets to identify possible substrates. SLC45A4 expression in over 1,000 cell lines was positively correlated with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. Cryo-EM structural analysis revealed a unique autoinhibitory "plug domain" essential for polyamine recognition and transport regulation.

Next, the team analyzed substrates involved in GABA synthesis via the arginine-ornithine-putrescine pathway. They found a marked reduction in thermal stability of SLC45A4 in the presence of biogenic amines, with spermidine and spermine inducing the most significant response. Cell-based assays confirmed that SLC45A4 is a broad-specificity polyamine transporter with differential affinity for substrates (highest for putrescine and cadaverine). Next, the team characterized the expression of SLC45A4 in neural tissues.

Published mouse RNA-sequencing datasets indicate predominant Slc45a4 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed enriched expression of Slc45a4 in the DRG across the sensory neuraxis. Published human data also indicate SLC45A4 expression in sensory neurons. Further, Slc45a4-/- knockout (KO) mice were generated to evaluate the links between pain perception and SLC45A4 function. These mice exhibited a transient "salt and pepper" coat color defect linked to disrupted melanoblast differentiation and spermidine's established role in melanin production, supporting spermidine's role in melanin production.

All polyamines were abundant in the spinal cord, DRG, and brain of wild-type mice. However, Slc45a4 loss increased DRG putrescine and reduced spinal spermidine levels. While all polyamines were detected in the plasma of wild-type and KO mice, KO mice had elevated Spd levels. Next, the team performed behavioral testing at 10 weeks of age when coat color had normalized. There were no deficits in open-field behavior tests of exploration and locomotion.

However, in the rotarod task, KO mice had a higher maximum final speed and latency to fall from the rotarod than wild-type mice, indicating increased motor endurance that may be associated with reduced ventral horn GABAergic inhibition. Moreover, KO mice had a higher latency to respond to being placed on a hot plate than wild-type mice, suggesting hyposensitivity. However, no differences were observed in the reflex withdrawal latency to dry ice. Since polyamines are involved in GABA synthesis, the team investigated whether GABA levels were altered in KO mice.

While brain GABA levels were normal in KO mice, spinal GABA levels were significantly reduced. Further analyses showed that GABA levels were significantly lower only in the ventral horn of KO mice. A patch-clamp analysis of sensory neurons was performed to explore peripheral pain modulation mechanisms, focusing on nociceptors that bind to isolectin B4 (IB4) (predominantly non-peptidergic) and those that do not bind to IB4 (predominantly peptidergic).

While IB4+ nociceptors were normal in KO mice, the suprathreshold excitability of IB4⁻ nociceptors and C-polymodal nociceptors in response to dynamic and static current injections was selectively reduced in KO mice. Moreover, C-mechano-heat-nociceptors, also called C-polymodal nociceptors, in KO mice showed selective and marked hypoexcitability in response to suprathreshold mechanical and heat stimuli. Mechanical pain pathways remained intact, indicating modality-specific effects.

The findings demonstrate that SLC45A4 encodes a neuronal membrane polyamine transporter with genetic associations to human pain. It is expressed in sensory neurons, and its ablation alters polyamine homeostasis, pain perception, and thermal coding in mice. Mechanical pain responses following SLC45A4 KO remained intact, likely due to preserved functions of other mechanoreceptor populations. Overall, SLC45A4 may be a potential molecular target for modulating thermal and chemical pain perception while preserving mechanical sensitivity.

Researchers found that Americans who drank 100% fruit juice had healthier diets, higher nutrient scores, and stayed within guideline limits, suggesting juice may help bridge nutritional gaps without pushing out whole fruit.



Study: Consumption of 100% Juice and Diluted 100% Juice Is Associated with Better Compliance with Dietary Guidelines for Americans: Analyses of NHANES 2017–2023. Image Credit: Elenia Photo  / Shutterstock

In a recent article in the journal Nutrients, researchers analyzed patterns of pure and diluted juice consumption in the United States across different groups to assess its relationship with diet quality. Their findings show most Americans consume well below the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) limits on juice intake. However, juice consumption was linked to better diet quality, including higher intake of fruit, whole grains, vitamin C, potassium, and calcium, and lower intake of added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat.

Diluted 100% juice barely registered in diets: Consumption was so minimal it was termed "practically nonexistent," though slightly higher-income children were more likely to drink it.

The DGA recommendations for 2020–2025 advise limiting 100% fruit juice. Excessive intake may add unnecessary calories. Recommendations vary by age, from ½ cup daily for children aged 2–3 years to 1.25 cups for adult men. At least half of fruit intake should come from whole fruit to provide enough fiber.

Despite these guidelines, national surveys show that 100% juice consumption in the U.S. is low. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), which add calories without nutritional benefits, are consumed in much larger amounts, especially by children and young adults. Paradoxically, concerns about childhood obesity have been more strongly linked to 100% juice rather than SSB consumption, even though SSBs are consumed far more widely. While trends in SSB intake have been well studied, fewer U.S. studies have examined recent patterns of 100% juice or diluted juice intake.

Orange and apple juice remain the main sources of fruit juice, and past research has shown that juices can provide bioactive compounds and contribute positively to diet quality. Beverage patterns centered on juice and milk, for instance, were associated with healthier diets compared to SSB-heavy patterns.

Water wasn't just popular, it dominated: Tap and bottled water made up roughly 40% of all beverages consumed across the US population, far outpacing milk, SSBs, and juice combined..

Researchers used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2020 and 2021–2023 cycles to examine how juice intake varies by demographic and socioeconomic factors, and whether juice consumption is linked to better diet quality and reduced nutritional disparities, comparing intake to pediatric and DGA recommendations.

Their dataset included 4,086 children aged between 5 and 19, and 10,925 adults. NHANES collects dietary intake using two 24-hour recalls with a multi-pass method, where trained interviewers record all foods and beverages consumed, including amounts and eating occasions. The Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) converted reported foods into standardized cup-equivalents for consistency with DGA food groups.

Participants were stratified by age, sex, ethnicity/race, and income-to-poverty ratio (IPR), which reflects household income relative to poverty thresholds. Beverage intake was grouped into six categories: low-calorie drinks, SSBs, 100% juice, diluted juice (practically nonexistent in consumption, without added sugar), water, and milk.

Two measures of dietary quality were used: the Healthy Eating Index 2020, a 100-point scale assessing adherence to the DGA, and the Nutrient Rich Food Index, which scores diets based on nine nutrients to encourage and three to limit (sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar).

Analyses estimated mean intakes, percentiles, and demographic differences using chi-square tests and generalized linear models, with adjustments for energy intake and survey weights. Compliance with DGA juice recommendations was also assessed by categorizing individuals' daily juice intake. Whole fruit and juice consumption ratios were calculated to evaluate whether juice was displacing whole fruit.

Mexican American children drank the most water and milk: This group stood out for higher water and milk intake compared to others, while Non-Hispanic Black children consumed the least water overall.

The analysis showed that only about one-quarter of participants consumed any 100% fruit juice (including diluted versions) over two recall days. Consumption was more common among younger children, older adults, lower-income groups, and specific ethnic/racial minorities, particularly Mexican American and non-Hispanic Black individuals.

Water was by far the most consumed beverage, followed by milk, SSBs, with juice contributing relatively little overall. Children in lower-income households tended to drink more 100% juice and less whole fruit compared with higher-income children, though diluted juice intake was slightly higher in wealthier groups.

Compliance with DGA limits was widespread: nearly 95% of participants consumed under 1 cup/day, and 88% consumed under ½ cup/day. Only a small fraction of young children exceeded age-specific recommendations. Importantly, juice intake did not appear to displace whole fruit at the population level. However, the average juice-to-whole fruit ratio was 0.4, within DGA guidance, and higher in lower-income groups and young children.

Consumers of 100% juice had significantly higher dietary quality scores. Both Healthy Eating Index and Nutrient Rich Food Index scores were greater among juice drinkers, reflecting higher intakes of fruit, whole grains, vitamin C, potassium, and calcium, and lower intakes of added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat. Vegetable intake differences were less consistent, and non-consumers scored slightly higher for dairy.

This study highlights that 100% fruit juice consumption in the U.S. is generally low and well within DGA limits, with only a small minority exceeding recommended amounts. Notably, juice consumption was linked with higher-quality diets overall, indicating that it may substitute for less nutritious beverages such as SSBs rather than displacing whole fruit.

Strengths include nationally representative data and robust measures of dietary quality; however, limitations include reliance on self-reported 24-hour recalls, potential misreporting among children, and the cross-sectional design, which precludes causal inference.

In conclusion, while the DGA emphasizes limiting juice, these findings suggest that modest juice consumption supports diet quality and may help reduce disparities in fruit intake. The authors stress that the economic cost of meeting DGA fruit recommendations is a major barrier and argue that affordability and accessibility of whole fruit should be central in future guidelines.

Linked with moves to MLS and Serie A via LAFC and Parma, U.S. Men's National Team attacker Gio Reyna's new club ultimately proved closer to home, leaving Borussia Dortmund for fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach — a move team management admitted involves an element of “risk.”

The 22-year-old's move to Monchengladbach was announced on Saturday as he signed a three-year deal to reunite him with USMNT teammate and former New York City FC academy co-star Joe Scally.

Following Reyna's transfer, Monchengladbach's sporting director Roland Virkus admitted that the move was one “where we normally have no chance — no chance. But he wants to make a fresh start with us,” as per Goal.

“That's why we should be proud that the boy has chosen Borussia. [He can] play as a hanging striker, on the wing, at number 10, or directly behind a central striker,” he added.

Virkus said that when it comes to where Reyna could line up under head coach Gerardo Seoane, who has been in the role since 2023, he explained, “It's important for competition that you're not tied to one position. He puts pressure on all the forward positions – but he doesn't actually block anyone.

“There's always a bit of residual risk. But we're getting an outstanding young player, something we wouldn't get under normal circumstances.”

This isn't the first time the term “risk” has been associated with Reyna, whose domestic career has faltered in recent years after a remarkable start with Dortmund. USMNT legend Alexi Lalas recently suggested on his 'State of the Union' podcast that, “Anybody signing Gio Reyna, given what has happened and how far his stock has fallen, there's inherent risk in that.

“It wouldn't be the first time that a player has had multiple years of down problems, whatever you want to call them, and resurrects his or her career by going some place else. But, you have to kick those tires and worry that this is not a temporary type of event or something that this player can't grow out of."

At his peak, Reyna has the ability to be a top-tier talent, having set numerous records early during his Dortmund career after making his debut at just 17. However, injuries, off-the-field concerns, and falling out of favor under multiple coaches at Dortmund have ultimately plagued his career in recent years, limiting him to just 627 minutes across all competitions last season.

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, rapidly approaching, it is perhaps more important than ever that Reyna finds regular minutes if he's to earn a spot on Mauricio Pochettino's roster.

Following confirmation of his move to Monchengladbach, Reyna posted an emotional farewell message to Dortmund on Instagram, reading, “I arrived at BVB as a 16-year-old kid, and over the past six years I've grown into the person and player I am today. Every time I stepped onto the pitch in black and yellow, I gave everything I had for this club.

“I'll carry so many unforgettable memories with me, from my Bundesliga debut to lifting the DFB-Pokal, and all the moments in between. Dortmund has shaped me in ways I'll never forget, both on and off the field.

“To the staff, my teammates, and above all, the incredible fans: Thank you. Your support through every high and low has meant the world to me.

“Now it's time to close this chapter and start a new one, but BVB will always have a special place in my heart. Thank you, @bvb09! Heja BVB.”

Monchengladbach's season got off to a slow start on Sunday, drawing 0-0 with Hamburger SV at home ahead of their first away game of the campaign on Saturday at VfB Stuttgart. Unfortunately for Reyna and Co., they won't be taking part in any European competitions in the coming months, having finished 10th last season.

It was another exciting week for the U.S. Men's National Team player pool as the MLS season rolls on closer to the playoffs and the European leagues pick up speed.

Several USMNT players were in the mix for their respective club teams. Let's rewind the best moments from last week:

Josh Sargent has appeared in four matches since the 2025-26 season for Norwich City, and he's scored in all four. His most recent goal came in the 85th minute on an impressive high-arching shot that sailed above the goalkeeper's head. It cut Norwich's two-goal deficit in half, but ultimately the Canaries fell to Middlesbrough FC as City played with 10 after a red card was handed out.

Three of Sargent's four goals came in EFL Championship matches and one in the EFL Cup. Sargent will have another chance to add to his season total when Norwich plays in the second round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday.

Coventry City tallied an impressive 7-1 win over QPR, and Haji Wright scored in the 12th and 37th minutes to secure the brace.

The performance brings Wright's total to three goals in two starts early in the season. He recorded his first goal of the season in Coventry's win over Derby County on a penalty kick. Wright left USMNT camp during the Concacaf Gold Cup run to tend to an Achilles injury; however, now he appears healthy and making a good impression with his club early in the season.

Brian White has been one of the most prolific scorers in MLS this season and leads the Vancouver Whitecaps in scoring. So when the Whitecaps were awarded the penalty, White stepped up to the spot and answered the call. It was White's 14th goal of the season, tied for seventh in the Golden Boot race.

White scored the penalty in stoppage time just before the half to equalize the game at 1-1. The Whitecaps finished off St. Louis CITY 3-2 with another penalty kick, this time from German legend Thomas Müller, who recently joined MLS from FC Bayern Munich.

Forwards Ricardo Pepi, Folarin Balogun and defender Antonee Robinson have yet to play for the USMNT in 2025 because of injury, but each returned to their clubs this weekend.

Pepi made his Eredivisie debut this season for PSV in a 4-2 victory against FC Groningen, subbing on late in the 86th minute. He also appeared in the Dutch Super Cup and a club friendly a few weeks prior. The friendly in late July marked his first minutes on the field since January as he dealt with a meniscus injury.

Balogun played all 90 minutes in AS Monaco's 1-0 loss to LOSC on Sunday. The striker was initially on the USMNT roster this summer for the June friendlies but suffered an ankle injury just before camp. Before that, Balogun was rehabbing from a dislocated shoulder, which kept him away from National Team training.

Robinson subbed on in the 62nd minute in Fulham's 1-1 draw versus Manchester United. He underwent knee surgery in May, which kept him from contention of making the National Team roster this summer and the beginning of the EPL season.

It was a busy weekend in the NWSL for those in the U.S. Women's National Team talent pool. Several players scored in Week 19 with six weeks left in the regular season. 

The 2025-26 Concacaf Champions W Cup was back with group stage play, and forward Trinity Rodman scored a goal in the Washington Spirit's impressive 7-0 win over the El Salvador club Alianza Women FC, the Spirit's first match on international soil.

Let's rewind through the biggest USWNT moments over the last week: 

After the Washington Spirit's victory in the Concacaf Champions W Cup, where Rodman scored off the bench, the club met Bay FC in Matchday 19 and made history.

The match was played at Oracle Park, and the more than 40,000 fans in attendance go down in history as the largest stand-alone women's professional league event in the United States.

Rodman and midfielder Croix Bethune both started, and Bethune scored her first goal of the season in the 39th minute to give the Spirit a 2-0 lead. Bay FC made a valiant comeback effort, but Washington came out with the 3-2 victory to keep its No. 2 spot in the NWSL standings. 

Alyssa Thompson scored the game-winner in Angel City FC's 1-0 victory over the Orlando Pride.

Thompson broke the deadlock in the 86th minute with a right-footed beauty from the left side after she crossed up a Pride defender to create space. Orlando wouldn't find the last-minute equalizer, giving Angel City its fifth win of the season to stay in playoff contention.

It was the forward's sixth goal of the season. She is second in scoring for Angel City behind Riley Tiernan with seven. 

Emma Sears has also been a forward on fire this season for Racing Louisville FC. Sears recorded her seventh goal of the season in Louisville's 1-0 win against the San Diego Wave.

Sears recorded the lone goal of the match in the 59th minute off an assist from Ella Hase. Sears caught a cross at the right side of the box and launched a right-footed shot to the far post. She gave Louisville the win and three points, as Racing sits in seventh place in the league, vying for a higher position in the NWSL standings.

In the last few weeks, Yazmeen Ryan has made some show-stopping moves for the Houston Dash. First, her impressive attack led to a rebound goal against the North Carolina Courage. Now, she scored her second goal in exciting fashion.

Ryan picked off a back pass intended for Seattle Reign's goalkeeper and scored with Seattle's defense unprepared for the attack. It was the first goal of the match in the 47th minute. Seattle would later find the equalizer in the 65th minute to finish the game in a 1-1 draw.

It was Ryan's second goal of the season as the Dash continued its fight to stay in playoff contention on the outside looking in. Houston sits in 11th place, but it's a tight race with the Dash three points behind spot No. 8.

United States Men's National Team and Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie was on the receiving end of "discriminatory racist remarks" following the Italian club's matchup against  Serie A opponent Parma ... with the org. condemning the actions in a strong statement.

Juventus addressed the situation after Sunday's match ... saying the hateful words came from an individual sitting in the away section while McKennie was "training on the field with his teammates who had not taken part in the game."

Questa sera, al termine della partita contro il Parma, Weston Mckennie è stato oggetto di espressioni discriminatorie di natura razzista, da parte di alcune persone presenti nel settore ospiti, mentre si allenava in campo con i compagni che non avevano preso parte alla gara.La…

"Juventus strongly condemns this episode and every manifestation of racism and will ensure the utmost collaboration with the sports justice authorities to identify those responsible."

It's unclear what was said to McKennie -- who joined the squad back in 2020 -- but he has yet to speak on the matter himself.

The opposing club -- Parma Calcio -- released its own statement Monday following the incident ... also calling the individual's actions inexcusable.

"Racial intolerance, or any other type of abusive behaviour, is NEVER tolerated or acceptable and must therefore be addressed, fought, and condemned at all times."

Unfortunately, this only adds to the growing list of racial incidents that have occurred in the sport.

During a match in 2023, Inter Milan's Romelu Lukaku faced racist chants from Juventus fans.

In another 2023 incident, McKennie and other Juventus members had discriminatory chants directed at them during a match against Fiorentina -- resulting in a partial stadium one-match ban.

In 2024, U.S. Soccer stood up for its players after some individuals sent them racist messages following their 2-1 loss to Panama.

Just last week, FIFA President Gianni Infantino condemned two incidents of alleged racist abuse during German Cup games, calling it "unacceptable."

"Football has no place for racism or any form of discrimination."

Russian President Vladimir Putin may be attending next year's World Cup as games are played in three nations leading up to the championship game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, according to President Trump.

Trump floated the possibility of Putin showing up during the FIFA 2026 World Cup tournament — hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico — while meeting Friday with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

The president did not say if Putin would attend the championship game in New Jersey or one of the earlier games in the U.S., Canada or Mexico.

During the meeting, Trump displayed a photo of himself with Putin from their recent summit in Alaska.

Then Trump referenced the World Cup and said he believes Putin “will be coming, depending on what happens,” according to video of the White House meeting.

Trump did not offer any guarantees. He followed up by saying Putin “may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens.”

MetLife Stadium is scheduled to host eight games during the tournament, including the final game on July 19.

A total of 48 teams will be participating, up from 32 four years ago.

Bayern Munich have agreed personal terms with Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson as the Bundesliga champions look to bolster their attack with a new forward. Bayern are eyeing a loan move for the Senegalese forward and will now initiate transfer talks with the Blues. Jackson has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer after falling down the pecking order under Enzo Maresca.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup may still be 10 months away, but the European season could not have started any better for Tajon Buchanan and Jonathan David, likely to be two of Canada's key players at the tournament. 

Both completed transfers this summer, with Buchanan securing a permanent deal with La Liga's Villarreal after struggling for playing time with Inter Milan, while David made his long-awaited move to a European giant—Juventus—after five seasons with Lille. 

In their first starts of the season, they put down performances that will go down in the history of Canadian and North American players in Europe.

For Buchanan, it was a hat trick for Villarreal in a 5–0 win over Girona, and for David, the first goal of Juventus's season in a 2–0 victory over Palma. 

“There's no question this is the best player pool in the history of the Canadian national team,” Canada manager Jesse Marsch told TSN ahead of their debuts. “They're all playing at big clubs, they're all being challenged in big ways, which I think is a big part in developing as a person and as a player …being put in an environment that is very, very challenging and where the levels are very, very high.”

Buchanan had already provided some standout moments for Villarreal as a loan player at the tail end of the 2024–25 season. Still, his comeback from injury and limited minutes hit their peak against Girona. 

Playing as an outright left winger, he caressed the ball with slick dribbling in the 13th minute, weaving past two defenders before smashing a shot in from a sharp angle, scoring two more goals before the 30th minute. 

Over the last 18 months, the 26-year-old went from fighting for playing time at Inter to breaking his leg at the 2024 Copa América and managing a lengthy rehab. Now, he's returned to top form, with eight goals and an assist in his last 10 games for club and country. 

In addition to becoming just the second Canadian to score a hat trick in Europe's top five leagues—the other being David—he made 22 of 26 passes, completed five dribbles and created four chances. 

“The first goal was probably my favorite ... I'm super happy with the game for everyone and obviously my first hat trick,” Buchanan said after the match. “Everyone is working hard and playing their roles, and it's showing on the field, so we just have to keep pushing every day and keep performing, and we're in a really good spot right now.” 

While other Canadians, such as Alphonso Davies at FC Bayern Munich, have had standout moments, few match the level that Buchanan hit on Sunday night, with Villarreal now sitting atop La Liga after two matches. 

“It's only two games and the schedule means we played them both at home,” Villarreal manager Marcelino García Toral said. “This is a process. I am proud and grateful to the players; it's been a real pleasure. But this is ephemeral. We will have a glass of wine with the family and keep working.”

Few situations in soccer come with as much pressure as being a new marquee striker signing at a major club. Yet, that was no issue for David, nicknamed “The Iceman,” who made his presence known in his Serie A debut. 

While Juventus struggled to settle into the match in their visit to Parma, David adjusted to exploit pockets of space. He hung around the back post, before slipping off his defender to finish a cross from Kenan Yıldız in the second half.

With the goal, he became the second Canadian to score in Serie A, after Buchanan became the first with Inter. 

“It's everything I hoped for," said David after the match. “It was the first game of the season, and the fans brought an amazing atmosphere, and you could feel them pushing us forward.

“I'm happy to score in my first game, but the most important thing is the three points.”

Although the goal will go down as his first official marker for Juventus, it was the second time he hit the back of the net, after netting a bicycle-kick finish in their final preseason match against Atalanta.

The pressure will only mount now for David, too, as he hopes to lead Juventus to their first Scudetto title since 2019–20, while also establishing himself as the outright striker option ahead of Dušan Vlahović, who scored off the bench against Parma.

“The target is to help the team as much as I can,” David said. “If it's by scoring goals, by getting assists, running back, defending, I will do everything.”

It may be early, but the weekend marked a good start to the European season for Canada's marquee talents in Europe, as the countdown to the FIFA World Cup opener on home soil on June 12 continues.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Aug. 25, 2025) — The Orlando Pride (8-4-4, 28 points) today announced that midfielder Morgan Gautrat has been loaned to Newcastle United W.F.C for the remainder of the 2025 season. The NWSL veteran also has announced her retirement from NWSL play.

“We want to thank Morgan for her incredible contributions to our club and the NWSL. Her professionalism, leadership, and dedication have made a lasting impact on our organization and the league as a whole,” said Haley Carter, Vice President and Sporting Director of Orlando Pride. “We understand and fully support Morgan's decision as she moves into this next chapter. While we're sad to see her go, we respect her choice to pursue opportunities that align with her personal goals and wish her and her family nothing but success in their future endeavors. Morgan will always be part of our family, and we're grateful for everything she's brought to our club.”

Gautrat, 32, joined the Pride via trade from the Kansas City Current ahead of the 2024 season. During her time with the Club, the 11-year NWSL veteran has appeared in 34 matches and earned one assist for Orlando, helping the team complete the double during the 2024 season as the Pride won both the NWSL Shield and the NWSL Championship.

Prior to playing for Orlando, Gautrat had stints with the Kansas City Current, Chicago Red Stars and the Houston Dash. While in Chicago, the midfielder helped the Red Stars to four-straight playoff appearances, appearing in 62 matches and scoring six goals across all competitions. In 2018, Gautrat spent time overseas playing for French club Olympique Lyonnes where she appeared in four matches and recorded one goal and one assist.

The St. Simons Island, Ga., native originally entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NWSL Draft by the Houston Dash. During her rookie season, she appeared in 10 matches but spent a large part of the season with the U.S. Women's National Team at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. After her rookie campaign, Gautrat would go on to log over 1,000 minutes for the Dash while also being part of the USWNT's participation in the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics.

Overall with the USWNT, Gautrat has made 88 appearances and tallied eight goals and 11 assists since making her senior team debut on June 15, 2013. She won two FIFA Women's World Cups in both 2015 and 2019 and was the youngest member of the 2015 winning squad.

With the Gold Cup and summer competition complete, GOAL projects the USMNT roster for September friendlies

The summer is just about over and, and that means another U.S. men's national team camp is on the way - the first of three to close 2025 as the team takes part in a series of vital friendlies.

Up first are two September matches, with the USMNT taking on South Korea and Japan to begin this fall slate. The squad for those matches is set to be announced this week, as Mauricio Pochettino looks to build off this summer's Gold Cup by reintroducing a series of players that weren't involved at the tournament, for one reason or another.

What will that squad look like? How much will Pochettino lean on Gold Cup veterans compared to more familiar counterparts? Which newcomers are in line for a look? GOAL takes a look.

Jens Castrop, who played for birthplace Germany at youth level, joins Son Heung-min, Lee Kang-in in a 22-man squad for games against Mexico, US

South Korea coach Hong Myung-bo on Monday called up former German youth international Jens Castrop for next month's friendlies against World Cup co-hosts the United States and Mexico – the first time a foreign-born, mixed-heritage player has been included in the men's national squad.

Hong named the Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder in his 26-man squad as the Koreans begin preparations for next year's World Cup.

The 22-year-old Castrop, who was born to a German father and a South Korean mother, was picked along with captain Son Heung-min – who joined Los Angeles FC earlier this month after a decade in the English Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur – and Paris St Germain's Champions League winner Lee Kang-in.

Castrop, who was born in Dusseldorf and played for Germany from Under-16 to Under-21 level, asked Fifa to switch his international allegiance to South Korea, and the change was signed off by the sport's world governing body two weeks ago.

He played for Koln and Nurnberg before joining Mönchengladbach in February, making his debut appearance in the top tier of German football on Sunday as a substitute in a 0-0 draw against Hamburg.

“Although Castrop is young, he is a player who has consistently grown while gaining experience in the Bundesliga,” Hong said. “Above all, I highly value the strong will and sense of responsibility he has shown to join our national team.

Women's Soccer

Morgan Gautrat has won two World Cups with the United States. She was a pivotal member of the Orlando Pride team that lifted the 2024 NWSL Shield last November — the first trophy in the club's history — and then became league champions three weeks later. At 32, the midfielder has seen and done it all, albeit from a lofty vantage point. Since 2015, when she joined that league's Houston Dash as the number one pick in its college draft, she has played at the top.

Which makes it all the more remarkable that, on a cool summer's evening in the north-east of England, Gautrat is walking down the players' tunnel at St James' Park, the home of Newcastle United.

The walls are stencilled with black and white images of fans and players and the words “United” and “Ready”. “You imagine yourself on game day, walking out,” she says, “what you'll feel and expect.”

She steps out, bends down and touches the grass. “This is like a footballer's dream,” she says. “This is a special stadium.”

In terms of the men's team, their history, their ground and their prominence in the Premier League, Newcastle's stature is obvious. They, too, are newly minted winners — their victory over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final last season earned them a first piece of domestic silverware for 70 years — yet their women's side are in the second tier of the Women's Super League (WSL).

In that context, Gautrat's presence — she has signed on loan from Orlando until the end of December, a short initial spell which she “definitely, definitely,” hopes to extend — is vaguely astonishing. A double world-champion pulling on Newcastle's shirt is a moment that can only provoke reflection.

As recently as 2023, Newcastle were on the fourth rung of the ladder in English women's football and the players were juggling their careers as athletes with full-time jobs and training at night. Not too long before that, Becky Langley, the manager, would be eating her evening meal at 11pm after training and washing the team's kit herself. The players paid to play under her.

Thankful for this one. WE DID IT. World Cup Champions!!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/hCC1ehoxDW

— Morgan Brian Gautrat (@moeebrian) July 6, 2015



Since Newcastle's takeover in October 2021 — the club are now majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund — that outlook has been transformed. Flush with investment, two consecutive promotions took them into second-tier WSL 2, where they finished fifth in an 11-team competition in their debut campaign at that level back in May. They are now fully professional. Gautrat's arrival takes their number of close-season signings to six, with the others including Jordan Nobbs, who has been capped 71 times by England.

To put it bluntly, Newcastle want what Gautrat has had. The big idea is that she helps them to get there — next stop, the WSL itself — which is what persuaded Ben Maitland, Newcastle's head of recruitment and analysis, to pick up the phone in the first place.

“It's a really amazing project that's going on here,” Gautrat says, when asked about her motivation for the move. “When Ben talked to my agent and me and tried to sell me on it, it just seemed like the club is extremely ambitious. And at this point in my career, I'm really excited to join something like this, to help lead a team and make history.

“I've always wanted to play overseas and experience a different footballing culture and immerse myself in something like Newcastle. I've heard nothing but amazing things about the city, the fans and just the culture of it all. A lot of people follow the Premier League at home and know about Newcastle and how much people love this team.

“It's an exciting time to be part of this, and then I had a good conversation with Becky, and it seems like everyone is headed in the right direction. And for me, it was just a great opportunity and perfect timing.”

That notion of timing is interesting. Orlando, who are challenging again as the NWSL season enters its second half, have just signed Lizbeth Ovalle from Mexican side Tigres for a women's football world-record fee of $1.5million (£1.1m). Gautrat is far from an afterthought there. She has explained her thought process about joining Newcastle, but why leave a club like that at a time like this?

“It's a good question,” she says. “I had an option year in my contract, and they have to tell you ahead of time if they're planning on exercising that. And, obviously, there's salary-cap rules. Once they tell me that (they're not exercising), I'm a free agent, so I can look around the world and the market and within the league and see what other opportunities are out there. This one caught my eye, just because of the project.

“I've always loved joining places that I could help make better and where I could leave a lasting impact, and this is going to be no different, hopefully. I've done it all in the NWSL. I've done a lot in my career in America, I had a short stint playing in France (with Lyon seven years ago), and I didn't have a great experience, so I've always kind of wanted to rewrite that chapter and enjoy something different.

“I've played in the NWSL for 11 seasons now and I would say that my technical ability and skill set weren't always utilised, because it's so athletic and transitional (as a league). I've always wanted to come to a place like here and try and experience a different style of play and enjoy playing football.”

What does she mean by that?

“When I watch European players, they all have this base technical ability and technical skill,” Gautrat says. “I feel like most European players watch soccer from a very young age and they're immersed in it from the beginning of their lives. In America, it's just different. People don't watch the game very often, and there's not a ton of teams with a rich culture in the history of football. That impacts the development of players.

“What's made us successful for so long on the women's side is our athleticism and our physical ability. And I think sometimes we rely on that too much, and the technical side gets lost. I would say that for 70 per cent of the players in the United States, the way that they're developed from a young age is more about winning than development. It's more about run and gun and using your athleticism. They forget to teach the technical side of the game.”

How this will translate to WSL 2 is unclear.

“I'm wondering too!” Gautrat says. “Time will tell, I guess.”

Playing at this level will provide a different kind of challenge, but, as she says, “I'm in a different place in my career where I'm excited to be a leader and help the younger players.

“Winning the NSWL and the Shield and having success gives you that experience of big games and how to get the best out of your team-mates, closing out games, learning how to manage games within the game. I think I can really help. And then it's trying to raise the standards, to make players see that this is the level we need to be at to achieve what we want to achieve and get to where we want to be at the end of the year.”

Which is promotion, right?

“Correct,” she says. No ifs, no caveats.

Gautrat has made 88 appearances for the United States, most recently in 2022. Is dropping down a level a tacit acknowledgment that this part of her career is now over?

“Never say never, but I had a really good, long stint with the national team and did a lot of the travelling and the grind and the double duty,” she says. “That took a mental, physical and emotional toll on me for a long time.

“It would have to be special and the right moment if I were ever to go back and entertain that, but obviously I would love to play for my country. I'm also at the point where I like to focus on my club. You know, if that opportunity came, then great, and we would kind of see where we were.”

She has not spoken to Emma Hayes, the English head coach who has been in charge of the USWNT for the past year.

Playing abroad has always appealed but, as mentioned above, her previous taste of it was not ideal. “When you're drafted at number one (from college), you go to the worst team (from the previous season) and so, for my development, being at Houston Dash was hard,” she says. “I was trying to improve in a team that wasn't doing so great and was constantly in flux with the coach and all that, so it wasn't a great situation.

“Lyon were the best team in the world at that time. They had some of the best players. They had a training environment and style of play that suited me better than playing in the NWSL, so when they got in touch with my agent I wanted to experience all that. The training was amazing, but there were a lot of things, on and off the field, that didn't go well.

“My husband (Fabrice Gautrat, who has been the Dash's head coach since January) is half-French and moved over there with me and they had kind of said they'd help find him a job, which they didn't really do. There were politics going on that I got caught in the middle of and leading into the 2019 World Cup, I needed to be playing consistently. So we moved back, to Chicago Red Stars, where I knew I would play all the time.”

Naturally, she hopes Newcastle will be different.

“It helps that we speak English,” she says, although this may prove to be a gross underestimation of the Geordie accent. She is looking forward to exploring. “Flying in here, I could see the coast and I love the water — I grew up on the water (her hometown is on St Simons Island in the southern state of Georgia), so that's very exciting,” she says.

“I'm not looking forward to the cold quite so much. Soccer-wise, it will be wonderful, because in (the Florida heat and humidity of) Orlando I'm like: ‘I can't breathe, I can't run, I'm exhausted'. But I got off the plane today and oh my gosh, ‘Is this summer? I'm in trouble'.”

Gautrat's new team will play most of their home games across the river Tyne from Newcastle itself in Gateshead, but the temperature will not be an issue in November, when they host Sunderland, their local rivals, at St James'. It is always a feisty, white-hot occasion. For last season's corresponding fixture, a crowd of 38,502 smashed the record attendance for a WSL 2 match, and for this one, Newcastle are pushing for a 52,000 sell-out.

Back on the pitch, Gautrat glances around. “That would be sick,” she says, and she means it in a good way. “That would be so cool. Because I imagine those matches are pretty rowdy.”

A Tyne-Wear derby will be another voyage of discovery for her, but Gautrat knows all about the big games — the biggest games.

A potentially transformational signing at a club hellbent on transforming themselves into winners, Gautrat now has to make those games the norm for Newcastle.

Morgan Gautrat, the two-time World Cup winner with the United States, has joined Newcastle United Women on loan from Orlando Pride.

The 32-year-old midfielder has signed a short-term deal with the Women's Super League 2 club after being told by the Pride that they would not be exercising her contract option for 2026.

Gautrat's loan at Newcastle, who are targeting promotion to the top-flight Women's Super League this season, is due to end in December, but in an exclusive interview with The Athletic, she said she “definitely, definitely” hopes to extend her stay in the north east of England.

Gautrat was a member of the Pride squad which won the National Women's Soccer League Championship and the Shield last year, the first major trophies in the club's history. She has also been playing regularly for the team – which recently signed Lizbeth Ovalle, the Mexico international, for a word record fee of $1.5 million – this season.

“It seems like (Newcastle) is extremely ambitious,” Gautrat told The Athletic. “And at this point in my career, I'm really excited to join something like this to help lead a team and make history.”

Gautrat, who has made 88 appearances for the USA and won the World Cup with in 2015 and 2019, becomes Newcastle's sixth signing of the summer. Becky Langley's side have also signed Jordan Nobbs, who has been capped 71 times by England.

Since Newcastle's takeover in October 2021, which was led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the women's team have been transformed. After consecutive promotions, last season was their first in the second tier in English football.

They recently announced the appointment of Grace Williams as their new director of women's football.

“We are absolutely delighted to be adding a player of Morgan's quality and experience to our squad,” said Langley.

“She has performed at the highest level for her whole career and brings with her a world class mentality having won some of the biggest trophies in the game for both club and country.

“Morgan is a leader, and she will bring so much on and off the pitch for us. We are excited to start working with her.”

European correspondent, HuffPost

President Donald Trump made a trademark Trumpian request after being allowed to hold the FIFA World Cup trophy at the White House.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino handed the gold prize to Trump during an Oval Office presser on Friday announcing the Dec. 5 draw date for the 2026 soccer tournament, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. 

“It is the trophy that the winner of the FIFA World Cup wins,” Infantino explained to Trump in a way that some social media users mocked as patronizing. “Only the FIFA president, presidents of countries and then those who win can touch it, because this is for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course, you can touch it. It's pretty heavy.”

“Can I keep it?” Trump asked, before joking that “we're not giving it back.”

“It goes very well on the wall right over there. We'll put it right below the angels,” Trump added, referencing some of the blinged-up decor he's used to transform the Oval Office following his return to power.

Infantino laughed and replied: “It fits well here, I think — until we have to give it to the next winners.”

“That's fine,” Trump said. “That's a beautiful piece of gold, I will say.”

Trump has form with keeping trophies, having been given the 24-karat gold-plated prize that was supposed to be presented to English team Chelsea following its Club World Cup win in the United States earlier this summer.

Hello! The Trump-Infantino bromance is back… and a trip to Vegas is off the agenda.

On the way:

🏆 World Cup draw switch

💸 Arsenal eyeing new defender

✊ Wrexham's show of solidarity

😲 Di Maria's belter at 37

It was always going to be Las Vegas. The World Cup draw is ultimately a show, a glitzy affair that doesn't in itself have any substance. It just gets people excited for something that does. From that perspective, hosting the draw in Las Vegas would have been perfect.

The draw for the 1994 World Cup was held there, when James Brown performed and Robin Williams mugged for the cameras with Sepp Blatter, one of entertainment's more unlikely double acts. It seemed like a fairly politically neutral venue. It is used to hosting thousands of people who arrive for big events, then leave rapidly. If attendees got bored talking to FIFA functionaries, they could go and see Blue Man Group, or Magic Mike Live. It seemed ideal.

But then President Donald Trump's administration suggested to his FIFA equivalent, Gianni Infantino, that maybe the draw for the 2026 World Cup should be held in a place that is none of those things: Washington, DC. And, because he has developed into quite the politician, adept at whatever the opposite of holding the powerful to account is, Infantino said: ‘Sure!'.

All of which led to a surreal scene in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump sporting a modified MAGA hat bearing the slogan, “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING”, Infantino grinning as a replica of the Club World Cup trophy (complete with winners' medal) glistened behind them, as it was announced that December's draw would take place at Washington's Kennedy Center. Or at least, that's what it's currently called: who knows what the name will be if a group pressing for Trump's name to be added gets its way.

Toes curled around the globe as Infantino told Trump that “since you are a winner”, he was allowed to touch the traditional World Cup trophy, and then presented the president with a ceremonial ticket for the World Cup final — row one, seat one, which sums it up neatly really: that would be a terrible seat, but none of this is about what anything actually means, just what sounds or looks impressive.

“The Kennedy Center will give (the World Cup) a phenomenal kick-off,” Trump said. “And we'll be involved, and they'll be working over there for quite a bit of time. We have it all set that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences, and everything else.”

Apart from anything else, this is a kick in the pants for Las Vegas. Visitor numbers for what was once the gambling capital of the United States are down — the latest figures, for June this year, report a drop of 11.3 per cent on the equivalent month in 2024.

A big event like the World Cup draw might not have boosted mass tourism, but plenty of high rollers would have passed through town. U.S. Soccer was planning to host a conference around the draw while the game's great and good were in town, and save-the-date messages had been sent to key personnel. The MGM Grand, the venue pegged to host the draw, declined to comment when The Athletic's Adam Crafton asked them about the U-turn, but we can probably assume they're not delighted.

We can also assume this is a little taste of what the World Cup will be in 2026, with Trump and Infantino front and centre.

It was impossible not to feel a warm glow when Eberechi Eze was introduced to the crowd as a new Arsenal player before their 5-0 hammering of Leeds United, which also featured Viktor Gyokeres's first two goals and almost saw the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, as Max Dowman (15 years, 234 days old) fizzed a shot just wide.

Arsenal also agreed a deal for another teenager, the 16-year-old Shamrock Rovers midfielder Victor Ozhianvuna, a wizened old veteran by comparison. Their squad depth already looks strong after this summer's investment, and they could add Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie to the pile, too.

The same could not be said of Manchester United, who drew 1-1 with Fulham after Bruno Fernandes sent a penalty into space. The Portuguese playmaker is United's best player, but also presents a tactical dilemma.

Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur clearly aren't missing Son Heung-min — who scored a beautiful first goal (above) for LAFC this weekend — too much as they stunned Manchester City, beating Pep Guardiola's side 2-0, and with some ease on Saturday.

On the field, Wrexham's start to life in the English second tier isn't going brilliantly (one draw and two defeats), but off it, they continue to win friends.

They played Sheffield Wednesday this weekend, a club who, to say the least, are going through some problems: their fans are protesting against owner Dejphon Chansiri, who is taking the club towards oblivion.

Wrexham reversed a decision to reject Wednesday fans bringing an anti-Chansiri banner to the Racecourse Ground, then co-owner Rob McElhenney encouraged Wrexham's fans to wear last season's gold away shirt in support of Wednesday's ‘black and gold until it's sold' campaign.

Furthermore, they put around 10,000 of those shirts on sale, with McElhenney announcing that the profits of those sales will go to the Sheffield Wednesday Supporters' Trust. An altruistic gesture representing true solidarity, or a PR move by a savvy actor? Maybe one, maybe both, but does it really matter?

Most clicked in Friday's TAFC: Gio Reyna's impending move.

(Selected games, kick-offs ET/UK time)

Premier League: Newcastle United vs Liverpool, 3pm/8pm — USA Network, Fubo/Sky Sports.

Serie A: Udinese vs Hellas Verona, 12.30pm/5.30pm; Inter vs Torino, 2.45pm/7.45pm — both CBS Sports, Fubo/DAZN.

La Liga: Athletic Club vs Rayo Vallecano, 1.30pm/6.30pm; Sevilla vs Getafe, 3.30pm/8.30pm — both ESPN+, Fubo/Premier Sports.

For those of us whose grey around the temples is rapidly expanding to the rest of the head, it's always comforting to see an old boy who has still emphatically got it: so we present to you 37-year-old Angel Di Maria absolutely curling one in for Rosario Central against Newell's Old Boys this weekend.

People living in the shadow of the country's national Azteca Stadium in Mexico City say development plans will add to pressure on water sources and put green spaces at risk

Rubén Ramírez is no stranger to political battles. As a community leader in Santa Úrsula Coapa, a district in southern Mexico City, he's become adept at taking on developers and bureaucrats to protect his neighbourhood over the past decade.

His latest fight may be his most ambitious yet: challenging the expansion of Mexico City's national stadium ahead of the 2026 football World Cup, which he claims neglects the community's ancient rights.

“The stadium is part of the community's territory,” says Ramírez, sporting a wide-set sombrero. “It's the owners, the businesspeople who are going to benefit from the World Cup. What are the community going to see? Nothing.”

Mexico's national Azteca Stadium – the largest in Latin America – is a sprawling complex. In June next year, it will host the opening match of the 2026 World Cup, a tournament split between Mexico, Canada and the US. The stadium's perimeter will be expanded to include new shopping and leisure centres, and there will be renovation of the Azteca itself.

But about 200,000 people live in the stadium's shadows. They include Indigenous and native people, as well as the Santa Úrsula Coapa community, located just a stone's throw from the main entrance. These individuals, many living in poverty, are quietly being affected by the World Cup plans, according to Ramírez.

Chief among grievances is water – or the lack of it. The community's water supply already experiences regular outages, and residents say it will be further threatened by stadium expansion due to increased demand.

“We think the World Cup is going to magnify the problems, including the water shortage,” says Natalia Lara, an environmentalist and teacher.

Water shortages are common across Mexico City, where ageing infrastructure loses an estimated 30-40% of supply and rapid population growth has caused demand to outstrip the locally available renewable freshwater resources. Many neighbourhoods routinely face rationing or water truck deliveries, especially in poorer areas.

In the Azteca district, residents say the plight worsened in 2018 when a neighbouring well was privatised by Televisa – a Mexican telecoms company, which also partly owns the Azteca stadium. The Santa Úrsula community says this contract was illegal and has contributed to over-exploitation, with extraction now required at a depth of 400 metres against the original 80 metres.

On 1 May, Lara was arrested alongside a colleague while protesting against the World Cup stadium expansion. The arrest was captured in a video widely shared on social media. The charges were quickly dropped, but she says her arrest was part of a wider trend to silence protesters. Lara says: “It was a political abuse. It was totally arbitrary.”

The office of Mexico City's mayor, Clara Brugada, did not reply to a request for comment. However, during a community visit in May after protests, Brugada seemed to acknowledge the problem. Quoted by local media, she said Mexico could not be “hosting a World Cup if next to the great Azteca stadium we have a lack of water, flooding or other kinds of problems”.

Activists say no action has been taken since the meetings. They continue to send letters to government officials, accusing them of being in Fifa's pockets. Their central plea is for the private concession, which extracts 450m litres of water annually, to be withdrawn. A spokesperson for the Televisa spinoff, Grupo Ollamani, said they “work very closely with the surrounding communities” and work with “the local government in order to alleviate their needs.”

However, even activists like Lara want to celebrate the World Cup – as long as officials put people first. There is palpable excitement in this nation of football fanatics that Mexico will host the international tournament for the third time.

“We're not against the World Cup,” says Lara. “What we're asking for is management of public spaces that's not just for generating profits for private companies.”

She says the problem is “how the environmental and social impact of these events” is handled.

John Horne, a retired British professor of sport and sociology, has studied mega-events like the World Cup. His research found that these spectacles often involve the “routinisation of harm to local populations”, with the diversion of critical urban resources a key factor.

His study also showed that the much-cited benefits of mega-events are often spread highly unevenly and the occasions frequently fail to deliver promised legacies, with notorious examples including South Africa's staging of the 2010 Fifa World Cup.

The Mexican government estimates the World Cup will see up to a $7bn (£5.2bn) injection into the country. The capital alone expects to invest $250m (£190m) in infrastructure, along with promising jobs and improved services.

Economic advancement would be welcome for communities surrounding the stadium, which are generally not well off. The average monthly income in a Santa Úrsula household is 18,900 Mexican pesos (£750), below the city average of 22,200 pesos.

It may be a good sign that house prices in the area have risen above average, in anticipation of the games. Yet Lara suspects residents will see little economic benefit from the World Cup – at best, small earnings from charging for parking or selling drinks. Worse, rental prices are likely to rise. She says: “We're going to get a tiny slice.”

Ramírez has seen this before – stretching back to when the Azteca was constructed in the 1960s. Since then, life for the community has become nearly unbearable on match days, with extreme traffic congestion, resource depletion and noise pollution.

He's already lived through previous World Cups. Though smaller in scale, he says they brought little positive change and worries that promises of infrastructure improvement to the immediate area is a distraction from the underlying issues.

For the Santa Úrsula community, the fight to be heard is deeply rooted in history. The constitution stipulates that authorities must legally consult local communities and leaders such as Ramírez when constructing on Indigenous land. They have failed to do so adequately, he argues.

“We have a right to consultation,” he says. “They're ignoring us completely. We don't know anything.”

The plans, he says, were publicly announced without prior consultation. Worse, other projects are being touted to take advantage of the World Cup buzz – including a dinosaur theme park. One proposed site is a 5,000 sq metre (55,000 sq ft) forest area inside Santa Úrsula that residents have protected for decades.

“They can't take it, this is the lungs of the community,” says Ramírez. “Why do they have to build it here? Take it somewhere else.”

If redevelopment occurs, families will lose homes to make way for lorries. The community will lose its main green space. Lara adds that the World Cup is being used to justify wider urbanisation plans and “gentrification” without regard for environmental and social challenges.

Legal protections technically exist to prevent the urban forest's destruction, but the government has failed to give solid assurances that communities will be spared construction. Developers continue to visit the site, and Televisa's longstanding plans for a large luxury residential project nearby remain under discussion.

For Ramírez, it's a reminder of inherent tensions with development and how Indigenous rights remain sidelined.

“I'm not against development,” he says. “I'm just advocating that things get done the right way, and as the law dictates.

“How is it possible that they have a first-class stadium, and next to it, a town that's dead?”

U.S. men's national team and Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie was the target of racist remarks during Sunday's game in Italy against Parma.

McKennie was training with his Juventus teammates after the Serie A game when the incident took place. 

The USMNT midfielder came on as a substitute in the 89th minute of the 2-0 win. In a statement, the club added that it had reported the incident to the authorities. 

McKennie was the target of racial abuse last season as well. Following a Coppa Italia match against Lazio in April, Juventus said it was launching an investigation against Lazio fans for racist remarks against the player. In November 2024, McKennie and several of his teammates were subject to abuse by Fiorentina fans. 

McKennie has been at Juventus since 2021, which included a brief loan to English club Leeds United in 2023. With Juve, he has 151 appearances and 13 goals but has often been linked to a move away from Italy. 

McKennie is expected to be part of the U.S. squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Competing for the first time since Wimbledon due to an arm injury, Jack Draper did not have it easy Monday at the US Open. Nonetheless, the 2024 semi-finalist battled through at Flushing Meadows.

The fifth seed clawed past Argentine qualifier Federico Agustin Gomez 6-4, 7-5, 6-7(7), 6-2 for a place in the second round. Despite letting slip a match point in the third-set tie-break, this year's Indian Wells champion rebounded with a clean performance in the fourth set to advance after three hours and one minute.

”Unbelievable to be out here in New York, playing on Louis Armstrong. I wasn't too sure if I was going to make it here this year, but we did a great job with the team since Wimbledon to get myself back on court,” Draper said in his on-court interview. “It wasn't my finest performance, but credit to my opponent, he played some outstanding tennis and I look forward to hopefully improving and getting better as the tournament carries on.”

The 23-year-old has been out of action due to bone stress and bone bruising in his left humerus. “I felt like my arm was shutting down a little bit when I was hitting forehands and on the serve, as well,” he said.

Draper did not hit groundstrokes for two-and-a-half weeks or serves for about a month. The big-serving lefty averaged just less than 110 miles per hour on his first serve Monday, but it was enough to navigate past Gomez.



The Argentine saved one match point on his own serve in the third-set tie-break, blistering a forehand, one of 50 winners he hit in the match. Draper broke early in the fourth set and did not relinquish his advantage. 

The 23-year-old's next opponent, Bergs, eased past Chun-Hsin Tseng 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 earlier in the day. The Briton leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 1-0, a victory in the first round of Wimbledon in 2022.

Draper earned his biggest major breakthrough at the US Open last year, when he was No. 25 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Now World No. 5, he is back for more in New York and will next take on Belgian Zizou Bergs.

“I'm not putting too much expectations on myself. I feel like I've put in the work. I know that if I can get that level back, I'm going to be really tough to beat,” Draper said. “Obviously there are so many amazing players in this draw, but the main thing is I'm just so happy to be able to compete here in front of you guys in New York.”

In other early action Monday, #NextGenATP star Joao Fonseca hit 51 winners in a 7-6(3), 7-6(5), 6-3 triumph against Miomir Kecmanovic, this year's Delray Beach titlist.

Fonseca has thrived at the majors in 2025, upsetting Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open as a qualifier before making the third round at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

One year ago, Fonseca was World No. 162 when he lost in qualifying at Flushing Meadows. The 19-year-old is now World No. 40 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, inside his career-high No. 44.

In a three-hour battle on Arthur Ashe, Renata Zarazua upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys to reach the second round.

NEW YORK -- For years, Renata Zarazua has labored at the fringes of big-time tennis, far from the spotlight.

Last year was the first time in the 27-year-old Mexican's career that she played in all four Grand Slam singles main draws. The two titles on her resume are both WTA 125s, a year ago in Charleston and, in 2023, Montevideo. Her career-high ranking is No. 51.

Before Monday, the feisty 5-foot-3 player had never, ever beaten a PIF WTA Rankings Top 10 player.

But in sprawling Arthur Ashe Stadium, playing with fiery intensity and undeniable determination, Zarazua changed that with the biggest victory of her career, by an astounding 6-7 (10), 7-6 (3), 7-5 score over reigning Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

Zarazua, who trailed by a set and 3-0, is the first Mexican woman to defeat a Top 10 seed at a Grand Slam since Angelica Gavaldon took down Jana Novotna at the 1995 Australian Open.

The match required a draining 3 hours and 10 minutes.

Check out these final point totals: Zarazua 131, Keys 125.

“I was really nervous coming in,” Zarazua told reporters. “I think the few minutes right before you go on court, it's probably the worst moments. But in a way, I feel like the experiences of playing in the other stadiums at the other Slams kind of helped me a lot today.

“I didn't want the nerves to be what let me down in the match. I thought I was playing really well the past few days and practicing well, so I was like, 'I've just got to find a way to use that to my advantage. The fear, the nerves, all of that, [I] just tried to leave them on the side and just focus on my game and what I had to do.”

For context, consider that this was only her ninth major main-draw and she has never advanced past the second round. She'll have that chance when she meets Diane Parry, a 6-1, 6-0 winner over retiring Petra Kvitova.

Zarazua was previously 0-6 against Top 10 players, losing most recently to No. 10 Elena Rybakina in Cincinnati earlier this month.

That she did it against Keys made the accomplishment even more impressive. Coming in, Keys led all women with 15 three-set victories and 10 comeback wins.

Zarazua was able to practice on Ashe a few days ago for the first time.

“First few rallies, it was like, 'Oh, my gosh, this court is really super big,'" she explained. “I really like how it plays, a little bit slower than some of the outside courts. So I liked that, because I knew it was going to help me a bit, like, having one or two extra seconds when Madison was hitting as hard as she hits.”

Keys was her own worst enemy, hitting 89 unforced errors against 46 winners. Zarazua was a more modest 34 and eight.

Zarazua evened their career series at 1-all. After winning 13 straight first-round matches in majors, Keys lost for only the sixth time in 49 first-round matches.

The first set was a match in itself, running some 72 minutes and featuring nine set points -- five of them belonging to Zarazua, a Mexican ranked No. 82.

In the end, Keys saved them all. With the tiebreak score 10-all, with points at 51 each, Keys smashed a forehand winner and Zarazua's tired forehand found the net. Keys responded with a fist pump and, sitting in the stands, actor Jeff Goldblum's face wore a look of disbelief.

Keys ran out to a 3-0 lead in the second set, but Zarazua countered by going on a five-game streak. But serving for the set, she was broken by Keys (with another massive forehand winner) to level the frame at 5-all.

Naturally, it went to another tiebreak.

This time, Zarazua got off to a big lead; her forehand passing shot put her up 5-2. A Keys double fault brought her a set point, which she converted with a backhand winner.

The third set progressed on serve -- until Zarazua broke Keys following a double fault and a backhand that soared long.

Serving for the match at 5-3, Zarazua was two points from the match, but two groundstroke errors gave the game to Keys and it was back on serve. Keys, again two points from defeat at deuce, escaped again for 5-all.

Zarazua broke Keys for the sixth time in the definitive game, when two Keys' forehands found the net.

In a three-hour battle on Arthur Ashe, Renata Zarazua upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys to reach the second round.

Diana Shnaider's surge back into the Top 20 headlined a busy week of rankings moves, with Sorana Cirstea, Ekaterina Alexandrova and several rising names also making big strides.

Last week, the final preparations for the US Open wrapped up with the WTA 500 in Monterrey and the WTA 250 in Cleveland -- two tournaments that gave their champions much-needed rebounds.

Diana Shnaider ended 2024 as the World No. 13, seemingly poised to go even higher after sweeping up four titles last year. The 21-year-old climbed to a career high of No. 11 in May but has found a breakthrough to the next level elusive. After a succession of coaching changes, she headed to Monterrey with a modest season record of 19-19. 

But both Shnaider's raw talent and battling spirit shone through in Mexico en route to her second WTA 500 trophy. In the quarterfinals, she faced a total of five match points -- and trailed 5-1 in the third set -- against Elise Mertens before pulling off one of the year's greatest comebacks. In the final, she also overcame Ekaterina Alexandrova in three sets.

After falling out of the Top 20 last week, Shnaider has already rebounded, climbing five spots from No. 22 to No. 17 this week.

This time last year, Sorana Cirstea was on crutches, ending her season after Wimbledon after plantar fasciitis necessitated foot surgery. She returned to action in January, but fell out of the Top 100 the following month. But the 35-year-old Romanian has been steadily rebuilding her ranking with promising results such as a semifinal run in Iasi and a fourth-round showing in Cincinnati -- and last week, she went all the way to the trophy in Cleveland. It's just Cirstea's third career title, and her first on hard courts since Tashkent 2008.

Cirstea climbs 41 places from No. 112 to No. 71 this week, the biggest numerical jump inside the Top 100.

Ekaterina Alexandrova, +2 to No. 12: Alexandrova continued the most consistent season of her career by reaching her second final of 2025 in Monterrey, a run that included a quarterfinal defeat of defending champion Linda Noskova. Alexandrova's 2025 record is now 35-18, and she's up to another new career high.

Marie Bouzkova, +9 to No. 44: Prague champion Bouzkova reached her second semifinal in her past three tournaments in Monterrey.

Alycia Parks, +15 to No. 56: Parks scored her seventh career Top 20 win, and third of the season, over Emma Navarro in Monterrey en route to her first WTA 500 semifinal.

In her tour-level debut at the US Open, Janice Tjen upset Veronika Kudermetova to become the first Indonesian player to win a Grand Slam match since 2023. Get to know her here.

Of the 12 players who successfully made it through US Open qualifying last week, Indonesia's Janice Tjen garnered some of the most attention.

The 23-year-old's rise since graduating from Pepperdine University with a degree in sociology last year had been meteoric. Unranked last May, Tjen won 100 out of 113 matches over the next 16 months to rise to No. 149 this week, sweeping up 13 ITF titles in the process. But her opener against No. 25 seed Veronika Kudermetova represented another step up in level. It was not only Tjen's tour-level debut, but the first time she'd ever faced a Top 50 opponent.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Tjen responded brilliantly, upsetting Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 despite losing a break lead in the second set, and setting up a popcorn second-round encounter with Emma Raducanu. The seventh Indonesian woman to compete in a Grand Slam main draw in the Open Era, Tjen also snapped a long drought for her country at this level of the sport, becoming:

"I feel proud to be able to do this for my country," Tjen told press afterwards. "Hopefully like this, by me making appearance here, will inspire more tennis player -- like, younger kids to play tennis and also believing that they can be here too."

Growing up in Jakarta, Tjen got her start in tennis by accident. Her friend, Priska Nugroho -- then one of the country's top juniors, and the 2020 Australian Open girls' doubles champion with Alexandra Eala -- persuaded her to try the sport. Tjen's parents quickly acquiesced.

"My parents were just like, 'Yeah, just go play the sport, just having exercise,' so I'm not going to be in my room just doing nothing," Tjen recalled with a smile.

Tjen patterned her game after a former World No. 1

Against Kudermetova, Tjen excelled with a throwback game style that's become all too rare in tennis: sliced backhands, a powerful forehand with which she struck a slew of lethal angled winners and an eagerness to get to the net, where she won 20 out of 30 points.

"Me and my coach have been working on that," Tjen said with satisfaction afterwards. "Just making sure that if it is a 50/50, we're going in, coming into the net. And I would say we have a pretty good percentage of winning up at the net, so we would want to make more appearance up there."

It's all reminiscent of none other than former World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, who retired in 2022 -- and it's no surprise that Tjen has consciously patterned her game after the three-time major champion.

"I have been hearing that a lot," Tjen said. "She's, I would say, my role model. I would watch a little bit of her matches and try to copy what works for me, what's not, and just trying to understand her game a little bit more."

Tjen and Eala are both making history for south-east Asia in New York

On a strong day for south-east Asian tennis, Tjen's breakthrough was mirrored by none other than her former junior rival Eala, who delivered Day 1's only other seeded upset, knocking out No. 14 Clara Tauson in a Grandstand barnburner. Eala, the first Filipina to win a Grand Slam main-draw match in the Open Era, remembered Tjen well from their junior rivalry.

"Janice is super nice," the 20-year-old told press. "I've known her for quite a long time. Growing up in the same region, we would run into each other a lot in the same tournaments. You know, I haven't been able to spend a lot of time with her recently. I know she was in college. I'm so happy for her, and it's nice to see someone that you grew up with in the biggest stages in the world."

Eala had the narrow edge in their 2018-19 junior days, leading their head-to-head at that level 2-1.

Tjen was encouraged by her college coaches and a fellow Indonesian player

Going pro was never an automatic decision for Tjen. After finishing with juniors, the travel costs involved meant that she and her parents opted for the college tennis pathway -- which she feels paid off after her coaches at Pepperdine University helped to develop her game. And after spending her college career contemplating whether or not she should turn pro, they were also instrumental in encouraging her.

"The coaches at Pepperdine told me I think you should give it a try, at least for two years," she said. "So I trust them, and here I am!"

The only other Indonesian player at the US Open -- doubles No. 48 Aldila Sutjiadi -- was also a key figure in Tjen's emergence.

"I am really, really close with Aldila," Tjen said. "She's always been like a good older sister to me, taking care of me, guiding me, and telling me, 'This is what you need to do.' She's also one of the people that convinced me that I should give it a try. It's very nice to be around another Indonesian here."

In her spare time, Tjen is a Mario Kart fan

Tennis isn't Tjen's only competitive endeavor. In her downtime, she and her coach continue to battle hard -- playing Mario Kart.

"We've been grinding on that one," she told press.

Only one on the video game's characters will do for Tjen, though -- the green dinosaur Yoshi.

"I've been into Mario Kart since I was really young, and it's always my go-to character," she said. "I would be a little bit not happy if somebody took that. I would be like, 'Nope, that's my character.'"

In her tour-level debut at the US Open, Janice Tjen upset Veronika Kudermetova to become the first Indonesian player to win a Grand Slam match since 2023. Get to know her here.

Ultimately, it's all about learning. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has lost three ATP Tour finals in 2025, and in two of them he held match points (Acapulco and Washington).

While his quest to claim his first trophy continues, the 26-year-old Spaniard is in no doubt about what he needs to do to get his hands on it.

“It's a learning curve,” he admitted on Sunday after storming his way to a 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 over Alexander Shevchenko, the most resounding Grand Slam win of his career. “If you look at the final at Delray Beach, after the 5-2, 15-40 I couldn't play that game because I was really nervous and I was talking a lot. Then, in the Washington final, where I was 5-2 up and had match points, I kept fighting and I lost in a close tie-break.

“I think that's the lesson; being calm during tense moments. And you get that from the weeks and the matches. There will be another chance. That's tennis. I know I'll have chances in the rest of my career. In the end, the finals I've been in this year, I'm learning from them and I use that to know how to handle it in the future.”

Watch Washington final highlights:

At the start of the year, Davidovich Fokina lost in Delray Beach to Miomir Kecmanovic despite having had a 5-2 lead in the deciding set and earning himself two match points. He also bowed out of the title bout in Acapulco against Tomas Machac and a few weeks ago he fell at the last hurdle to Alex de Minaur in Washington where he again had a 5-2 lead in the decider as well as three match points at 5-4 on the Australian's serve.

After that defeat, the third in a final in 2025 (and the fourth final he has lost in his career), there was an outpouring of affection from many of Davidovich's peers, including De Minaur himself, who sat with him on the bench in Washington and devoted some kind words to him at the prizegiving ceremony.

He was not the only one.

“Fils, Lehecka, Cobolli… I have several friends on tour and they could see I was in a bad place after that final,” confessed Davidovich Fokina, the No. 18 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I was struggling and I appreciated many of their messages. Fils is one of my best friends on Tour and also off court. That's who I speak most with and I received a message from him straight after the loss.

“Ultimately, for me, it's also like saying ‘I know I'm doing things right and the title will come.' I think people know that too. Maybe it won't be this year, but it'll come one day.”

After that final in Washington, and without taking a break, Davidovich reached the last sixteen at the ATP Masters 1000 in Toronto, where he retired from the match with Andrey Rublev, just as he did in Cincinnati, when he was unable to finish against Joao Fonseca.

“I was very tired, above all mentally and physically,” said the Spaniard. “I was exhausted. I've never played so many matches in a year and it takes its toll in the end. It wasn't the best decision to play in Toronto after Washington. I didn't get a single day's rest and the fatigue accumulated.

“I had to retire in Toronto because my legs had gone. In the end, having a week and not resting, your body tells you it's too much. We had to reflect and figure out what was happening. In the end it was all about getting a proper rest.”



Sometimes the solution is simpler than it may seem.

“The day after losing to Fonseca I went to Miami with my wife and spent four days there doing nothing,” said Davidovich Fokina. “We were relaxing on the beach and eating good food. After those four days I returned to Cincinnati where I was practising. I did a mini week-and-a-half preseason. That was my preparation for arriving here stronger.”

So far, it seems to be working. Having thrashed Shevchenko in his first match at the US Open, Davidovich is into the second round at Flushing Meadows and could not be feeling better.

Photographer walking on court when he's not supposed to could've just changed the entire match 🤯

The rambunctious Russian was the talk of the town as Day 1 of the US Open stretched from late Sunday into early Monday. For a while, it didn't appear that his matchup with 51st-ranked Benjamin Bonzi would be noteworthy beyond Medvedev's continued struggles at the Slams. He entered the tournament having lost his last three matches at the Slams; after winning 18 matches at the majors in 2024, the former No. 1 has just one this season.“I'm playing bad and in important moments, even worse,” said Medvedev. “Everything. Everything. Serve, return, volley, whatever. Just need to play better, and I'm going to try to do it next year.”Then someone came onto the court—during match point.As Bonzi prepared to hit a second serve at 6-3, 7-5, 5-4, a photographer walked onto the playing surface, erroneously thinking the match was over. When chair umpire Greg Allensworth commanded him, “Not now, get off the court please!”, he then announced that Bonzi would receive a first serve.Cue Medvedev.

What ensued was a viral moment Medvedev has become known for: making his voice heard, loud and clear. He berated Allensworth for the decision, saying, “He wants to go home guys, he doesn't like to be here, he gets paid by the match, not by the hour.” Medvedev then mentioned Reilly Opelka, who at this year's Dallas Open called Allensworth the “worst ump on tour.”“Delay from the photographer was probably four seconds and a half,” Medvedev would later say. “I'm not sure it's enough for a second serve.”Combined with a cascade of boos from the crowd inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, some six minutes passed before Bonzi struck his (second) first serve.

“Ya he should get a first [serve],” Fritz wrote in reply to the X account @whinerali, “but the call ends up backfiring and hurting him because of the pause, having to sit on a match point for 10 min and then the crowd getting super into it against you.“Unless bonzi hits a huge first serve and gets a free point off the pause, then the whole thing is actually really bad for him”Fritz, who occasionally engages with followers during buzzworthy tennis moments, elaborated further:

It sucks for the returner and it's not fair but at the same time someone literally running on the court, who isn't supposed to be on the court between serves is insane and not just something you play on through. After Allensworth calls at the guy to not come on the court and…

It appeared Fritz's feeling would would be fact: Bonzi lost the match point, and then the third set in a tiebreak. His play immediately cratered as Medvedev ran away with the fourth set, 6-0. When he fell behind 0-40 at 3-3 in the fifth, Bonzi's Cinderella story appeared over—it was after midnight, after all.But he would go on to save all three break points, then two more before holding serve—and ultimately win the match.“I'm very proud of myself, the scenario of the match, the match point in the third,” said Bonzi. “Then Daniil playing great and taking, like, full advantage on the fourth. I was not in my best physically in the fifth. I tried to fought very hard to give all I had. I saw that he was not maybe at his best too.“Yeah, it's kind of crazy, this match. For me it's like my best victory ever. It's very special to do it here.”

Medvedev's antics weren't over with after the match point fiasco. He seemed to purposely delay play by shaking one hand before serving late in the fifth set, and he destroyed his racquet after repeatedly whacking it on his bench after the match was over.But after Bonzi converted his second match point—with a backhand pass Medvedev couldn't get back—both men shook each others' hands, along with Allensworth's.“What I say and what I do, in my head, I want to do worse, and I cannot because there are rules, because we're on tennis court,” said Medvedev. “So I just expressed my emotions, my unhappiness with the decision, and then the crowd did what they did without me asking them too much, and it was fun to witness.”

 Daniil Medvedev is unlikely to look back fondly on the 2025 Grand Slam season. 

 The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has ended his year at the majors with just one match win after he fell to a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7(5), 0-6, 6-4 defeat against Benjamin Bonzi on Sunday night at the US Open. After stealing the third set amid chaotic scenes, Medvedev twice surrendered a break in the fifth set. After shaking hands with Bonzi, he tossed six racquets from his bag to fans in the stands.

Despite a courageous comeback and some excellent shotmaking, Medvedev produced an error-strewn performance on Louis Armstrong Stadium, offering up 64 unforced errors overall. For Bonzi, it was a second consecutive Grand Slam victory against Medvedev following his four-set triumph in the pair's clash at Wimbledon in late June. 

 The 20-time tour-level champion Medvedev began his Grand Slam year by rallying from two-sets-to-one down to defeat then-World No. 418 Kasidit Samrej at the Australian Open. He then fell to Learner Tien in five sets in the second round in Melbourne, before falling to Cameron Norrie in five at Roland Garros, and Bonzi at both Wimbledon and now the US Open. 

“I'm playing bad and in important moments, even worse,” Medvedev said of his 2025 Grand Slam season. “Everything: serve, return, volley, whatever… I just need to play better, and I'm going to try to do it next year.”

 Sunday night's encounter between Medvedev and Bonzi in New York did not lack drama. Bonzi appeared set to wrap a comfortable upset when he stepped up to serve on match point at 5-4, 40/30 in the third set, but an unexpected interruption acted as a catalyst for wild scenes on Louis Armstrong Stadium. 

The bedlam began when a photographer ran from the court entrance onto the court surface inside the side court signage to take his position in the photographers' pit after Bonzi missed his first serve on the match point. Umpire Greg Allensworth awarded the Frenchman another first serve due to the disturbance. Medvedev ran towards the umpire's chair to remonstrate and soon after encouraged the crowd to raise as much noise as they could muster. 

 Sustained crowd noise delayed play for about five minutes. As Bonzi paced near the back of the court, even Medvedev was concerned things had spiralled out of control and he signalled for an end to the chaos. Upon resumption, a Bonzi fault drew an enormous roar from fans. When Medvedev won a baseline exchange to get back to deuce, fans erupted. 

 Massive roars rang out when Medvedev then earned – and converted – a break point to level at 5-5. The former US Open champion, who once fancied himself a villain to the New York crowd – made a heart symbol with his hands to thank them for their support. After clinching the set in a tie-break, he repeated the gesture.

Medvedev raced away with the fourth set and broke in the first game of the fifth. But he handed back the break immediately. He also handed back a break at 3-3. Despite serving below full strength due to a leg injury, Bonzi fought off five break points to hold for 4-3 and soon after broke Medvedev in the final game of the match to secure a dramatic win for new coach Nicolas Mahut.

“It's a very important win, it's my first Grand Slam with Nico, our first week together,” Bonzi said on court after the victory. “I gave all my heart on the court and I have the win today.

“I'm very proud of myself, the scenario of the match, the match point in the third. Then Daniil playing great and taking full advantage in the fourth. It's kind of crazy, this match. For me it's like my best victory ever. It's very special to do it here.”

Medvedev has enjoyed some success away from the majors in 2025, reaching an ATP Masters 1000 semi-final in Indian Wells and an ATP 500 championship match in Halle. But the 29-year-old's horror show at the Slams represents a dramatic dropoff for a player who has been of the most consistent performers at that level in recent years: Medvedev reached at least one Grand Slam final per year from 2021 to 2024.

NEW YORK (AP) — Daniil Medvedev's match was delayed more than six minutes between points Sunday night, after a photographer entered the court on match point and the 2021 U.S. Open champion became enraged by the chair umpire's decision to award his opponent a first serve.The latest Medvedev meltdown on Louis Armstrong Stadium led to a wild change in the match. The No. 13 seed was a point away from being eliminated by Benjamin Bonzi for the second straight Grand Slam tournament. Instead, he won the next two sets to force a deciding fifth early Monday.Bonzi would win the match on his second match point, 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4.

Bonzi had just hit his first serve leading 5-4 in the third set after winning the first two. After he missed it, a photographer left his position before the Frenchman could hit his second.Chair umpire Greg Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay — which is common in tennis. Medvedev then approached the chair to complain about the decision."He wants to go home, guys. He doesn't like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour," Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.

Medvedev kept encouraging the loud boos on Armstrong, which eventually lasted so long that he then tried to get fans to quiet down so Bonzi could serve. When Bonzi finally did, he double-faulted, and Medvedev won the game and later the set in a tiebreaker to prolong the match.

It was reminiscent of Medvedev's 2019 match on the same court, when fans booed him for his antics and he later said in his post-match interview that the crowd gave him energy. Medvedev had snatched the towel from a ballperson during the match and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire's chair, actions that led to him being fined $9,000 for that match.Medvedev reached the final that year, then won the title two years later. But he has struggled this year in the majors and was upset by Bonzi in the first round at Wimbledon.A U.S. Tennis Association spokesman said the photographer was escorted from the court by U.S. Open security and his credential was revoked.

NEW YORK—“Quite a strange match, to be honest,' was how Novak Djokovic assessed his 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2 win over Learner Tien on Sunday night at the US Open.Strange indeed in some ways. Djokovic mentioned the lengths of the first two sets: The opener lasted 20 minutes, while the second went on for an hour and 20 minutes. Djokovic's demeanor and physical condition were also mysterious at times. By the middle of the second set, he looked gassed. He walked slowly and took extra time between points. He bailed out of long rallies with drop shots. He breathed hard and bent double. By the end of the third set, though, he was close to his normal self again, and the scoreline looked routine.In that sense, this was also a predictable result for an opening night at the Open. Typically, this is when we see a very high seed play his first-round match against someone who has never experienced an evening session in New York before. Never felt the bright lights or heard the 20,000 fans in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Never had the sense that you're playing in front of the world.

That was certainly true of Tien, who hasn't made it past the first round of the US Open in four tries. At 19, in his first full year on tour, he's even greener than Djokovic's average opening-round victim. So it was no surprise that he looked like a deer in the headlights as he littered up the court with misses in the first set.But it also wasn't a surprise that, once he got the blood flowing and got used to the stage, Tien challenged Djokovic in the second set, and briefly brought some buzz and tension to the building. The match really only existed from the fifth game of the second set to the end of the tiebreaker, but it was a pretty good half set. Three times Tien pushed Djokovic; three times he failed to take the next step.At 3-2, Tien had three break points, but Djokovic saved them all. During one of them, Tien had a look at a forehand, but he tapped the ball tentatively to the middle of the court, where Djokovic quickly bashed it for a winner. Later, with Djokovic serving at 4-5, Tien reached set point. He chose to back up to return serve; Djokovic, seeing his deep position, sent the ball out wide for an ace. Finally, Tien reached 3-3 in the tiebreaker. From there, though, he put a backhand into the net, double faulted, and missed a regulation backhand long. That was essentially that.

Despite not having played a match since Wimbledon, Djokovic's physical struggles came as a surprise to him.“I started great. Just over 20 minutes, first set, I felt really good,” he said. “Then some long games to start the second set, and then I start to feel really—I don't know why. I really was surprised how bad I was feeling in the second physically.”

In the past, Djokovic might have brushed an early dip aside and chalked it up to first-round nerves. But not at 38.“There are positives, but also things that hopefully won't happen in terms of, like, how I feel on the court physically the way I felt in the second set,” he said. “It's slightly a concern. I don't know. I don't have any injury or anything. I just struggled a lot to stay in long exchanges and recover after points.”Djokovic has two days off before he plays another young Californian, 22-year-old Zachary Svajda.“Good thing,” the five-time champ admitted. He's three sets closer to another title now, but he'll need to feel and play much better if he's going to win 18 more.

 Novak Djokovic was forced to battle through some Sunday-night struggles to kick-start his 2025 US Open campaign. 

 The four-time champion at the New York major overcame #NextGenATP home favourite Learner Tien in straight sets inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, but he was quick to admit the victory had been far less straightforward than the scoreline suggests. 

 “I started great. Just over 20 minutes, first set, I felt really good,” said Djokovic in his post-match press conference following his 6-1, 7-6(3), 6-2 win. “Then some long games to start the second set, and then I started to feel really… I don't know why. I really was surprised how bad I was feeling in the second physically. 

 “Yeah, we had long exchanges, but also, I kind of dropped my level and made a lot of unforced errors and kind of got him back into the match. I'm glad that I kind of reset myself after second set. And the third set was okay to finish up the match.”

 Djokovic was competing in his first match since he also struggled physically in a straight-sets Wimbledon semi-final defeat to Jannik Sinner six weeks ago. This time around, the 38-year-old was able to get the win, but he acknowledged he will hope to feel physical improvement in his second-round encounter on Wednesday against another American, Zachary Svajda. 

 “There are positives but also things that hopefully won't happen in terms of how I feel on the court physically, the way I felt in the second set,” reflected the No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “Hopefully that doesn't happen, because then it makes my life on the court definitely much more challenging. 

 “Good thing, two days off now. But yeah, it's slightly a concern. I don't know. I don't have any injury or anything. I just struggled a lot to stay in long exchanges and recover after points."

 A record 24-time major titlist, Djokovic is too experienced to panic after one match back from an extended break. Indeed, he reflected on the fact that his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with the 19-year-old Tien always held the potential to represent a stern test. 

 “There was quite a bit of tension on the court, playing a young American, night session,” said Djokovic, who is now 27-9 for the season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “For me, I haven't played a match, an official match, for six weeks. I had to deliver my A-game, which I did I think in the first set. Particularly in the second, it was surviving on the court. But in the important moments I just put one ball more in the court than he did. 

 “I think it was also good to experience that, in a sense, kind of break the ice officially in the tournament. So you know, looking forward to the next challenge.”

When the draw was made, this was one of the toughest first-round match-ups. Djokovic hadn't played a match since Wimbledon, and Tien had an incredible 4-1 record against Top 10 players this year.But the favorite came out firing on Sunday night, rolling through the first set—there was some danger in the second set, as Djokovic faced a set point in his 4-5 service game, but he saved it, held and eventually clinched the set in a tie-break to secure a two-set lead.Tien broke serve in the first game of the third set but it was all Djokovic from there, as the 24-time Grand Slam champion won five games in a row for a 5-1 lead, and then—after getting broken while serving for the match—broke the American one last time to close it out."Well, I started great. Just over 20 minutes, first set, I felt really good," Djokovic said. "Then some long games to start the second set, and then I start to feel really—I don't know why. I really was surprised how bad I was feeling in the second physically. Yeah, we had long exchanges, but also, I kind of dropped my level and made a lot of unforced errors and kind of got him back into the match. I'm glad that I kind of reset myself after second set. And the third set was okay to finish up the match."There are positives, but also things that hopefully won't happen in terms of how I feel on the court physically the way I felt in the second set. Hopefully that doesn't happen, because then it makes my life on the court much more challenging. Good thing, two days off now. But yeah, it's slightly a concern. I don't have any injury or anything. I just struggled a lot to stay in long exchanges and recover after points."

Eighty seemed to be the magic number for Djokovic on Sunday, as he not only scored his 80th career win on Ashe, but this is also his 80th career appearance at a Grand Slam event. He's just the third man in tennis history to play that many majors, after Roger Federer and Feliciano Lopez, who contested 81 major tournaments each.Awaiting the Serb in the second round will be another American, Zachary Svajda, who won an all-qualifier battle against Hungary's Zsombor Piros earlier in the day, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5.Djokovic will be playing against Svajda for the first time.

“It's hard not to get their energy,” the 20-year-old said of her US Open fan army.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 25, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—From an early age, whenever she was nervous, Alexandra Eala liked to say a prayer before a big point. Which one she chose depended on what had been working for her.“If I won the point with Our Father, I'd say Our Father,” Eala told Tennis Channel's Jon Wertheim. “If I won the point with Hail Mary, I'd say Hail Mary.“If I lost the point, I had to switch to a different prayer.”👉 WATCH: The Alexandra Eala interview, with Jon Wertheim

Clearly, not every invocation that the 20-year-old from the Philippines made during her epic opening-day win over No. 14 seed Clara Tauson on Sunday was successful. After winning the first set, and revving up her—already exceptionally loud—Filipino fan army in the Grandstand, she lost the second 6-2, trailed 1-5 in the third, and looked all but sure to make her exit.The rookie's level, as it had in many of her matches this season, swung wildly from one set to the next.She began with a series of blazing winners—taken early, hit flat, and aimed fearlessly at the corners—that knocked Tauson back on her heels and thrilled her flag-waving supporters. When Eala is hot, no one on either tour produces winners with such a jaw-dropping mix of pace and precision. She spent the first set showing off the highly touted game that took her to the girls' title on these courts in 2022, a win over Iga Swiatek in Miami in April, and the Eastbourne final in June.

But at 20, another, much-less-precise version of Eala still exists. This is the one who has often lost early in 2025, even in smaller events; who sails ground strokes 10 feet over the baseline; who hits her second serve 75 miles per hour; who struggles to track down drop shots; who wins a set 6-2, and then loses next two just as badly; who can look not quite ready for prime time. That's the Eala who appeared in the second and third set, and who nearly lost the match.So what did Eala say to herself when she was down 1-5 in the third? Was it an Our Father or a Hail Mary? What we do know is that, on the outside, she appealed to a different higher power: her fans. They had been quiet for most of the last two sets, and she hadn't done much to get them involved. But after connecting on a few shots and holding at 1-5, she raised her fist and and looked out at the stands. Her fan club responded immediately.When Eala is hot, no one on either tour produces winners with such a jaw-dropping mix of pace and precision.“Definitely hard to see the positives when, you know, you're down 5-1, but that's what I tried to do,” Eala said. “I tried to see the positives, find solutions. And obviously, you know, with all these people backing me up, it's hard not to stay in the moment and get their energy.”

The energy that Eala took seemed to be siphoned directly from Tauson. From the start, the Dane had been rattled by the intensity of the fans. She complained about noise during points, she complained that Eala kept clipping the outside of the lines, and she unraveled completely in the first set.“She's not exuding positive vibes,” one commentator said of Tauson, in the day's most notable understatement.Tauson settled down in the second set. But the frustration came flooding back as Eala and her army re-engaged in the third. Serving for the match at 5-2, Tauson double faulted to go down break point, then watched Eala blister a return past her. Serving at 5-4, she double faulted twice more and was broken again. Every errant swing of Tauson's was greeted with something close to a standing ovation.But credit Tauson for settling down again and holding at 5-6. With the two women raising their games and trading baseline rockets, the match tiebreaker was drama from start to finish. Eala went up 8-4; Tauson leveled at 8-8. Eala reached match point four times; Tauson saved them all.Finally, at 11-11, Eala hit another backhand winner that skidded off the baseline, and finished with a full-cut forehand that Tauson couldn't handle.

As Tauson's final shot floated long, Eala fell to the court and the crowd went delirious. Which may be more understandable when you realize that this was the first time in the Open Era that a player from the Philippines had won a match at a major.“To be Filipino is something I take so much pride in,” Eala said. “I don't have a home tournament, so to be able to have this community here at the US Open, I'm so grateful that they made me feel like I'm home.”👉 WATCH: The Alexandra Eala interview, with Jon Wertheim

“I'm super over the moon with what I was able to do today,” she said later. “I think everything in general just made the atmosphere so, so exciting, but at the same time, so tense.”In the end, we can only guess that Eala's system of praying—stick with what's working—came through for her on the final two points.

Welcome to It's a Hit! In this series, IndieWire speaks to creators and showrunners behind a few of our favorite television programs about the moment they realized their show was breaking big.

So many things can go wrong on any given project. When they go right, it means that the creators in charge have made a series of decisions that support the story they want to tell. Netflix's “Adolescence” broke out way bigger than anyone ever expected, and wound up scoring 13 Primetime Emmy nominations.

Decision 1: Actor and producer Stephen Graham approached his frequent collaborator Jack Thorne (“The Virtues,” “Help”) to write the show.

Decision 2: Thorne convinced Graham to write it with him. “I've always thought that he was an actor that had a writer within him,” said Thorne to IndieWire over Zoom. “He is instinctively a storyteller. And so I wanted to find a way to harness that side of his brain and use it. He's nervous about writing, he's dyslexic, he doesn't see himself as a writer, but I thought we could find a way to work together that would allow that side of his brain to flower.”

They met on Zooms; as Graham and Thorne talked things through, Thorne finalized dialogue and typed the script into the computer. 

Decision 3: They wrote the show to be shot in four episodes as single long takes. “I want this to be about knife crimes,” Graham told Thorne, “and I want this to be in a single take and four episodes.” During the writing process, Thorne realized that “the single take was changing the way I write. I could see the joy of the incomplete. Where, conventionally, I would tell a story was not possible. Writing this show I realized the damage of that rhythm. This kicked me halfway across the road, and I was seeing traffic come towards me. And Stephen was an army captain, he's ruthless. It's done with love, and it's done with care.”

Decision 4: With a rapidly approaching window to shoot the show, Graham and Thorne did something risky. All they had written was Episode 1. “I didn't want to lose that window, and I didn't want the project to die,” said Thorne. “Let's write episodes 2 and 3 on spec and and thankfully, it paid off for us.”

Decision 5: Amazon, the original home of the series, did not want to make the show they wanted to make. So they walked away. “We just didn't suit what they wanted to do,” said Thorne.

Decision 6: This allowed the two creators to go to Netflix UK. Graham had starred in the Netflix political series “Bodies.” They met with Netflix in January 2024 and were shooting by the summer. “Adolescence” launched production in July 2024 with director Phil Barantini and cinematographer Matthew Lewis, who had both shot the one-take drama “Boiling Point” with Graham. “They knew how to do it,” said Thorne. “The difference was that was a single room, and we weren't doing single rooms. We were throwing cameras out of trucks. One of my jobs was to write the impossible and let these technically brilliant people work out ways to solve it, because it is always in the impossible that the interesting things happen.”

 










Decision 7: They fixed Episode 3. The first episode to be filmed was the confrontation between the 13-year-old accused murderer Jamie (Owen Cooper) and his psychologist (Erin Doherty). But Netflix had notes. “We had rehearsal week, tech week, and shoot week,” said Thorne. “Particularly Thursday of tech week, there will be a lot of people around watching the take, because that would be a dress rehearsal for where we were going to go with it. And at that point, any problems with the script would be apparent, and we'd have to get the spanners and the screwdrivers out and fix it, because there was no edit. The script wasn't a document which then would be taken into filming, which then would be taken into the edit. The script was the story. On Episode 3, Anne Mensah, our Netflix exec, felt like we were taking way too long to get into the room. We slashed the script, and that still felt too ponderous. And so we ended up with [the psychologist] being late. And she was then traveling through the center at triple speed. It was one of those golden processes that happened so rarely, where it felt like everyone wanted to be on the same team.”

Decision 8: Netflix got behind it. The show was screened for content chief Bela Bajaria, who showed it to Co-CEO Ted Sarandos. “They were helping us position it so that it did have an international life,” said Thorne. “They were on it from the start, and they were passionate about it, and they felt like they had something that people will want to see. But that's not to say it wasn't a massive surprise. Because we thought we'd made a little show that might have some international interest, but we didn't think it would do what it did, no one would ever dare. It did well in countries that I wouldn't expect to be interested in the story of a lad from Pontefract just outside of Doncaster. We weren't trying to tell a story that would work in America. It was about knife crime, not gun crime. It was local, but when it is specific enough it does work internationally, if given the chance. And that's not just true of ‘Adolescence,' that's true of a lot of stories.”

 










Once the show aired to raves, Thorne started getting messages from old school friends, people who aren't in the business. “You became aware of how many people in different countries were watching it and having that response,” said Thorne. “It is partly down to the single shot, and people were interested in the technical prowess that Matt and Phil showed in making the show, and there is an element of the fear of ‘What's going on with my teenager behind a closed door?' But the main reason is there was something about the performances that was special. The actors weren't being required to do Scene 13 from Episode 2, followed by Scene 16 from Episode 3, and then Scene 20 from Episode 6, because we only have the location for the single day. They were actually telling the story of an hour. And they were telling it on their faces.”

Next up: Thorne is working on Sam Mendes' series of films about The Beatles. That's all he can say. He also adapted William Golding's “Lord of the Flies,” directed by Mark London and filmed with 42 boys off the coast of Malaysia.  

All episodes of “Adolescence” are now streaming on Netflix.

Jennifer Lopez has always been a superstar who knows how to command attention — whether it's with her music, movies, or her unforgettable love life. Over the years, the multi-talented icon and former “American Idol” judge has been engaged six times, and with each proposal came a dazzling new ring that captured just as many headlines as her red-carpet looks. 

From her very first engagement in the late 1990s to her most recent chapter with Ben Affleck, Lopez's collection of sparkling diamonds and rare gemstones tells the story of her journey through love, fame, and personal reinvention. These rings weren't just jewelry — they were cultural moments, cementing J.Lo's place as one of Hollywood's most glamorous and talked-about stars.



According to People, Lopez's first engagement came from model-turned-waiter Ojani Noa in 1997. He proposed with a marquise-cut diamond set on a gold band, a classic piece that reflected her rising fame at the time. The pair married that same year, but the marriage lasted less than a year before they divorced in 1998. While short-lived, the ring marked the beginning of Lopez's headline-making romantic history.



In 2001, backup dancer Cris Judd proposed to Lopez with a stunning emerald-cut diamond on a pavé band. Their whirlwind romance culminated in a wedding later that year, but just nine months later, Lopez filed for divorce. Though their union was brief, the ring was elegant and sophisticated, a symbol of Lopez's growing Hollywood star power in the early 2000s.



By 2002, Lopez had moved on to one of her most famous romances. Ben Affleck proposed with a 6-carat radiant-cut pink diamond by Harry Winston, surrounded by two white diamonds. Worth millions, the ring was instantly iconic and set a new standard for celebrity engagement rings. Affleck even had the word “sing” engraved inside the band. The couple planned a lavish wedding for September 2003, but called it off days before the ceremony. They officially split in early 2004, but the ring remains one of the most memorable pieces in Hollywood history.



Later in 2004, Lopez married singer Marc Anthony. He proposed with an 8.5-carat blue diamond by Harry Winston, a bold and colorful stone valued at several million dollars. The marriage lasted a decade, during which Lopez and Anthony welcomed twins Max and Emme in 2008. The ring symbolized a long and meaningful chapter in Lopez's personal life, and to this day, it remains one of her most striking engagement pieces.



In 2019, baseball legend Alex Rodriguez proposed during a romantic Bahamas getaway. He presented Lopez with a massive 15-carat emerald-cut diamond, estimated at over a million dollars. The ring was a showstopper, perfectly aligned with Lopez's glamorous style. While the couple seemed headed for marriage, postponements during the COVID-19 pandemic and growing strain led to their split in 2021.

In 2022, Lopez and Affleck rekindled their romance in a love story straight out of Hollywood. Affleck proposed a second time, this time with a rare green diamond — Lopez's favorite color and considered her lucky shade — flanked by white side stones. Estimated to be worth between $5 million and $10 million, the ring was both romantic and symbolic. Lopez revealed Affleck engraved the band with “not.going.anywhere,” a personal message that reflected their renewed commitment. They married in Las Vegas in July 2022, followed by a larger ceremony in Georgia, before Lopez filed for divorce in August 2024. Court records confirmed Lopez kept the green diamond after the divorce was finalized in early 2025.

Jennifer Lopez's six engagement rings tell more than just the story of her love life — they serve as milestones in her career, her evolution as a global superstar, and her ability to captivate the public like few others can. From simple designs to rare colored diamonds, her collection is valued in the tens of millions and remains one of the most iconic in Hollywood history. Today, Lopez may once again be single, but her engagement rings — from Ojani Noa's marquise-cut to Ben Affleck's rare green diamond — will forever be part of her lasting legacy as a trendsetter in love, fashion, and fame.

Netflix may have had its first No. 1 weekend at the box office ever with “KPop Demon Hunters Sing-Along,” but you wouldn't know that from asking Netflix.

Officially, the top movie in America is “Weapons” for the third straight week. It made an estimated $15.4 million, and we know that because Warner Bros. told us. Why wouldn't you when you're No. 1? Netflix, however — as is its right — hasn't reported numbers, even though it probably would've beaten that.

Industry sources told IndieWire that the film opened on 1,750 screens for just two days on Saturday and Sunday, not Friday, and over 1,150 of those screenings were sellout showings of ravenous tweens wanting to sing along with the animated K-pop musical in person. We're hearing estimates of between $18 million and $18.8 million, which is where “Demon Hunters” finally settled, including at least $10.5 million on Saturday and $7.5 million on Sunday, though other reports had it at $19.2 million. It did that without opening at any AMC Theatres locations, America's largest theater chain.

It doesn't really matter. Netflix isn't sweating those extra hundreds of thousands, and it won't report where it finally lands, even though it did when Rian Johnson's “Glass Onion” made $15 million from roughly 700 screens and one week in theaters.

That's a little frustrating if you're a rival studio distributor who wants to size up the competition, but the question you're most likely asking is, does this mean Netflix will start putting more of its stuff in theaters?  The short answer is no, and the longer answer is maybe with a but. 

Netflix's position, as its executives have said frequently, is that it wants you to watch its movies on its platform, full stop. It generates revenue from its subscribers and ad dollars, and keeping you engaged, and chasing an unpredictable box office is not the business it wants to be in. It looked at claims that money was probably left on the table with “Glass Onion” if it had only opened wider and said, thanks, we're good.

But Netflix will also tell you, actually, we do put movies in theaters! We own two historic movie palaces in New York and Hollywood to host premieres. A movie like “Red Notice” opened on a similar number of screens as “KPop Demon Hunters” did. And all of our awards titles get small but notable qualifying runs for Oscars. We just don't report any box office data, but look at us being transparent.

The other big difference between “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Glass Onion” is that “Demon Hunters” has already been on Netflix for two months. Everyone who saw it in theaters was a super-fan who had likely streamed it a bunch of times (God help you if you thought watching the “Sing-Along” version was the best way to check it out for the first time). This worked for Netflix because it knew it had that built-in fanbase and could successfully stage some event screenings for those core fans, and it didn't need extensive marketing to make it a hit. They're likely the same folks who will show up to the Netflix House theme park locations, now opening November 12 in Philadelphia and December 11 in Dallas.

 










That's why, if we were betting journos, we'd wager there could be more theatrical examples like “KPop Demon Hunters” in the future. Netflix, of late, has been about making events with its releases. It's not interested in bidding on NFL rights, but if it can host two tentpole Christmas Day games and have mega viewing numbers, it'll get behind that. If it can double viewing by splitting up seasons of “Squid Game,” “Wednesday,” and “Stranger Things,” it'll break its rule about dropping every episode at once. If it can get John Mulaney to fight some teenage boys live on its platform, it'll take that over your standard late-night talk show.

Not everything for Netflix is going to be a K-pop musical that demands a sing-along, but if something really catches on again, could Netflix get creative about giving it its day in theaters? We're spitballing here, but what if there was an R-rated cut of “Happy Gilmore 2” you could only see in theaters? What if Rian Johnson came up with alternate endings for “Wake Up Dead Man” you could see after having watched it on streaming first? Would fans pay to binge a season of “Stranger Things” in theaters ahead of the release of the final season?

Netflix's hand may be forced about theatrical before long. Its biggest tentpole movie on the horizon is Greta Gerwig's “Narnia,” debuting on Netflix Christmas 2026. But before then, it will have an exclusive run on IMAX screens. Doing it that way gives Netflix the opportunity to eventize the film on a premium format for those who want it, all without cannibalizing the audience that would watch it at home.

 










That's the tax, though, Netflix must pay to collaborate with a top-shelf director like Gerwig. Netflix has already lost out on a handful of projects because filmmakers still want their movies in theaters, and as Netflix squeezes bigger and bigger numbers out of these events, the pressure is only mounting for them to do more.

The "Old Town Road" rapper is facing serious criminal charges that could see him serve years in prison if convicted.


Lil Nas X is facing four total felony charges over accusations that he attacked police officers and resisted arrest on Thursday (Aug. 21), while wandering naked in Los Angeles.


	Prosecutors confirmed to Billboard on Monday (Aug. 25) that they had charged “Old Town Road” rapper (born Montero Hill) with three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting executive officer over the alleged incident, which saw the star hospitalized.


	In a statement last week, the Los Angeles Police Department said Lil Nas had “charged at officers and was taken into custody” after they found him wandering nude on Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley. He was later taken to a hospital to be treated for a “possible overdose.” A widely circulated video showed Lil Nas walking the streets in only white underwear and white cowboy boots.

	An arraignment hearing for Lil Nas is scheduled for later on Monday. If eventually convicted of battery with injury on a police officer, the star could face up to three years in prison for each count. Reps for the the rapper did not immediately return a request for comment.


	TMZ first published the video of Nas roaming Los Angeles in the buff. In the video clip, he tells the person filming, “Don't be late to the party tonight,” while mimicking a series of dance moves. The incident came a day after he cleared his Instagram page, updated his name on the app to “Queen Madeline” and began repopulating it with a series of odd posts of himself in a series of costumes.


	Monday's charges came after Lil Nas sat in jail all weekend. On Friday, a spokersperson for the LAPD told Billboard that the artist “cannot be cited out,” and that “it is mandatory that he appears before a judge before he is released.”

Film history is littered with movies unappreciated in their time but reevaluated and rediscovered later — movies like “It's a Wonderful Life,” “Sorcerer,” and John Carpenter's “The Thing,” all of which bombed on their initial release but are now almost unanimously considered cases where audiences and critics got it wrong. But the reverse is also true — there are hundreds of films celebrated in their moment but eventually forgotten in spite of garnering awards attention, and wide audiences.

Two such movies, “The Citadel” (1938) and “The Enchanted Cottage” (1945), are newly available on Blu-ray from Warner Archive and worthy of rediscovery — these are cases where everyone had it right the first time around, a few dated elements in each notwithstanding. That both films have come to be seen as a bit creaky probably has as much to do with the inferior home video transfers they've been subjected to in the past as with any inherent faults — a problem Warner Archive‘s flawless new editions laudably correct.

Like many movies that scoop up accolades in their moment only to have later generations of critics turn on them, “The Citadel” is a social problem picture. In this case, the problem is ethics in the medical profession, as young doctor Andrew Manson (Robert Donat) moves from idealism to disillusionment and back again when faced with ignorant patients who are skeptical of his conclusions, economic hardship, and crooked colleagues. 

 










Actor Donat deftly conveys Manson's drastically shifting perspective, the film meticulously calibrated by master director King Vidor — both Oscar-nominated for their efforts. The movie was also nominated for Best Picture (it lost to “You Can't Take it With You,” whose director Frank Capra also took home a bald swordsman) and Best Screenplay for its clear and concise adaptation of A.J. Cronin's novel by Ian Dalrymple, Frank Wead, and Elizabeth Hill (who would soon become Vidor's third wife).

All these honors were justly bestowed upon “The Citadel,” mounted with a restrained sense of classicism that makes the movie's underlying rage all the more potent. The film's indictment of the medical establishment of the time is rather scathing, and a bit ahead of its time in the risk-averse Hollywood of the 1930s — it feels like the kind of thing Stanley Kramer would have done 20 or 25 years later.

That Vidor not only got away with his controversial position but was lauded for it might be because the story was set in the United Kingdom rather than the United States; the film was a British co-production on which the only Americans were Vidor and actress Rosalind Russell, terrific here as the doctor's love interest. (Her sincere and understated performance comes as quite a surprise for contemporary viewers who know her primarily as the heroine of Howard Hawks' snappy “His Girl Friday.”)

 










“The Citadel” was one of those rare movies like Oliver Stone's “JFK” that actually motivated concrete political action; the shameful conditions the film and its source novel depicted led to the creation of Britain's National Health Service in 1947. In terms of “The Citadel” being considered a work of art by later generations, however, this positive social change was probably more of a hindrance than a help — ever since the French critics of Cahiers du Cinéma (correctly) exalted the work of previously unheralded genre filmmakers like Hawks, Sam Fuller, and Budd Boetticher, there's been a strain of criticism that looks at Vidor's kind of earnest seriousness with a skeptical eye.  

Yet “The Citadel” remains surprisingly entertaining and energetic, and relatively timeless in its concerns — the uninformed boobs who Manson finds himself bumping up against, sadly, do not feel like they come from another era. (The same cannot be said for a hysterical woman Manson treats, who the movie, in one of its few badly dated moments, suggests simply needs a man and kids to shake some sense into her.)

If “The Citadel” feels relatively modern in its attitudes and pleasures, the same can't really be said for “The Enchanted Cottage,” which is more unintentionally hilarious in its weaknesses yet reaches more transcendent heights when it works. An allegory about the transformative power of love, “The Enchanted Cottage” is trite and simplistic when stripped down to its core story elements, yet its emotional power is considerable thanks to director John Cromwell‘s supreme execution — this movie is the ultimate demonstration of Roger Ebert's belief that a movie is not about what it's about, but about how it's about what it's about.

 










The premise of “The Enchanted Cottage,” based on a 1923 play by Arthur Wing Pinero that had already been adapted as a silent film in 1924, is that two emotionally damaged people — a disfigured war veteran (Robert Young) and the homely caretaker of a seaside cottage (Dorothy McGuire) — come together in that cottage and find themselves physically altered by some kind of magical force. As they fall in love, the cottage makes the veteran handsome and the caretaker beautiful — or so they think.

“The Enchanted Cottage” demands a pretty hefty suspension of disbelief from the viewer, particularly since the notion that McGuire is physically repellent is completely laughable — she doesn't wear makeup or have her hair done in the glamorous style of the Hollywood studio era, but that's about the extent of her “homeliness.” The movie more than meets the audience halfway, providing an abundance of genuinely moving moments between the two lovers, generated almost entirely by Young and McGuire's delicate performances and Cromwell's elegant style.

John Cromwell isn't well remembered today — he's probably better known among movie buffs for being “Babe” farmer James Cromwell's dad than for any of the 47 movies he directed — but in his time, he was known as a sturdy craftsman who directed stars like Bette Davis (“Of Human Bondage”), Humphrey Bogart (“Dead Reckoning”), and Jennifer Jones (“Since You Went Away”) in handsomely mounted prestige pictures, often based on established literary properties. That description really doesn't do Cromwell justice, though. At his best, he's able to tease remarkable emotional effects out of even the stodgiest material.

 










“The Enchanted Cottage” is a case in point. Although the screenwriting pedigree is strong — the script is attributed to “Cat People” scribe DeWitt Bodeen and Herman Mankiewicz of “Citizen Kane” fame — the movie is somewhat limited by its antiquated attitudes and comical overreactions to McGuire's plainness. (The “Cat People” connection is apt, given that random men react to McGuire's perfectly fine-looking face with horror suited to something you'd see in a Val Lewton suspense picture.) Yet Cromwell turns even these shortcomings to his advantage when it comes to the filmmaking, relying on clever cinematic means to sell the premise.

McGuire, for example, eschews obvious prosthetics or props in favor of a subtler approach to illustrate the difference between how others see her and how she is seen by the man who loves her. Cromwell had costume designer Eddie Stevenson create doubles of her wardrobe, so that she would have clothes that looked great for the scenes from Young's perspective and ill-fitting costumes for the others.

Cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff does his part too, lighting McGuire from below and with harsh shadows for much of the film while giving her a soft, luminous quality in moments when Young is falling for her, and there are many other areas where “The Enchanted Cottage” creates poetic effects through the sheer Hollywood craftsmanship on display. While McGuire went without prosthetics, for example, Young's war-scarred face is expertly executed — realistic and restrained, with detail that holds up to scrutiny even in the new Blu-ray's razor-sharp imagery. 

 










This all enables Cromwell to create a sophisticated sense of alternating points of view without resorting to explicitly subjective point of view shots; the camerawork is invisible in the classical Hollywood style, but it's expressive and powerful. The special effects work is outstanding as well, with a combination of matte paintings and location work that vividly evokes a rural New England without ever getting more than a few miles outside of Santa Monica.

The seriousness with which everyone on the film, from Cromwell and the actors on down to the costume, camera, and optical effects departments, treats the material has a magical effect not unlike that of the cottage on its inhabitants — it transforms something clunky into something beautiful by sheer force of will and artistry. And it's certainly never looked more beautiful at home than it does on the new Warner Archive Blu-ray, which maintains the label's consistently high standards for image and sound quality. 

Unlike “The Citadel,” “The Enchanted Cottage” didn't get any love from the Academy, and the reviews were mixed, but it was a big hit with audiences, making a strong enough impression that Carol Burnett could parody it decades later with a TV skit called “The Enchanted Hovel.” Seeing “The Enchanted Cottage” restored to its original luster, it's easy to see why the movie worked — 81 years later, it still does.

After a stint in jail over the weekend, the musician's defense attorneys said after his arraignment hearing that they expect he'll be released on bail later Monday.



		By Winston Cho, Ethan Millman 

	August 25, 2025 10:56am	




Lil Nas X pleaded not guilty to the four felony charges filed against him Monday morning during an arraignment hearing in Van Nuys, with his bail set for $75,000. 


	The rapper, whose real name is Montero Hill, was arrested on Thursday morning after he was seen roaming the streets of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, nearly naked and seemingly delirious. At the time, he was booked on a misdemeanor of obstructing an officer and was jailed through the weekend at the Valley Jail in Van Nuys, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff records.

	He's been charged with battery and resisting a law enforcement officer. The former carries a sentence of up to one year in prison and a fine, both of which could be increased if an officer was injured, constituting a felony. After his arrest, the artist was taken to a hospital for a suspected overdose and was later discharged before being taken to a jail.


	Speaking with reporters outside the courthouse Monday, Hill's lawyer Drew Findling said Hill will pay bail and he expects Hill will be out of jail later today.

	During the arraignment, Christy O'Connor, another attorney on Hill's defense team, called the incident “an aberration in [Hill's] life” noting that the rapper has no prior criminal history, and no previous history of violence. She disputed the police report suggestion that the incident was drug-related, stating it was too early and reports haven't come back yet. The judge overseeing the arraignment Monday called for Hill to sign up for a drug treatment program. 

	











	“He's never been in trouble for a split second in his existence, we're not going to let one little event change the trajectory of his amazing life,” Findling said. “There's no way to have a sense of what happened this immediately, but we're going to look into it and do the right thing.”


	When asked whether this was a substance or a medical or emotional issue, Findling said “there's no way for us to know right now.”


	“Anybody that has kids, you hear about things like this all the time,” Findling continued. “Don't forget, he's 26 years old. It's not unusual for something like this to happen, particularly when you have the pressure of being recognized internationally like him.”


	Findling said Monday not to “judge somebody by the worst moment in their life.”


	Hill was first caught on camera by TMZ in the early hours of Thursday morning, strutting down a near-empty Ventura Boulevard, wearing nothing but underwear and a pair of white cowboy boots.


	Lil Nas X, who released his Days Before Dreamboy EP back in March, has been struggling with health issues throughout 2025. Back in April, he shared an update on social media saying he'd suffered partial facial paralysis. A month later, he had to cancel a headlining appearance for West Hollywood's Outloud pride music festival. At the time the cancellation was announced, the festival said in a statement that “we've been in close contact with Lil Nas X and his team regarding an ongoing medical issue.”


	“After my recent hospital visit, I – like all of you should – must prioritize my health and getting back to 100%,” the rapper said in a statement at the time.

	











	Hill's father Robert Stafford gave a brief update following the arraignment as well, telling reporters that Hill is “doing great mentally” following the arrest.


	“We said shed tears, we shed laughter, but he's in great spirits,” Stafford said of his first conversation with his son after the arrest. “God is good all the time. Keep him in your prayers.”

When it comes to “Dancing With the Stars,” the ballroom isn't the only place the pro dancers know how to turn heads. One recent Instagram post featuring some of the male cast members looking all dapper has left “DWTS” fans in a frenzy, thinking Britt Stewart's wedding has taken place.

A post shared by Gleb Savchenko (@glebsavchenkoofficial)

The frenzy started when Gleb Savchenko shared a dapper group photo with fellow pro dancers Pasha Pashkov, Sasha Farber, and Brandon Armstrong. While most of the comments seemed to focus on the men and fans swooning over them, others had some bold theories on why all the men were together and looking so dressed up.

“Dancing With the Stars” fans know that pro Britt Stewart has plans to wed her season 31 partner, Daniel Durant. Rumors have said the wedding would take place this summer, but the happy couple has never confirmed this information.

However, fans were quick to assume, especially when so many “DWTS” faces were suited up together. It would be logical to assume the looks were from a wedding weekend.

Savchenko shared the photo on his Instagram with no caption, so no hints are available there. All four men are looking all done up for whatever the special occasion was.

It didn't take long for “DWTS” fans to flood the comments with love for these pros. One person wrote, “What a squaddddd!!! 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍.”

Another fan wrote, “Love this Love you all !!! You guys look FANTASTIC ♥️♥️♥️♥️,” and a third commented, “Okay you all look SO GOOD! 🔥”

The love didn't just stop with fans, as fellow “DWTS” pro and Pashkov's partner, Daniella Karagach, commented a series of heart-eyed emojis in the comment section.

A post shared by Sasha Farber (@sashafarber1)

The male pro dancers' choice of formal attire quickly sparked questions online from “Dancing With the Stars” fans about what event had the stars dressed to impress. 

Stewart's wedding is supposed to take place sometime this year. We have seen bridal party photos with the “DWTS” cast. It seems only logical that the actual wedding would be taking place soon, right?

One fan wrote, “This has to be from Britt's wedding 😍,” and another added, “This is giving wedding attire — maybe Britt's wedding.”

One other fan just asked, “Is that from Britt's wedding or something else?”

Farber also shared an image on his Instagram, which he was asking for opinions on glasses or no glasses. However, he is dressed in the same outfit and gave Derek Hough credit for taking the photo. More “DWTS” faces in the crowd, so it just seems logical it was for Britt's wedding, right?

	After a popular YouTuber who entraps suspected sexual predators he contacts through Roblox was banned from the youth-targeted gaming platform this month, the company found itself defending its approach to moderation and user safety. But the furor over harm to minors hasn't been limited to the game's community. Now a Congressman, state officials, and families are demanding accountability and bringing legal actions, saying that Roblox has allowed its platform to become a festering hub for horrific child exploitation. Even Chris Hansen, best known as the host of the sting segment To Catch a Predator on Dateline NBC, is looking into stories of grooming and abuse on Roblox. “When I tell you what we've learned in terms of what these predators are getting these kids to do, it's shocking,” Hansen tells Rolling Stone.


	Trying to expose and confront potential sex offenders in videos to be posted online — a practice sometimes referred to as “pedophile hunting” — is a booming genre of social media content. Among the prominent personalities in this space is a 22-year-old creator known as “Schlep” (his real first name is Michael, though he does not share his surname for privacy reasons), who says he was groomed by a contracted Roblox developer he met in the game while in his early teens. This individual, he says, exposed him to violent and pornographic content and engaged him in sexual conversations. According to statements from Schlep and his legal team, he eventually attempted suicide as a result, but afterward, when his mother contacted the company, they say they took no action against Schlep's abuser, only banning this person years later following a complaint from another developer. (The company has not commented on these claims.)

	











	The experience led Schlep to devote himself to outing would-be groomers and child abusers. With the help of a team of collaborators, he poses as underage “decoys” in virtual Roblox environments, responds to adult users who contact him, lets them make incriminating statements unprompted, then arranges real-world meetups where the individual in question is detained by law enforcement. He claims he has secured the arrest of six people over more than a year of pursuing what he calls “catches,” with only one arrest not leading to prosecution. Two more cases are likely headed toward plea agreements, he says, though none of the alleged predators have yet to be convicted.

	Schlep tells Rolling Stone that it has always been his intention to work with Roblox to make the platform safer, but that the company has been a “brick wall” when he seeks to open up areas of cooperation. “I've made it clear since the beginning,” he says. “After one of my first catches, I was like, ‘Hey, I want to work with you. I was a victim of the platform. This is why I do it. And I would love some form of communication where I can just directly report these people to you, because their reports just don't work.' I have lost total faith in their moderation and report system. A lot of victims don't have every chat log. They don't have every voice call recorded. We have everything. We record the chat logs on mobile and scroll through them for the cops, and we give that to Roblox, too. It's enough for the cops where they're willing to charge and prosecute these people, but it's not enough for Roblox to take action on their platform.”


	The older videos on Schlep's main YouTube account, which has well over a million subscribers, were often critical of Roblox, sometimes highlighting inappropriate games hosted on the platform that weren't being removed. It was not until he pivoted to predator hunting, however, that his videos began going massively viral, escalating the debate over whether Roblox does enough to protect its young user base (about 40 percent of its users are under 13). In the videos, which appear with copious disclaimers labeling the content “edutainment” and instructing viewers “DO NOT TRY THIS AT ALL,” Schlep narrates as his ballcap-wearing Roblox avatar. He walks you through his chats — read by voice actors — with people who initiate explicit conversations in Discord servers associated with Roblox's adult-themed “Condo” sub-communities, conversations that continue in this vein after the suspect establishes that they are over 18 and the decoy has indicated that they are a minor. Once a suspect suggests a plan to meet in real life for sex, Schlep arranges a rendezvous, typically with another predator catcher sitting the person down in a public space to explain themselves before police arrive.

	As Schlep racked up arrests, he gained the mantle of an online folk hero, while Roblox was pilloried by viewers declaring that he had revealed crucial weaknesses in its safety protocols. Finally, on Aug. 7, under increasing pressure, Roblox issued a statement on how it collaborates with law enforcement to combat safety threats, touting their direct links with the FBI and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). It also clarified its policy against “vigilante groups,” similar to policies for apps including Discord, TikTok, and Snapchat. “Unfortunately, there are cases of vigilante groups or individuals violating our policies to entrap users or otherwise self-police the platform,” the statement noted. “Actions taken by vigilante groups increase the risk of more users being exposed to bad actors and can delay enforcement efforts by both Roblox and law enforcement.” Roblox added that vigilantism could result in “removal and banning, where warranted.”

	











	The next day, Schlep received a cease and desist notice from Roblox informing him that his account would be closed for violations related to his efforts to ensnare predators, including “simulated child endangerment conversations,” waiting to report suspicious user behavior to Roblox, and directing users to move conversations off platform. The company instructed him to make no further attempt to access the platform, warning that this could result in legal repercussions.


	Schlep says he received no prior warnings about violating guidelines and that this is the sole direct communication he's ever received from the company. He retained the services of a law firm that has also brought multiple private lawsuits against Roblox for alleged harms to minors. Nationwide, more than a dozen of these suits are now proceeding, with several coming on the heels of Schlep's removal from the platform. In a recently filed Georgia case, a mother has alleged that her nine-year-old son was exposed to pornography and coerced into sending explicit images of himself to adults posing as children on the site. Other tech companies, including Meta, are regularly named as co-defendants in these cases — again, because conversations veering toward inappropriate topics often migrate to other platforms, such as Instagram or Discord. Big Tech in general has come in for renewed scrutiny on child sexual exploitation, with roleplaying AI chatbots being another area of concern. But Roblox is now squarely in the crosshairs of many legal actions thanks to its very young user demographic.


	Schlep's followers were outraged at his ban, arguing that he had stepped in to address an issue that Roblox preferred to sweep under the rug. Roblox put out a followup statement on the risks raised by vigilantes, but it did little to stem the backlash. YouTuber KreekCraft posted a video explaining that he was quitting the Roblox Video Stars Program, the platform's paid partnership system for top creators, over the way Roblox had long handled criticism of its safeguards. “I feel like this decision isn't entirely based on the Schlep situation,” he said, noting that the safety problems had been “bubbling for years” and that “Roblox just refuses to acknowledge, refuses to listen to the community.” 


	A week after Schlep's ban, the company unveiled stricter prohibitions on romantic and sexual content, announcing it would take action even against material that “implied” sexual activity and was rolling out new technology to detect “violative scenes.” Perhaps this rang hollow after recent headlines about Roblox CEO David Baszucki floating the idea of the platform attracting more adult users by offering online dating services. A petition to remove Baszucki from his executive role has drawn more than 230,000 signatures to date. (Roblox has not publicly commented on this.)

	











	Schlep argues that the cleanup of explicit games is “surface level,” and that “if you go any deeper, you will still see these games everywhere.” Steven Vanderporten, an attorney representing Schlep, adds that such changes were woefully overdue. “They have had 20 years of these incidents happening, 20 years of notice, 20 years of opportunities to implement safeguards that they're now rolling out, and they're on a big PR campaign saying how much they're focused on safety features,” he says. In Roblox, Vanderporten sees a company “covering up their tracks, trying to silence their critics.” 


	It's a common sentiment across social media. Since the cease and desist, Schlep and his supporters have pushed a #FreeSchlep campaign, with some staging virtual protests on his behalf within Roblox. (A handful of users claim to have received disciplinary warnings for displaying that slogan in the game, though the company denies this, with a spokesperson saying they “value open debate on the platform,” and that any moderation “was likely linked to another policy violation.”) The hashtag was taken up by Louisiana State Rep. Laurie Schlegel, who on X asserted that Roblox “has a history of refusing to take action against sexual predators” and makes far fewer reports to NCMEC than other apps. (NCMEC did not respond to requests for comment on the efficacy of Roblox's safety measures or policies against vigilante behavior.) These attacks came as Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murrill, filed a blistering lawsuit against Roblox, describing it as “overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety.”


	Roblox defended itself against Murrill's claims in a press release. “Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue,” the company said. “No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ.”  


	Rod Breslau, co-founding editor of ESPN Esports and a consultant to companies in the gaming and streaming scene, observes that Roblox could have taken earlier coverage of their safety failures as a cue to bolster their safety practices well before Schlep's videos took off. Instead, they are now facing the full brunt of the political class. “Everyone in this industry knows that Roblox is a platform that has been primarily targeted to and played by minors,” he says. “It should not take an independent Roblox YouTuber like Schlep doing vigilante-style To Catch a Predator takedowns to elicit the attention of a state attorney general — and then and only then do Roblox come back with an official statement and a change in policy on sexual content on the platform. There have already been multiple deep investigative pieces by journalists on these issues and dozens of arrests of alleged predators! It's crazy.” 

	











	The outcry over Roblox's safety standards has also attracted the attention of Rep. Ro Khanna, who launched his own petition, titled “Stand with Us to Protect Kids and Save Roblox.” It states that “powerful tech companies can do more” to stop child exploitation but only calls upon Roblox by name to bolster its protections. He says that more than 100,000 people have signed. “I've heard from creators and concerned parents about the urgent need for Roblox to do more to protect kids online,” Khanna tells Rolling Stone. “These conversations have included stories of inappropriate interactions and algorithmic suggestions. I am collaborating with the community to listen and explore what actions can and must be taken to protect kids on the platform. I will continue my fight for accountability.”


	As Roblox weathers this firestorm, the company is nevertheless holding firm in its anti-vigilante line to justify Schlep's ban. “Taking the law into your hands isn't safe in the real world and it's not safe online,” a Roblox spokesperson tells Rolling Stone. “That's why we work with law enforcement to hold bad actors accountable. Many experts agree independent actors impersonating others and luring users to other platforms for sexually explicit conversations can never be safe. The company also shared quotes from police, attorneys, and academics describing how vigilante groups may interfere with investigations or employ methods that undermine criminal cases against offenders. They may obtain evidence through extralegal means that can't be used in prosecutions, for example. Online child safety expert Jessica Chalmers concurs that “vigilante predator hunting for YouTube content is dangerous” and can create more risk. “Turning something as serious as child safety into entertainment also doesn't sit right with me,” she tells Rolling Stone.  


	But Schlep says Roblox is distorting the nature of his content. “I don't view myself as a vigilante,” he says. “‘Vigilante' means that you are going ahead and taking the law into your own hands, right? It'd be like, if I slap the handcuffs on them — or you see a lot of the predator catchers where they beat [suspects] up.” He argues that the company has contradicted itself by arguing that he should notify them of suspected abuse before the police. “If you read their policy, it specifically says law enforcement is best positioned to take action related to this sort of stuff,” he says, which is somewhat at odds with Roblox's insistence in their cease and desist letter that he should have reported suspicious behavior to them first. Schlep has spoken with Hansen about this very question, and says the famed predator catcher told him that he “always goes to law enforcement first,” while “social media platforms come second.” 

	











	Hansen, as it happens, is currently at work on a documentary about child exploitation on Roblox, and shared last week on X that Schlep would have a hand in the project. He tells Rolling Stone that the news of their partnership has already brought more attention to the topic. “Just by announcing that we're doing it and collaborating with this young content creator, we've had millions and millions of views and thousands of comments and tips,” he says. “It's difficult to keep up with of people who are reaching out to say, ‘Here's what happened to my kid on Roblox.'” He has yet to interview leadership at the company but questions their decision to ban Schlep. “Instead of saying, ‘Look, we're going to make you our young security emissary and have you help us,'” Hansen says, “they shut him down and banned him from the site, even though some of the cases he exposed were criminally prosecuted. So we will get his story.”


	Internet child safety expert Fareedah Shaheed agrees that Roblox could be doing more to mitigate abuse, including working alongside motivated activists like Schlep. “Roblox does have a number of safety tools in place that are helpful, but there's still a long way to go in how they handle reports of grooming and how they engage with creators raising awareness of the problem,” she says, noting that it's clear Schlep “genuinely cares about protecting kids.” 


	“I wish Roblox would find ways to work with creators like him to strengthen protections and build trust for both parents and children,” Shaheed says, calling his ban “a step back” for the company. “As someone who was groomed in online games I loved, I know the solution isn't just more technology or placing blame,” she explains. “It's bringing the online and offline village together to solve the bigger problems.” Potential corporate reform will naturally take some time, and there's no telling if theoretical changes in Roblox policies would result in the overturning of Schlep's ban. In the meantime, the company may have to brace for additional lawsuits or investigations. Once politicians and parents have identified your product as a significant danger to kids, it can be all but impossible to rid the brand of that toxic reputation.

	Still, Shaheed notes that Roblox is hardly unique in struggling to ensure child safety. “At the end of the day, what we're seeing on Roblox isn't just a Roblox problem,” she says. “These risks exist in any open-world, open-communication game, and tackling them requires collaboration across companies, experts, and communities.” Chalmers says that in addition to making the most of parental controls, “explaining the risks” to children accessing internet platforms and letting them know “how to block and report anyone who makes them uncomfortable” is essential for their protection. “Ultimately, an educated child is the best filter we can give them,” she says. “No setting can replace that.” 

	











	Of course, for many, the damage is already done, and it seems there's no shortage of victims who believe that Roblox could have prevented what happened to them. Devastating accounts of child abuse are tough for any tech company to answer. But the challenge is all the more pronounced when you're supposed to be supervising a safe place for kids to play.

A key tenet of creating comedy is escalation. How do you take an idea and stretch it to its extreme, surreal conclusion? For two seasons, Nathan Fielder's The Rehearsal has practiced this on scales grand and small. The comedian's pitch to the audience in the series premiere was: What if you could really practice a potentially awkward or embarrassing social situation in advance? Cut to season two as Fielder flies a commercial airliner alone across the Atlantic. But this constant ratcheting up happens within individual episodes, and there is perhaps no episode that put this to better use than “Pilot's Code.”  

The episode, which earned Fielder an Emmy nomination for directing, comes in the middle of his quest to improve airline safety by doing the same with communication between pilots. This premise is mostly sidelined in “Pilot's Code,” which instead goes eccentrically philosophical with the question: How can we really understand what goes on in another person's head? The episode begins with a couple who cloned a beloved pet dog but are unhappy that it does not behave like its progenitor. Our host, using his much-ballyhooed Fielder Method, attempts to recreate the exact circumstances of the first dog's upbringing, hiring actors (and animals) to replicate the couple's home as it was in 2011. Then he schemes to do the same with himself but as Captain Sully Sullenberger, the pilot behind the Miracle On The Hudson landing. 

It's not hard to see why this episode was submitted in the directing category. As Fielder's voiceover explains with characteristic deadpan that “what you're about to witness is going to seem weird,” we watch as he shaves off his body hair, puts on a diaper, and enters a set designed to look like an infant's nursery and scaled to render Fielder the size of a baby. From here, we follow as he speed-runs through Sullenberger's childhood, his mother first a giant puppet and then, with his dad now in the picture, an actor on stilts to maintain the difference that Sully would see as a child. The images are bizarre and a little disturbing, filmed in a naturalistic, documentary style and performed, by Fielder, almost apathetically. The resulting mélange is so off-kilter that we have to rely on him to pilot us through the rest of the experiment.  

﻿

With his “parents,” Fielder-as-Sully breastfeeds from a giant marionette, milk pouring out from the papier-mâché nipple and overflowing from his mouth onto his diaper-clad body as a wooden voiceover reads, “I tried not to think about the fact that I was a 41-year-old man and just did my best to be present in the moment.” Then, after researching extensively with Sully's memoir, Fielder suggests that as the pilot landed the plane on the Hudson, he popped in his earbuds to listen to Evanescence's “Bring Me To Life.” By now, after the carnivalesque childhood sequence, Fielder's suggestion that this is plausible goes down more easily. It's also ridiculous, but it underscores why The Rehearsal succeeds. 

Fielder directed the entire second season of The Rehearsal, and nearly every episode has an inimitable image. His depiction of Paramount as Nazi Germany, of actors singing public-domain songs in a bar-cum-airport set as part of a pretend singing competition, of himself all stone-faced and flying a jet over the welcoming sands of Namibia: Fielder's vision created the kind of appointment TV with “did you see that?” moments that are increasingly rare. And he deserves to be honored—even among some stiff competition—for sticking that tricky landing.

In just its second year in existence, The Popcorn List — a survey of acclaimed (but still undistributed) feature films that debuted at major or regional film festivals over the past year and come highly recommended by festival programmers — is already taking a big step forward. Next month, the creators of the list will host various pop up screening events, both at theaters and virtually, to show off the very same films they've been championing. 

The Pop Up Series includes eight films from the 2025 list — seven from first-time feature directors, six directed by women, three documentaries, and five fiction features — and will not only provide a space for eager audiences to see this stellar films, but will also offer a unique model for both promotion and profit.

The series will offer what's being billed as a “collective and transparent model,” and participating filmmakers (and other partners) will work from a centralized promotion strategy guided by Product of Culture, connecting their projects with new eyeballs and uplifting all the films in the series (while also bringing awareness to The Popcorn List as a whole).

 










In addition to a traditional indie film 50/50 box office split, a portion of every ticket sold will go into a filmmaker solidarity pool, split evenly among all participating titles. Filmmakers retain full rights to their films. Tax deductible donations, which will contribute to the campaign, can be made here via TFC's Fiscal Sponsorship program. 

“For any film in today's landscape, finding new audience touchpoints is essential — and working collaboratively to support each others' films is an exciting model,” said TPL co-founder Lela Meadow-Conner and Kathy Susca of The Film Collaborative in an official statement. “We're grateful to all of the players — the festival programmers, the cinemas, our partners who are helping this take shape and especially the filmmakers, who are leveraging their social capital to highlight one another's films in addition to their own. We hope this will be a brand building opportunity for them as storytellers, and exciting for audiences who are looking for new stories, now and in the future.” 

In-person screenings will take place at various venues — cinéSPEAK (Philadelphia), The Downer Theatre (Milwaukee), FilmScene (Iowa City), The Independent Picture House (Charlotte), The Roxie Theater (San Francisco), Sidewalk Cinema (Birmingham), SIFF Film Center (Seattle), The State Theatre (Traverse City),  The Nightlight Cinema (Akron), and Vidiots (Los Angeles) — September 2 – 28. All films will include a pre-recorded introduction from the filmmakers and the programmers who recommended the film to The Popcorn List. You can get in-person tickets here.

 










Virtual screenings will be available September 25 – 30 via Eventive. They will also include include a pre-recorded introduction from the filmmakers and the programmers who recommended the film to The Popcorn List. Those tickets are available here.

KPop Demon Hunters is also the first soundtrack with four Hot 100 top 10s at all in nearly 30 years.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden” shines again atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and contributes to history for its parent album, the soundtrack to the smash animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters.


	“Golden” rebounds a spot for a second week at No. 1, two weeks after it first led the Hot 100, as KPop Demon Hunters becomes the first soundtrack to generate four simultaneous top 10s over the chart's 67-year archives. Also from the album, Saja Boys' “Your Idol” holds at its No. 4 high and their “Soda Pop” surges 10-5 — while HUNTR/X slays with its second top 10, as “How It's Done” bursts 14-10.


KPop Demon Hunters becomes just the fifth soundtrack with four Hot 100 top 10s at all, and the first since Waiting To Exhale spun off a record five in 1995-96.


	Upon the original coronation of “Golden,” HUNTR/X — the singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI (in the roles of the film's characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey) — became the first female group associated with Korean pop to top the Hot 100. The act also became the first all-woman collective of three or more members to reign in 24 years, since Destiny's Child with “Bootylicious” for two weeks in August 2001.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 30, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Aug. 26. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 33.8 million official streams (up 3% week-over-week), 16.2 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 39%) and 8,000 sold (up 11%) in the United States Aug. 15-21.


	The track scores a fifth week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; debuts at No. 42 on Radio Songs; and holds at its No. 2 best on Digital Song Sales.


	The soundtrack to Netflix's empowering, action-packed and heartwarming KPop Demon Hunters hauls in a fourth Hot 100 top 10, as HUNTR/X's “How It's Done,” the act's second top 10, after “Golden,” bounds 14-10. “How It's Done” was driven by 17.2 million streams (up 2%) in the tracking week.


	HUNTR/X and KPop Demon Hunters adversaries Saja Boys come to a draw, each with two Hot 100 top 10s: the latter's “Your Idol” keeps at its No. 4 high and “Soda Pop” leaps 10-5. The former boasts a gain of nearly 1% to 20.4 million streams and the latter, a 4% lift to 18.4 million. (“It is annoyingly catchy,” HUNTR/X's Rumi concedes of “Soda Pop” in the film.)


	Despite their on-screen combat, HUNTR/X and Saja Boys — whose music is voiced by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee — combine to make KPop Demon Hunters the first soundtrack ever to generate four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s.


	It's also the first soundtrack with at least four Hot 100 top 10s overall since Waiting To Exhale reeled off a record five in 1995-96. The only other soundtracks with four top 10s each: Saturday Night Fever (in 1977-78), Grease (1978) and Prince and the Revolution's Purple Rain (1984-85).


	Meanwhile, the last time a soundtrack sent three songs to the Hot 100's top five simultaneously, as KPop Demon Hunters has now done via “Golden,” “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop”? April 15, 1978, when three Saturday Night Fever songs strutted in the tier: Bee Gees' “Night Fever” (No. 1) and “Stayin' Alive” (No. 2) and Yvonne Eliiman's “If I Can't Have You” (also written by the trio; No. 5).


	“It's so thrilling that people are hearing the songs in two ways,” KPop Demon Hunters executive music producer Ian Eisendrath recently told Billboard. “Some are loving the film, and the film is making the songs hits … and then some people are just encountering the songs, and the songs are making the film a hit.”


	The movie's profile will be further enhanced thanks to sing-along theater screenings held Aug. 23-24, with any related boost in its songs to be reflected on next week's Billboard charts, dated Sept. 6 and encompassing streaming, airplay and sales Aug. 22-28.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It claims a 10th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73.8 million, essentially no percentage change) and a 13th week atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the list made its seasonal return after Memorial Day.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, is steady at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It adds a 14th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” falls to No. 6 from its No. 5 Hot 100 high.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which topped the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and wrapped as the year's No. 1 song, keeps at No. 7 — as it adds a record-extending 105th week on the chart overall and a record-padding, and landmark, 75th week in the top 10.


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Justin Bieber's “Daisies” drops 6-8 and Wallen's “Just in Case” descends 8-9, both after reaching No. 2.

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Annette Bening has joined the leading cast of the Paramount+ Yellowstone Beth and Rip spinoff series, which now has a working title, The Dutton Ranch. She will star opposite Kelly Reilly, Cole Hauser and Finn Little, who will reprise their original roles. Additionally, Chad Feehan (Lawmen: Bass Reeves) will serve as showrunner of the offshoot.


The Dutton Ranch, home to Beth Dutton (Reilly) and Rip Wheeler (Hauser), is a testament to the peace they sought, fought for, and nearly died for, as they've come to cherish their 7,000-acre land. With tough times and stiff competition, Beth and Rip do what they must to survive, all while ensuring Carter (Little) becomes the man he's supposed to be.

	











	Bening will play Beulah Jackson, the powerful, cunning and charming head of a major ranch in Texas.




			Watch on Deadline		







As Deadline revealed in December, the show is expected to remain on the same present-day timeline as the original series, with the new offshoot sharing the most DNA with the mothership of any show in the universe to date.


Yellowstone followed the Dutton family that controls the largest contiguous cattle ranch in the United States. Reilly's Beth is John Dutton III's (Kevin Costner) daughter, a former head of acquisitions at the Schwartz & Meyer financial firm. Hauser's jaded ranch foreman Rip, who first came to John Dutton as a young boy on the run after killing his stepfather to protect his mother, learned how to be a cowboy from John, who treated him like a son.

	











Yellowstone was co-created by Sheridan and John Linson, who executive produce with Art Linson, Costner, David C. Glasser, Bob Yari, Stephen Kay, Michael Friedman, Christina Voros and Keith Cox. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.


	The Yellowstone Universe also includes prequels 1883 and 1923, both of which have concluded their runs. Two other upcoming offshoots join the Beth and Rip series on the slate: The Madison for Paramount+, led by Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals for CBS, led by Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton. Additional universe entries 1944 and 6666 previously were announced as being in development.


	From Paramount Television Studios and 101 Studios, The Dutton Ranch is executive produced by Sheridan, Glasser, the Linsons, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Yari, Friedman, Feehan, Voros, Reilly, Hauser and Cox.


	Bening is a BAFTA and Golden Globe winner with multiple Oscar, Tony and Emmy nominations under her belt. She received Oscar noms for the films The Grifters (1990), American Beauty (1999), Being Julia (2004), The Kids Are Alright (2010) and the Netflix biopic Nyad (2023). Her Emmy nomination was for her work as the titular character in the TV movie Mrs. Harris (2005). On stage, Bening was last seen alongside Tracy Letts in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons, which earned her a Tony nomination.


	She will next be seen in the Apple TV+ limited series Lucky, working opposite Anya Taylor-Joy. Previously, Bening starred in and executive produced the Peacock limited series Apples Never Fall. On the big screen, she will next star in The Bride, Maggie Gyllenhaal's Frankenstein movie.


	Bening is repped by CAA and Gochman Law Group.

The band is also confident it will return for an "even bigger" American tour in the future.

	The members of Kneecap have canceled all of their upcoming tour dates in the United States due to scheduling conflicts that have arisen as a result of their ongoing alleged terror offense legal saga. 


	In a message posted to Instagram on Monday (Aug. 25), bandmates Mo Chara, Móglaí Bap and DJ Próvaí explained that they had “bad news” to share with American fans who had been looking forward to seeing them play a run of sold-out stateside shows this fall. “Due to the proximity of our next court hearing in London to the first date of the tour, as the British government continues [its] witch-hunt, we will have to cancel all 15 U.S. tour dates in October,” the trio wrote.

	











	“But once we win our court case, which we will, we promise to embark on an even bigger tour to all you great heads,” Kneecap continued. “We also have some good news. We will be sharing something very special for U.S. fans next week so that we can still ink in with you all in October. It's top secret for now, but all will be revealed next week — stay tuned.”


	Noting that refunds for the American shows will be available at people's respective points of purchase, the band ended its statement with a strong message. “‘The revolution will be no re-run, brothers,'” it read. “‘The revolution will live.' FREE PALESTINE!”

	











	The cancelations mark just the latest development in Kneecap's legal battle with the British police, who in May charged frontman Mo Chara with allegedly showing support for terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah at a November 2024 concert in London. The band members — who have been outspoken in their support for Palestinian people amid the war in Gaza, notably accusing Israel of “genocide” during their Coachella set in April — quickly responded to the charge, calling it a “carnival of distraction” in a statement on Instagram.


	Kneecap has also denied ever supporting Hamas or Hezbollah. Legal proceedings involving Chara will resume on Sept. 26, at which time a judge will decide whether he will be required to stand trial. In the meantime, his legal team is working to have the case thrown out.

"Someday I'll wish upon a star + wake + find the darkness far behind me," E. Y. (Yip) Harburg scrawled in pencil on a piece of yellow legal paper. And so was born a classic.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	The Library of Congress has acquired rare music and lyric sketches from composer Harold Arlen and lyricist E.Y. “Yip” Harburg, who collaborated on the song score to the iconic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.


	The acquisition includes 35 manuscript items, including the first handwritten drafts of music and lyrics from some of the most beloved songs from the film classic, which starred Judy Garland. The collection also includes draft song lists and correspondence from the film's director, Mervyn Leroy.

	











	The crown jewel of the collection: the only lyric sketch for “Over the Rainbow” known to exist. “Someday I'll wish upon a star + wake + find the darkness far behind me,” Harburg scrawled in pencil on a piece of yellow legal paper. This is believed to be the start of his creative process for a song that has proved timeless and universal, recorded by such varied artists as Garland, Ray Charles, Willie Nelson, Patti LaBelle, Barbra Streisand and Placido Domingo.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Over the Rainbow” won an Oscar for best original song, while Herbert Stothart's score won best original score – making The Wizard of Oz the first double song/score winner in Oscar history. Garland's recording of “Over the Rainbow” was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1981 and the National Recording Registry in 2016. The full soundtrack album was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2006.


	The film was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Film Registry in 1989.


	“Over the Rainbow” topped the American Film Institute's “100 Years…100 Songs,” a 2004 list of the top songs in American film from the 20th century. The Wizard of Oz ranked third (behind Singin' in the Rain and the original West Side Story) on AFI's 2006 Greatest Movie Musicals list.


	Additional collection highlights include:


	“Harold Arlen's contributions to The Wizard of Oz have profoundly shaped American culture,” Nicholas A. Brown-Cáceres, acting chief of the Library's Music Division, said in a statement. “The donation of these manuscripts and papers represents a treasured addition in conjunction with our various Oz-themed holdings. This gift not only honors Arlen and Harburg's imaginative genius but also preserves the legacy of the music that has captured the hearts of generations. The Library is grateful to the late Mrs. Arlen and the Arlen family for sharing these artifacts with the American people.”


	A small display will be featured in the Great Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building beginning in October that features original music and lyric manuscripts from the creation of The Wizard of Oz and Wicked. These treasures from the Music Division's Harold Arlen Collection and ASCAP Foundation Collection document the creation of the soundtracks to the iconic films inspired by Frank L. Baum's classic novel The Wizard of Oz. This display will be on view from Oct. 23 through Jan. 7, 2026.

	











	The recently acquired Wizard of Oz material joins the Harold Arlen Collection, which was donated by Arlen's sister-in-law, Rita Arlen, beginning in 2022. That collection includes a musical sketchbook, a large notebook of music and lyric sketches for the musical House of Flowers (1954), hundreds of photographs and Arlen's original typescript screenplay for The Wizard of Oz.


	Additionally, the existing Arlen Collection contains correspondence from Arlen's friends, family and colleagues including Harburg, Mercer, Streisand, Louis Armstrong, Fred Astaire, Irving Berlin, Truman Capote, Bing Crosby, Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers and Frank Sinatra.


	It also includes several artworks such as three portraits by George Gershwin, including a rare self-portrait dated 1929 that Gershwin sent to Arlen. The Library also acquired Arlen's original sketch for his searing torch song, “Stormy Weather,” and his manuscript for “The Man That Got Away” from Garland's A Star is Born (1954).


	Arlen's other classic songs included in the 2022 collection include three other Oscar-nominated songs: “Blues in the Night,”  “Ac-Cent-Chu-Ate the Positive” and “The Man That Got Away,” as well as “Come Rain or Come Shine,” “Get Happy,” “It's Only a Paper Moon,” “One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)” and “A Sleepin' Bee.”


	Arlen wrote the liner notes for Streisand's Grammy-winning 1963 debut album. His notes brought him his only Grammy nomination – in the category of best album notes. (Most of his best work preceded the arrival of the Grammys in 1959). Streisand returned the favor in 1966, when she sang two songs on Arlen's debut album, Harold Sings Arlen (With Friend). She was the friend, of course, and sang “Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead” (from Oz) and “House of Flowers.”

	











	Harburg and Arlen were the first two recipients of the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Johnny Mercer Award, that organization's highest honor. They received the award in 1981 and 1982, respectively. Arlen received a trustees award from the Recording Academy posthumously in 1987.


	The Harold Arlen Collection joins dozens of other songwriter collections in the Library's Music Division. These include the manuscripts and papers of Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George & Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers & Oscar Hammerstein, Alan Jay Lerner & Frederick Loewe, Billy Strayhorn, Leonard Bernstein, Jeanine Tesori, Leslie Bricusse, Burt Bacharach, Harry Chapin and Judy Collins.


	The Library of Congress is the world's largest library, offering access to the creative record of the United States — and extensive materials from around the world — both on-site and online.

Snoop Dogg is opening up about a terrifying experience he had at the movies—one that was seemingly so distressing it took him three whole years to talk about it. No it wasn't at a screening of Hereditary or Weapons or anything that would be slightly less embarrassing for the “Gin And Juice” rapper. Snoop Dogg couldn't handle a children's movie—and a Pixar one at that—for one specific reason: lesbians.

Really. The rapper recalled taking his grandson to see 2022's Lightyear in an interview with the It's Giving podcast, during which he discussed seeing one of the film's protagonists raise a baby with another woman. “Well, my grandson, in the middle of the movie is like, ‘Papa Snoop? How she have a baby with a woman? She's a woman!'” Snoop Dogg said. For many, this would be an opportunity to educate a young mind on a different type of relationship model, but not for Snoop! “Oh shit, I didn't come in for this shit. I just came to watch the goddamn movie,” he remembered thinking. His grandson apparently kept asking questions that Snoop didn't have—or didn't want to have—the answers for. The whole experience “fucked me up,” he reflected. “I'm like, scared to go to the movies. Y'all throwing me in the middle of shit that I don't have an answer for.”

“It threw me for a loop. I'm like, ‘What part of the movie was this?'” he went on. “These are kids. We have to show that at this age? They're going to ask questions. I don't have the answer… What you see is what you see, and they're putting it everywhere.”

Due in part to reactionaries like Snoop Dogg, Disney is no longer “putting it everywhere.” (Not that the company ever really was.) Pixar reportedly axed queer themes from this year's Elio—to the film's detriment—after doing the same to Disney+'s Win Or Lose last year. “It was upsetting because my daughter is transgender, and this is her life. I felt like it was very important that we not hide that fact,” the mother of Chanel Stewart, the trans voice actor whose character's gender identity was scrubbed in the latter project, said last year. “There may be some parents out there who are not ready to have that conversation, but this is the world that we live in and everyone should be represented. Everyone deserves to be recognized.” Until that happens, Snoop Dogg may want to pick up a book or just spend some time on Google so he can answer these pretty basic questions in the future.

	In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Gilmore Girls this October, a new documentary, Searching For Stars Hollow, is in the works with stars Kelly Bishop, Jared Padalecki and Chad Michael Murray, among others.


Searching For Stars Hollow, from Ink On Paper Studios, is set to examine “the beloved show's role in American cultural history,” per a press release, as well as include never-before-seen interviews with castmembers and behind-the-scenes stories from crewmembers, writers and directors.




	In addition to Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Padalecki (Dean Forester) and Murray (Tristin Dugray), the doc will also feature interviews with Keiko Agena (Lane Kim), Sally Struthers (Babette Dell), Liz Torres (Miss Patty), Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim), Rose Abdoo (Gypsy), Kathleen Wilhoite (Liz Danes), Matt Jones (Morgan), Grant Lee Phillips (the town troubadour), director Jamie Babbit, writer and producer Stan Zimmerman, casting directors Jami Rudofsky and Mara Casey, and Kevin T Porter, host of the Gilmore Guys podcast.

Gilmore Girls, which ran for seven seasons, from 2000-07, centered around the relationship between a thirtysomething single mother, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), and her teen daughter, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. Melissa McCarthy, Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn and the late Edward Herrmann also starred in the Amy Sherman-Palladino-created dramedy.

	Meghna Balakumar and Kevin Konrad Hanna are directing the documentary, with Adam F. Goldberg executive producing and Jim Demonakos producing.


	“The interviews that we've already conducted with the cast have been a delight,” Balakumar said in a statement. “We've shot more than 100 hours of footage and have already unearthed stories, commentary, critiques, and more. And we're continuing to shoot more interviews in the coming months to present the most complete, full and truly new story of the show's impact and legacy that is only possible at this historical moment.”


	Demonakos added, “Searching For Stars Hollow will reveal how Gilmore Girls came to life, why it continues to resonate across generations, and how its unique blend of humor, heart and pop culture shaped a devoted worldwide fan community with an in-depth look at its creation and the connections it continues to foster. This documentary is for fans of the show but also for anyone with an interest in cultural history and how it affects individual lives.”


	A release date for Searching For Stars Hollow has yet to be announced, but fans can follow the doc's pre-launch page for the Kickstarter here.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia has never set foot in Uganda, but President Donald Trump's administration is currently “processing” his deportation to the East African nation after rearresting him at a mandated check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 


	Abrego Garcia's renewed detention is the latest escalation by the Trump administration in their campaign against the Maryland father they wrongfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, before bringing him back to the U.S. to face new charges in Tennessee. 


	The arrest was expected given that the Department of Homeland Security had openly stated that it would seek to remove Abrego Garcia should he be let out on bail in the Tennessee case. 


	“Today, [DHS Secretary Kristi Noem] announced that ICE arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He will be processed for removal to Uganda,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote on X. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have, in turn, filed a motion in Maryland to prevent his imminent deportation to a third-party country he has no connection to. The U.S. State Department warns Americans to reconsider whether to travel to Uganda based on threats of terrorism and violent crime.   

	











	Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any crime. Despite the Trump administration having been ordered by a judge in Tennessee to stop making inflammatory public comments about the case, Secretary Noem today described Abrego Garcia as “an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator” whom Trump would not allow to “terrorize American citizens.”

	Abrego Garcia was released from federal custody in Tennessee on Friday and allowed to return home to Maryland, after a judge ruled that the federal government — which has charged Abrego Garcia with unlawfully transporting undocumented migrants based off a 2022 traffic stop — had failed to prove that he was a flight risk or threat to the public in a manner that required pre-trial detention.

	Before his release, the Trump administration apparently offered Abrego Garcia a choice between Scylla and Charybdis: Plead guilty to the charges and be allowed to live in Costa Rica following his sentence, or reject the plea, get out of jail, and face deportation to Uganda. By that point, Abrego Garcia — who is married to an American citizen, and has one child and several step children — had been held captive by the state for over 160 days.

	“The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot, and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a matter that is completely unconstitutional. And specifically weaponizing the decision of which country they send him to,” his attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said today.


	“The government disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order,” he added. “Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him. This shows that they were playing games with the court all along — due process means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after.”

The horror movie “Bone Lake” explores what is many people's worst nightmare: finding out your Airbnb has been double booked. 

In the first trailer for “Bone Lake,” the horror film directed by Mercedes Bryce Morgan, it's immediately clear that yes, the title has two meanings: there's gonna be a lot of boning going on at this picturesque, secluded lake, and also there's going to be a lot of bones at the bottom of said lake. But the drama starts when a couple on a romantic vacation discover another attractive and young couple has also booked the home for the weekend. And things get creepy and bloody from there after some foreplay.

Here's the official synopsis: A couple's romantic vacation at a secluded lakeside estate is upended when they are forced to share the mansion with a mysterious and attractive couple. In this darkly hilarious and seductive horror story, a dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, bringing terrifying secrets to light and triggering a bloody battle for survival.

Audiences who saw “Bone Lake” out of Fantastic Fest in 2024 upon its premiere responded to its sex appeal, its dark humor, as well as its scares. It currently has a 95 percent on Rotten Tomatoes from 20 reviews. Bleecker Street then jumped on it out of the festival for U.S. distribution and partnered with LD Entertainment, setting a release date for October 3. That's a crowded release date that also includes the return of Daniel Day-Lewis in “Anemone” from Focus Features and Josh Safdie's “The Smashing Machine” from A24. But curiously, it also opens the same day as another breakout horror movie generating a lot of buzz, IFC Films' “Good Boy” that's a horror movie told entirely from the perspective of a dog. Bone Lake gives an entirely different connotation to a dog of course. 

Marco Pigossi, Maddie Hasson, Alex Roe, and Andra Nechita are your sexy slasher victims starring in “Bone Lake.” Bryce Morgan directed from a screenplay by Joshua Friedlander, and this is her third feature after directing 2022's “Fixation” and “Spoonful of Sugar.”

Christopher Schwarzenegger, 27, looked noticeably slimmer during a sun-soaked family getaway in Cape Cod.

In photos shared by his sister Katherine on Aug. 22, he appeared sharply transformed—sporting a crisp white short-sleeved button-down and pastel pink shorts, casually checking his phone aboard a boat.

A post shared by Katherine Schwarzenegger (@katherineschwarzenegger)

The fun getaway also featured mom Maria Shriver and brother-in-law Chris Pratt, who flaunted his own fit physique in shirtless photos.

Katherine simply captioned the carousel of images, “A perfect day ☀️🌊.” 

Christopher's physical transformation isn't recent. He first showed off his slimmer physique at the June premiere of “FUBAR” Season 2 in Los Angeles, where he stood confidently beside Arnold, Katherine, Christina, and Patrick.

He opened up about the origins of his weight-loss journey during May's Beacher Vitality Happy & Healthy Summit in Los Angeles, according to PEOPLE.

His struggle began in 2019 while in Australia, and he realized his weight was limiting the activities he wanted to participate in.

“I started in 2019 when I was living in Australia. I was on this big trip. I made it a big [deal] like, ‘Oh, I'm going to go out and do all this stuff, be in Australia,' and I just saw how much my weight was prohibiting me from doing the everyday activities,” he stated.

He added, “I was like, ‘I want to go skydiving.' And my friends were like, ‘Yeah, no shot.' I was like, ‘Yeah, I can't skydive.'”

Christopher described years of trial and error with various diets and meal programs dating back to his high school days. 

He had a turning point when he decided to give up bread for Lent.

“Weirdly enough, I gave up bread for Lent,” he told the audience. “I don't know if anyone's Catholic in here, but I gave up bread for Lent.”

“I was like, ‘Well, if I'm giving up bread, I might as well just take the opportunity and I'm a good Catholic boy, so I'm not going to break it,' ” he added. “And that was my one rule. I was like, ‘I'm not going to break Lent.' And so I lost 30 pounds just through that.”

Though Christopher mainly stays out of the spotlight, his famous father opened up about his weight loss in a June 2025 interview with The Sunday Times.

The actor recalled that he never told his son he was overweight, instead introducing healthy food and the gym. The 78-year-old praised his son for his impressive weight loss.

“And then, out of nowhere, he decided that he wanted to be lean. And now he is,” he added. “So that is of course fantastic, the self-discipline and the self-motivation. I always felt one day it will have to come from him — and it did.”

The rapper said he didn't want to explain queer relationships to his grandson after watching Lightyear three years ago.

Snoop Dogg took his mind off his money and his money off his mind when the rapper decided to criticize children's movies for including LGBTQ+ characters.


	Appearing on the It's Giving podcast on Aug. 20, Snoop said that he was thrown off when he took his grandson to see the 2022 film Lightyear in theaters, and found out that the female character Alisha Hawthorne (voiced by Uzo Aduba) was in a same-sex marriage and had children with her wife, Kiko.

	











	“Why my grandson in the middle of the movie like, ‘Papa Snoop, how she have a baby with a woman? She a woman,'” Snoop recalled during his interview. “I didn't come here for this s–t, I just came to watch the goddamn movie.”




			Trending on Billboard		







Lightyear featured a short scene in which it was revealed that Alisha was queer and in a relationship with a woman, and the two share a kiss. For that scene alone, the film was banned in multiple countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The scene also caused a wave of backlash from right-wing political figures in the U.S. who claimed that Disney was specifically “pushing” a pro-LGBTQ+ agenda.


	In his interview, Snoop presented a common conservative argument against showing same-sex relationships in kids movies, stating that he didn't want to have to explain queerness to his grandson. “So it's like, f–k me, I'm scared to go to the movies now. Like, y'all throwing me in the middle of s–t that I don't have an answer for,” Snoop said. “It threw me for a loop. We have to show that at this age? Like, they're going to ask questions. I don't have the answer.”

	











	Back in 2022, Disney briefly acquiesced to the backlash from people making arguments similar to Snoop's when they cut the kiss scene from the film. However, after a coalition of past and present LGBTQ+ employees and allies urged the studio not to censor “overtly gay affection” in the film as they claimed they did in the past, Disney reinstated the scene.


	Even Lightyear‘s lead actor Chris Evans spoke out in support of the scene in a 2022 interview, stating that he was “frustrated” that the kiss was a point of debate and controversy. “The goal is that we can get to a point where it is the norm, and that this doesn't have to be some uncharted waters, that eventually this is just the way it is,” Evans said. “The goal is to look back on this time and just be shocked that it took us this long to get there.”


	Despite Snoop's claim that children's films are “putting [queerness] everywhere,” a report published by GLAAD in June 2025 showed that only two children's movies released in 2024 featured LGBTQ+ representation, marking a 62% decrease in queer representation in kids' films. According to that same report, in both those films, the queer characters were non-major roles who appeared on screen for less than one minute in each film.

A24 is planning a weeklong celebration ahead of its reopening of the Off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theater this September, featuring Spike Lee, Jerrod Carmichael, Brandi Carlile, Sofia Coppola and more.


	The film studio purchased the 100-year-old theater in 2023 after the West Village theater had run into financial trouble. A24 has since renovated the theater and partnered with the team behind Frenchette to open a restaurant and bar there. 




	The theater will feature theatrical productions, film screenings and more. Natalie Palamides' one-woman show Weer will be the first long-run programming at the theater, with the show set for a five-week run starting Sept. 20.

	The theater is also planning a film screening series hosted by Sofia Coppola, which will also include a discussion afterwards. This kicks off Sept. 14 with a screening of Foxes and a discussion with Jodie Foster. A block party will follow the Sept. 14. Screening. 


	Full list of opening events: 


	Leading up to reopening, the theater has hosted a series of private events including stand-up comedy by Ramy Youssef and Alex Edelman, HAIM previewing their new album I Quit with a listening party and performance for a group of their fans and a theater reading of To Be Young, Gifted and Black, a Robert Nemiroff play adapted from Lorraine Hansberry's writings that had its original premiere at the Cherry Lane in 1969.

There is a specific nostalgic jolt to documentaries that capture the rise and fall of fleetingly popular phenomena. Whether it's Small Potatoes: Who Killed The USFL?, ESPN's 30 For 30 about the flash-in-the-pan football league, or Hulu's 2021 exposé WeWork: Or The Making And Breaking Of A $47 Billion Unicorn, audiences get a kick out of reliving a halcyon bygone moment when some upstart idea briefly burned brightly—knowing full well that its end is coming soon. Like with James Cameron's Best Picture-winning blockbuster, these documentaries offer the promise of a seemingly unsinkable Titanic hitting its inevitable iceberg, giving viewers a chance to savor the schadenfreude found in its specular failure. Vice Is Broke, Eddie Huang's autopsy of the once-powerful media brand that declared bankruptcy in 2023, would seem to provide comparable pleasures.

A former host of the Viceland series Huang's World, the celebrated chef/author/personality knew the company's inner workings, befriending its executives and witnessing its implosion up close. But what's intriguing about Vice Is Broke is that Huang approaches this familiar rise-and-fall narrative from a different perspective. Both angry at Vice for screwing him out of money he says the company owed him and mournful at the loss of a brand whose impudent ethos he cherished, Huang comes to praise and bury this toppled empire. Neither approach entirely works.

Huang, who wrote and directed the 2021 sports drama Boogie, and whose 2013 memoir Fresh Off The Boat became the launching-off point for the ABC sitcom, puts himself front and center, narrating Vice Is Broke but also serving as its star. Mocking the drier, more formulaic tone of comparable docs, like WeWork, he flaunts the fact that he's not a journalist, positioning himself as a straight-shooting regular guy—like his hero, and fellow celebrated chef, Anthony Bourdain—as he tries to explain why Vice mattered before ultimately selling its soul. Brandishing his bonafides as an uncompromising iconoclast, Huang recalls Bourdain's warning about not acquiescing to deep-pocketed corporate interests. According to Huang, the No Reservations star told him, “Eddie, at every turn, they're gonna ask you to bite the dick. And no matter what you do, never bite the dick.”

“And I didn't,” Huang informs us, pleased.

That brash, self-aggrandizing anecdote sets the stage for Vice Is Broke‘s entertaining but shallow examination of Vice, which started as an edgy mid-1990s Montreal magazine before moving to New York near the start of the 21st century, quickly establishing itself as the Bible of youth culture. Providing frank sex advice while candidly dissecting dating, drugs, race, and class, Vice was irreverent and unapologetically provocative. As former editor-in-chief Jesse Pearson describes the magazine's M.O., “I always refer to it as, like, hyper-intelligent valley girl. Like, you know you can drop continental philosophy, but you also say ‘totes.'” Vice‘s attitude made it impossibly cool to its receptive audience of budding tastemakers and influencers, and soon the company expanded into documentary series and digital verticals. Vice Media won Emmys and was at one point valued at $5.7 billion. Run by the P.T. Barnum-like Shane Smith, who became a symbol of a new, hipper type of thought leader, Vice felt (perhaps unfortunately) like the future of media.

Vice Is Broke is strongest when it talks honestly about Vice Media's strengths and weaknesses. Speaking with several people who were instrumental to the company's legacy, like Amy Kellner (the magazine's first female writer), Huang doesn't shy away from Vice‘s sometimes disturbing sexist and racist tendencies—its bro-heavy, “just joking” style of performative outrageousness. Once Smith's team started branching out into actual news reporting, traveling to different countries to chronicle dangerous gangs and similar “exotic” horrors, they were rightly accused of sensationalizing and othering foreign cultures. Huang even includes the well-known clip, from the 2011 documentary Page One: Inside The New York Times, in which late Times reporter David Carr dresses down Smith and his fellow poseurs for their naivety about international affairs—a pivotal turning point that humiliated Vice Media and, in turn, forced Smith to get more thoughtful about its journalism. 

But for as much as Huang tries to go for a more freewheeling approach, treating his interviews like off-the-cuff conversations taking place in bars and restaurants, Vice Is Broke isn't that intimate or revealing. The closest the film gets to anything resembling Vice‘s no-holds-barred daring is a one-on-one between Huang and company co-founder Gavin McInnes, who left in 2008, later helping to form the dangerous far-right group the Proud Boys. Convinced McInnes' regressive views are all an act to garner a response—not unlike Vice in its prime—Huang tries to get him to come clean, which proves unsuccessful and not especially compelling. The filmmaker knows a thing or two about being outspoken (Rolling Stone once declared Huang “The Bad Boy Of Pork Buns”) but he doesn't have the chops as an interviewer to challenge McInnes. 

In its later reels, the documentary digs into Vice‘s ignominious collapse, which becomes a chilling metaphor for the modern struggles across the media landscape. Crumbling ad dollars, an inability to monetize the web, the fickleness of a distracted populace: The financial headaches that keep plenty of media executives up at night all contributed to Vice Media's downfall. Smith tried different tactics to keep Vice afloat, each of them more desperate than the next. (Those fascinated by such inside-baseball stories will be especially interested in Vice Is Broke‘s exploration of the company's vain pursuit of “traffic assignment” and its flirtation with tired legacy brands that represented everything Vice once railed against.) 

Huang fancies his film a raw, personal response to Vice‘s fall from grace. But not unlike the quickie obituary-docs such as WeWork, Vice Is Broke is largely a superficial once-over. Part of the problem is that, as angry as Huang is at Smith for not paying him, he still seems weirdly enamored of Vice‘s pseudo-rebellious spirit. Too often, he talks to Vice contributors who also felt cheated by Smith—an indication that Huang wants to grind an axe more than examine a corpse. It's yet another reason to miss David Carr's sharp, fearless truthtelling. Just think what he would have done with this story.

In episode six of Game Of Thrones‘ fifth season, Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) is raped by her husband, Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) on their wedding night. The scene, which never occurred in George R.R. Martin's books (although something similar did happen to Sansa's friend Jeyne Pool, a character that did not make it into the show), launched dozens of think pieces and other strong reactions in the aftermath, most of them negative. But while Turner herself described the experience of filming the scene as “super, super traumatic” a decade ago when the episode was released (per Vanity Fair), she seems to have changed her tune somewhat in the ensuing years.

“I did feel—and still do—that Game Of Thrones shone a light on things that many people were like ‘Oh god, you can't show that kind of thing'—and I understand it can be triggering—I totally understand that point of view,” the actor told Flaunt in a recent interview. “But I did feel we were actually doing a lot of justice to women and the fight women have had to fight for hundreds of thousands of years—the patriarchy, being treated as objects, and being constantly sexually assaulted—I don't think there's one woman I know who hasn't had a form of that.”

Turner went on to explain that men tend not to believe this statistic when she shares it with them. “And that's because we don't [talk about] it enough—we shy away from it,” she continued. “I think if Game Of Thrones came out today, we'd definitely put some trigger warnings on there… But I'm really proud to have been a part of Game Of Thrones where they didn't shy away from showing atrocities that happened to women back then. I feel proud to have been part of the conversation.” 

Turner previously spoke out in 2017 about how the backlash to the scene “shocked” her and inspired her to get involved with the nonprofit Women For Women International, which supports female survivors of war and conflict. “My anger over the response then turned to excitement that the show had caused such a stir among the public and that a dialogue had been created; a dialogue that was very important,” Turner wrote in an op-ed for the Thomas Reuters Foundation at the time. “Although, I wondered why people feel so impassioned to speak out about a fictional rape when this happens all over the world every day? So unless we continually keep broadcasting people's stories of sexual violence, then how else are people going to respond?”

It's a mission Turner is still on, even though she said goodbye to her Game Of Thrones character over half a decade ago. “I do like to make things that people can walk away from and they feel able to change something about themselves or feel inspired to do something,” she explained to Flaunt. “I want to do more unusual stories—I want to do more A24-type projects where they're super unique and very niche.”

Ah, what's that chill in the air? It's movies. As the summer blockbuster season winds down, cinephiles are already turning their attention to the fall film festivals — where some of the year's most anticipated and awards-worthy titles will begin to make their mark (or, in the case of plenty of gems from Sundance, Berlin, and Cannes, get a second wind). 

The trifecta of Venice, Toronto, and New York (and, of course, that wily and secretive Telluride) once again promises a compelling lineup of international auteurs, breakout discoveries, and major studio contenders. In the coming weeks, we will see (and tell you all about) new films from filmmakers like Luca Guadagnino, Yorgos Lanthimos, Sofia Coppola, Chloé Zhao, Steven Soderbergh, Park Chan-wook, Noah Baumbach, Mamoru Hosoda, Nia DaCosta, Rian Johnson, Mona Fastvold, and Romain Gavras, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

More exciting? All those names we don't yet know, or are just about to learn. That's what makes this seemingly typical annual event — picking new movies to look forward to — so fun and so imprecise. Behold, some seriously educated guesses, with infinitely more names to add soon.

Bookmark this page for IndieWire's list of 42 films we can't wait to see at the Venice, Toronto, and New York film festivals this fall. 

David Ehrlich, Marcus Jones, Ryan Lattanzio, Anne Thompson, and Christian Zilko contributed to this list. 

Luca Guadagnino turns slightly away from his usual subjects, sex and love, in this provocative original from actress-turned-screenwriter Nora Garrett. The psychological thriller stars Julia Roberts as Alma, a Yale philosophy professor whose ordered life is uprooted when her protégé (Ayo Edebiri) makes assault accusations against her close friend and colleague (Andrew Garfield), who in turn charges her with plagiarism. Who to believe? Alma also fears that a secret from her own past will come to light. 

Michael Stuhlbarg plays Alma's psychiatrist husband in this Venice world premiere, which will also open the New York Film Festival. Cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed shot the film on 35mm over six weeks in London and at Cambridge University in the summer of 2024. “Challengers” and “Queer” composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross rejoined Team Guadagnino. Guadagnino has said that Roberts gives the “best performance” of her career in this timely cultural commentary. —AT
 










If you're of the school of thought that Saoirse Ronan can do anything (read: the only correct school of thought), Jonatan Etzler's satirical and darkly funny English-language debut is a tasty treat made just for you. Based on Rasmus Lindgren's debut novel “De Oönskade,” screenwriter Jess O'Kane adapts the story of one very maligned teacher (Ronan as Maria) and the decision that will change her life (and just about everyone else in her close-knit elementary school) forever.

Much of the film's delight is found in just how unpredictably it plays out (surprises galore, the kind that guarantee uncomfortable laughs from an engaged audience), but without spoiling too much, here goes: when Maria makes a shocking choice that leads to the excision of her class' worst student, it has unexpected consequences. What happens when you forcefully remove a supposed bad apple from an otherwise healthy bunch? And who are you to decide who is said bad apple? This is all, we promise, very funny, but the canny casting of Ronan also helps it to feel palatable and possible, until the real world comes calling. —KE

“All Quiet on the Western Front” director Edward Berger returns to Netflix with his latest, which Rowan Joffé adapted from a Lawrence Osborne novel into an awards season hopeful starring Colin Farrell as debt-ridden card shark Lord Doyle and Tilda Swinton as a private investigator on his tail. 

 










Adapted from the 2014 Osborne novel, Berger's first post-“Conclave” feature follows Doyle as he tussles with a fierce gambling habit in the deluxe casinos of Las Vegas and Macau. The secretive casino employee Dao Ming (Fala Chen) offers him a lifeline, but it may not save Doyle from Swinton's relentless P.I. As the movie premieres at the fall film festivals, Farrell will accept the Golden Icon Award in Zurich. Oscar-winning cinematographer James Friend shot the film in Macau and Hong Kong. —AT

Adapted by Will Tracy from the lauded 2003 Korean film “Save the Green Planet!” from director Jang Joon-hwan, who was going to direct the English-language version but was replaced by Yorgos Lanthimos, “Bugonia” brings back Emma Stone for a fifth turn with Lanthimos, in a role originally written as a man, the CEO of a Big Pharma company. Two conspiracists (Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis) believe that she is an evil alien who plans to destroy Earth. So they kidnap her and shave her head. (For real.) 

Ari Aster joined the project as producer and hired Tracy to adapt; by February 2024, Lanthimos came on as director, and Stone joined as both actress and producer. Plemons joined the cast that May during Cannes, when Focus Features picked up the film for distribution. For his fourth go-round with Lanthimos, Irish cinematographer Robbie Ryan shot the film with 35 mm VistaVision cameras last summer in Milos, Greece and High Wycombe, England. —AT
 










Steven Soderbergh continues to bolster his reputation as the fastest worker in Hollywood. Just months after his smart spy thriller “Black Bag” hit theaters, the workhorse director returns to TIFF with a dark comedy about the children of a deceased painter who reconnect to oversee a forgery operation that allows them to liquidate his unfinished works. With a screenplay by frequent collaborator Ed Solomon (who also wrote Soderbergh's “No Sudden Move” and his TV projects “Mosaic” and “Full Circle”) and a cast that includes Ian McKellen, Michaela Coel, James Corden, and Jessica Gunning, “The Christophers” should be a hot title in Toronto. —CZ

Sydney Sweeney takes her first swing at a prestige biopic with “Christy,” which sees the “Euphoria” star playing Christy Martin, one of the first major female boxers to break into mainstream sports culture. Martin's private life was marred by turmoil, most of which stemmed from her marriage to boxing coach Jim Martin (played here by Ben Foster). 

Australian filmmaker David Michôd directs the biopic, which promises to shine light on all of the ugly details of Martin's life, including her struggles with drugs and the domestic violence that plagued her marriage, while still showcasing her inspirational battle against the odds to reach the top of her industry. —CZ
 










Laura Poitras is back at Venice after winning the Golden Lion in 2022 for her Sackler pharmaceutical family by-way-of-Nan-Goldin takedown “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed.” The Oscar-winning, co-directing with longtime “Frontline” producer Mark Obenhaus, is out of competition this time with “Cover-Up.” The made-in-secret documentary, as virtually all of Poitras' films are obliged to be due to their intelligence-breaking investigations, charts the legacy of investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who exposed the cover-up of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam, and covered the Watergate scandal and other U.S. misdeeds throughout his career, including the torture of Abu Ghraib prisoners for The New Yorker. Films like “Citizenfour” and “Risk” proved the former Intercept co-founder was a sharp investigative journalist; “All the Beauty” proved she was a bracingly cinematic filmmaker capable of harnessing truthful emotion. —RL

Independent film maverick Gus Van Sant's recent run of releases, from “Sea of Trees” to “Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot” met mixed results with critics and audiences. With “Dead Man's Wire,” the Academy Award-nominated “Milk” director returns to fact-inspired filmmaking, casting Bill Skarsgård as Tony Kiritsis, who in 1977 entered the Meridian Mortgage Company offices with a sawed-off shotgun to hold its president (Dacre Montgomery) hostage. The ripped-from-the-headlines story feels eerily similar to recent news breaks that have turned assassins fighting for the working class into folk heroes. Austin Kolodney pens the script, with Arnaud Potier (“Aggro Dr1ft”) handling cinematography. Colman Domingo, Al Pacino, Cary Elwes, and “Industry” breakout Myha'la also star. —RL
 










Prolific French filmmaker François Ozon has tackled cinephile-tailored I.P. before, including the Rainer Werner Fassbinder-inspired “Peter von Kant” from 2022. With his latest film “L'Étranger,” he adapts Albert Camus' 1942 existentialist novella, about a disaffected French settler in Algiers who kills an Arab man amid a search for meaning in an indifferent world. Ozon reunites with the young French actor Benjamin Voisin, here playing Mersault after breaking out as one half of a gay romance in the director's lush coming-of-ager “Summer of 85.” The cast also includes Rebecca Marder, Pierre Lottin, Denis Lavant, and “Anatomy of a Fall” internet boyfriend Swann Arlaud, with Belgian cinematographer Manu Dacosse (“Let the Corpses Tan”) shooting in black-and-white to match the novel's eerie, dislocated World War II-era setting. —RL

Marking “Nomadland” Oscar winner Chloé Zhao's return to indie filmmaking after a Marvel detour for “Eternals” in 2021, “Hamnet” was adapted by Zhao and author Maggie O'Farrell from her 2020 bestseller. (It's her first book to make it to the big screen after 25 years.) 

Set during the Elizabethan age in the home of Agnes and William Shakespeare (Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal), “Hamnet” tracks their early romance and the devastating loss of their 11-year-old son Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe) to the plague. Emily Watson plays Hamnet's grandmother. Zhao convinced the reluctant O'Farrell to work with her on the script. Produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, the film was shot by cinematographer Łukasz Żal in Wales and will premiere at the fall film festivals. —AT
 










Painter and New York filmmaker Julian Schnabel (“The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” “Basquiat”) continues his run of history-inspired period pieces after 2018 Oscar nominee “At Eternity's Gate,” which starred Willem Dafoe as Vincent Van Gogh. His decade-in-the-making “In the Hand of Dante” teams him with Oscar Isaac, who plays both a hard-living novelist in present day and Italian poet Dante Alighieri in 14th-century Florence. Nick (Isaac in the 21st century) is tasked by John Malkovich to locate what's believed to be the originally handwritten manuscript of “The Divine Comedy,” while accompanied by a quirky mafia assassin played by Gerard Butler. Schnabel tussled with financiers for final cut on the black-and-white and color, two-and-a-half-hour epic, and he got it. The cast also includes Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa in what looks to be the most ambitious screen project of Schnabel's career. —RL

The next few months are poised to be very big indeed for filmmaker Nia DaCosta, who not only bows her imaginative Henrik Ibsen adaptation with star Tessa Thompson at the festival, but will soon bring her very own “28 Years Later” sequel to cinemas in January. DaCosta has always enjoyed good buzz, but suddenly, it seems her incredible range and deep emotional wells are the talk of the town.

 










In “Hedda,” Thompson takes on the classic, iconic, and titular role of Hedda Gabler with plenty of twists: in DaCosta's telling, she's a bored society doyenne manipulating everyone around her for her own fun and games. And perhaps more? The film's first trailer hinted at something frisky and fun and glossy, with a thrilling underbelly, a sexy and wild outing that will put Ibsen in an entirely new light. DaCosta, too. —KE

Eight years after “Detroit,” Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow (“The Hurt Locker”) is back with another powderkeg political thriller, written by NBC news president Noah Oppenheim (“Zero Day,” “Jackie”). The contemporary narrative is set at the White House as officials scramble to deal with an incoming single unattributed missile attack on the U.S. How to respond? The sprawling cast includes Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Jared Harris, Greta Lee, and Bigelow regular Jason Clarke (“Zero Dark Thirty”). Among other projects over the last eight years, Bigelow spent time developing an adaptation of David Koepp's novel “Aurora” for Netflix, but scrapped it in 2022.

Bigelow believes in using entertainment as a “delivery method for meaningful messaging,” she told IndieWire in 2017. The film will world premiere in the main competition of the 82nd Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2025, where it's nominated for the Golden Lion. —AT
 










Oscar-winning surrealist filmmaker Charlie Kaufman reunites again with poet/writer Eva H.D., who provided both a poem for his 2020 Netflix head trip “I'm Thinking of Ending Things” and the script for his 2023 short “Jackals and Fireflies.” The Venice-premiering short film “How to Shoot a Ghost” also reteams him with “Ending Things” star Jessie Buckley, who plays a blue-haired, newly dead woman wandering the streets of Athens with the also-dead Josef Akiki. In a blend of street photography, historical footage, and new material shot by Michał Dymek (“The Girl with the Needle,” “EO”), this evocative meditation on memory and loss recalls the hybrid fiction works of Chris Marker or the ruminative, temporal poetry of Alain Resnais' “Hiroshima, Mon Amour.” Kaufman has given the film to free library streaming service Kanopy for distribution after its festival bow. —RL

Cannes was apparently not interested in Jim Jarmusch's globe-trotting triptych “Father Mother Sister Brother” despite regularly hosting the filmmaker for decades. Skipping the Croisette enabled Jarmusch to take a film to Venice for only the second time (“Coffee and Cigarettes” played out of competition there in 2003) before he gets a Centerpiece showcase at the New York Film Festival. Three chapters set in New Jersey, Dublin, and Paris — with Frederick Elmes and Yorick Le Saux splitting cinematography duties — center on adult children and their relationships with their aging parents. The stacked cast includes Jarmusch fave Tom Waits, plus Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Vicky Krieps, Charlotte Rampling, Indya Moore, and Luka Sabbat in what the director describes as an “anti-action film.” But any anti-action film from slow cinema poet Jarmusch is more thrilling than most actual action films these days. —RL
 










Claire Denis hasn't directed a new film since her 2022 double feature of “The Stars at Noon” and “Both Sides of the Blade,” but she's set to make a big return to the festival circuit with “The Fence.” Her adaptation of Bernard-Marie Koltès' play “Black Battles with Dogs” takes place on a European-owned construction site in Cameroon, following a supervisor (Matt Dillon) who has to deal with an enraged villager after one of his workers dies on the job. It has all the makings of another Denis classic, featuring some of the auteur's favorite themes like colonial influence in Africa and the obsessions of men who are left to work together while isolated from the outside world. —CZ

When it was announced that Guillermo del Toro would be directing a “Frankenstein” movie for Netflix, you'd be forgiven if your knee-jerk reaction was to hastily check IMDB to confirm that he hadn't already made one. By now, the Mexican director's favorite themes — namely that monsters are often misunderstood creatures who serve as vehicles for the true evil lurking in the hearts of the humans who control them — are so well-established that it feels like he's been directing “Frankenstein” movies for his entire career. But a direct take on Mary Shelley's classic novel has eluded him until now, and the $120 million passion project could put him right back in the heart of the awards race.

 










Oscar Isaac stars as a flamboyant version of the eponymous doctor that is loosely inspired by Mick Jagger, while Jacob Elordi plays the monster he brings into existence. The film is almost certain to have some of the best below-the-line craftsmanship you'll see all season, and watching a living legend dive even deeper into his favorite material is an opportunity that every cinephile should cherish. —CZ

Possibly the first movie about Franz Kafka since Steven Soderbergh's “Kafka” in 1991, and definitely a more straightforward portrait of literature's most name-brand surrealist, Agnieszka Holland's “Franz” seems poised to offer the “Metamorphosis” author a somewhat traditional biopic treatment. Emphasis on somewhat. A crafty and rebellious filmmaker who's coming off one of the most vital works of her career (“Green Border”), Holland supposedly embraces the strictures of the biopic subgenre only so that she can subvert them in turn, as the traditional coming-of-genius stuff (which stars Idan Weiss as a young Czech Jew who's trying to make his way through the world of pre-war Prague) runs parallel to a present-day timeline in which Kafka is forced to reckon with his legacy.

It should be fascinating — and bleakly hilarious — to see what he thinks of a 21st century that seems to have hatched straight out of his worst nightmares. —DE
 










If filmmaker Werner Herzog is going to do one thing, it's make a film centered on a figure willingly going on a Sisyphean quest. The latest documentary from the German director, who will also be receiving the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at this year's Venice Film Festival, focuses on Dr. Steve Boyes, whose “Moby Dick” is in the form of a herd of giant elephants in the highlands of Angola. Though he has gone so far as to recruit master trackers from Namibia to find the elusive animals, the film's synopsis teases that the endeavor may lead to Boyes' second-guessing if the elephants are ever meant to be found. —MJ

World renowned Taiwanese actress Shu Qi, who won the prestigious Golden Horse Award for Best Supporting Actress in the film “Your Place or Mine,” which also stars Tony Leung, makes her directorial debut with what is said to be an artistic drama centered on a young girl who finds a new friend with a similar name to hers, living the life she would like to live. 

In addition to her almost three decades of acting work, Qi has been on several international film festival juries, meaning she already has an idea of how to show her film in the best light that would help it stand out among other more publicized competition titles at this year's Venice Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival. —MJ
 










A few things have changed about the world since Frank Capra released “It's a Wonderful Life” in 1946, and Aziz Ansari has apparently decided that we needed another guardian angel movie that reflects the anxieties of 2025. Enter “Good Fortune,” which stars Ansari as a gig worker who loathes his ultra-wealthy employer (Seth Rogen) until a guardian angel (who else but Keanu Reeves) arrives and attempts to teach them both a thing or two about the way the other half lives. Ansari's directing career has gotten off to a few false starts (through no fault of his own), but “Good Fortune” could be the film that signals the “Master of None” creator's entry into the indie film stratosphere. —CZ

Bradley Cooper's directorial career thus far has been defined by heavy stories of musical geniuses who struggled to control their vices and avoid tragedy. But for his third feature behind the camera, he appears to be taking things in a lighter direction. “Is This Thing On?” is set inside the world of standup comedy, starring Will Arnett (who co-wrote the film with Cooper and Mark Chappell) as a recently divorced man who tries his hand at comedy as a way of coping with a midlife crisis. Cooper also stars alongside Laura Dern, Sean Hayes, Amy Sedaris, and Peyton Manning. The film will have its world premiere at the New York Film Festival, where fans will get their first look at how far Cooper's directorial range extends beyond his favorite subjects. —CZ
 










In a fun bit of art imitating life, Noah Baumbach is bringing his latest Netflix film, in which George Clooney begrudgingly attends a European film festival to accept a prestigious tribute, to the competition at the Venice Film Festival 2025. Co-written with actress and screenwriter Emily Mortimer, the cast of the highly anticipated dramedy is filled out by Kelly's publicist Liz, played by Laura Dern, whose last collaboration with Baumbach earned her an Oscar nomination, and the actor's manager Ron, played by Adam Sandler, who is coming off a year of successes ranging from a spotlight moment on “SNL 50” to long-awaited sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” (also a Netflix film). —MJ

Swiss-American filmmaker Alexandre O. Philippe more than demonstrated his cinema savvy with the film-centric essay films “Lynch/Oz,” which traced David Lynch's career-long fascination with “The Wizard of Oz,” and “78/52,” which gave a frame-by-frame close reading of the “Psycho” shower scene. He turns back to Hitchcock for “Kim Novak's Vertigo,” premiering in Venice where the namesake subject will receive the Golden Lion for career achievement. Philippe funnels his obsession with Hitch's heady psychosexual mind-bender “Vertigo” into a tapestry of the life and career of Novak, who of course played both Judy (the object and victim of James Stewart's perverse fixation) and her made-up alter-ego Madeleine” — inadvertently or intentionally, however you want to dice it, commenting on a director's controlling and manipulating Svengali-like influence over an actress. But this documentary shows us Novak as the fiercely independent iconoclast who left Hollywood on her own terms. —RL
 










Influential film critic and programmer Kent Jones made a seamless leap to the other side of the screen with his quietly shattering narrative debut, “Diane,” which towered over the rest of the competition at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, where it premiered. His follow-up is deservedly swimming in some deeper waters, with some much bigger fish, as “Late Fame” will debut at Venice before screening at TIFF and in the main slate at NYFF, where Jones once served as the chairman of the festival's selection committee. Boasting a cast worthy of this brighter spotlight (and a script adapted from the Arthur Schnitzler novel of the same name by “May December” breakout Samy Burch!), the film stars Willem Dafoe as Ed Saxberger, a forgotten New York poet who's spent the last 40 years of his life working at the post office. But obscurity has a way of inflaming enthusiasm in this town, and all it takes is one extroverted kid with esoteric tastes (Edmund Donovan) to launch Ed back into the arts scene, where he's forced to contend with a new generation of aspirant creatives led by a Greta Lee. It's hard to say how things will pan out for Ed, but Kent's chances of whiffing on his second at bat seem just about nil. —DE

All we need to know: semi-secret film from John Early, in which he directs himself as the titular Maddie: a wannabe influencer who has built her life on all manner of lies. The film promises to be very funny indeed, but with a dark and wise center about actually heady matters. No fake followers here. —KE
 










Director Sofia Coppola and fashion designer Marc Jacobs, a pair of longtime friends and icons who transcend past the artistic trades that they are known for, team up for the former's first-ever documentary feature. Though there are few public details about the film, which will have its world premiere at Venice, even the prospect of a filmed conversation between them would be a fashion lover's dream, involving insights on brands ranging from Chanel and Louis Vuitton to Gap and Perry Ellis. What a rare treat to see someone's muse turn the spotlight back toward them. —MJ

In addition to programming the obvious heavy-hitters and big-time Oscar players, TIFF also excels at championing rising Canadian cinema, offering up true discoveries and fresh features alongside the usual suspects. Three years after debuting her first film, “I Like Movies,” at the festival, Chandler Levack returns with another feature pulled from her rich background of loving (and making) all sorts of art.

Barbie Ferreira stars as Grace, our Levack surrogate, who is spending the summer in Montreal writing music criticism (something Levack herself did in 2011 and thereabouts, in which the film is set with hilarious detail) and dealing with all sorts of personal and professional upheavals. While Levack adopts the shape and form and feel of a rom-com or a coming-of-age comedy, the specificity of her story lends her sophomore debut real gravitas. If you ever read a David Foster Wallace novel not just to impress some bro, but to feel as if you're part of a cultural conversation not necessarily welcoming to you, “Mile End Kicks” will really speak to you (just like it spoke to me). —KE
 










Perhaps the most dazzlingly operatic auteur in the world, Park Chan-wook loves to torture us by making a masterpiece — the most recent of them being 2022's “Decision to Leave” — and then abandoning the cinema for a few years in favor of television, a medium whose production schedule and narrative structure are anathema to his clockwork genius. It's even more frustrating because Park is only growing more confident and ambitious as a filmmaker as he gets older. Needless to say, his diehard fans couldn't be more excited to see him return to the movies with a project he's been dreaming about since 2005: A darkly comic adaptation of Donald Westlake's “The Ax,” starring Lee Byung-hun as a man so desperate to find a job that he starts murdering all of the other applicants. And just in time for Trump to crater the economy! Brace for another virtuosic profile of humanity at its worst and most mounded. —DE

Ben Wheatley was once among the most promising directors on the planet, but recent years have been a bumpy ride for those of us who went all in on his stock after “Kill List.” “Meg 2: The Trench” and his Netflix adaptation of “Rebecca” were both dire in their own ways, but Wheatley's “In the Earth” was a resourceful pandemic riff that suggested he still had some gas in the tank, and it does seem like only a matter of time before a filmmaker of his talent manages to make good on it again. 

Enter: “Normal,” a neo-Western starring Bob Odenkirk as the new sheriff of a small town that's in the clutches of a vast criminal organization (Henry Winkler is the presumably overmatched mayor). Written by “Nobody” and “John Wick” screenwriter Derek Kolstad, and promising to combine ultra-violent action with Hitchcockian mystery, “Normal” has the potential to be a coiled blast of midnight fun — and the potential to restore our faith in Wheatley's orgiastic approach to genre thrills. —DE  
 










Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel's (“Zama,” “The Headless Woman”) first documentary feature is her long-gestating true-crime-and-then-some portrait of the 2009 murder of Indigenous leader Javier Chocobar in her home country. The Chuschagasta native tried to defend his community's ancestral land against three mining entrepreneurs who claimed ownership of the territory, armed with firearms. The film integrates chilling cell-phone footage of the movie that feels ripped from a found-footage horror movie, as well as recordings of the court proceedings as they opened in 2018 and innovative, self-reflexive drone camerawork for a panorama of colonial unrest that spans generations. The men were all freed shortly after their sentencing, but Martel still makes the case that this was a hard-won act of defiance and self-reservation by the Chuschagasta people. —RL

Nearly a decade after his holocaust film “Son of Saul” won the Oscar for Best International Feature on behalf of his native Hungary, director László Nemes returns with a coming-of-age story involving the Communist occupation of Budapest circa 1957. The new project premiering in competition at the Venice Film Festival stars a young Jewish boy named Andor, played by Loppert Martin Tibor, and later Bojtorján Barabas, who begins to question everything he knows about his family after meeting a brutish man bearing earth-shattering news. 

In his director's statement, the filmmaker reveals that the historical drama mines from his own family's trauma, linking the effects that both the holocaust and the rise in communism in Hungary had on him and his loved ones. —MJ
 










What looks to be the most tender film of this year's TIFF, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser stars as an American expat who has long lived and worked in Tokyo, but is struggling to find work as an actor. In HIKARI's feature, that struggle brings Fraser's character into an unexpected job: taking on roles from a “rental family” agency that slots him in where he's seemingly needed most. We suspect he'll find what he needs to, and that audiences will likely spark to what looks like a feel-good feature for all. —KE

After almost a decade away from the big screen (and with one thrilling stopover in TV land, care of “I Know This Much Is True”), Derek Cianfrance is poised to make his triumphant return to features this fall with “Roofman,” a true‑crime dramedy that's already generating serious buzz. While the film might not sound too Cianfrance-y at the outset (Channing Tatum stars as Jeffrey Manchester, a former Army Ranger who robbed dozens of McDonald's by breaking in through their roofs and ultimately went on the lam, ultimately hiding inside a Toys “R” Us for six months), early reports hold that the filmmaker's emotional realism is more pronounced here than originally expected.

As he told IndieWire's Screen Talk last year, the film has been a long-time passion project, and fans of the “Blue Valentine” director should be just as excited for it as movie-goers who simply love a true crime story (with a little “Career Opportunities” flair). —KE
 










One of the buzziest discoveries heading into this year's fall festival corridor, “Rose of Nevada” promises a time-traveling, sci-fi-tinged mystery from Cornish director Mark Jenkin (“Enys Men,” “Bait”). The filmmaker, known for crafting atmospheric landscapes keener on mood than narrative, directs George MacKay and Callum Turner as fishermen on a boat that has returned to harbor after disappearing 30 years prior. The voyage, though, takes them back in time, finding themselves mistaken for the original crew. “Rose of Nevada” bloomed during the pandemic as Jenkin observed the resilience of his Cornwall community; it's first world-premiering in the Orizzonti section at Venice, dedicated to edgy titles and emerging filmmakers that push cinematic form. —RL

An inspired heist thriller that never got the U.S. release that was dumped on Netflix after its riotous debut at Cannes, 2018's “The World Is Yours” made it abundantly clear that Romain Gavras was ready to move beyond his father Costa-Gavras' shadow. Four years later, the even more incendiary (if less substantial) “Athena” made it just as clear that the former music video auteur had become one of modern cinema's most formidable stylists. Now Gavras' English-language debut represents his best chance to put it all together and connect with a wider audience, as the explosive action-comedy — anchored by Anya Taylor-Joy as the leader of a doomsday eco-cult who storm a celebrity-studded environmental conference and begin offering celebrities as a blood sacrifice to mother nature — has all the ingredients for the filmmaker's hypnotically confrontational brand of shock-and-awe social commentary. Billionaires in peril? Check. Chris Evans as a self-embarrassed movie star? Check. A supporting performance by Charli XCX and a presumably banging soundtrack to match? Check check check. If one TIFF premiere has a shot at stealing the spotlight from the more broadly anticipated likes of “Wake Up Dead Man” and “Frankenstein,” it has to be “Sacrifice.” —DE

The last time Japanese animator Mamoru Hosoda released a film, he dazzled anime lovers around the world with his cyberpunk take on a tale as old as time with the “Beauty and the Beast” update “Belle.” Now he's set to return with another princess saga that might even be more ambitious in scope. “Scarlet” takes place in between the realms of life and death, following a murdered princess who is forced to do battle in the afterlife to prevent her soul from perishing forever. Hosoda's mastery of his medium makes any film he releases a must-see event, and “Scarlet” could emerge as one of the year's best animated films. —CZ
 










Hungarian director Ildikó Enyedi has run hot and cold after returning from an 18-year hiatus with 2017's Golden Bear-winning “On Body and Soul” (her follow-up, “The Story of My Wife,” was so pummeled at Cannes that it never made it across the ocean), but her latest epic boasts what might be the single best premise of any movie this year: What if Bertrand Bonello's “The Beast” had co-starred Tony Leung? It would be almost impossible to improve on George MacKay's performance in that film, but we don't have any complaints if one of modern cinema's greatest actors wants to give it a whirl. 

Less romantic than “The Beast” but similarly compelled by inter-generational connections and the invisible forces that shape our world, Enyedi's “Silent Friend” is another three-part, century-spanning epic starring Léa Seydoux as a woman with a complicated relationship with the past. Only here, the French actress — along with the rest of the cast — is confined to a single timeline, as the story's only constant across its 1908, 1972, and 2020-set chapters is a Ginkgo biloba tree that can live for 1,000 years. Here's hoping it bears fruit. —DE
 










The idea of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson fronting A24's awards season kickoff at Venice did not sound plausible even five years ago, when the WWE superstar emeritus was more focused on starring in the types of CGI-heavy blockbusters that are $1 billion-or-bust. But leave it to Benny Safdie, in his solo feature directorial debut, to showcase a new side of Johnson as an actor, playing early Ultimate Fighting Championship favorite Mark Kerr. 

Sharing a name with the 2002 documentary that spotlighted the fighter who came to fame right as UFC was gaining global appeal, the sports biopic also reteams Johnson with his “Jungle Cruise” co-star Emily Blunt, in what already seems to be another scene-stealing performance as Dawn Staples, Kerr's wife at the time. —MJ
 










Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet have a good thing going. The creative and life partners have found success co-writing each other's films while taking turns in the directorial spotlight, most notably with Corbet's 2024 masterpiece “The Brutalist.” Now, Fastvold returns to the director's chair with a film that appears to be every bit as ambitious in terms of artistry and historical scope. “The Testament of Ann Lee” is a musical drama about the Shaker movement, starring Amanda Seyfried as the eponymous founder of the utopian sect of Evangelical Christianity.

Shot on 70mm film and featuring a supporting cast that includes Thomasin McKenzie, Lewis Pullman, Christopher Abbott, and Tim Blake Nelson, “The Testament of Ann Lee” should be one of the cinematic events of the season for arthouse enthusiasts. —CZ

It's a tradition now: a twisty new Rian Johnson murder mystery at TIFF, all big names and better surprises, playing to a very enthusiastic crowd. That's all we'd need to know to get excited for Johnson's third “Knives Out” movie, but we'll give you still more to get jazzed about.

 










This one, hinted to be a bit darker than Johnson's previous entries, boasts a secretive plot (of course) and a murderer's row of stars, including Daniel Craig back as private detective Benoit Blanc, with Josh O'Connor, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, and Thomas Haden Church. Let's solve a crime, but, more importantly, let's have fun while doing it! —KE

Once more famous for his looks than for his film performances (despite being a rather excellent actor right from the jump), Jude Law has made a meal of middle age by re-establishing himself as a virtuosic character actor with extraordinary range. Henry VIII. Captain Hook. The hot Pope. But not even the most chameleonic of Law's previous roles — nor the most receding of their hairlines — has sufficiently prepared us for the idea of watching him play an upstart Vladimir Putin in an epic Olivier Assayas thriller set during the final years of the Soviet Union. 

Adapted from a Giuliano da Empoli novel and starring Paul Dano as a fictional artist who rises high in the ranks of the Russian government while coming across all sorts of disreputable figures in the process, “The Wizard of the Kremlin” finds Assayas mounting his most outwardly ambitious — or at least his longest — feature since “Carlos” in 2010. The movie's ensemble also includes Alicia Vikander, Jeffrey Wright, and Tom Sturridge, but this is said to be Dano's show, with Law's Putin a malevolent presence who shadows his every move. —DE

Ed Kelce said there is "no question" that Taylor Swift has made the Super Bowl winner a very happy man.

	Gil Kaufman



	Relationship experts have endlessly parsed the body language and non-verbal cues between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce during the singer's album release appearance on the Kansas City Chief's tight end's New Heights podcast two weeks ago.


	Kelce's broad smile and longing looks at his girlfriend of two years said it all. But if you really want to know how the three-time Super Bowl champ feels about Swift, just ask his dad. At Sunday night's (Aug. 24) premiere of the new six-part ESPN series The Kingdom about the Chiefs' pursuit of a Super Bowl three-peat, People magazine caught up with Travis' dad, Ed Kelce, to ask him about how his youngest son's joy steams from his relationship with the pop superstar.

	











	“Taylor,” Ed Kelce said when asked to pinpoint the source of Travis' happiness. “There's no question about it.” Ed could see it when he tuned in to the two-hour New Heights pod, dubbing the appearance “so good… I think it was awesome. It was great to see them go back-and-forth. They're two people obviously very much in love.”




			Trending on Billboard		







People also caught up with family matriarch Donna Kelce at Sunday's premiere, where she had high praise for the New Heights appearance as well. Donna said she also tuned in and she dubbed the record-breaking Aug. 13 appearance “really, really eventuful… It was authentic. It was just something I think everybody was thrilled to see, and it was a very loving podcast.”


	Swift and Kelce went official with their romance in Oct. 2023 and have since made a habit of showing up for each other at important events, with Travis flying out for a number of Eras Tour shows and Taylor posting up in the family box at more than a dozen Chiefs games. Swift broke the internet when she went on New Heights to reveal the details of her upcoming 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl.

Senior International Film Correspondent


Updated at 10.05 am PT with latest death toll and NBC denial of connection… Double-tap Israeli strikes on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza on Monday killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, the Gaza Health Ministry said in a statement.


	The dead media professionals were named as Hussam al-Masri, a cameraman working for Reuters News Agency; Mohammed Salama, a photojournalist with Al Jazeera; Mariam Abu Daqqa (aka Mariam Dagga), a journalist working with several media outlets including Associated Press, and Moaz Abu Taha, who was initially reported as working for NBC, but the network has denied any connection in an email to Deadline.

	A fifth media professional – freelance journalist Ahmed Abu Aziz, who contributed to Quds Feed –  was also announced as having died in the strikes later on in the day. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Journalist Jamal Baddah from Palestine Today TV; photographer Hatem Khaled, a Reuters contractor, and Mohammed Fayeq, a freelance photographer, were also reported as having been injured in the attack, in an update issued by New York-based Committee To Protect Journalists (CPJ).


	“Israel killed at least five journalists in Nasser Hospital on Monday morning. Israel's broadcasted killing of journalists in Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,” said CPJ's Regional Director Sara Qudah. “These murders must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.”


	The Gaza Health Ministry reported earlier that there had been two strikes on the Nasser Hospital. The first had targeted the fourth floor of the hospital, and was followed by a second strike which hit the same location as first responders rushed to recover the injured and dead, and journalists followed close behind to capture what had happened.


	Reuters confirmed Al-Masri's death and Khaled's injuries in a statement. 


	“We are devastated to learn that cameraman Hussam al-Masri, a contractor for Reuters, was killed this morning in Israeli strikes on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in Gaza. Moaz Abu Taha, a freelance journalist whose work had been occasionally published by Reuters, was also killed, and photographer Hatem Khaled, a Reuters contractor, was wounded.”

	











	“We are urgently seeking more information and have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical assistance for Hatem,” the spokesperson added


	Female photographer Abu Daqqa, who is among the dead, had won renown and the moniker “the adventurer” for her work documenting the impact of Israel's military campaign and occupation of the Gaza Strip on children and civilian life.  


	The Israeli army later confirmed it struck the area of Nasser hospital in Gaza and said it regretted “any harm to uninvolved individuals” and that “it does not target journalists as such”.


	The deaths come amid growing condemnation over the number of Palestinian journalists and media workers killed, injured or declared missing since the beginning of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, sparked by the Hamas-led October 7 terror attacks.


	It has also added fuel to suggestions that Israel is deliberately targeting media workers to prevent them from documenting events on the ground in Gaza. 


	Figures released by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate (PJS) on August 18, stated that at least 212 Palestinian journalists and media workers had been killed.


	Monday's deaths come just two weeks after Israeli forces killed five Al-Jazeera staff in an attack on a tent housing journalists located outside Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.


	They included celebrated Gaza journalist Anas al-Sharif alongside correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, camera operators Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa, and driver Mohammed Noufal.


	Israel claimed that al-Sharif, who was one of Gaza's most famous journalists, was a Hamas member posing as a journalist. This claim has been refuted by Al-Jazeera and a number of other media orgs.


	A group of Democrat senators led by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who is Jewish, wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on August 22 saying Israel had not provided “convincing evidence” to back up its claim of al-Sharif's Hamas membership. 


	“The recent targeted Israeli strike on a group of journalists and media workers, which killed six journalists, including well-known Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, is just one example of attacks on reporters in Gaza and part of a pattern of violence that has silenced the voices of far too many Gazan journalists,” wrote the senators in their statement. 


	Israeli news website +972 reported in August that Israeli military had create a special unit, called the Legitimization Cell, tasked with gathering intelligence that can bolster Israel's image in the international media as well as uncover links between journalists and Hamas so as to make them legitimate targets.

The 'Godfather' director will give the laudatio for the lifetime achievement honor for the German director of 'Fitzcarraldo, 'Grizzly Man' and 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God.'


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


Francis Ford Coppola will give the laudatio honoring Werner Herzog at the Venice Film Festival on Wednesday night, when Herzog will receive the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.


	The Godfather and Apocalypse Now director will honor the iconic German filmmaker, director of Fitzcarraldo, Grizzly Man and Aguirre, the Wrath of God on Aug. 27 at Venice's Sala Grande during the Opening Ceremony of the 82nd Venice festival. Herzog will be honored for his life's work. On Thursday, Herzog will present his latest documentary, Ghost Elephants, out of competition in Venice and will hold a master class.

	











	Announcing the award for Herzog, Venice film festival director Alberto Barbera said the New German Cinema pioneer  “has never ceased from testing the limits of film language, belying the traditional distinction between documentary and fiction. A brilliant narrator of unusual stories, Herzog is also the last heir of the great tradition of German romanticism, a visionary humanist, and a tireless explorer.”

	Coppola will also be in focus in Venice this year, with the screening of Mike Figgis' Megadoc, screening in the Venice Classics – Documentaries About Cinema section, on Thursday. The film is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Megalopolis, Coppola's decades-in-the-making epic.


	Coppola received a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 49th Venice film festival in 1992.

A round of applause to those Hollywood couples who know and trust their partners in a heartbeat, despite their rigorous jobs! During a Televerse panel on August 15, 2025, Kristen Bell recounted how her husband, Dax Shepard, and his buddies watched the first episode of “Nobody Wants This.”

Apparently, they all collectively lost it at the steamy kiss she shared with Adam Brody. “I could hear that music in the background and they were screaming,” she quipped, “and he was like, ‘Oh my God!'” She added with pride, “He was so excited for these two characters to kiss, which I think says a lot.”

So yeah, her real-life spouse was more than into it. Just like us! So much so that he sent her a voice memo capturing the cheers, which is both adorable and hilarious.

It's no secret that the couple has been pretty open when it comes to their love and family life. Bell and Shepard have built their relationship on what she calls “foundational trust.” Despite the occasional on-screen romance, they're rock solid. “Even if Dax hooks up with the most beautiful person in the world at work, I know he's committed to our family,” Bell said. “I know he's coming home… we have a very open communication.”

She laughs even harder about Sheppard's own flirtatious onscreen moments, saying she was delighted when he had to kiss Minka Kelly on “Parenthood.” “Yes. Get it!” she said, because they know that marriage isn't a monolith; you have to trust.

Let's dial back to October 2024, at the New Yorker Festival, when Shepard joked about that kiss. According to Bell, during an eTalk appearance: “My husband said…the first episode he was like, ‘Oh my God, I want you to kiss him so badly.'” But Sheppard had his own take, darkly comedic, of course. He called it “the very best kissing scene ever, ever put on film,” then added the legendary burn. “My best friend, Aaron, … ‘Does she ever kiss you like that?' No, I didn't even know she could kiss like that.” So yes, he's not bitter at all; he's clearly impressed, and maybe a little shook, just like us!

Seriously, the guy doesn't just tolerate romance, he roots for it. That raw excitement? That's a partner who's secure enough to laugh and cheer, not just endure.

A post shared by Nobody Wants This (@nobodywantsthisofficial)

In “Nobody Wants This,” Bell plays Joanne, an agnostic, sex-positive podcaster, who unexpectedly falls for Noah. Noah's character is purely brilliant, described as a newly single rabbi played by Brody, who is married to Leighton Meester. Their chemistry has lit up the screen and critics, earning Emmy noms for Outstanding Comedy Series and acting nods for both Bell and Brody.

Season 2 has also been confirmed, dropping October 23, 2025. It'll continue weaving Joanne's feminist, messy sensibility with Noah's tradition-obsessed world, while their relationship gets tested by families, routines, and maybe more unexpected kisses. A round of applause for that! Also, fun fact, Meester is also part of the amazing cast, making things more exciting! 

A post shared by kristen bell (@kristenanniebell)

These two built a marriage where Bell is literally being celebrated for kissing a co-star. So much so that even Sheppard celebrated her after she received an Emmy nomination by posting a nearly nude (aside from socks) celebratory picture! That's comfort, not chaos!

It's safe to say that acting intimately with someone else on screen could make any marriage awkward, but not theirs. Bell and Shepard model something rare. It's joy in each other's careers, playful honesty, and the freedom to be weird and loving in equal measure. Now we need to hear Meester's side of it too! It's only right!

The K-pop supergroup — who also just wrapped their record-breaking world tour — digs into their new album, why it's important to produce their own music and how their relationship with one another has evolved.


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	For K-pop supergroup Stray Kids, it's all about authenticity. 


	The eight-member boy group, consisting of members Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin and I.N, hail from Korean agency JYP Entertainment. The group has spent the last seven years creating the music they want to make with members Bang Chan, Changbin and Han, known collectively as 3Racha, as their main production team. 




	“[Producing our own music] allows us to highlight both our authenticity as a group and our strengths,” Changbin tells The Hollywood Reporter on a Zoom from Seoul. At the time of this conversation, the group is in between the North American and European legs of their record-breaking Dominate World Tour. The North American leg grossed about $76.2M, according to Billboard, making it the best-selling and highest-grossing North American leg for any K-pop tour. The group went on to have an equally successful European run.

	Stray Kids is back with a new album, Karma, which the group says aims to convey the literal meaning of the word — do good things and you'll receive good things in return. The album's title track, “Ceremony,” is all about celebrating a triumph after overcoming adversity to get to that moment. The song is endlessly catchy and a celebration of Stray Kids making it to the top.


	A line from Changbin's opening rap verse for the song — “No one, nobody can stop me” — is perhaps the best view of where the eight-member group is at the moment. Stray Kids continue to break charting records around the world, including becoming the first act to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with its first six chart entries; Karma is contending to continue further that record.

	











	Below, Stray Kids speaks with THR about the meaning of their new album Karma, how their relationship with one another has changed and the pressures that come along with hitting the top of the charts.


Can you tell me a bit about your new title track, “Ceremony?”


BANG CHAN “Ceremony” is a song that was elected by all the members for the next album. This might be a personal opinion, but I feel like it's pretty catchy. It's simplified, but it has the energy [needed] for a title track. I think that's how we decided on “Ceremony” and hopefully people will enjoy the whole message and everything that we put into the song.


Why was the message of this album so perfect for you right now? Was it intentional or did it work out that way?


BANG CHAN Obviously, there was a lot of stuff that behind the scenes of how we're making the album and everything, but because it's been a while since we released a full album, we wanted to include different genres of music. I think we really wanted to emphasize in “Ceremony,” the title track, a lot of times it says “karma.” In the end, if you do good, you get good stuff in return. I think that's what we've been trying to emphasize. That's what we aim to do. We try to do good things in order for good things to [come to us in] return.


Does anyone have a favorite song on the album?


HYUNJIN I really like the track “Bleep.” It was actually considered as a focus track because it's that it has that Stray Kids vibe and it's very grand in scale, so I really like that track.

	











CHANGBIN I like the track “In My Head.” It was also considered [for the] title track, and it's a song that you can listen when you want to blow off some steam. It has a chill vibe. The hook is super catchy and addictive, so I think a lot of fans would be able to sing along to it.


You just wrapped up the U.S. leg of your tour and you're preparing to head out to Europe soon. This tour has been very big in scale. What was your experience like playing in stadiums across the U.S.?


FELIX It's been a long time since we've toured and being able to go through this tour through stadiums and to see a lot of stays in the venue, it was not only exciting but also a very good experience. We did learn a lot from the tour, and there are some things that we thought we can improve on and some things that we did that we really liked. Obviously, we thought we really did succeed at this tour. We just hope that when the chance comes, we can do much better, but also just… I guess we want to prepare more surprises. We thought this tour was very successful.


Using a live band was an interesting and fun choice for the tour. It really adds to the listener experience, having gone to the tour myself. Was that a group consensus or just something that happened naturally?


FELIX It was definitely what the group decided on. We wanted Stays [the name for the group's loyal fanbase] to hear our sound very natural, very loud and very strongly.


How do you kind of practice self-care when you're touring or when you are busy working on a new project and that might become your whole life?












I.N I usually work out to build up my stamina. All the members are doing this too, and they also eat a variety of foods to get all the energy.


HYUNJIN I like to draw. Since the scale of the tour has gotten very big, I find joy in visiting art museums in each city. I also get inspiration from those visits too. That's how I like to spend my free time.


Can you tell me a bit about why you feel it's important to produce your own music?


CHANGBIN We produce our own music and perform it on stage, which allows us to highlight both our authenticity as a group and our strengths. Since our fans have always loved the color of our music from our trainee days, to after our debut, up until this moment; that's why we've stuck to that style. We think our challenge now is to develop it further and deliver something new to the fans.


Do you find that your relationship with your fans has changed as you've grown as a group?


SEUNGMIN I do believe that our bond with the fans has changed over time. We can't ask every one of them exactly when they became Stay — some of them have been with us since debut and keep showing up, while others we were able to meet for the first time in the new cities during the tour. Just by looking at their expressions, we could really feel how long they've waited and how much they love Stray Kids. Touring around the world really reminds us of how grateful we constantly are.


As we just talked about, the scale of the tour is bigger, and you consistently break records on music charts. Does that ever add pressure to you when it comes to a new release or a new tour?












HAN As our concert scale grows, there's obviously more pressure that builds. But since so many people are looking forward to the tour and what we do, we work hard to meet those expectations. Because there are eight of us, we're able to share the weight, and we're able to achieve things that we couldn't handle alone. We can now lean on each other and get through it together.


How has your relationship with each other changed since your debut?


LEE KNOW Since we all originally came from different backgrounds; we didn't really click perfectly from the beginning. But after spending eight years together, we've come to understand what each other wants just by looking at each other and we know what each other dislikes. Even without putting thoughts into words, we're often on the same page.


As an artist, you don't have much say in how you're perceived, unfortunately. But you're obviously working hard and creating music you love, so it's easy to assume there's an ideal way you'd want to be viewed. How do you want to be perceived as a group?


SEUNGMIN I want to be perceived as an artist with a sound that people can instantly recognize as Stray Kids. When you hear a song, we want the audience to be able to tell it's ours [because of] how unique and how different our musical color is. We want to be remembered as that kind of artist.


As you prepare to release this album, what're you hoping for as a group as you look ahead?


HYUNJIN I definitely want to keep performing constantly. We want to stick to our style of music no matter what other trends come along. We want to keep that fun, energetic vibe in our music always. We want to be a long-lasting group and not a short-term project. [We also want to] come back to the fans whenever they want us to.

Donald Trump threatened to investigate Chris Christie after the former New Jersey governor criticized him on ABC's This Week earlier on Sunday. 


	Trump wrote on Truth Social, “I just watched Sloppy Chris Christie be interviewed on a ratings challenged ‘News' Show, ‘This Week With George Slopadopolus,' on ABC Fake News (By the way, what the ‘hell happened to Jonathan Karl's hair? He looks absolutely terrible! It's amazing what bad ratings, on a failed television show that was forced to pay me $16,000,000, can do to one's appearance!). Can anyone believe anything that Sloppy Chris says? Do you remember the way he lied about the dangerous and deadly closure of the George Washington Bridge in order to stay out of prison, at the same time sacrificing people who worked for him, including a young mother, who spent years trying to fight off the vicious charges against her. Chris refused to take responsibility for these criminal acts. For the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again? NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW! Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT”

					Ghislaine Maxwell Prison Interview Friday Dump Dominates Cable News; C-Span To Run Full Video Tonight Of Epstein Associate On Trump, Files, Suicide, & More		
			








	Trump's comments came two days after the FBI raided the home of John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser who, like Christie, has criticized the president in media appearances. Like Bolton, Christie is a former supporter of Trump's.




			Watch on Deadline		







	On This Week, Christie expressed skepticism of Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking and conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein, in questioning by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The transcript of the Maxwell interview was released on Friday, in which she said of Trump, “As far as I'm concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find — I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him. And I've always liked him.”


	Maxwell also said that she did not hear from Epstein that Trump did anything inappropriate.

	











	Christie said, “Why should we believe a damn thing Ghislaine Maxwell has to say about anyone? Now, that doesn't make Donald Trump guilty of anything. In fact, in my own experience … I don't think Donald Trump had anything to do with — with Jeffrey Epstein that was untoward or illegal. But we're going to believe Ghislaine Maxwell? Give me a break.”


	The Bolton raid reportedly had to do with his handling of classified information. While Christie said that the fact that two judges signed off on a search warrant suggested that “there's real evidence that they believe something is there,” he thinks “it's kind of funny to hear the president talk the way he does about Bolton and classified information, yet when he had the classified information, the same rules didn't apply.”


	Christie said Trump was following through on his campaign promises to seek retribution. “He told you he was going to do this, that he was going to have a Justice Department that acted as his personal legal representation, and that is what they're doing,” Christie said.


	Christie's political career was on the rise until the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which Fort Lee, NJ toll lanes were closed during morning rush hour, a move that was suspected of being an act of political revenge because the city's mayor had not endorsed Christie's reelection bid. He was not indicted, but some of his aides were. Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff, was convicted, but that was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.


	At the time Kelly's conviction was overturned, in 2020, Trump congratulated Christie and wrote on Twitter that it was “a complete and total exoneration (with a 9-0 vote by the U.S. Supreme Court) on the Obama DOJ Scam referred to as ‘Bridgegate.' The Democrats are getting caught doing very evil things, and Republicans should take note. This was grave misconduct by the Obama Justice Department!”

Of course this is a case of the underlings abusing their positions, or are they guilty of protecting their employer in the Bridgegate scandle? I find it hard to believe he didn't know about it.

He should release the Epstein files.

In the 2024 presidential election, 73.6% (or 174 million people) of the citizen voting-age population was registered to vote and 65.3% (or 154 million people) voted according to new voting and registration tables released today by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Trump received 49.8% of the total votes (or 76.7 million).  That's only 22.6% of the U.S. total population = 340.1 million.  Trump doesn't have a mandate to destroy this country's democracy.  He clearly wants to disrupt the 2026 elections and make himself the President-for-Life similar to his pal Vladimir Putin.

That's nice, now release the Epstein files.

This is the demonic clown that low info voters wanted. Enjoy the daily fresh hell.

Agreed. To all those independents, Democrats, Latinos, Blacks, and women voters, who wanted to give him a chance, well, he gots his, and you will never get yours. God help you.

Platonic star and executive producer Seth Rogen said he understands why viewers are expecting romance between his character and that of Rose Byrne‘s in the Apple TV+ comedy.


	While on Late Night with Seth Meyers recently, the multi-hyphenate acknowledged he gets the fan fixation because of the “precedent” set by other shows like seminal sitcom Friends.


	“People are very fixated on this idea that we will one day get together,” the actor-cum-writer said. “And I get why, honestly. Like, we grew up with a show called Friends, and they all f—ed each other. Every friend f—ed every other friend.”

	Meyers agreed, joking, “No one went unf—ed.”

	“No friend will go unf—ed,” Rogen added.


	“That was the original title,” Meyers continued.


	Rogen riffed, “F— Friends,” adding that the famed capuchin monkey featured in the series (in the episode “The One With the Monkey”) also probably had a romantic backstory: “Marcel got f—ed, I would assume. I would pay to see the Marcel spinoff show where you see him f—.”


The Studio co-creator concluded, “Anyway, I get why people think we're gonna have sex because of the f— precedent that Friends set,” adding onto Meyers' joke that the '90s-era NBC comedy “ruined it for everybody.”


	Co-created, directed and co-written by Nick Stoller and Francesca Delbanco, Platonic follows a pair of collegiate best friends who reconnect as adults (Rogen and Byrne). Season 2 picks up as the duo contend with new midlife hurdles, including work, weddings and partners in crises. Additional cast members include Luke Macfarlane and Carla Gallo, as the sophomore installment introduces Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett as guest stars. Season 2 premiered on Apple TV+ Aug. 6 and will air its finale Oct. 1.


	Speaking to Deadline at the TV Contenders event earlier this year, Delbanco said of the two characters: “It is the lowest fi idea in history. There's no suspense or tension about ‘Will they or won't they?' They're just buddies. We thought it was important to try to represent that, the possibility that men and women can be friends with each other and those friendships can provide something friendships with your own gender can't provide — or something extra.”

In yet another head-scratching twist on “The Bold and the Beautiful,” Luna Nozawa (Lisa Yamada) somehow wound up in bed with an unsuspecting Will Spencer (Crew Morrow). Now, Will is left to face the fallout from his wild night, and the first casualty in the chaos is none other than Electra Forrester (Laneya Grace).

A post shared by The Bold and The Beautiful (@boldandbeautifulcbs)

On Friday, Will finally wakes up after a steamy night at Deacon's apartment. Of course, he's unaware that the woman he just got intimate with was the supposedly dead Luna.

“The Bold and the Beautiful” spoilers say Will thought Electra came back to spend the night with him. But he's too wasted to recognize that it was Luna all along.

Meanwhile, Electra has never been so sure about taking the next step with Will. She tells Ivy she's ready and wants to make their first time special.

Electra sends Will a text telling him how excited she is for tomorrow night. Little did she know that her boyfriend had gotten busy with someone else.

Once it finally sinks in, Will is sure to feel guilty. “The Bold and the Beautiful” speculation suggests his conscience will weigh so heavily on him that he may even push Electra away.

Electra has been eagerly anticipating a romantic night with Will, but that may be put on hold. She'll be left puzzled by his sudden change of heart about intimacy, especially since he was the one who pushed for it to begin with.

“The Bold and the Beautiful” spoilers for next week reveal that Will seeks answers about what really happened on that fateful night. He's determined to uncover the truth, even if it means facing some shocking revelations.

Will returns to Il Giardino as he tries to put the pieces together. Spoilers say he asks Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) if she has any idea about what happened to him.

Of course, the doting grandmother already knows that Luna took advantage of Will and is very supportive of it. She'll likely not tell Will a thing and let Luna handle it.

Now that Luna finally got a taste of Will, she'll likely crave more. There are endless possibilities for how she might manipulate him.

Just imagine Will's shock when he learns that not only is Luna alive, but he actually spent the night with her. Then there's Electra, who is sure to have her world crushed with this shocking revelation.

Watch “The Bold and the Beautiful” weekdays on CBS.

As prolific director Terry Ingram oversees the filming of Hallmark Channel's third “Three Wise Men” movie in Vancouver, the cast and crew threw a surprise party to celebrate it being his 50th Hallmark movie. 

Producer Rob Lycar posted a video on August 22, 2025, of them pulling off the surprise, with Tina Turner's “Simply the Best” as the soundtrack. He shared footage of stars including Andrew Walker, Tyler Hynes, and Kimberley Sustad at the on-set party, and many other stars shared or commented on the post. 

“Today on set we celebrated our leader & Director Terry Ingram as he directs his 50th movie for @hallmark,” Lycar captioned the video. “We love you Terry! Here's to 50 more! And yes he eventually got to eat that piece of cake!”

A post shared by Rob Lycar (@lickylicks)

Lycar's video showed him leading Ingram to a room where a group of cast and crew members cheered and threw confetti as he opened the door, catching him by surprise. 

Hynes was the first to hug the director and place a sparkling gold “50” necklace around his neck. In 2023, Ingram revealed on the “Unbuttoned Suspenders” podcast that he'd known Hynes since he was a 13-year-old actor in a Canadian series he directed called “Amazon.”

Walker and Sustad could also be seen celebrating, and fellow “Three Wise Men” star Fiona Vroom gave Ingram a big hug, declaring him “my favorite director.” She reiterated that by writing in the comments, “Terry is the absolute best!!!! ❤️”

Several people held posters with photos of Ingram and the words “Here's to another 50 films!” He was also shown cutting a sheet cake decorated with the words “Terry, Congratulations on 50 Hallmark movies!” 

Lycar shared the post in his Instagram Stories and wrote, “The single director I've worked the most with. 7+ projects. 20+ years. 🤍@terryjohningram We celebrate you my friend, The only way worthy of the legend you are. Thank you”

A post shared by Terry Ingram (@terryjohningram)

In addition to Ingram's impressive 50-movie milestone, which includes Hallmark Channel's “The Wedding Veil” franchise and multiple mystery movies, he also directed 18 episodes of the network's beloved series “Chesapeake Shores,” per IMDb.  

Using that database, EntertainmentNow has pulled together a list of all 50 Hallmark movies directed by Ingram for anyone who wants to celebrate by bingeing the prolific director's works over the last dozen years. How many have you seen?!

Cleveland cut former Pro Bowl quarterback Tyler Huntley Sunday, an NFL journeyman who stood fifth on the depth chart, part of 17 roster cuts ahead of the Tuesday deadline to get down to the 53-man limit. 

Huntley led a field goal drive in the fourth quarter to get the Browns a 19-17 win over the Rams on Saturday.  In the team's 3-0 exhibition run he was 17-22 passing for 129 yards with one touchdown without an interception.

Browns coach Kevin Stefanski has already named Joe Flacco the Week One starter for the opener against Cincinnati on September 7. Five quarterbacks remain on the roster ahead of Tuesday, Flacco, backup Kenny Pickett who's battling a groin injury, third-round pick and former Duck Dillon Gabriel and fifth-round selection Shedeur Sanders. Deshaun Watson is out for the year while recovering from an Achilles injury, a $256 million albatross for the franchise.

Controversy follows the fifth-round draft pick. 

Tyler Huntley came right in and lead those same group of players right down the field, and Shedeur was also playing against guys who are also going to get cut. https://t.co/BPrYNDVKAn

A cadre of Browns fans, pundits and former players insist that the beleaguered franchise (40 starting quarterbacks since 1999) is mishandling or even sabotaging Sanders in his bid to become an NFL starter.

Saturday the rookie from Colorado and son of an NFL Hall of Famer was badly outplayed by fellow rookie and Oregon Duck Dillon Gabriel. Gabriel played in the second quarter and led an 11-play, 86-yard drive in the two-minute drill, throwing his first pro touchdown pass.

Sanders entered the game in the fourth and struggled horrendously, sacked five times, 3-6 passing for 14 yards. Sanders supporters/apologists made much of the fact that four of the linemen in the game when the former Buff took the field were cut by the team a day later:

• Tackle Sebastian Gutierrez
• Center Bucky Williams
• Guard Javion Cohen
• Guard Dartanyan Tinsley 

Yet Huntley took over with the same group later in the fourth and won the game with the field goal drive, and he was the one who was cut.

In 2024, 15 of the 32 starting NFL quarterbacks were black, including Super Bowl winner Jalen Hurts, three-time Super Bowl winner and two-time NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes, and NFL Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels.

Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl in 1988.

The brewing tempest in the Cleveland teapot prompted former Duck and NFL lineman Geoff Schwartz to post a sarcastic blast on X.

I remember being a young offensive lineman fighting for a job. My OL coach came up to me and said "Hey Schwartz you need to block worse when Smith is playing quarterback so he looks bad" ... totally normal conspiracy that happens all the time https://t.co/vUYv1OwAHb

The NFL cares about two things: winning and making money. Sanders fifth-string status has everything to do with his pocket awareness and performance, and little to do with his race. He hasn't played well, despite a strong debut in Charlotte on August 8th. 

Within an organization, even an organization as badly-run as the Browns, it helps if the backup is a team-oriented guy who doesn't draw controversy. The job is to hold a clipboard, attend meetings and wait. Sulking, speed through 40 mile-an-hour traffic zones and being a media lightning rod create distractions. NFL coaches despise distractions.  

So far the Browns have indicated that they're keeping all four of the active quarterbacks entering the season. If Sanders has NFL talent, he'll get his chance to prove his detractors wrong down the road.

First Lady Melania Trump's signature on the letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin is at the center of wild social media speculation

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

First Lady Melania Trump wasn't at the big Ukraine war summit in Alaska between her husband, President Donald Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin — but she was there in spirit. 

Trump handed Putin a letter from his wife, appealing to him to remember the innocence of the children caught in the midst of the fighting between Russia and Ukraine, and to put an end to the violence. “In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them — a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future,” the first lady wrote. “Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.”

But the first lady's signature at the end of the letter, which was shared on social media by Attorney General Pam Bondi, has sparked more social media interest than its content.

That's because of how similar it looked to the president's signature Sharpie scrawl. 

“Donald Trump and Melania Trump's signatures. So weird,” said one person on X, who shared a side-by-side image of the two. “That's IDENTICAL to Trump's own signature…”

“Melania has the same type of signature as Trump ... odd ... ” wrote a Facebook user.

“Why she have the same sharpie a** signature as Trump?” posted another, referring to the president's favorite pen.

“No way is that her signature,” said another. “She didn't write it and Trump signed it,” someone else said on Facebook, without evidence.

Others questioned why the first lady's signature appears to have changed over the years, with one user asking Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, “Why did Melania Trump change her signature?”

“Melania Trump's signature evolved after her 2005 marriage, shifting from a flowing cursive style (as Melania Knauss) to a peaked, stylized one resembling Donald's,” Grok replied. 

“Analysts suggest it's for branding unity, quick signing via autopen or to reflect tenacity and privacy. No official reason given.”

The chatbot's answer actually tallies with the opinion of Bart Baggett, a handwriting expert who has testified in criminal cases. He said the style with its “angular letters” and “long downstrokes” is all about the Trump “brand.”

“She's got angular writing that's a fast, analytical line. She's had that long before she met Donald Trump,” Baggett said. 

However, Melania's handwriting and signature has “morphed” into Trump's in the last 10 years, the expert noted.

“Her current handwriting is almost like a brand, like a logo, and I think she morphed it a little bit more into matching Trump's as she bought into the brand,” Baggett added.

The signature on the letter to Putin is an “aggressive” one, which tied in with the powerful display of a B-2 Stealth Bomber flying overhead as the two leaders met for the first time last week, the expert said. 

“[Trump] did have a bomber fly over their meeting, he did have a red carpet. He had a lot of pomp and circumstance,” Baggett said. “So there's a lot of pressure about how powerful we are as a country and so that doesn't surprise me that it's a more aggressive signature.”

“You don't want a heart and flowers on your letters,” Baggett added, referring back to a handwritten note Melania penned in 2017 to the patients of a children's hospital in Italy.

Baggett, who stressed that he has not examined the letter to Putin personally, poured cold water on the conspiracy theory that the first lady's signature was forged in any way. 

“I don't see any nefarious thing about her letter,” Baggett said. “Those conspiracy theories, I think, are just grasping at straws.”

Chatter online turned to Trump's Sharpie, the marker he raved about during his first term, and he has used to sign dozens of executive orders since his return to the White House. 

“Did she borrow his Sharpie?” one person joked on X.

Well, quite possibly, according to Baggett, who said the Sharpie is typical of the Trump brand.

“I think a Sharpie probably was used, and it is very typical of his brand,” he said, referring to the signature on the Putin letter. “For some people, if you write really heavy, Sharpies are [a] really good instrument. People that write heavy are more passionate.”

The marker has become a trademark of the president's.

“I was signing documents with a very expensive pen and it didn't write well,” Trump said in a 2018 HBO documentary in partnership with Axios. “It was a horrible pen, and it was extremely expensive.”

“And then I started using just a Sharpie, and I said to myself, ‘Well wait a minute, this writes much better and this cost almost nothing,'” Trump said.

Reddit and X users were also wildly speculating whether the first lady used an autopen—which has become one of the president's go-to attack lines on his predecessor Joe Biden. Earlier this year, Trump began accusing Biden of using the mechanical device to sign pardoning documents, rather than doing so by hand. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents.

“Did Melania use Donald's autopen?” asked one X user.

“The autopen can only have one signature preset,” jested another.

The Independent has contacted the White House to inquire whether the first lady did, indeed, use Trump's Sharpie or an autopen to sign the letter to the Russian dictator.

Unfortunately for the autopen conspiracy theorists out there, until there is a definitive answer - it will remain a mystery. 

“If [Melania] has an autopen, we don't know about it,” Baggett concluded. “But [the signature] doesn't really deviate too much from her known handwriting,” the expert said. “She's got angular letters, she's got a very similar Trumpian style of ‘aggressiveness,' which I'll call triangles.'”

For years, TV writer Patrick Tarr has been writing scripts for shows like Murdoch Mysteries, Cardinal and Saving Hope — but his dream was always to write a book. Now, that dream has become a reality. Tarr's debut novel, The Guest Children, is a chilling supernatural tale inspired by real-life history: the evacuation of 6,000 British children to Canada during the Second World War. He joins guest host Gill Deacon to talk about reframing these events as a ghost story.

Vice President JD Vance revealed that he's "obsessed" with mysterious UFO videos during an appearance on the "Ruthless" podcast on Friday.

It started like something out of a sci-fi thriller: a glowing, pill-shaped object hovering over the skies of upstate New York. 

Photos captured near the Finger Lakes on Aug. 12 showed a slow-moving orb shrouded in a glowing mist, sparking a surge of UFO speculation in a community's Facebook group.

Some residents described it as "otherworldly," as others commented, asking what it was.

"They're here," one person joked. 

"Truly an amazing thing to witness!" another said.

But what many believed could be an alien visitation turned out to be something less supernatural: a rocket launch. 

According to Space.com, the mysterious orb was later confirmed to be the planned launch of the Vulcan Centaur by the United Launch Alliance from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.

OVER 60 UFO SIGHTINGS REPORTED WHIZZING ACROSS STATE IN FIRST HALF OF 2025, NATIONAL TRACKING GROUP SAYS

"My first instinct from my scientific and military training is to look for a conventional explanation, such as a meteorological or human-made aerospace explanation, because that's what many objects in the sky are," retired Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet, Ph.D., U.S. Navy, told Fox News Digital. "In this case, it was both."

He emphasized the critical nature of data verification when distinguishing between civilian misidentifications and genuinely Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).

"The primary protocols are to cross-check the visual sighting with other data: higher-resolution optical or infrared, radar, lidar, listen for a radio or acoustic signature, and if it looks to be under intelligent control, interrogate it via VHF radio. That will allow for a better characterization of the object, e.g. size, speed, altitude, range, material composition, and intentions."

As UAP sightings continue to rise, Gallaudet said that more scientific transparency and investigation could help reduce both stigma and fear.

"We tend to fear the unknown, and so more UAP research can not only reduce the stigma associated with the phenomena, but also transform their enigma status to accepted science," he said.

      By
      
      STEPHEN DAISLEY
    


I'm not one for conspiracy theories but I'm beginning to wonder if Nicola Sturgeon is secretly working for Westminster.

John Swinney stopped the bleeding in the polls. He had moved the government on from divisive social issues. After a couple of rocky years and a disastrous general election result, unity had at last been restored to the SNP.

Then along comes Nicola to remind everyone of all the things they furiously disagree on. All of a sudden, the headlines are chockers with the Sturgeon-Salmond psychodrama, SNP splits over gender recognition, and JK Rowling resuming her role as the unofficial leader of the opposition in Scotland.

If you're somehow nostalgic for 2021, the past seven days have been made for you. If you're an SNP strategist looking ahead to next year's Holyrood elections, they'll have had you weeping with clumps of your own hair in your hands.

Scottish voters go to the polls in eight months' time and instead of hearing why they should hand the Nationalists an unprecedented fifth consecutive term in government, they are being reminded of the woman who was First Minister or Deputy First Minister for most of the last two decades.

And unfortunately for the SNP their former leader comes with more baggage than the luggage collection point at Glasgow Airport.

In a landmark 2015 speech, Sturgeon decried the school attainment gap between rich and poor children and outlined her mission to ‘close that attainment gap completely'. She even insisted: ‘I want to be judged on this.' A decade on, far from closing, the gap is widening.

While education is seen as her major failing, it is far from the only area where she was found wanting. During her time as health minister, she introduced ‘legally binding' waiting time targets that even today are routinely being missed.

She was the First Minister who saw Scotland become the drug deaths capital of Europe, who boasted about ambitious climate targets even as her government habitually missed them, and whose attempt to procure two ferries ended in ballooning budgets, endless delays, and a nationalised shipyard.

Not only are voters being prompted to recall all this, they are doing so while watching Sturgeon push her memoirs, ironically titled Frankly, and be feted by literary luvvies at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. Oh, and take part in a bizarre photo shoot for a Sunday supplement. (In one shot, she is seen standing behind a glass wall, peering out intently. Perhaps it was meant as a metaphor for the gilded cage of political life, but I was waiting for her to ask Clarice if the lambs had stopped screaming.)

An argument popular among Sturgeon's fan club is that her detractors are afraid of a strong woman and a champion of Scottish independence.

Afraid of her? I'd have her back tomorrow. Dealt a hand that would bankrupt a Vegas casino (Corbyn, Brexit, Boris, Covid, Truss), not only did she fail to advance the independence cause, she set it back with her catastrophic Supreme Court gambit, confirming in law Westminster's supremacy in constitutional matters. Better Together should give her a lifetime achievement award.

No, it's people on her own side who are rapidly losing patience. Behind the scenes, SNP insiders just want her book tour to be over so Sturgeon can fade into the background.

Some are more public in their criticisms than others.

Irvine Welsh says gender identity ought to be ‘a fringe issue' but Sturgeon caused it to ‘leak right into the whole independence debate'. She did so, the Trainspotting and Porno author reckons, because she was ‘out of step with what people feel and believe in the way that social engineers always are'.

Is he one of those Right-wing misogynist transphobes Sturgeon seems to find everywhere she looks, like a gender-obsessed Joe McCarthy? Hardly. Welsh doesn't strike me as a political tribalist but he is plainly a man of the Nationalist Left.

It's possible she didn't even notice Welsh's comments, busy as she was keeping up her feud with JK Rowling. The Harry Potter author penned a coruscating review of Sturgeon's memoirs and the former First Minister thought the wise thing to do would be to go on Iain Dale's LBC show and pour kerosene on the flames, accusing Rowling of ‘punching down on trans people'.

If I ever set up a political consultancy, it will offer just one service: a daily memo containing nothing but the words ‘Don't pick a fight with a beloved billionaire author on the subject of whether or not women exist'. I would make enough to retire within a week.

Then again, at least Rowling can exercise her right of reply. The same can't be said of Alex Salmond, with whom Sturgeon has also been picking fights, rather unsporting considering the man's been dead ten months.

One passage in Frankly that has caused ructions is her account of the path to legislating for same-sex marriage. She claims that Salmond became ‘increasingly hostile' to the idea, fearing it would undermine support for independence, to the point where he was ‘implacably opposed'.

Geoff Aberdein, Salmond's former chief of staff, said this was ‘demonstrably false', and pointed to a newspaper clipping from the 2011 election campaign, when Salmond confirmed his backing for gay marriage. ‘If you're going to speak ill of the dead,' he quipped, ‘at least make your claims accurate.'

It's no great secret that Sturgeon and Aberdein aren't exactly besties, but he was in many of the rooms where the big decisions were taken. His perspective is valuable and, honestly, more plausible than Sturgeon's.

The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 was government legislation. If Salmond was implacably opposed, what changed his mind? Or are we to believe he was content to let his government push legislation he fiercely opposed? Doesn't sound like Alex Salmond, does it?

What I could believe is that Salmond tried to triangulate between liberal, professional urbanites and the rural and religious voters he had coaxed into the Nationalist fold. Salmond was a crafty old dog when it came to political tactics. He not only practised the dark arts, he could have taught them at Hogwarts.

If he is to be damned for wishing at times for ca'canny on major social change, he shouldn't face judgement alone. When Sturgeon claims her old boss ‘made arguments that seemed rooted in the prejudice which had put Section 28 on the statute book', it is worth considering her stance on removing Section 28 (called Section 2A in Scotland) from the statute books.

For although she was sympathetic to repeal, Sturgeon was not above a bit of triangulation herself. When Christian businessman — and SNP supporter — Brian Souter funded a methodologically unreliable ‘referendum' that showed voters opposed to repeal, Sturgeon said: ‘The ballot confirms what we already knew — that many people are concerned about the repeal of Section 2A.'

It was Sturgeon who told Holyrood ‘the real concerns of parents must be addressed'. Sturgeon who called for sex education guidelines to refer to ‘the value of marriage' without denigrating other relationships. Sturgeon who demanded statutory footing as a way of ‘reassuring parents that local authorities would not be at liberty to disregard guidance'.

Ah, you might say, but that's old history.

It is. Ancient history. So why is Sturgeon bringing it back up? Gay marriage, gender, the Salmond feud, the Rowling row – why she is bringing any of it back up? Sure, she has a book to sell, but it's not even that cynical. Poor judgement, failure and division accompany Sturgeon wherever she goes because these were her principal contributions to Scottish public life.

She may not be a secret agent but she is fast becoming Unionism's secret weapon. The SNP will not be able to move on until it tells Nicola Sturgeon to shove off.

Is the search for aliens finally over?

For years, scientists have scanned the skies for extraterrestrial intelligence using radio telescopes and optical tools to detect artificial signals.

But a new study suggests the issue may not be the lack of signals, but rather timing and direction.

So, what does the study say? And what does it mean for the search?

Let's take a look:

A recent study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society introduces a new way to look for possible extraterrestrial probes near Earth.

The researchers suggest using Earth's shadow as a natural filter to block out interference caused by satellites and space junk.

Notably, today's skies are crowded with thousands of satellites and millions of fragments of debris that reflect light. This makes it very hard to spot anything unusual, especially if it might come from beyond Earth.

To tackle this issue of “contamination,” an international team led by Beatriz Villarroel of Stockholm University turned to Earth's shadow.

When Earth blocks the Sun, it creates a cone-shaped shadow in space where no sunlight can bounce off satellites or debris. This makes it an ideal area to carry out a clean search. For objects in geosynchronous orbit, around 35,700 km above Earth, the shadow stretches across a base of nearly eight to nine degrees.

This is why the team focused on Earth's shadow. Each night, it creates a space where sunlight cannot reflect off satellites or fragments of debris.

Since human-made satellites rarely give off visible light, apart from occasional cases such as communication lasers or thrusters, any bright flash or streak seen within this shadow could point to something far more unusual.

For the study, the researchers examined more than 200,000 images from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a telescope in California that regularly scans the sky for changing objects.

They used an automated system called NEOrion, which flagged thousands of possible candidates. Most of these turned out to be meteors, aircraft or already known asteroids.

One case, however, was different.

The system detected an unidentified object moving much faster than typical asteroids and not listed in any existing database. The researchers could not determine what it was, leaving the finding unresolved.

The study also suggested new paths for future work. These include looking at astronomical photographs taken before 1957 to search for unexplained objects from before the space age, and studying the light signatures of materials that may have been altered by long exposure to space.

Although no alien artefacts were confirmed, Villarroel and her team believe their work shows that systematic searches are possible with the telescopes we already have.

They are now working on the ExoProbe project, a telescope network that will capture simultaneous observations and help measure the distance to unusual objects.

The researchers suggest astronomers should rethink their approach. If Earth's own signals are strongest during alignments, then signals from elsewhere may behave the same way.

Pinchen Fan, an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University and the study's lead author, said, “Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures.”

To increase the chances of detection, the team said scientists should focus on moments when exoplanets, planets outside our solar system, line up with their host stars, or at least when such alignments occur.

Written during a profoundly transformative period in her own life, author and psychic medium MaryAnn DiMarco invites readers to go on a spiritual and intuitive journey. The Guide Book(s) offers a compassionate roadmap for connecting with spirit guides who help support and guide each of us in unique ways.   

Harper's Bazaar: Your book presents spirit guides as reliable companions on life's journey. For someone feeling sceptical, what's the first small step they can take towards that possibility?

MaryAnn DiMarco: I think it's okay to feel sceptical. We don't have to fight it. We want to move ourselves into something that feels more in alignment with what spirit is trying to reveal to us. A belief system is a great place to start. If we could shift our perspective to believe that we are part of the light—as made from it—we can begin to connect with spirit and guides on the other side.

HB: You've structured The Guide(s) Book as a spiritual road trip. What was happening in your own life that made this metaphor feel essential? 

MD: My whole life was moving around, shifting, and changing. I worked with my guides to understand what I was feeling. For one, it was the resistance to moving which caused me stress and anxiety because it brought up things from being a child and moving a lot. Until we transition, we don't quite reach a destination. But I decided to make stops along the way, understand the scenic route, and allow myself to embrace it differently. I was making these road trips back and forth to my new destination down in Florida from New York over and over again, and it was stirring up a lot within me. I worked with my guides on it, and they were like, 'Let's write about this.'

HB: Many people struggle to trust their intuition, even if it feels loud. How do you suggest they differentiate between true spiritual nudges and ordinary thoughts or fears?

MD: A great way to make this discernment is to start learning about claircognizance, or your inner knowing, and intuition. What is your gut telling you versus what is your head telling you? Our human self wants to speak in terms of doubt, fear, and feelings of hesitation. If we can reach a point where we are going inward and listening to the story that we know is true, we will feel that flow. We must nourish that muscle and allow it to grow, and the spirit will give us validation to move into spaces of trust.

HB: You speak of 'honouring the pause', a profound idea in a culture obsessed with productivity. How can we begin to see stillness as sacred, rather than stagnant?

MD: I move into spaces of gratitude. I thank them for allowing me the time to pause so that I can welcome reflection into my mind, body, and soul. It's a time when I know that it is a moment of co-creation. I used to think I was stuck, but I moved on from 'I am stuck' to 'I am creating'. I am receiving instead of reaching. And I started to be really grateful for that. I realised how powerful these pauses are.

HB: When you're in that space of gratitude, what's the mental shift that takes place, and what's the physical manifestation of that mental change?

MD: It's clarity. Your physical self might still feel angst, but the knowing calms you. And you're not only able to communicate with your guides, but also hear your higher self. The reassurance of your own true story that lies within you becomes crystal clear. Our perception in these moments is key to the change. How we choose to look at it and how we speak about it will allow the information to flow to us more easily, or we can create resistance. If you could shift into gratitude and start to look at this as the most wonderful and creative time, even though you might be in a space of the unknown, you are trusting that the universe is showing you something far better than you could have imagined for yourself.

HB: Some might think connecting with spirit guides requires a rare gift or lifelong spiritual practice. What do you say to people who feel they're 'too late' or not 'spiritual enough' to begin?

MD: It is never too late to lead into the most authentic parts of your soul ever. It is a choice, whether you want to acknowledge it or not. It's never too late. And every year that I'm alive, I discover a new way of connecting. We are always learning. If you're willing to learn, you will always be able to receive new information for yourself. So it's never, ever too late.

A post shared by Dear Gabby (@deargabbypodcast)

HB: Can you share a moment from your own journey when working with your guides shifted the direction of your life in a way logic alone never could?

MD: Well, most recently, going through menopause. I realised that if I started working with my guides to understand the hormonal angst I was feeling, it would be life-changing. It brought me to a beautiful place of wisdom. I could have looked at it and said, "This is terrible, I'm hot flashing, and I feel that I'm gaining weight", but then I started to shift that, asking my guides to show me how to better take care of myself. I was able to be grateful for all the wisdom from all these years.

HB: You've taught countless students and worked with many clients. What are some common spiritual blocks that you see?

MD: Fear is the biggest one. Fear of the unknown, fear of not making connections, fear of never receiving information, fear of not accomplishing things. Fear, in all its various forms, is one of the biggest lessons that people work on trying to understand, especially when they come to me. Some people are even afraid that they'll never figure out what they have been feeling their whole life, and that they know they have this connection, but don't quite know how to grasp it. They feel like they'll never get the tools to understand it. I love to get them out of that space of fear and give them the power to understand it better.

HB: If readers could only walk away with one enduring lesson from The Guide(s) Book, what do you hope it would be?

MD: It would be that they are never alone. That even though we are technically walking through this (life) journey all by ourselves, we have a whole spiritual team on the other side that's here to help us. If we just say yes, we can help create many beautiful things in our lives, we can understand the hard times with a healthier perspective or a more healing perspective. That they can take away with them the feeling that anytime they want, they can hear the journey that they came here to experience and that their guides, their loved ones, their angels on the other side are cheering them on and that they want us to succeed.

I always say, "We sign up for the lessons, but I don't know that we sign up for the experience of how those lessons come into fruition". But I believe that they are cheering us on, and I think that they have always been with us. Even if you haven't believed in them or felt them, they believe in you, and they've been there for you. My hope is that people lean into that thought process and allow themselves to make the most beautiful connection that they could ever have while they are here in this space to help change their lives. I think it's extraordinary how they work with us. And so, I hope they find that magical miracle for themselves.

Are aliens coming to attack Earth with 3I/ATLAS? A Harvard scientist thinks it will be good news for Earth if the interstellar visitor turns out to be an alien spacecraft. He says encountering alien technology will change humanity forever. 

Harvard scientist Avi Loeb earnestly hopes that the interstellar alien object in the solar system turns out to be a spacecraft sent by extraterrestrial beings. This comes after his very open assertion, backed by evidence, that it is not a natural space rock or comet. He has said that almost everything about 3I/ATLAS points to it being an object designed by someone. Its trajectory, the light it released, and the lack of a tail are signs that it is not a naturally occurring cosmic body. Meanwhile, everyone else is refuting his claims, saying it is impossible that 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft. But Loeb stands steadfast on his observations. In fact, he actually wishes that the interstellar object were an alien probe coming for Earth. In a new blog post, Loeb states that the "mothership" will be a wake-up call for humans busy fighting for land and resources on Earth. He has previously called for world leaders to join hands and work towards a common threat, which 3I/ATLAS could be.

Also Read: Scientist claims mystery interstellar object is here to test human intelligence, and we have already failed. Here's why

Loeb says he is aware that "our financial or political systems will respond to such a potential threat in earnest only after our first encounter with alien technology." If the world agrees that 3I/ATLAS is aliens coming to seed Earth and other planets with probes, it "would reset our priorities", Loeb says. "Humanity desperately needs a wakeup call," Loeb wrote, and if his fears about the interstellar visitor turn out to be real, it would reset priorities and humans will be forced to stop focusing on "terrestrial conflicts", and explore what lies "beyond Earth". "With that perspective in mind, would it be better if 3I/ATLAS happens to be a spacecraft?" Loeb, known for his alien theories, asks.

The second reason Loeb thinks it is a good idea to encounter alien technology is that stumbling upon it in the way of 3I/ATLAS will save the world millions in research. If an alien spacecraft is coming towards Earth, it would be a treasure trove of technology that humans have yet to create. Accessing the scientific knowledge of another world will fast-forward human technology without adding to the financial burden of funding research to reach there, besides saving time.



The third reason the Harvard scientists want the visitor from outer space to be an alien spaceship is that it would be proof that interstellar travel is possible and inspire humans to undertake the journey themselves one day. Right now, NASA and other space agencies are trying to go as far as Mars. But encountering an alien spaceship will help them go beyond just the red planet. Notably, the Voyager spacecraft are already in deep space, but Loeb seems to be pointing to the fact that humans can visit interstellar space too if we gain access to alien technology.

Loeb argues that if humans are sure that aliens can attack Earth, they would sit up and take the necessary steps to protect the planet. He wrote that setting up "an alert system of monitors and interceptors around the Sun would protect Earth from a global threat by alien technology," besides telling us what lies beyond what we already know.
