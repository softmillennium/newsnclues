In this series, IndieWire speaks to creators and showrunners behind a few of our favorite television programs about the moment they realized their show was breaking big. So many things can go wrong on any given project. When they go right, it means that the creators in charge have made a series of decisions that support the story they want to tell. Netflix's “Adolescence” broke out way bigger than anyone ever expected, and wound up scoring 13 Primetime Emmy nominations. 1 at the Box Office, Will Netflix Start Taking Theaters Seriously Now? Lighting the Legacy: Why Los Angeles Is Home for ‘RuPaul's Drag Race' and Me Decision 2: Thorne convinced Graham to write it with him. “I've always thought that he was an actor that had a writer within him,” said Thorne to IndieWire over Zoom. He's nervous about writing, he's dyslexic, he doesn't see himself as a writer, but I thought we could find a way to work together that would allow that side of his brain to flower.” They met on Zooms; as Graham and Thorne talked things through, Thorne finalized dialogue and typed the script into the computer. Decision 3: They wrote the show to be shot in four episodes as single long takes. “I want this to be about knife crimes,” Graham told Thorne, “and I want this to be in a single take and four episodes.” During the writing process, Thorne realized that “the single take was changing the way I write. Where, conventionally, I would tell a story was not possible. Writing this show I realized the damage of that rhythm. Decision 4: With a rapidly approaching window to shoot the show, Graham and Thorne did something risky. “I didn't want to lose that window, and I didn't want the project to die,” said Thorne. “We just didn't suit what they wanted to do,” said Thorne. Graham had starred in the Netflix political series “Bodies.” They met with Netflix in January 2024 and were shooting by the summer. “Adolescence” launched production in July 2024 with director Phil Barantini and cinematographer Matthew Lewis, who had both shot the one-take drama “Boiling Point” with Graham. “They knew how to do it,” said Thorne. One of my jobs was to write the impossible and let these technically brilliant people work out ways to solve it, because it is always in the impossible that the interesting things happen.” “Particularly Thursday of tech week, there will be a lot of people around watching the take, because that would be a dress rehearsal for where we were going to go with it. The script wasn't a document which then would be taken into filming, which then would be taken into the edit. On Episode 3, Anne Mensah, our Netflix exec, felt like we were taking way too long to get into the room. We slashed the script, and that still felt too ponderous. And so we ended up with [the psychologist] being late. And she was then traveling through the center at triple speed. It was one of those golden processes that happened so rarely, where it felt like everyone wanted to be on the same team.” The show was screened for content chief Bela Bajaria, who showed it to Co-CEO Ted Sarandos. But that's not to say it wasn't a massive surprise. It did well in countries that I wouldn't expect to be interested in the story of a lad from Pontefract just outside of Doncaster. We weren't trying to tell a story that would work in America. Once the show aired to raves, Thorne started getting messages from old school friends, people who aren't in the business. “You became aware of how many people in different countries were watching it and having that response,” said Thorne. “It is partly down to the single shot, and people were interested in the technical prowess that Matt and Phil showed in making the show, and there is an element of the fear of ‘What's going on with my teenager behind a closed door?' The actors weren't being required to do Scene 13 from Episode 2, followed by Scene 16 from Episode 3, and then Scene 20 from Episode 6, because we only have the location for the single day. They were actually telling the story of an hour. Next up: Thorne is working on Sam Mendes' series of films about The Beatles. He also adapted William Golding's “Lord of the Flies,” directed by Mark London and filmed with 42 boys off the coast of Malaysia. All episodes of “Adolescence” are now streaming on Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Lopez has always been a superstar who knows how to command attention — whether it's with her music, movies, or her unforgettable love life. Over the years, the multi-talented icon and former “American Idol” judge has been engaged six times, and with each proposal came a dazzling new ring that captured just as many headlines as her red-carpet looks. From her very first engagement in the late 1990s to her most recent chapter with Ben Affleck, Lopez's collection of sparkling diamonds and rare gemstones tells the story of her journey through love, fame, and personal reinvention. These rings weren't just jewelry — they were cultural moments, cementing J.Lo's place as one of Hollywood's most glamorous and talked-about stars. According to People, Lopez's first engagement came from model-turned-waiter Ojani Noa in 1997. The pair married that same year, but the marriage lasted less than a year before they divorced in 1998. Their whirlwind romance culminated in a wedding later that year, but just nine months later, Lopez filed for divorce. Though their union was brief, the ring was elegant and sophisticated, a symbol of Lopez's growing Hollywood star power in the early 2000s. By 2002, Lopez had moved on to one of her most famous romances. Worth millions, the ring was instantly iconic and set a new standard for celebrity engagement rings. They officially split in early 2004, but the ring remains one of the most memorable pieces in Hollywood history. Later in 2004, Lopez married singer Marc Anthony. He proposed with an 8.5-carat blue diamond by Harry Winston, a bold and colorful stone valued at several million dollars. The ring symbolized a long and meaningful chapter in Lopez's personal life, and to this day, it remains one of her most striking engagement pieces. In 2019, baseball legend Alex Rodriguez proposed during a romantic Bahamas getaway. The ring was a showstopper, perfectly aligned with Lopez's glamorous style. While the couple seemed headed for marriage, postponements during the COVID-19 pandemic and growing strain led to their split in 2021. Affleck proposed a second time, this time with a rare green diamond — Lopez's favorite color and considered her lucky shade — flanked by white side stones. Lopez revealed Affleck engraved the band with “not.going.anywhere,” a personal message that reflected their renewed commitment. Jennifer Lopez's six engagement rings tell more than just the story of her love life — they serve as milestones in her career, her evolution as a global superstar, and her ability to captivate the public like few others can. From simple designs to rare colored diamonds, her collection is valued in the tens of millions and remains one of the most iconic in Hollywood history. Today, Lopez may once again be single, but her engagement rings — from Ojani Noa's marquise-cut to Ben Affleck's rare green diamond — will forever be part of her lasting legacy as a trendsetter in love, fashion, and fame.</p>

It made an estimated $15.4 million, and we know that because Warner Bros. told us. Netflix, however — as is its right — hasn't reported numbers, even though it probably would've beaten that. Industry sources told IndieWire that the film opened on 1,750 screens for just two days on Saturday and Sunday, not Friday, and over 1,150 of those screenings were sellout showings of ravenous tweens wanting to sing along with the animated K-pop musical in person. It did that without opening at any AMC Theatres locations, America's largest theater chain. Related Stories Warner Archive Gives Two Forgotten Classics the Blu-ray Upgrade They Deserve You Can Soon See Some of the Year's Best Undistributed Films at a Theater Near You Netflix isn't sweating those extra hundreds of thousands, and it won't report where it finally lands, even though it did when Rian Johnson's “Glass Onion” made $15 million from roughly 700 screens and one week in theaters. That's a little frustrating if you're a rival studio distributor who wants to size up the competition, but the question you're most likely asking is, does this mean Netflix will start putting more of its stuff in theaters? It looked at claims that money was probably left on the table with “Glass Onion” if it had only opened wider and said, thanks, we're good. But Netflix will also tell you, actually, we do put movies in theaters! We own two historic movie palaces in New York and Hollywood to host premieres. And all of our awards titles get small but notable qualifying runs for Oscars. We just don't report any box office data, but look at us being transparent. The other big difference between “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Glass Onion” is that “Demon Hunters” has already been on Netflix for two months. Everyone who saw it in theaters was a super-fan who had likely streamed it a bunch of times (God help you if you thought watching the “Sing-Along” version was the best way to check it out for the first time). They're likely the same folks who will show up to the Netflix House theme park locations, now opening November 12 in Philadelphia and December 11 in Dallas. Netflix, of late, has been about making events with its releases. If it can double viewing by splitting up seasons of “Squid Game,” “Wednesday,” and “Stranger Things,” it'll break its rule about dropping every episode at once. If it can get John Mulaney to fight some teenage boys live on its platform, it'll take that over your standard late-night talk show. Not everything for Netflix is going to be a K-pop musical that demands a sing-along, but if something really catches on again, could Netflix get creative about giving it its day in theaters? We're spitballing here, but what if there was an R-rated cut of “Happy Gilmore 2” you could only see in theaters? What if Rian Johnson came up with alternate endings for “Wake Up Dead Man” you could see after having watched it on streaming first? Netflix's hand may be forced about theatrical before long. But before then, it will have an exclusive run on IMAX screens. That's the tax, though, Netflix must pay to collaborate with a top-shelf director like Gerwig. Netflix has already lost out on a handful of projects because filmmakers still want their movies in theaters, and as Netflix squeezes bigger and bigger numbers out of these events, the pressure is only mounting for them to do more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "Old Town Road" rapper is facing serious criminal charges that could see him serve years in prison if convicted. Lil Nas X is facing four total felony charges over accusations that he attacked police officers and resisted arrest on Thursday (Aug. 21), while wandering naked in Los Angeles. Prosecutors confirmed to Billboard on Monday (Aug. 25) that they had charged “Old Town Road” rapper (born Montero Hill) with three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting executive officer over the alleged incident, which saw the star hospitalized. In a statement last week, the Los Angeles Police Department said Lil Nas had “charged at officers and was taken into custody” after they found him wandering nude on Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley. If eventually convicted of battery with injury on a police officer, the star could face up to three years in prison for each count. The incident came a day after he cleared his Instagram page, updated his name on the app to “Queen Madeline” and began repopulating it with a series of odd posts of himself in a series of costumes. Monday's charges came after Lil Nas sat in jail all weekend. On Friday, a spokersperson for the LAPD told Billboard that the artist “cannot be cited out,” and that “it is mandatory that he appears before a judge before he is released.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a stint in jail over the weekend, the musician's defense attorneys said after his arraignment hearing that they expect he'll be released on bail later Monday. Lil Nas X pleaded not guilty to the four felony charges filed against him Monday morning during an arraignment hearing in Van Nuys, with his bail set for $75,000. The rapper, whose real name is Montero Hill, was arrested on Thursday morning after he was seen roaming the streets of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, nearly naked and seemingly delirious. Nobody Can Stop Stray Kids, Especially With Their New Album 'Karma' He's been charged with battery and resisting a law enforcement officer. “He's never been in trouble for a split second in his existence, we're not going to let one little event change the trajectory of his amazing life,” Findling said. “Anybody that has kids, you hear about things like this all the time,” Findling continued. Findling said Monday not to “judge somebody by the worst moment in their life.” Hill was first caught on camera by TMZ in the early hours of Thursday morning, strutting down a near-empty Ventura Boulevard, wearing nothing but underwear and a pair of white cowboy boots. Lil Nas X, who released his Days Before Dreamboy EP back in March, has been struggling with health issues throughout 2025. “After my recent hospital visit, I – like all of you should – must prioritize my health and getting back to 100%,” the rapper said in a statement at the time. Hill's father Robert Stafford gave a brief update following the arraignment as well, telling reporters that Hill is “doing great mentally” following the arrest. “We said shed tears, we shed laughter, but he's in great spirits,” Stafford said of his first conversation with his son after the arrest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One recent Instagram post featuring some of the male cast members looking all dapper has left “DWTS” fans in a frenzy, thinking Britt Stewart's wedding has taken place. A post shared by Gleb Savchenko (@glebsavchenkoofficial) The frenzy started when Gleb Savchenko shared a dapper group photo with fellow pro dancers Pasha Pashkov, Sasha Farber, and Brandon Armstrong. While most of the comments seemed to focus on the men and fans swooning over them, others had some bold theories on why all the men were together and looking so dressed up. “Dancing With the Stars” fans know that pro Britt Stewart has plans to wed her season 31 partner, Daniel Durant. Rumors have said the wedding would take place this summer, but the happy couple has never confirmed this information. It would be logical to assume the looks were from a wedding weekend. It didn't take long for “DWTS” fans to flood the comments with love for these pros. The love didn't just stop with fans, as fellow “DWTS” pro and Pashkov's partner, Daniella Karagach, commented a series of heart-eyed emojis in the comment section. Stewart's wedding is supposed to take place sometime this year. We have seen bridal party photos with the “DWTS” cast. It seems only logical that the actual wedding would be taking place soon, right? One other fan just asked, “Is that from Britt's wedding or something else?” Farber also shared an image on his Instagram, which he was asking for opinions on glasses or no glasses. More “DWTS” faces in the crowd, so it just seems logical it was for Britt's wedding, right?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a popular YouTuber who entraps suspected sexual predators he contacts through Roblox was banned from the youth-targeted gaming platform this month, the company found itself defending its approach to moderation and user safety. Now a Congressman, state officials, and families are demanding accountability and bringing legal actions, saying that Roblox has allowed its platform to become a festering hub for horrific child exploitation. Even Chris Hansen, best known as the host of the sting segment To Catch a Predator on Dateline NBC, is looking into stories of grooming and abuse on Roblox. “When I tell you what we've learned in terms of what these predators are getting these kids to do, it's shocking,” Hansen tells Rolling Stone. Among the prominent personalities in this space is a 22-year-old creator known as “Schlep” (his real first name is Michael, though he does not share his surname for privacy reasons), who says he was groomed by a contracted Roblox developer he met in the game while in his early teens. According to statements from Schlep and his legal team, he eventually attempted suicide as a result, but afterward, when his mother contacted the company, they say they took no action against Schlep's abuser, only banning this person years later following a complaint from another developer. With the help of a team of collaborators, he poses as underage “decoys” in virtual Roblox environments, responds to adult users who contact him, lets them make incriminating statements unprompted, then arranges real-world meetups where the individual in question is detained by law enforcement. Two more cases are likely headed toward plea agreements, he says, though none of the alleged predators have yet to be convicted. Schlep tells Rolling Stone that it has always been his intention to work with Roblox to make the platform safer, but that the company has been a “brick wall” when he seeks to open up areas of cooperation. And I would love some form of communication where I can just directly report these people to you, because their reports just don't work.' I have lost total faith in their moderation and report system. A lot of victims don't have every chat log. It's enough for the cops where they're willing to charge and prosecute these people, but it's not enough for Roblox to take action on their platform.” The older videos on Schlep's main YouTube account, which has well over a million subscribers, were often critical of Roblox, sometimes highlighting inappropriate games hosted on the platform that weren't being removed. It was not until he pivoted to predator hunting, however, that his videos began going massively viral, escalating the debate over whether Roblox does enough to protect its young user base (about 40 percent of its users are under 13). In the videos, which appear with copious disclaimers labeling the content “edutainment” and instructing viewers “DO NOT TRY THIS AT ALL,” Schlep narrates as his ballcap-wearing Roblox avatar. He walks you through his chats — read by voice actors — with people who initiate explicit conversations in Discord servers associated with Roblox's adult-themed “Condo” sub-communities, conversations that continue in this vein after the suspect establishes that they are over 18 and the decoy has indicated that they are a minor. ‘I Want to Leave With My Dignity': One Woman's Self-Deportation Story As Schlep racked up arrests, he gained the mantle of an online folk hero, while Roblox was pilloried by viewers declaring that he had revealed crucial weaknesses in its safety protocols. Finally, on Aug. 7, under increasing pressure, Roblox issued a statement on how it collaborates with law enforcement to combat safety threats, touting their direct links with the FBI and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). It also clarified its policy against “vigilante groups,” similar to policies for apps including Discord, TikTok, and Snapchat. Schlep says he received no prior warnings about violating guidelines and that this is the sole direct communication he's ever received from the company. He retained the services of a law firm that has also brought multiple private lawsuits against Roblox for alleged harms to minors. In a recently filed Georgia case, a mother has alleged that her nine-year-old son was exposed to pornography and coerced into sending explicit images of himself to adults posing as children on the site. Other tech companies, including Meta, are regularly named as co-defendants in these cases — again, because conversations veering toward inappropriate topics often migrate to other platforms, such as Instagram or Discord. But Roblox is now squarely in the crosshairs of many legal actions thanks to its very young user demographic. Schlep's followers were outraged at his ban, arguing that he had stepped in to address an issue that Roblox preferred to sweep under the rug. “I feel like this decision isn't entirely based on the Schlep situation,” he said, noting that the safety problems had been “bubbling for years” and that “Roblox just refuses to acknowledge, refuses to listen to the community.” A week after Schlep's ban, the company unveiled stricter prohibitions on romantic and sexual content, announcing it would take action even against material that “implied” sexual activity and was rolling out new technology to detect “violative scenes.” Perhaps this rang hollow after recent headlines about Roblox CEO David Baszucki floating the idea of the platform attracting more adult users by offering online dating services. Since the cease and desist, Schlep and his supporters have pushed a #FreeSchlep campaign, with some staging virtual protests on his behalf within Roblox. (A handful of users claim to have received disciplinary warnings for displaying that slogan in the game, though the company denies this, with a spokesperson saying they “value open debate on the platform,” and that any moderation “was likely linked to another policy violation.”) The hashtag was taken up by Louisiana State Rep. Laurie Schlegel, who on X asserted that Roblox “has a history of refusing to take action against sexual predators” and makes far fewer reports to NCMEC than other apps. (NCMEC did not respond to requests for comment on the efficacy of Roblox's safety measures or policies against vigilante behavior.) These attacks came as Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murrill, filed a blistering lawsuit against Roblox, describing it as “overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety.” Roblox defended itself against Murrill's claims in a press release. “Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue,” the company said. Rod Breslau, co-founding editor of ESPN Esports and a consultant to companies in the gaming and streaming scene, observes that Roblox could have taken earlier coverage of their safety failures as a cue to bolster their safety practices well before Schlep's videos took off. “It should not take an independent Roblox YouTuber like Schlep doing vigilante-style To Catch a Predator takedowns to elicit the attention of a state attorney general — and then and only then do Roblox come back with an official statement and a change in policy on sexual content on the platform. The outcry over Roblox's safety standards has also attracted the attention of Rep. Ro Khanna, who launched his own petition, titled “Stand with Us to Protect Kids and Save Roblox.” It states that “powerful tech companies can do more” to stop child exploitation but only calls upon Roblox by name to bolster its protections. “These conversations have included stories of inappropriate interactions and algorithmic suggestions. I am collaborating with the community to listen and explore what actions can and must be taken to protect kids on the platform. As Roblox weathers this firestorm, the company is nevertheless holding firm in its anti-vigilante line to justify Schlep's ban. “Taking the law into your hands isn't safe in the real world and it's not safe online,” a Roblox spokesperson tells Rolling Stone. “That's why we work with law enforcement to hold bad actors accountable. Many experts agree independent actors impersonating others and luring users to other platforms for sexually explicit conversations can never be safe. The company also shared quotes from police, attorneys, and academics describing how vigilante groups may interfere with investigations or employ methods that undermine criminal cases against offenders. They may obtain evidence through extralegal means that can't be used in prosecutions, for example. Online child safety expert Jessica Chalmers concurs that “vigilante predator hunting for YouTube content is dangerous” and can create more risk. But Schlep says Roblox is distorting the nature of his content. “I don't view myself as a vigilante,” he says. “‘Vigilante' means that you are going ahead and taking the law into your own hands, right? “If you read their policy, it specifically says law enforcement is best positioned to take action related to this sort of stuff,” he says, which is somewhat at odds with Roblox's insistence in their cease and desist letter that he should have reported suspicious behavior to them first. Schlep has spoken with Hansen about this very question, and says the famed predator catcher told him that he “always goes to law enforcement first,” while “social media platforms come second.” “Instead of saying, ‘Look, we're going to make you our young security emissary and have you help us,'” Hansen says, “they shut him down and banned him from the site, even though some of the cases he exposed were criminally prosecuted. Internet child safety expert Fareedah Shaheed agrees that Roblox could be doing more to mitigate abuse, including working alongside motivated activists like Schlep. “Roblox does have a number of safety tools in place that are helpful, but there's still a long way to go in how they handle reports of grooming and how they engage with creators raising awareness of the problem,” she says, noting that it's clear Schlep “genuinely cares about protecting kids.” “I wish Roblox would find ways to work with creators like him to strengthen protections and build trust for both parents and children,” Shaheed says, calling his ban “a step back” for the company. Once politicians and parents have identified your product as a significant danger to kids, it can be all but impossible to rid the brand of that toxic reputation. Russia's Foreign Minister Struggles to Defend Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Thanks, Trump: ICE Just Gassed a Public School Into Submission Still, Shaheed notes that Roblox is hardly unique in struggling to ensure child safety. “These risks exist in any open-world, open-communication game, and tackling them requires collaboration across companies, experts, and communities.” Chalmers says that in addition to making the most of parental controls, “explaining the risks” to children accessing internet platforms and letting them know “how to block and report anyone who makes them uncomfortable” is essential for their protection. “Ultimately, an educated child is the best filter we can give them,” she says. Of course, for many, the damage is already done, and it seems there's no shortage of victims who believe that Roblox could have prevented what happened to them. Devastating accounts of child abuse are tough for any tech company to answer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How do you take an idea and stretch it to its extreme, surreal conclusion? For two seasons, Nathan Fielder's The Rehearsal has practiced this on scales grand and small. Cut to season two as Fielder flies a commercial airliner alone across the Atlantic. But this constant ratcheting up happens within individual episodes, and there is perhaps no episode that put this to better use than “Pilot's Code.” This premise is mostly sidelined in “Pilot's Code,” which instead goes eccentrically philosophical with the question: How can we really understand what goes on in another person's head? The episode begins with a couple who cloned a beloved pet dog but are unhappy that it does not behave like its progenitor. It's not hard to see why this episode was submitted in the directing category. As Fielder's voiceover explains with characteristic deadpan that “what you're about to witness is going to seem weird,” we watch as he shaves off his body hair, puts on a diaper, and enters a set designed to look like an infant's nursery and scaled to render Fielder the size of a baby. From here, we follow as he speed-runs through Sullenberger's childhood, his mother first a giant puppet and then, with his dad now in the picture, an actor on stilts to maintain the difference that Sully would see as a child. With his “parents,” Fielder-as-Sully breastfeeds from a giant marionette, milk pouring out from the papier-mâché nipple and overflowing from his mouth onto his diaper-clad body as a wooden voiceover reads, “I tried not to think about the fact that I was a 41-year-old man and just did my best to be present in the moment.” Then, after researching extensively with Sully's memoir, Fielder suggests that as the pilot landed the plane on the Hudson, he popped in his earbuds to listen to Evanescence's “Bring Me To Life.” By now, after the carnivalesque childhood sequence, Fielder's suggestion that this is plausible goes down more easily. And he deserves to be honored—even among some stiff competition—for sticking that tricky landing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KPop Demon Hunters is also the first soundtrack with four Hot 100 top 10s at all in nearly 30 years. Also from the album, Saja Boys' “Your Idol” holds at its No. 4 high and their “Soda Pop” surges 10-5 — while HUNTR/X slays with its second top 10, as “How It's Done” bursts 14-10. KPop Demon Hunters becomes just the fifth soundtrack with four Hot 100 top 10s at all, and the first since Waiting To Exhale spun off a record five in 1995-96. The act also became the first all-woman collective of three or more members to reign in 24 years, since Destiny's Child with “Bootylicious” for two weeks in August 2001. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. The track scores a fifth week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; debuts at No. 42 on Radio Songs; and holds at its No. The soundtrack to Netflix's empowering, action-packed and heartwarming KPop Demon Hunters hauls in a fourth Hot 100 top 10, as HUNTR/X's “How It's Done,” the act's second top 10, after “Golden,” bounds 14-10. “How It's Done” was driven by 17.2 million streams (up 2%) in the tracking week. HUNTR/X and KPop Demon Hunters adversaries Saja Boys come to a draw, each with two Hot 100 top 10s: the latter's “Your Idol” keeps at its No. (“It is annoyingly catchy,” HUNTR/X's Rumi concedes of “Soda Pop” in the film.) Despite their on-screen combat, HUNTR/X and Saja Boys — whose music is voiced by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee — combine to make KPop Demon Hunters the first soundtrack ever to generate four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s. It's also the first soundtrack with at least four Hot 100 top 10s overall since Waiting To Exhale reeled off a record five in 1995-96. The only other soundtracks with four top 10s each: Saturday Night Fever (in 1977-78), Grease (1978) and Prince and the Revolution's Purple Rain (1984-85). Meanwhile, the last time a soundtrack sent three songs to the Hot 100's top five simultaneously, as KPop Demon Hunters has now done via “Golden,” “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop”? 2) and Yvonne Eliiman's “If I Can't Have You” (also written by the trio; No. “It's so thrilling that people are hearing the songs in two ways,” KPop Demon Hunters executive music producer Ian Eisendrath recently told Billboard. The movie's profile will be further enhanced thanks to sing-along theater screenings held Aug. 23-24, with any related boost in its songs to be reflected on next week's Billboard charts, dated Sept. 6 and encompassing streaming, airplay and sales Aug. 22-28. 2 on the Hot 100 after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73.8 million, essentially no percentage change) and a 13th week atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the list made its seasonal return after Memorial Day. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, is steady at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” falls to No. Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which topped the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and wrapped as the year's No. 7 — as it adds a record-extending 105th week on the chart overall and a record-padding, and landmark, 75th week in the top 10. Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Justin Bieber's “Daisies” drops 6-8 and Wallen's “Just in Case” descends 8-9, both after reaching No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Additionally, Chad Feehan (Lawmen: Bass Reeves) will serve as showrunner of the offshoot. The Dutton Ranch, home to Beth Dutton (Reilly) and Rip Wheeler (Hauser), is a testament to the peace they sought, fought for, and nearly died for, as they've come to cherish their 7,000-acre land. With tough times and stiff competition, Beth and Rip do what they must to survive, all while ensuring Carter (Little) becomes the man he's supposed to be. Bening will play Beulah Jackson, the powerful, cunning and charming head of a major ranch in Texas. Reilly's Beth is John Dutton III's (Kevin Costner) daughter, a former head of acquisitions at the Schwartz & Meyer financial firm. Hauser's jaded ranch foreman Rip, who first came to John Dutton as a young boy on the run after killing his stepfather to protect his mother, learned how to be a cowboy from John, who treated him like a son. Yellowstone was co-created by Sheridan and John Linson, who executive produce with Art Linson, Costner, David C. Glasser, Bob Yari, Stephen Kay, Michael Friedman, Christina Voros and Keith Cox. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. The Yellowstone Universe also includes prequels 1883 and 1923, both of which have concluded their runs. Two other upcoming offshoots join the Beth and Rip series on the slate: The Madison for Paramount+, led by Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals for CBS, led by Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton. Additional universe entries 1944 and 6666 previously were announced as being in development. From Paramount Television Studios and 101 Studios, The Dutton Ranch is executive produced by Sheridan, Glasser, the Linsons, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Yari, Friedman, Feehan, Voros, Reilly, Hauser and Cox. Bening is a BAFTA and Golden Globe winner with multiple Oscar, Tony and Emmy nominations under her belt. On stage, Bening was last seen alongside Tracy Letts in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons, which earned her a Tony nomination. She will next be seen in the Apple TV+ limited series Lucky, working opposite Anya Taylor-Joy. Previously, Bening starred in and executive produced the Peacock limited series Apples Never Fall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Snoop Dogg is opening up about a terrifying experience he had at the movies—one that was seemingly so distressing it took him three whole years to talk about it. No it wasn't at a screening of Hereditary or Weapons or anything that would be slightly less embarrassing for the “Gin And Juice” rapper. The rapper recalled taking his grandson to see 2022's Lightyear in an interview with the It's Giving podcast, during which he discussed seeing one of the film's protagonists raise a baby with another woman. For many, this would be an opportunity to educate a young mind on a different type of relationship model, but not for Snoop! I just came to watch the goddamn movie,” he remembered thinking. The whole experience “fucked me up,” he reflected. Y'all throwing me in the middle of shit that I don't have an answer for.” I'm like, ‘What part of the movie was this? We have to show that at this age? I don't have the answer… What you see is what you see, and they're putting it everywhere.” Due in part to reactionaries like Snoop Dogg, Disney is no longer “putting it everywhere.” (Not that the company ever really was.) Pixar reportedly axed queer themes from this year's Elio—to the film's detriment—after doing the same to Disney+'s Win Or Lose last year. I felt like it was very important that we not hide that fact,” the mother of Chanel Stewart, the trans voice actor whose character's gender identity was scrubbed in the latter project, said last year. “There may be some parents out there who are not ready to have that conversation, but this is the world that we live in and everyone should be represented. Everyone deserves to be recognized.” Until that happens, Snoop Dogg may want to pick up a book or just spend some time on Google so he can answer these pretty basic questions in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kilmar Abrego Garcia has never set foot in Uganda, but President Donald Trump's administration is currently “processing” his deportation to the East African nation after rearresting him at a mandated check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Today, [DHS Secretary Kristi Noem] announced that ICE arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He will be processed for removal to Uganda,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote on X. Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any crime. Despite the Trump administration having been ordered by a judge in Tennessee to stop making inflammatory public comments about the case, Secretary Noem today described Abrego Garcia as “an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator” whom Trump would not allow to “terrorize American citizens.” Abrego Garcia was released from federal custody in Tennessee on Friday and allowed to return home to Maryland, after a judge ruled that the federal government — which has charged Abrego Garcia with unlawfully transporting undocumented migrants based off a 2022 traffic stop — had failed to prove that he was a flight risk or threat to the public in a manner that required pre-trial detention. Before his release, the Trump administration apparently offered Abrego Garcia a choice between Scylla and Charybdis: Plead guilty to the charges and be allowed to live in Costa Rica following his sentence, or reject the plea, get out of jail, and face deportation to Uganda. By that point, Abrego Garcia — who is married to an American citizen, and has one child and several step children — had been held captive by the state for over 160 days. Russia's Foreign Minister Struggles to Defend Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Thanks, Trump: ICE Just Gassed a Public School Into Submission And specifically weaponizing the decision of which country they send him to,” his attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said today. This shows that they were playing games with the court all along — due process means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after.”</p>
