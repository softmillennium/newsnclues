Jennifer Coolidge is very much missed on this season of The White Lotus, but it doesn’t mean her presence isn’t haunting the luxury resort like a fabulous ghost. You can’t stop thinking about how it must be nice to be dead as she’s no longer with her bum ex-husband, Greg, who has made his way back into another White Lotus resort in Thailand with a new woman on his arm.

Taylor Swift returned to Instagram Saturday after not posting on the app for 100 days to praise Selena Gomez‘s “I Said I Love You First,” the “Only Murders in the Building” star’s new musical collaboration with her fiancé Benny Blanco. “[Selena Gomez] & [Benny Blanco] I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDD,” Swift wrote on Instagram Stories, sharing a link to the album. The 14-song record is Gomez’s first major musical release since her 2020 album “Rare.” While her fans are certainly pleased that the current queen of pop shared the project on social media, they’re also expressing frustration with other artists who are not showing support despite the fact Gomez has supported them in the past. Prior to Swift’s glowing endorsement, one popular Gomez fan account posted to X, “No celebrity supporting Selena Gomez’s new album except Becky G. Not Even Taylor Swift.” The post has since been taken down. Fans are also upset with Gomez’s label Interscope Records, saying that it has not properly promoted the project since its March 21 release. “[Interscope Records] must really love losing money by not promoting one of their biggest artists,” wrote one fan on X. Ahead of the album’s release, Spotify posted a teaser in the form of a one-on-one sitdown between Blanco and Gomez. “We’d get up in the morning and have a conversation. “I was constantly just writing whatever you said wherever we were,” Blanco added. “Sometimes, you’d be saying something really important, and I didn’t know if you even realized, but I would always open my phone and be like, ‘Fuck, that’s such a good line for a song.’”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bill Skarsgård may be gaining a reputation for enjoying transformative performances with roles like Pennywise in “It” and Count Orlok in “Nosferatu,” but like any other actor, he likes mixing things up too. Keeping it simple for his most recent outing, the close-quarters thriller “Locked” sees Skarsgård trapped and tortured inside the car of a sociopath played by Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins. “I was very happy because I had a bigger break than usual — four or five months, which I really needed in order to shake off Mr. Orlok,” Skarsgård said in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly. And there’s something about it that was so different from what I have been doing, and I often instinctively want to go somewhere that’s the polar opposite of my current project, just to keep challenging myself. The camera’s here, and I’m not looking at a person.’ All of Anthony’s dialogue is spoken through the car. There were some scenes Hopkins had recorded his dialogue for, but other times, Skarsgård only had the Assistant Director to perform with. “When he did show up in person, that was one of the high points. In our review of the film, IndieWire’s Christian Zilko said, “A remake of the Argentine thriller ‘4×4,’ and often too cheesy for its own good, David Yarovesky’s two-hander stars Skarsgård as a small-time carjacker who picks the wrong self-driving vehicle to break into. He finds himself trapped and tortured over the phone by William (Hopkins), a dying man who is sick of petty crime. The film’s attempts at exploring morality might be underwhelming, but ‘Locked’ finds plenty of silly opportunities to exploit its gimmick of a premise, likely to the delight of anyone who willingly buys a ticket to a movie about Bill Skarsgård being locked in a car.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The biggest mystery for Cordelia Cupp has been solved: how did The Residence, a show filled with Kylie Minogue references, get the Princess of Pop to play along? Shonda Rhimes said the team ” didn’t know if it was gonna happen.” The answer is a lot more simple: It’s as easy as just talking to Minogue. In an interview with Variety, showrunner Paul William Davies explained that they simply approached the pop star with the project, and she “really responded” to the show. “For being Kylie, she’s a very down-to-earth, warm, accessible person who really thought it would be fun,” Davies said. “I was like, ‘Anything you’re able to do or willing to do, I’ll write for you.’ So I wrote more because she was game.” Minogue plays herself, a dinner guest who becomes a performer after Harry Styles cancels. Then, she transforms into a suspect of a murder after White House chief usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead at the party.

Having performed professionally now since they were 13 years-old, acting has become second-nature to the still relatively young talent, Bella Ramsey. Now co-lead of the hit HBO series “The Last of Us,” Ramsey has gotten more opportunities to hone their craft and in doing so, has only gotten to learn more about themself. Speaking in an interview in British Vogue, Ramsey shared that a crew member with an autistic daughter noticed certain habits they were exhibiting that related to sensory issues and hyperawareness common with the diagnosis. As Ramsey puts it, this can be incredibly “freeing” when you’re neurodivergent and offers them a great deal of “grace” towards themselves. This diagnosis has also allowed them to further understand elements of their identity, but at the same time, they’re not interested in being thought of as just one thing. “The label of being autistic has been so helpful to me because that’s helped me to understand myself,” said Ramsey, “but gender and sexuality-wise, labels do not feel comfy for me in any capacity, because I feel like I’m putting myself into a box. Being one of the most famous talents in their age range has made it so that they can’t exactly avoid being in the “public eye” and while they do feel more comfortable once people are aware of their autism, they do wonder what it must feel like not to have to put themself out there, especially when it comes to exploring the more sensitive elements of their life. “It does make me a bit sad that people who aren’t in the public eye can explore their gender identity or sexuality in private,” Ramsey told British Vogue. If I did want to explore other things, like facets of my gender identity, that would be done publicly. As much as I would try and keep it private, if someone recognizes me on the street, say if I’m presenting differently, [and] takes a photo, then that is just talked about.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Rumors were further fueled when the Los Angeles Times reported that Zendaya “kept showing her ring, smiled coyly and shrugged her shoulders mysteriously” after being asked about her relationship status with Tom Holland. (The actor did not attend the awards show.)

One day later, a source confirmed to Us Weekly that Holland had popped the question to Zendaya years after meeting on the set of Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2016.

At the time, she opened up via her Instagram Story that she spent the morning crying as a result of her husband’s diagnosis and ongoing health battle. “Sometimes in our lives, we have to put our big girl panties on and get to it, and that’s what I’m doing,” she explained. “But I do have times of sadness every day, grief every day and I’m really feeling it today on his birthday.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Teigen, who is a fan of the first season of the show, told Entertainment Weekly during filming for the show’s finale that there are several reasons why she was open to coming on board as season 2’s banker. “My history with the show, obviously, NBC is family in our house, coming to Panama with my friends,” Teigen said.“I love the show! “It was one of my first jobs in entertainment ever.

Most haircuts are either long overdue or a cry for help, but in the case of Adam Scott in season two of Severance, it’s a bat signal for everyone who had a crush on Ben Wyatt on Parks and Rec. Fans have been thirsting over the flashback scenes in episode 7, when a younger Mark Scout is happily in love with Gemma before both of their severance procedures. However, when Scott is looking back on the admiration, it confuses both him and Jimmy Kimmel since he isn’t actually younger in the flashback scenes. “You’re the same age, in fact you might actually be older in the flashbacks,” Kimmel points out to his talk show guest, Scott. “Literally all I did was get a haircut,” Scott explains. Haircuts do a lot for people, just ask anyone who had a glow-up on Love Is Blind.

However, it wasn’t just a simple haircut; it was Ben Stiller’s vision we have to thank for Mark S’s hair. “That’s all Ben Stiller, he loves that hair do,” Scott continues. “From the very beginning of the show, he had a very specific idea of what my hair should look like and that’s what it is.” Stiller just wanted Mark S to serve, whether it was to serve Lumon or to serve cu—</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While Boz did have “a lot” of workable outfits in her closet ahead of time, she still needed to request additional looks from the fashion houses themselves considering the amount of filming days in her schedule. “I got a rack and then pulled out everything in my closet that was by Black designers, and then pulled out all my jewelry by Black designers, too,” Boz told the outlet.

Pregnant Olivia Culpo is proudly bumping along as she and her husband, NFL running back Christian McCaffrey, prepare to welcome their first baby.

Culpo announced in March 2025 that she is pregnant nearly one year after she and McCaffrey tied the knot in the model’s native Rhode Island.

“I’ve been truly on bedrest for, like, four weeks,” Culpo revealed in a TikTok video that month, which was filmed ahead of her pregnancy announcement. “Towards the end of the two weeks of being really sick, I got a subchorionic hematoma, which is basically a blot clot in my uterus and I was bleeding everywhere.”

Culpo was ultimately “so excited” when a follow-up ultrasound with her OB-GYN revealed that her pregnancy was still viable.

“[I’m] really grateful that everything is going well so far,” she added, suggesting that taking progesterone suppositories was “the only reason” that her body is able to maintain the pregnancy.

Nowadays, it seems acting is a talent you have to be born with, and no one knows this better than recent Oscar-nominee Timothée Chalamet. I don’t know him, but he seems to be making interesting choices.” Even someone like Clooney had to take on some stinkers before getting to have more control over the projects he’d agree to be a part of, but Soderbergh isn’t sure Chalamet has ever faced this problem or ever will. While this is great for Chalamet, Soderbergh isn’t sure whether this has set an unhealthy expectation in the industry that young talent have to bring star power with them to a project instead of the project helping these actors rise in stature. “It’s interesting to think about how you make a movie star now, because movies aren’t the same as they were 25 years ago,” Soderbergh told Men’s Health. “Leading men, or people who become stars, do so by getting opportunities and making good on them. A lot of the conversation now, if you talk to filmmakers in terms of casting, is using people who have already established themselves and who everybody’s chasing.” Soderbergh empathizes with this new generation, especially considering there aren’t the same amount of options for work to cut their teeth on as there was when he and Clooney were coming up. However, in conversations he’s been have with Focus Features, A24, and Neon, he does get the sense that young people are starting to find their way into theaters, particularly if there is a director who’s work they’re really interested in seeing. The latest cast Soderbergh’s worked with for “Black Bag” includes Michael Fassbender, Cate Blanchett, Pierce Brosnan, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomi Harris, and Regé-Jean Page.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s time for a performance review. But don’t worry, Mr. Milchick — the internet is in charge this time, and it’s looking like you might just be meme-ployee of the month. When the season-two finale of Severance dropped on Apple TV+, it introduced us to a brand new Lumon department. And let’s just say that the choreography in Tramell Tillman’s marching band scene has been providing fans with a lot of merriment. Perhaps Tillman knew how popular his efforts would be, because he arrived at a Severance finale screening and panel at PaleyFest on March 21 with gloves, a whistle, and an actual band to lead:

“I didn’t want Milchick to dance in season two, because I didn’t want, ‘Oh, he dances in every season,’” Tillman recently told Vulture. “But there was something about the idea of playing a drum major that really excited me.” And it’s apparently been equally exciting for all the Innies and Outies who haven’t been able to stop pumping out memes about Milchella over the past couple days. Praise Kier for all the content we have here:

Asking for another season of Adolescence is, in some way, asking for another fictional murder to happen (just for it to be solved by the end, don’t worry.) Despite not being based on a specific event and rather inspired by several news stories in the UK, Adolescence is, right now, just a mini-series similar to Baby Reindeer. However, its focus on a recurring epidemic in youth culture does give the show an opportunity for another go. “One of our aims was to ask, ‘What is happening to our young men these days, and what are the pressures they face from their peers, from the internet, and from social media?’ ” Series co-creator and star Stephen Graham explained to Netflix on the core thesis of the series. “And the pressures that come from all of those things are as difficult for kids here as they are the world over.”

While Netflix originally green-lit Adolescence as a mini series, it’s not out of the question to give it an upgrade to a multi-season show. The streamer did that for Beef once it saw the high reception and praise for the show; it’s even a possibility for shows outside the Netflix sphere as well, Max also upgraded The White Lotus to the luxury suite on their roster. Hopefully, Graham has a few pitches in mind for other epidemics to explore, maybe looking at Katie’s family’s perspective as one idea.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/adolescence-stephen-graham-eddie-finale-ending-scene-interview.html'>How Stephen Graham Carried the Weight of Adolescence</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 16:00:45 <p>
Spoilers follow for the Netflix series Adolescence, all four episodes of which began streaming on March 13. The British character actor who started his career working with gangster-mythmakers Guy Ritchie and Martin Scorsese can be relied upon for a certain amount of machismo. Graham’s filmography is dotted through with dudes who have a short fuse and the fighting skills to back it up. But in Adolescence, the four-episode Netflix series about Jamie Miller (newcomer Owen Cooper), a budding 13-year-old incel who stabs a female classmate (Emilia Holliday) to death, the swagger some might associate with Graham is absent. In its place is a raw wound of regret, vulnerability, and confusion, which Graham, who also co-created and co-wrote the series with Jack Thorne, uses to play Jamie’s father Eddie as he struggles with the truth of what his son has done. Each episode of Adolescence was filmed with one camera in one uninterrupted take, and that level of immersion makes the characters’ emotional highs hit harder. The series banks on us being shocked by Jamie’s transformation after seven months in a youth facility in “Episode 3,” which centers on a psychologist’s interview that sends Jamie into bursts of rage and bitterness. But it breaks our hearts in “Episode 4” by spending its entire final installment with the Millers, who on Eddie’s 50th birthday learn that Jamie has decided to plead guilty. Jamie’s phone-call confession sends Eddie into a teary existential crisis, one that ends with Eddie in Jamie’s bedroom, where his teen son tumbled down the social-media rabbit hole and peed his pants when cops came to arrest him. Graham’s version of Eddie’s achingly analytical, Everyman masculinity was informed, he says, by observing his father and uncles, hearing relatives’ stories about growing up with corporal punishment in schools, and parenting his two children with wife Hannah Walters, who produced the series with Graham under their banner Matriarch Productions. “Eddie was trying to hold it together, constantly trying to hold it together, from that moment where he sees in “Episode 1” that his son has done it,” Graham says. “He’s poleaxed and will never be the same again.” In Episode 4,” Eddie and his wife Amanda (Christine Tremarco) speak to each other about Jamie with a lot of questions. If you listen to conversations, man and wife are constantly asking each other questions, in many ways. And in this situation, they’re trying to find the justification, but also seeking that kind of reassurance. We are on the same page here? We had Jack with us for the first three days of every rehearsal week. We could really dissect the language and pick out every single nuance. That’s the beauty of this particular process that we’ve managed to find, this one-take process. You’re in a state of flow. They’re passing the camera to each other. It’s like you’re building a little symphony. You’ve got the sound operators hiding little mics in certain places where they can’t be seen, and you’ve got the props department coming in and putting things down and then making sure that they’re not there when you move away. I’m curious about how you wanted your physicality to be different. I think the crew were a bit shocked at first because I actually fucking mowed the garden. Not that I’ve never mowed a garden, but I wanted to be in Eddie’s garden. You’re trying to escape it by doing a mundane thing, mowing the garden. I’m going to have a good day today. And then I see the bike: He’s not here. Was there one technical thing about the process that required an even higher level of choreography and finesse in the fourth episode? Don’t forget you’ve got to get it off the rig as well. So it’s both of those moments. At the beginning, you’re rehearsing everything. In the scene where Eddie goes through a fence to chase the teen boys who graffitied his van, I used to go, “Matt, I’m not happy with you trying to get through that hole in that gate. Can we lift the wire up a little bit?” It’s very quick, and it’s not a big gap! We’ve made it through the gap. And then you hit that state of flow, and it’s like, I know he’s going to make it through the gap. I know he’s going to get there. But in the same respect, everything Eddie’s saying to this kid is right: “You don’t do that. You don’t know what’s going on. You don’t know what’s happening in here.” Eddie opens up to that kid more than he probably has at home. Then he becomes aware of the fear that he’s putting into this kid, and that frightens him. You don’t see a lot of Eddie on the way back. When we’re in the car with Jamie (in “Episode 1”) — this was a conscious choice — you don’t see Jamie’s face. You don’t see the true impact it’s having on him. We didn’t want to show you. As an audience, you’re really listening to what’s being said, and you’re just watching for a bit. You’re looking to see the faces, and you’re looking to see what’s going on. We’ve been given all of that back-of-head and side-of-head space and then as Eddie opens the door to take the plant out, you see his face. My favorite bit of all is we then go in the house with Christine, and she hangs the coat up. It’s some of the most beautiful acting I have ever seen. She’s trying to hold it together for the family, and it just breaks for a second, and she crumbles as she’s hanging the coat up — and then she pulls it back together to go upstairs. I have to ask about the ending, where you kiss Jamie’s teddy bear and tuck it into his bed. I know this moment wasn’t scripted, and came to you in rehearsal. One of my favorite bits is when Amélie goes downstairs, and Eddie says, “How did we make her?” And then Christine says, “The same way we made him.” That line has so much gravity, but also, it’s so honest. I remember that, and walking into the bedroom for the first time and saying, “What are we going to do, Phil, when I come in here? I want to come in and have a look, because this is where it all started.” And then Phil put the teddy bear on the bed, and I went, “What’s that for?” He said, “I’ve just got this idea.” It just slowly comes to me to hold it. I’m very close with my children. I’m very tactile with my kids. In the rehearsal process, it was just a feeling. This is placing your family pictures in the bedroom so you could see them as you’re filming on Jamie’s bed, right? Yeah, he did, and in a beautiful way. That’s where Philip has his geniuses. He can normally do it through very subtle means, but in this particular case, it wasn’t subtle at all. He had these beautiful photographs of my children, and a “We love you, Dad, we’re so proud of you” message. For Stephen to see that and for that to hit Stephen, but then to stay in the context of Eddie — that was the key thing for me. We already had it a couple of takes back. This one — let’s just enjoy it. Let’s throw this one up there and give it to the great gods of creativity and say, “Thank you for this beautiful experience,” and let’s see what happens. Well, the drone only got brought into it by Wednesday of shooting. Toby Bentley from Netflix was lovely, wonderful. He said, “I think we need to see Eddie again, at the end. But I think he should be over by the flowers. See if you can work it out.” I wasn’t allowed to rehearse that day. I’m like, “Let me just get on, then. It’s my production.” They were like, “No. We have to clear it through the right channels.” We had to rehearse it with Phil’s brother. That was on a Wednesday, and then on Thursday, we go for the first time and it’s quite wobbly. We have to finish it with him by the school. On Friday morning, we got one up, but it was quite wobbly. We’ve got a really good take from the second take on Monday, but this new ending doesn’t exist. Every single performance had that kind of beautiful fluidity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We say our final goodbyes (for now) to “Paradise” and “Severance” and “Yellowjackets,” wipe away our tears and lock back into our screens. As excited as IndieWire is for returning shows (the finales of “You” and “Andor” and more “The Last of Us” and “Poker Face” come to mind), we’re also thrilled to look ahead at the new titles and faces headed to streaming between now and June. From “Side Quest” and “Dying for Sex” to later entries like “Étoile” and “The Four Seasons,” spring’s TV offerings have something for everyone (especially if you’ve been aching to see Alexander Skarsgård as a robot). Here are 14 new shows to (premiering before June 1) to check out this spring.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Severance” Season 2, Episode 10, “Cold Harbor.”] We hardly knew you and yet here we are, obsessing over every detail of the finale and trying to figure out what it might mean for the recently confirmed Season 3. Previously, creator Dan Erickson has discussed the possibility of a workers strike playing a part in the show’s future, but star Dichen Lachman thinks fans will have more pressing interpersonal concerns for their favorite characters. Speaking in a recent interview in the Los Angeles Times, Lachman believed that after the finale sees Mark’s innie choose Helly R. over his outie’s wife, many viewers might hope the writers find a way to maintain a dynamic between all three (or four or five or 29 depending on your perception of how severance works). “I think people will be pitching a throuple situation maybe, where they can all live together,” said Lachman. “I certainly think [fans are] going to be very upset, but only because they’re so torn. They’ve fallen so much in love for Helly R., who’s just captured people’s hearts, but are so aware of Adam’s character being torn between thinking that his wife is gone, but ultimately she isn’t. “That last moment where she’s seeing this heartbreaking thing happening across the hallway, my eyes were just drawn to Dichen. Lower went to explain that the moment is less about any romance between Helly and Gemma and more about “having empathy for an outie,” perhaps for the first time. “Severance” Season 2 is now available to stream in its entirety on Apple TV+.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After working together on the fictional, somewhat dystopian/somewhat familiar “Civil War,” filmmaker Alex Garland and Iraq War veteran Ray Mendoza have joined forces for an up-close-and-personal depiction of battle and the band of brothers who offer their lives to wage it. Their new film “Warfare” offers a real-time account of Mendoza’s platoon, a group of U.S. Navy Seals stationed in insurgent territory during 2006, and a conflict they were forced to engage in during their deployment. “Warfare” features an all-star cast of Hollywood’s rising talent including D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai as Mendoza, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis, Joseph Quinn, and Charles Melton. Rather than the traditional red carpet premiere, Mendoza and Garland unveiled the film last week at the Hollywood America Legion Theater in Los Angeles to a crowd of mostly veterans and members of the military community, with representation from partners including Veterans In Media And Entertainment, Navy Seal Foundation, Warrior Heritage Foundation, Team Rubicon, Team RWB, Writers Guild Foundation — Veterans Writing Program, Screen Actors Guild Veterans Committee, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Space Force. Addressing the crowd at the premiere, Garland said of how “Warfare” came to be, “It was based on memory. We had a handful of photographs that we got of the building, but aside from that, it was just interviews and it began with Ray and I sitting for a week and Ray just unloading everything he could remember. These guys opened up, never tried to make themselves look good, never tried to self-aggrandize, really dug it into themselves to try and say what really happened and what the truth was.” Mendoza has wanted to tell this story for a long time, but didn’t understand how to until he started work on films like “Act of Valor” and “Lone Survivor.” “When I first got out of the military, there was a lot going on with this event, and I didn’t understand how to describe it,” he said.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/andrew-cuomo-taxpayer-funded-revenge-campaign-1235301494/'>Andrew Cuomo’s Exorbitantly Expensive Taxpayer-Funded Revenge Campaign</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 14:00:00 <p>
The woman in question had dropped her legal effort months earlier, explaining that she was giving it up in the hope that Cuomo “can no longer use this lawsuit to harass me and my family.” Shortly after she dropped her suit, Cuomo threatened to sue her for defamation. She is one of many women who are still paying, quite literally, for their decisions to speak out about the toxic workplace Cuomo fostered as governor. An investigation by New York State Attorney General Letitia James found that Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women while he was governor; the U.S. Department of Justice, meanwhile, concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 13. He has never been criminally prosecuted in connection with any of the complaints.) Typically, a state’s attorney general would provide that defense, but because New York’s attorney general led the investigation into Cuomo’s alleged harassment, her office recused itself from defending Cuomo not just in the sexual harassment suits but in almost all matters, and instead Cuomo has been allowed to retain private lawyers, paid for with state resources. They have been forced to hire and pay for their own lawyers to answer a battery of demands for discovery, subpoenas and depositions from Cuomo’s state-funded attorneys. They include the request for the gynecologic records, which they say “serve[s] only to intimidate and humiliate… while driving up litigation costs,” and a litany of other discovery demands, including serving Verizon with a subpoena for all phone records of a witness not named in the litigation without any notice. (Andrew Cuomo, he notes, is currently suing his office to force them to pay for that litigation as well; the matter is currently before the New York State Supreme Court.) One woman who was swept up in Cuomo’s campaign tells Rolling Stone the experience has been “financially crippling for my family.” Another accuser, Lindsey Boylan, says she expects her bills to reach $2 million before the saga is over. Karen Hinton, who has spoken out about her experience with Cuomo when they worked at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the ‘90s, counts herself as lucky: She says her lawyer was able to convince the judge that her experience with Cuomo was so far in the past it wouldn’t be relevant to a lawsuit over his behavior as governor. (Cuomo’s team insists they ultimately opted not to take her deposition.) Even so, she says, her family “spent close to $45,000” on legal bills. Hinton, Boylan and others have both also been the target of online harassment by trolls who, The New York Times has reported, were being directed by Cuomo’s sister. (“KH and LB need to be frightened into shutting up right now — Enough is enough,” Madeline Cuomo reportedly wrote, referring to Hinton and Boylan, who were later attacked online.) “There are many reasons why he shouldn’t be mayor,” Hinton says. “But the one I’m talking about now is just this: He will retaliate and punish people. “The Attorney General bears direct responsibility for this entire mess,” Glavin said, citing what she deemed a costly and flawed investigation that, in her view, spawned a series of plaintiffs’ lawsuits. As a result, defense costs ballooned and non party witnesses were roped into the case,” Glavin said. Cuomo, meanwhile, has quickly emerged as the mayoral frontrunner in both polls and fundraising.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/careless-people-sarah-wynn-williams-facebook-gag-order.html'>The Gag Order That Birthed a Best-seller</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 11:00:19 <p>
Careless People author Sarah Wynn-Williams stands behind former Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Mark Zuckerberg in 2014. Instead, it may have helped them: The moment that an arbitrator (requested by Meta) slapped Wynn-Williams with a gag order, banning her from promoting her memoir, Careless People, he handed her the kind of publicity no book party could match. Suddenly, Careless People wasn’t just another tech whistleblower book; it was the book Mark Zuckerberg didn’t want you to read, and for many, that’s enough to recommend it. The book has taken on an air of persecution, even scarcity — as much as something freely available on Amazon (it’s now No. 3 on the Amazon best-seller list) can be called those things. The reason an arbitrator says Wynn-Williams, a former global policy director at the company, can’t promote it is because she violated the non-disparagement agreement she signed as part of her severance when Facebook fired her in 2017. The imprint announced the existence of Careless People just six days before the pub date, giving Wynn-Williams enough time to squeak in a few interviews teasing the book’s topics — including Facebook’s investment in censorship tools that it hoped would give it entrée to China — and sending Meta’s comms team, which issued statements denying the contents of a book no one had even read yet, into a tailspin. I asked Meta’s communications director, Andy Stone, why it would do this; doesn’t that just draw attention to the stuff she’s writing about, maybe even bolster it? Wynn-Williams recounts long, detailed in-person conversations with Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and her former manager Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta’s top policy official and chief liaison with the Trump administration. She reprints what appear to be excerpts from company emails and DMs. Wynn-Williams recalls the meetings that she says she persuaded Zuckerberg to attend with foreign dignitaries, determined to sway legislation that could make or break Facebook’s fortunes in other countries. “It’s made very clear to me that Mark has no interest in policy or politics … his disregard for politics is a point of pride,” she writes. Wynn-Williams describes being stunned by the ignorance of executives, as when Sandberg insists that Facebook could and should become a global broker for organ donation. But despite the cavalier attitude she says she witnessed toward other countries’ legal systems and Meta’s general disregard for employees’ personal lives, Wynn-Williams portrays herself as a true believer. (Meta’s communications team says that Wynn-Williams’s allegations were found to be “misleading and unfounded.”) But she doesn’t really turn on Zuckerberg until a Facebook employee in Brazil is arrested — and, she writes, the founder doesn’t seem to care. As she described it to NPR, her loss of faith in the company “wasn’t a lightning bolt. A few days after Careless People debuted, I called Megan Lynch, Flatiron’s publisher and executive VP. The book had by then entered Amazon’s top five and the mood at the imprint, which is owned by Macmillan, seemed to tilt unstably from excitement (everyone’s talking about our book), to concern (author’s in trouble for our book), to avoidance (we don’t want to be in trouble for our book). Lynch, who acquired and edited Careless People, stated and restated her support for Wynn-Williams, whom she calls “a hero.” I asked her how Wynn-Williams was doing. Lynch had never heard of Wynn-Williams, who is 45 and lives in London. “I mean, there have been Facebook-whistleblower books before, you know. “I wanted to publish it because I thought it was an amazing memoir that told the story of being an ambitious woman of my generation, and I connected with it in a strongly personal way.” This is maybe especially because the book is full of stories about confrontations with, among others, Sheryl Sandberg, who was then the company’s COO. “Women my age, we were all very earnest acolytes of Lean In when it was published,” Lynch said, adding that there’s been “profound disillusionment since then.” In Wynn-Williams’s description, Sandberg is a charismatic tyrant who demands too much work and too much intimacy from her underlings; at one point, Wynn-Williams writes that Sandberg and a 26-year-old protégé — who acknowledges to Wynn-Williams that she’s been chosen as “Sheryl’s little doll” — take turns lying in each other’s laps in the back of a car, stroking each other’s hair. Flatiron paid Wynn-Williams a “healthy” advance, Lynch said, confirming only that it was north of $500,000. Lynch says Flatiron kept the editorial and production processes on a need-to-know basis, using techniques it had developed while handling past Macmillan tell-alls such as James Comey’s book, Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, and Edward Snowden’s memoir. Since Lynch didn’t work on those, she drew on her experience editing something even leakier: a quick-turnaround 2023 oral history of BTS, translated from Korean, called Beyond the Story. “There was an incident with the BTS book where Taylor Swift fans found the listing for ‘untitled Flatiron book’ for a specific date that they thought was meaningful in Taylor Swift numerology and thought it was a Taylor Swift book and started ordering it. Then, obviously, we had to announce that it was not Taylor Swift,” she said. “Fortunately, there was a lot of overlap between Swifties and ARMY, so nobody got too upset.” Lesson learned: No shell listing for Careless People. “Drawing on my experience with BTS, I felt like the No. Although she wanted Careless People to come out before the election, Flatiron needed the whole fall for editing, legal review, and production, so they landed on March. One person who figures prominently in the book posted simply, “No one called me.” Meta, which Zuckerberg recently announced would stop employing fact-checkers, has made a huge deal out of that last bit: It alleges that the book wasn’t fact-checked. It’s an open secret that many publishers do not independently fact-check nonfiction books and largely rely on the writers to do so; often, a writer who wants another set of eyes on their work will need to hire a fact-checker themselves. Macmillan’s official line on Careless People is that although her account of her experiences is supported by “a trove of documentation,” they were not obligated to reach out to people in the book for comment. They also emphasize that this is standard for first-person memoirs. Or as Lynch puts it, “She’s not a journalist. Nonetheless, Lynch was adamant that the manuscript she received from Wynn-Williams was fully annotated and that the author had “saved all kinds of contemporaneous communications that are underpinning absolutely everything in the book — emails, memos, DMs, all kinds of things,” ranging across the entire period she was working there, from 2011 to 2017. While she did not personally look at all of the evidence herself, Lynch said, “I knew that if I had questions about something, what there was supporting evidence for and what there wasn’t.” And of course, Macmillan’s legal team “vetted” all of it. “This may be a question I punt to legal,” she said. “I think Meta’s problem is using this to not answer the questions themselves. Although the gag order suggests otherwise, Careless People is a careful book: Wynn-Williams, who was in her early 30s when she began working for Facebook, presents herself as a wide-eyed idealist, a small-town Everywoman who believes in the company’s ability to do good long past the point when its harms have been publicized. The self she depicts in Careless People is one drawn helplessly to what she sees as Facebook’s essential ideals of connectivity and openness. (She claims that for a time Facebook’s operations team had only one Burmese speaking employee to deal with this.) She says she sounded the alarm bells when the company decided Facebook should be used as a tool to win elections worldwide but that everyone ignored her. And although she was among those who worked to get Zuckerberg an audience with Xi Jinping, she reserves special disgust for Facebook’s dealings with Chinese officials. Lynch said that because Wynn-Williams’s tenure at Facebook ended eight years ago, “the book had to answer the question of ‘why now?’ even though I didn’t think that was a fair question. It’s easy to detect a kind of doublethink in sections where she expresses disgust at the company’s actions while doubling down on her belief in its essence. Wynn-Williams writes that Chinese officials were offended when Zuckerberg posted this photo because it only shows the back of Xi’s head. She has been vague about her activities since leaving Facebook in 2017. When Business Insider asked her how long it took to write the book, she said, “The process was off and on …There were moments when something would happen, there would be a headline about China, and I’d think, ‘It would be so different if people knew the truth.’” Lynch told me that she didn’t know when Wynn-Williams started writing the book and that I would have to ask Fletcher, the author’s agent. The book is a page-turner, and Wynn-Williams has never written one before, so I had to wonder: Did the author work with a ghostwriter? When I asked Lynch this, there was a pause on the line. Just … yeah, I just have to let her answer the question.” (A Macmillan publicist later told me that Wynn-Williams did not work with a ghostwriter; Fletcher did not respond to request for comment.) She hasn’t said for whom or in what capacity she did that, but public reports show that by 2021, she was living in London and working for the Minderoo Foundation, an Australian philanthropic venture founded by a mining-billionaire couple who pour money into environmental impact and tech-related research. Wynn-Williams held the title there of “CEO of Frontier Technology” and had the capacity to direct funding toward projects related to her interests — or so it seemed to Ariella Steinhorn, another refugee from the tech-policy world who has spent the past several years trying to get funding for an advocacy project related to whistleblowers, including many from the tech world, who are muzzled by NDAs. They met on Zoom in early 2023, and Steinhorn says Wynn-Williams seemed excited by her work; Wynn-Williams said she wanted to get Steinhorn’s whistleblower-focused project some funding through the foundation. It just seemed like she was on the same page,” Steinhorn says. “There were times where I would say something and she would nod and affirm it very intensely.” Shortly after they’d connected, though, Wynn-Williams stopped responding to emails; to Steinhorn, it was as if she had “disappeared.” But after hitting a series of roadblocks, she withdrew her proposal and the matter was dropped. In light of all this, Careless People starts to look more like a drastic escalation than an opening salvo: memoir as nuclear option. Vincent White, an employment lawyer in New York, says that based on the Meta employment contracts he’s seen, it’s likely she actually signed two NDAs — one when she was hired and another when she was fired. (Meta says Wynn-Williams was fired for “poor performance” and “toxic behavior”; she writes in the book that it happened after she reported Kaplan for sexual harassment and the company cleared him.) A lot of the time, companies won’t enforce NDAs against whistleblowers because it makes them look like villains. And the optics of Meta’s gag order on Wynn-Williams are terrible, White says. But “I’m guessing it’s not about her, right? No matter how bad we look, we’ll still get you for what you said.” He guesses this is doubly on the company’s hive mind since Meta just laid off 3,600 people, or 5 percent of its workforce, in February, citing poor performance — a couple dozen of whom White is now representing. After the arbitrator ordered Wynn-Williams to stop promoting her book, Stone, the Meta spokesperson, took to Threads with a link to the decision, writing, “This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published.” Commenters rushed in to block his victory lap: “i am now 500× more interested in this book!” “great sales pitch - thx big dog.” “Thanks for the heads up. Hadn’t heard about this one, but now excited to read it.” One poster, who said he was buying copies for his friends and family, summed it up: “Aren’t you fascist fools familiar with the Streisand Effect?”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

March Madness underdog McNeese spent $1.72 million on men’s basketball last season. McNeese hired Wade in 2023, a year after he was abruptly fired by LSU on the eve of the tournament amid an NCAA investigation. Prior to that game, ESPN reported that he’d agreed to become the next head coach at North Carolina State when the Cowboys’ run ends. The coach and school appear to have mutually understood that Wade was unlikely to be there for any length of time—athletic director Heath Schroyer told The Athletic that Wade promised him he’d stay for two years, which is exactly what the school ended up getting. To receive them in your inbox daily, sign up here via Club Sportico. Wade signed a new five-year contract in the middle of his first season at McNeese. The $1 million buyout—which would have fallen to $500,000 if Schroyer had left before Wade—is more than half of the school’s men’s basketball budget. “We had a two-year plan, [and] it’s been two years,” McNeese president Wade Rousse told The Athletic. “Now we have a full follow-up plan in place for what’s next. Each successive NCAA Tournament win will net him another $25,000. McNeese has grabbed a number of headlines this week—not just for its upset and Wade’s employment future, but also thanks to the team’s student manager, Amir Khan, who went viral on social media and is now signing NIL deals. “This is huge for our school,” he said following the Clemson win, before rattling off a series of statistics that weren’t immediately verifiable.

George Foreman, the Olympic gold medalist and two-time heavyweight champion who also became known for his knockout success as the salesman of his eponymous grill, died “peacefully” on March 21 while “surrounded by loved ones,” his family announced in a statement posted on his Instagram account. “A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.” No cause of death was shared, and Foreman’s family requested privacy as they “honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.” He won gold at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when he was 19, and went pro the following year. In 1974, he defeated Joe Frazier to become the world heavyweight champion. He returned to the ring a decade later amid financial difficulties, eventually becoming the oldest heavyweight champ in boxing history at age 45 in 1994. That same year, he launched his George Foreman Grill, which ultimately sold more than 100 million units worldwide, according to ESPN. He retired from boxing in 1997 with 76 wins and five losses, though he stayed connected to the sport as a longtime ringside analyst for HBO. In 2022, Foreman was accused of sexually abusing two women when they were minors in the 1970s, allegations that he denied. He made headlines later that year for appearing on The Masked Singer as the Venus Fly Trap, telling Entertainment Weekly after his elimination that he was now interested in recording music and doing more television. In his Instagram bio, Foreman promoted that movie, listed a couple of his boxing achievements, and described himself as the “Happiest of All Time!”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/hybe-feud-ador-min-hee-jin-newjeans.html'>Is NewJeans Disbanding, Leaving HYBE and ADOR, or What?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 01:40:00 <p>
But in late April, they became wrapped up in something of a family feud: Their parent company, HYBE, was publicly fighting with their label ADOR’s now ex-CEO, Min Hee-jin. On September 11, NewJeans themselves livestreamed an ultimatum for HYBE to reinstate Min as CEO within two weeks. On November 28, all five members of NewJeans said in an emergency press conference that they were terminating their contracts with ADOR over mistreatment allegations that the label has denied. On March 21, days before what was intended to be their first performance as the newly-rebranded NJZ, a court sided with ADOR and granted a preliminary injunction that will temporarily halt their independent activities. Depending on who you ask, this all began as either the story of an exec who got greedy and girlbossed too close to the sun, or of a brave creative who was being punished by a corporation for trying to protect her artistic vision. “Allowing unilateral terminations of exclusive contracts and independent activities without legal procedures could undermine investment in the entertainment industry,” ADOR argued in a January injunction application, per Yonhap News, “and destabilize the K-pop sector.” On March 21, the Seoul Central District Court sided with ADOR by granting the label’s request for a preliminary injunction that will temporarily prevent Hanni, Minji, Haerin, Danielle, and Hyein from taking on independent activities without ADOR’s approval. (It only applies until a ruling is reached in the yet-to-be-resolved main lawsuit over their contracts.) “With our status as NewJeans’ exclusive agency now legally affirmed, we are fully committed to supporting the artists going forward,” ADOR’s statement said. “Compared to everything we’ve been through so far, this is just another step in our journey,” the group added in a separate statement to Time. But that’s exactly why we believe change and growth are necessary. It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.” All five members of NewJeans previously said at a November 28 emergency press conference that they would terminate their contracts with the label at midnight on November 29. “Staying at the agency will only prolong our psychological pain and waste our time.” According to the BBC, the group raised concerns about “manipulation,” “deliberate miscommunication,” and “mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff.” Ultimately, they argued that ADOR didn’t make an effort to rectify its alleged breaches of contract when asked. “Therefore, we expect them to continue their scheduled activities ahead together with ADOR as they have until now.” The label optimistically noted that it will do its best to “support NewJeans in their activities and help them grow further as global artists.” Regardless, NewJeans seems to have already planned a future without ADOR. They also expressed a desire to work with ex-CEO Min Hee-jin again if possible. “Regardless of our name, just remember that NewJeans never dies,” she added, echoing previous remarks from the group’s November 16 acceptance speech at the 2024 Korea Grand Music Awards. NewJeans and ADOR had a seven-year contract that was set to expire in 2029. Per a Yonhap News report, the group sent a legal notice on November 13 declaring that they would terminate their contracts if the label didn’t rectify alleged breaches of contract within two weeks of receipt. All five members reportedly signed the document, known as a certification of content. (“You might have been surprised by the news, but don’t worry, we’re okay!” Danielle assured fans in a message on the fan app Phoning.) Their specific demands were not initially made public, but NewJeans previously issued a failed two-week ultimatum for Min to be reinstated as CEO in a September livestream. After NewJeans declared their departure on November 28, ADOR said in a statement via Soompi, “We regret that a press conference to announce the termination of exclusive contract was planned and conducted even before receiving a response to the certification of contents and without sufficient review.” NewJeans did acknowledge that ADOR sent a response shortly before the press conference, but clearly, the group did not find it satisfactory. Breaking a K-pop contract before time is up is usually associated with extremely expensive fees (The Korea Times estimated that the five members of NewJeans could collectively owe more than $213 million, while Chosun reported that an associate of Min Hee-jin’s suggested to her over KakaoTalk that the total could be as high as $442 million). On October 15, Hanni testified about workplace bullying in front of lawmakers as part of the Environment and Labor Committee’s examination into working conditions in the entertainment industry. The 20-year-old spoke at length about a manager allegedly telling another HYBE artist to ignore her, an incident she first brought up in September during the surprise NewJeans livestream. According to the BBC, Hanni noted that this wasn’t the only reason she was “honestly convinced that the company hated us.” She also alleged that higher-ups at HYBE hadn’t returned her greetings, HYBE employees had spoken negatively about NewJeans on Blind, and HYBE’s PR team had tried to get a journalist to downplay her group’s achievements. (HYBE denied the latter claim, arguing that it was trying to correct a factual error.) Kim said hearing how Hanni felt made her wonder if she could have done more, and affirmed that she would cooperate with an investigation into the incident. “Some fans apologized for making us go through this, but I’m grateful to Korea for allowing me to do what I love,” the Vietnamese Australian singer said. “The ones who should be apologizing are avoiding responsibility, and that frustrates me.” After Hanni first spoke about the alleged ignoring incident in NewJeans’s livestream, some fans were so concerned that they filed a workplace-harassment complaint over it with the Ministry of Employment and Labor. Hanni herself had touched on the distinction in her October testimony. “I understand that the contracts for artists and trainees may be different [from that of regular workers],” she said, per Korea JoongAng Daily, “but we are all human.” If enacted, it would also establish penalties for perpetrators and employers who don’t take appropriate action in cases of workplace bullying. Before she was nicknamed the “mother” of NewJeans, Min Hee-jin was a creative director at SM, where she worked on visuals for groups including Girls’ Generation, EXO, f(x), and SHINee. In 2022, she denied allegations that her past Instagram posts had glamorized pedophilia. In 2019, Min joined Big Hit Entertainment, BTS’s agency, as chief brand officer. In 2021, HYBE announced that Min was becoming the CEO of NewJeans’s eventual label, ADOR, short for All Doors One Room. This conflict first went public on April 22, when news broke that HYBE had begun an audit of ADOR over allegations that Min was planning a hostile takeover for independent management rights of the label (and thus NewJeans). ADOR released a statement on the same day, denying that it was trying to seize control. From the label’s point of view, this mess actually started because Min had brought up concerns that ILLIT, a five-member girl group under fellow HYBE label Belift Lab, had copied NewJeans in styling, choreography, music videos, and more. The next day, HYBE confirmed to Billboard that it was investigating top execs at ADOR and had sent an “official letter” asking Min to step down. The audit reportedly also revealed that Min had given instructions to prepare for a war of public opinion starting in May. During the emotional two-hour event on April 25, Min Hee-jin cried, cursed, suggested that people in her life have worried that she would try to kill herself because of this situation, and made a weird comment about NewJeans’s Minji being way prettier when she was younger. If you want a play-by-play, Korea JoongAng Daily has a lengthy summary, but Min’s main message was that she cares about protecting NewJeans and is not planning to take them away or break her contract with HYBE. Regarding HYBE’s alleged evidence, she argued that private conversations are being presented out of context. For example, HYBE claimed Min had considered involving foreign investors to facilitate a takeover plan. “Would that even be possible?” In another case, she said she asked a venture-capitalist friend about contract terms, which HYBE portrayed as her reaching out to an external consultant. Basically, she argued that no plans were ever put into action and that certain scenarios just reflect the way an employee complains about their job and boss. Min name-dropped several other K-pop groups in her claims that HYBE also slighted NewJeans and ADOR prior to ILLIT’s debut. Notably, she feels NewJeans was initially shunted aside to promote Le Sserafim (which Source Music has denied). At one point, Min pulled up screenshots of texts allegedly showing Bang Si-hyuk responding sarcastically to NewJeans’s global success. Her attorney, Timothy SK Lee, stepped in to note that the terms of Min’s contract were being renegotiated before this situation unfolded. “We asked [Min] not to make the internal report because it would worsen their relationships,” he said. On May 2, several outlets reported that, per an industry source, Min had previously asked HYBE for the right to terminate ADOR’s contract with NewJeans without board approval. (HYBE reportedly suspected this was a shady step to ultimately make ADOR an “empty shell” that she could buy back later when its value dropped.) Since then, there’s been plenty of other back-and-forth allegations about salaries, stocks, shamanism, financial negotiations, and the way the audit went down, but the gist is all the same: HYBE claims it has proof Min engaged in illegal or unsavory business behavior in a way that can’t be written off as a joke or casual conversation, while she alleges that the company is lying, taking things out of context, ﻿and coercing staff to try to dig up dirt. In August, Min’s attorneys also denied a former employee’s allegations that Min had berated her for filing a sexual-harassment complaint at the company and tried to cover up the case. In a September 11 livestream on a since-deleted YouTube channel, all five members of NewJeans called for Min Hee-jin to be reinstated as CEO by September 25. “She discusses even the smallest details with us and explains them in ways that we can understand clearly. They also suggested that while Min fought to protect them from alleged mistreatment at HYBE, the label’s current management wasn’t bringing the same energy. For example, Hanni said she and another group recently greeted each other in the HYBE building, only for their manager to later instruct the idols — while in front of Hanni — to “ignore her.” She claimed that ADOR’s new CEO made her feel like a liar when she recounted what happened. The members additionally pointed to a recent dispute over NewJeans content and the reveal of their trainee videos as reasons to wonder who really has their best interests at heart. Per The Korea Times, all members of NewJeans submitted court petitions in May siding with Min’s injunction, meaning they didn’t want her to leave. According to Min, the girls have been deeply affected by unfolding events. During her first press conference back in April, Min said NewJeans’s youngest member, Hyein, cried for 20 minutes about wanting to speak out on the group’s fan app, Phoning, and that other members called or asked to visit. After initiating the April 22 audit, HYBE asked ADOR to convene its board of directors, who have the power to call a shareholders’ meeting that could approve Min Hee-jin’s dismissal. The company had already filed an April 25 court request for permission to call an emergency shareholders’ meeting to replace board members and get Min removed that way. According to News 1, BTS producer Pdogg, Pledis CEO Han Sung-soo, Source Music CEO So Sung-jin, HYBE executive creator Son Sung-deuk, BTS and Le Sserafim creative director Kim Sung-hyun (a.k.a. Nu Kim), and TXT producer Slow Rabbit submitted petitions in support of HYBE. On May 30, local outlets reported that Min had won the injunction, with the court ruling that it did not have enough evidence to justify her dismissal. The court concluded that Min was finding ways to lessen HYBE’s control over ADOR, but that it’s difficult to say she followed through on any plans and actually committed a breach of trust. It looks like those new members may have helped finally sway the balance against Min. After months of efforts, she was replaced as CEO in an August 27 board meeting. The first part of this plan worked: ADOR did convene an October 17 shareholder meeting where Min’s contract as internal director was reupped for three years through 2027. “We acknowledge and appreciate the court’s wise ruling,” HYBE said in a statement to Vulture. “In light of this decision, HYBE is dedicated to normalizing ADOR’s operations, improving our multi-label capabilities, and supporting the activities of our artists.” Per The Korea Herald, after the October 29 court dismissal, Min affirmed in a same-day interview that she still planned to become CEO again and is “committed to taking this as far as it can go.” ADOR’s five-member board (three of whom are HYBE execs) made its stance clear the next day by voting against Min’s return as CEO. Wasn’t Min Hee-jin going to stay on as a producer? But around two hours after initial reports circulated, Min claimed in an August 27 statement to Korea JoongAng Daily that ADOR had decided that without discussing it with her. ADOR later said it had also offered her a five-year contract to produce for NewJeans on September 11, with discussions about specific terms to take place in the future. Her November 20 resignation statement similarly expressed outrage that the company offered her a producing contract “full of toxic clauses as if they were doing me a huge favor.” HYBE’s commitment to battling this out in the court of law (and the court of public opinion) apparently took a toll on ADOR’s former CEO. In a lengthy November 20 statement to Forbes, Min Hee-jin announced that she was resigning as an internal director at the ADOR label — and terminating a contentious shareholder agreement to leave parent company HYBE altogether. “However, as HYBE still refuses to acknowledge their wrongdoings and shows no signs of change, I have decided that further efforts would be a waste of time.” Later in her statement, she put it even more bluntly: “I didn’t want to conform to and settle in this twisted organization out of attachment to money.” She accused HYBE of using its subsidiary labels to file unreasonable lawsuits against her and “engage in unfair media play,” among other allegations. Still, that doesn’t mean we’ve seen the last of her. Min noted that she still plans to “hold HYBE legally accountable” for allegedly violating her shareholder agreement, among other “illegal activities.” (She has already followed through; per Yonhap News, she filed a new criminal complaint against two PR execs at the company within a week.) ADOR confirmed Min’s exit in a brief statement to Forbes on November 20. “It is regrettable that Min unilaterally notified us of her resignation,” the statement said. SPOTV News previously reported that HYBE nixed the contract at some point in July, which was a contentious month in this feud (Min underwent eight hours of police questioning on July 9 tied to a breach-of-trust complaint filed by HYBE; Yonhap News reported on July 24 that she had filed her own complaint with the police against five HYBE execs). Min ultimately said she was terminating the shareholder agreement in her resignation announcement, but affirmed that she still plans take legal action over HYBE’s alleged breach of this contract. Have plans for a NewJeans album, tour, or anything else been affected? Alongside their rebrand as NJZ, the group confirmed in a February 7 interview with CNBC that they they will debut a new song on the last day of ComplexCon Hong Kong, which runs from March 21 to March 23. The group previously told CNN that they’re focused on making and performing new music, which Haerin hinted will have a “very unique and different sound.” However, ADOR apparently hasn’t given up on NewJeans yet. When NewJeans announced on November 28 that they were leaving ADOR, Danielle said the group wants to drop new music “next year, as soon as possible, whenever.” But aside from an instrumental demo that Min Hee-jin shared in September, we haven’t really gotten substantial updates on their first album. Both Min and HYBE acknowledged in September that album production for the group was on hold. Naturally, they blamed each other: Min suggested in a September 25 JoongAng Ilbo interview that this was part of HYBE’s “obstruction” of business against NewJeans, while a September 26 statement from HYBE to ChosunBiz pointed to Min’s alleged negligence and delayed decision-making. When ADOR confirmed to Vulture on August 27 that Min had been replaced as CEO, the label noted that it aims “to provide strong support for the continued growth and success of NewJeans.” The girls didn’t seem too sure about that, though. “It was our dream to perform the music we wanted to make together with Min Hee-jin, and we were working hard for that dream,” Danielle said in NewJeans’s September 11 livestream in support of Min, per a Soompi translation. “Despite her being in the midst of all this current legal conflict, she’s expected to plan and creatively produce our future endeavors in just only two months, which I personally think makes no sense at all,” Hanni said in English, in apparent reference to reports that ADOR had asked Min to sign a two-month contract to continue producing for the group after her removal as CEO. Music-video director Shin Woo-seok alleged in early September that ADOR’s new management had told him to remove already released NewJeans footage and not upload planned content. Shin later restored affected content and announced plans to take legal action against the label. But it seemed inevitable that the quintet would face scrutiny over how the choreography, visuals, and sound compared to NewJeans when they returned on October 21 with their second mini-album, I’ll Like You. Fellow member Wonhee added that Bang Si-hyuk had personally offered advice and input for this comeback. ILLIT previously wrapped their music-show stage promotions for “Magnetic” and “Lucky Girl Syndrome” in late April, meaning they were due for a break shortly after the drama began. Still, fans remained worried about the emotional toll of this situation, especially after a member appeared to be reading and deleting negative comments during a livestream. On May 22, Belift announced that it had filed a criminal complaint over the plagiarism allegations, accusing Min of interference with business and defamation. According to a Soompi translation, Belift later said in a June 10 statement that it was also filing a civil lawsuit to hold Min “accountable” for damages to Belift artists and members, “as well as participating creators who have been burdened and silenced by the stigma of plagiarism.” That same day, Belift released a 27-minute YouTube video denying the plagiarism allegations. Yonhap News reported on November 22 that Min plans to sue Belift right back, with her lawyer stating that she will pursue both a civil and criminal case. This news came a day after ILLIT won Best New Female Artist at the 2024 MAMA Awards in Los Angeles on November 21. Military service couldn’t keep this conflict from reaching the group. Min Hee-jin claimed in an October 29 interview that V — whom she collaborated with on his debut solo album, Layover — sometimes called her from the military to check if she was doing okay amid ongoing events. She specifically claimed that he sent her a birthday message at dawn. But phone use is limited to specific times in the military, so some people questioned whether rules were bent for V because he’s famous. On November 21, the BTS member’s unit denied giving him any special treatment, noting that he only used his device during allowed afternoon periods. Naturally, this vague allegation did not sit well with the BTS Army. Minutes before the conference, HYBE also claimed it had obtained transcripts of Min consulting a shaman she believed was possessed by her dead sister about company business decisions, including who to hire and which trainees to accept. But the part that went viral was a conversation allegedly about BTS’s military service. “I think it would be better for me if BTS went, what do you think?” Min said, per a Korea JoongAng Daily translation, to which the shaman responded, “I’m trying to send them.” Min claimed that the shaman is simply a friend of hers. Reports from Rolling Stone and Forbes include allegations that the group is a pseudo-religious cult. Much of the speculation about HYBE’s ties is based on “clues” perceived to be planted in song lyrics and music videos. Special attention has been paid to NewJeans’s “OMG” video, because Min showed a screenshot during her press conference claiming that she was threatened by HYBE execs over it. Multiple viral posts pointed out that six of the seven BTS members graduated from Global Cyber University, which was established by Dahn World founder Ilchi Lee (real name Lee Seung-heon). That same day, HYBE’s Big Hit label announced that it has taken legal action over posts spreading the “completely false” allegation that BTS is affiliated with Dahn World “or any religious cults.” The company said it had filed a criminal complaint over the cult claims, as well as resurfaced allegations of chart manipulation (which Big Hit also denied). On July 15, Korea JoongAng Daily reported that Source Music had recently sued Min for defamation and disruption of business over alleged damages to Le Sserafim. Per Soompi, ADOR responded by not only denying that Min had stolen the NewJeans members, but also further accusing Source Music of copying a launch strategy Min had presented to HYBE chairman Bang Si-hyuk. Source Music firmly denied this and said it would pursue further legal action against Min on top of its existing lawsuit. On July 23, Dispatch published a lengthy report alleging that Min Hee-jin had consulted with a shaman and decided to delay NewJeans’s debut at Source Music so that she could take the trainees to her own label. At this point, the better question might be what groups haven’t been. When questioned, Belift CEO and HYBE COO Kim Tae-ho claimed that this was a collection of external opinions. “In particular, we are deeply sorry and deeply distressed that innocent artists and members of the company have been misunderstood and harmed by the reverse viral allegations, which are completely untrue.” Sports Seoul previously reported that Min Hee-jin had taken issue with these weekly reports several times, emailing a complaint to HYBE management in April. In an October 29 interview, Min confirmed that she had sent a critique calling for objective evaluations with facts and numbers. Min denied this in her April press conference and went on to name-drop a lot of other groups while explaining the ways she felt ADOR and NewJeans have been wronged. She denied speculation that she had to do with the disbandment of Lil Uzi Vert’s ult K-pop group, GFRIEND, which was under the HYBE-acquired Source Music. Min and HYBE have offered very different explanations for this decision. Min suggested that Bang Si-hyuk was insecure about Le Sserafim’s competitive prospects, given the success of IVE (which, like Le Sserafim, includes two former IZ*ONE members). For its part, HYBE brought up a few groups while hitting back against claims that it did not promote NewJeans enough. According to HYBE, its comms team distributed 273 press releases for NewJeans in 2023. In comparison, 365 were released for Pledis, which has four teams including boy band Seventeen.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

An upstate New York high school girls’ basketball coach has been canned after he yanked a player’s hair following their team’s loss on Friday -- an appalling moment was caught on camera.

As you can see, Northville High School player Hailey Monroe was already in tears after the game, but to add insult to injury 81-year-old coach Jim Zullo appeared to viciously yanked her back by her ponytail.

In the upsetting moment -- Monroe tried to pull away as another player appeared to tell Zullo to stop, but the coach was seen berating her, wagging his finger in her face and screaming at her.

WRGB reports that Monroe, the high school senior and all-time leading scorer, had fouled out of the game before the shocking incident unfolded.

Zullo tried to defend himself ... telling NEWS10 ABC that Monroe allegedly swore at him after he told her to shake hands with the other team, and that’s when things went south.

The Northville Central School District released a statement saying they expect the highest standards of professionalism and sportsmanship from their coaches, and Zullo’s behavior was totally unacceptable.

They made it clear he’s done not just at the school but in the whole district, and they’ll be offering support to the players and their families affected by the incident.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Justin Bieber is all about self-reflection these days, and he’s keeping the vibe going with a new post about how he’s working on his anger issues.

Along with the message, Justin shared a reflective close-up pic of himself with his hood down, almost like a visual nod to his state of mind.

He also shared a smiling throwback pic of himself as a child, along with one of his son Jack chilling on a blanket, watching a movie on a projector -- so it seemed like the point of him sorting through his anger was for his son, who he shares with wife Hailey Bieber.

Christine Quinn is bringing the heat with her new man, Thomas McGarrity, making their debut in Cabo, and proving he's quite the upgrade from her estranged hubby Christian Dumontet.

The former "Selling Sunset" star was looking fierce, flaunting her beach bod in a zebra print bikini while sharing a kiss with her 51-year-old shirtless new boo, who happens to be a Texas business executive.

The duo were all about that chill vibe, lounging on sunbeds and soaking up the Mexican heat, with Christine making a swimwear change into a cut-out black number later.

It definitely looked like CQ was taking it easy, especially after a tough year dealing with her fallout from husband Christian.

TMZ broke the story -- Christian filed for divorce last April after weeks of drama, including his arrest for assault with a deadly weapon and dueling requests for temporary restraining orders.

Earlier this month, Christine revealed even more chilling details, claiming Christian would go to extreme lengths to mess with her, like lying under her car to prevent her from leaving.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"Impractical Jokers" alum Joe Gatto has denied a TikToker's viral allegation that he sexually assaulted her when she was 19 in 2023. He adds, "Working on myself is an ongoing process, and I am now going to take some time away from the public eye to focus my energies where I need to." Joe notably left the popular truTV series in January 2022 over "some issues" in his personal life ... and simultaneously announced his separation from his wife of nearly a decade, Bessy Gatto. TikTok user joozyb accused Joe of sexually assaulting her just after he got back together with Bessy in a series of TikTok videos she began sharing Thursday. She claims their first interaction occurred when she and her mother saw him at a brunch and asked for a photo. After that, she says she DMd him in hopes of snagging free tickets to his Milwaukee show at the Pabst Theater. Joe indeed had a show at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee on Sept. 8, 2023, according to a website for shows in the area. Joozyb says he granted her two tickets with meet-and-greet access. After the meet-and-greet, she alleges she and the reality star spoke again via Instagram direct messages ... and that's when Joe gave her directions to his hotel room. The TikToker admits to being drunk and agreeing to meet him, which is when the alleged assault allegedly occurred.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Remember when Cynthia Erivo threw some "Wicked" shade at her fellow auditionees? Well, that side-eye might’ve been aimed at Amanda Seyfried!

Play video content Happy Sad Confused

Amanda appears to have indirectly spilled the tea on the "Happy Sad Confused" podcast this week -- we already knew she auditioned for the role of Glinda, but here’s the kicker -- she says she actually sang alongside Cynthia in auditions before Ariana Grande landed the role.

Cool moment for Amanda, sure -- but let’s rewind to November when Cynthia told the New York Times that Ariana landing the role was no shocker, adding, "Thank goodness, because it was not the two ladies that I was auditioning with."

Cynthia never named the two actresses she auditioned with, but it sounds like Amanda might've been one of them ... based on Amanda's new comments about the audition process.

That said, it seems Amanda either missed the shade or hasn’t caught on yet -- because she’s still reminiscing about the experience with nothing but fond memories!</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Prison inmate Charles Miles gave notorious wife-killer Scott Peterson a beating behind bars earlier this month ... and now he's sharing his side of the story. In an exclusive preview clip obtained by TMZ, Charles tells Court TV via phone call he went into "attack mode" after Scott rammed into him during a game of pickleball. He says Scott "aggressively" sprinted at him with his paddle in hand --allegedly to chase the ball -- and made no effort to avoid him. This pissed Charles off, who says he "beat him down to the ground" and "beat the hell out of him." Charles says there was a bit of a struggle, but once he overpowered Scott, he climbed on him and started pounding him. Despite the fight ... it seems like Charles and Scott are A-Okay with one another. Believe it or not ... Charles even says he and Scott talked it out for about two hours together directly after the altercation. That is, from isolated cells a few spots down for each other. Charles claims he even apologized -- saying a "primal urge" was triggered when he saw Scott coming at him full speed ... adding that his anger was intensified over him being a convicted woman and baby killer. He says Scott tried convincing him of his innocence ... which he has maintained ever since his wife, Laci, was found headless in the San Francisco Bay more than 20 years ago.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Looks like you can’t stay King of the Pirates forever. After being at the helm of the hit Netflix live adaptation of the popular manga and anime series “One Piece,” executive producer and co-showrunner Matt Owens announced in an Instagram post on Friday, March 21, that he would be leaving the series in order to address personal issues he’s currently facing. It’s also been A LOT,” Owens wrote in his post. “So I’m stepping off the Going Merry to take a break and focus on myself and my mental health.” The first season dropped in August of 2023, but Season 2 was delayed as a result of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and didn’t complete production until December 2024. While there is no official announcement, the WGA do have “One Piece” listed as being in production for Season 3, suggesting an oncoming renewal, though it’s unclear whether Owens leaving the show will upend these plans. After thanking many involved in making the show happen, Owens said in his statement, “For now I’m gonna take a breath, do some therapy, try and rank up in ‘Marvel Rivals,’ and come back refreshed for the new adventures that await.” “I knew there would be a lot of expectations, especially from the fans who are very protective and rightfully so,” Maeda said. I just wanted to faithfully keep all the fun and goofy moments while never giving emotion short shrift. “One Piece” follows Monkey D. Luffy as he gathers a crew to seek out the One Piece treasure that will allow him to become King of the Pirates.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/22/commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-shut-up-if-no-social-security-check/'>Commerce Sect'y Says Just Shut Up if You Don't Get Social Security Check</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tmz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 00:00:00 <p>
This is almost too outrageous to process ... Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said proudly and loudly ... if his 94-year-old mother-in-law didn't get her monthly Social Security check, she would just wait for it to come the next month, and anyone who would dare complain they didn't get their check is a criminal. Lutnick's mother-in-law shouldn't worry ... after all, her son-in-law is worth north of $800 million. Lutnick says anyone who loudly complains they didn't get their check is a fraudster. In fact, he likes the idea of actually withholding checks because he thinks it will root out those criminals. Of course, some people who don't get their checks will go without food, or medication, and may well die. But them's the breaks, according to Lutnick. Thing is ... Lutnick is actually intimidating people who don't get their Social Security checks -- intimidating them into silence, for fear if they speak up they'll be arrested for fraud. So if you're starving or just plain dying, well, don't bitch to someone who's supposed to care. BTW ... as if it can't get worse, the Trump administration is closing down Social Security offices all over the country, and they want to make it harder for people with grievances to get their checks. There's a plan to make recipients appear in person at the remaining Social Security offices to correct problems -- the phone will no longer be an option.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
