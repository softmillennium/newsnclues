Sarah Wynn-Williams can’t do interviews. She can’t post on social media or go on tour or give a talk. Her family can’t speak on her behalf, and her friends are afraid to. None of this has affected the sales of her first book, a memoir of the six years she spent working for Facebook. Instead, it may have helped them: The moment that an arbitrator (requested by Meta) slapped Wynn-Williams with a gag order, banning her from promoting her memoir, Careless People, he handed her the kind of publicity no book party could match. Suddenly, Careless People wasn’t just another tech whistleblower book; it was the book Mark Zuckerberg didn’t want you to read, and for many, that’s enough to recommend it. In the week following its release on March 11, Careless People hit the top of the Times best-seller list and sold 60,000 copies. It’s selling out in New York bookstores and prominently displayed in the ones that still have it. The book has taken on an air of persecution, even scarcity — as much as something freely available on Amazon (it’s now No. 3 on the Amazon best-seller list) can be called those things. When I brought a copy up to the counter at a Brooklyn Barnes & Noble, the salesperson waggled his eyebrows. “Ooo, yeah, everyone’s reading this one,” he said. “I think they’re trying to get it taken off shelves, so it’s like, Get it while you can.”

The book is not being taken off shelves, and Meta has stopped short of saying it thinks it should be. The reason an arbitrator says Wynn-Williams, a former global policy director at the company, can’t promote it is because she violated the non-disparagement agreement she signed as part of her severance when Facebook fired her in 2017. Her publisher, Flatiron, knew the subject matter was risky. The imprint announced the existence of Careless People just six days before the pub date, giving Wynn-Williams enough time to squeak in a few interviews teasing the book’s topics — including Facebook’s investment in censorship tools that it hoped would give it entrée to China — and sending Meta’s comms team, which issued statements denying the contents of a book no one had even read yet, into a tailspin. One document Meta put out to try to throw the public off the scent, titled “CARELESS REPRINT,” was simply a list of all the subjects it thought would be in the book, annotated by previously published damning stories about said subjects. I asked Meta’s communications director, Andy Stone, why it would do this; doesn’t that just draw attention to the stuff she’s writing about, maybe even bolster it? Stone said he didn’t think so. The goal was just “just to point out that much of this had been reported previously.”

The book turned out to contain much more. Wynn-Williams recounts long, detailed in-person conversations with Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and her former manager Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta’s top policy official and chief liaison with the Trump administration. She reprints what appear to be excerpts from company emails and DMs. Since her work was focused on Facebook’s global policy, she spends much of the book zigzagging across the globe from Indonesia to Colombia, recounting private meetings, karaoke sessions, and games of Settlers of Catan — which she claims everyone let Zuck win — from the perspective of the most nervous person on the private jet. Wynn-Williams recalls the meetings that she says she persuaded Zuckerberg to attend with foreign dignitaries, determined to sway legislation that could make or break Facebook’s fortunes in other countries. “It’s made very clear to me that Mark has no interest in policy or politics … his disregard for politics is a point of pride,” she writes. Her book is an account of him learning to care — in part, she implies, because of her influence.

Wynn-Williams describes being stunned by the ignorance of executives, as when Sandberg insists that Facebook could and should become a global broker for organ donation. (That idea gets scrapped.) But despite the cavalier attitude she says she witnessed toward other countries’ legal systems and Meta’s general disregard for employees’ personal lives, Wynn-Williams portrays herself as a true believer. She admits to being dazzled by Sandberg’s star power and touched when she sees Zuckerberg’s softer side. Her relationship with Kaplan is contentious; she alleges that Kaplan demanded she work through her maternity leave, barraged her with sexually charged comments on a regular basis, and grinded against her during a company party. (Meta’s communications team says that Wynn-Williams’s allegations were found to be “misleading and unfounded.”) But she doesn’t really turn on Zuckerberg until a Facebook employee in Brazil is arrested — and, she writes, the founder doesn’t seem to care. As she described it to NPR, her loss of faith in the company “wasn’t a lightning bolt. It was sort of a steady drip, drip, drip.”

A few days after Careless People debuted, I called Megan Lynch, Flatiron’s publisher and executive VP. The book had by then entered Amazon’s top five and the mood at the imprint, which is owned by Macmillan, seemed to tilt unstably from excitement (everyone’s talking about our book), to concern (author’s in trouble for our book), to avoidance (we don’t want to be in trouble for our book). Lynch, who acquired and edited Careless People, stated and restated her support for Wynn-Williams, whom she calls “a hero.” I asked her how Wynn-Williams was doing. “Nervous, but soldiering on,” Lynch says. “She sees the bigger picture in all of this, and it was very important to her to share her truth. Gratitude about having done that outweighs the extreme difficulty of the personal situation that she is in.” However, she added, “it’s frustrating to her that the story of Meta trying to silence her is distracting people from the things that are on the page, and the things that are on the page are very, very serious things that she hopes everybody pays attention to.” But how are sales? Lynch’s voice brightened: “Obviously, it’s been fun to see the Amazon pop!”

Lynch and her team first met Wynn-Williams last May in the midtown offices of the author’s agent, Christy Fletcher of UTA. Lynch had never heard of Wynn-Williams, who is 45 and lives in London. The author and agent handed off a nearly complete manuscript that persuaded Lynch to put in a bid. “I mean, there have been Facebook-whistleblower books before, you know. That wasn’t what drew me to this book,” Lynch told me. “I wanted to publish it because I thought it was an amazing memoir that told the story of being an ambitious woman of my generation, and I connected with it in a strongly personal way.” This is maybe especially because the book is full of stories about confrontations with, among others, Sheryl Sandberg, who was then the company’s COO. “Women my age, we were all very earnest acolytes of Lean In when it was published,” Lynch said, adding that there’s been “profound disillusionment since then.” In Wynn-Williams’s description, Sandberg is a charismatic tyrant who demands too much work and too much intimacy from her underlings; at one point, Wynn-Williams writes that Sandberg and a 26-year-old protégé — who acknowledges to Wynn-Williams that she’s been chosen as “Sheryl’s little doll” — take turns lying in each other’s laps in the back of a car, stroking each other’s hair. During a long private-jet ride back from Davos, Sandberg tries to summon Wynn-Williams to share the jet’s one bed with her. “Sarah, come to bed,” she orders her loudly while their co-workers turn their gazes to the floor. (The author, at this point massively pregnant and distraught to be traveling at all, refuses.)

Flatiron paid Wynn-Williams a “healthy” advance, Lynch said, confirming only that it was north of $500,000. Then began the problem of how to keep the book a secret. This was exacerbated by the fact that Wynn-Williams had just filed a whistleblower complaint with the SEC in April 2024, alleging that Meta misled investors about the extent of its operations in China and had planned to hire a “chief editor” who could remove content at the behest of the CCP. Lynch says Flatiron kept the editorial and production processes on a need-to-know basis, using techniques it had developed while handling past Macmillan tell-alls such as James Comey’s book, Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, and Edward Snowden’s memoir. Since Lynch didn’t work on those, she drew on her experience editing something even leakier: a quick-turnaround 2023 oral history of BTS, translated from Korean, called Beyond the Story. That one taught her what can happen when a publisher puts something in its catalogue called a “shell listing,” whereby a spot is held for a forthcoming book that isn’t described beyond “untitled music memoir” or the like. “There was an incident with the BTS book where Taylor Swift fans found the listing for ‘untitled Flatiron book’ for a specific date that they thought was meaningful in Taylor Swift numerology and thought it was a Taylor Swift book and started ordering it. Then, obviously, we had to announce that it was not Taylor Swift,” she said. “Fortunately, there was a lot of overlap between Swifties and ARMY, so nobody got too upset.” Lesson learned: No shell listing for Careless People.

Lynch had to move fast. “Drawing on my experience with BTS, I felt like the No. 1 thing we could do to keep the project under wraps was not to have to keep it under wraps for very long,” she said. Although she wanted Careless People to come out before the election, Flatiron needed the whole fall for editing, legal review, and production, so they landed on March. The book’s accounts of in-person conversations rely heavily on Wynn-Williams’s memory of long-ago interactions with people who were not informed of the book before publication. While some of Wynn-Williams’s former colleagues have posted in support of the book, others have disputed her account. One person who figures prominently in the book posted simply, “No one called me.” Meta, which Zuckerberg recently announced would stop employing fact-checkers, has made a huge deal out of that last bit: It alleges that the book wasn’t fact-checked. If this is true, it’s not an aberration. It’s an open secret that many publishers do not independently fact-check nonfiction books and largely rely on the writers to do so; often, a writer who wants another set of eyes on their work will need to hire a fact-checker themselves. Macmillan’s official line on Careless People is that although her account of her experiences is supported by “a trove of documentation,” they were not obligated to reach out to people in the book for comment. They also emphasize that this is standard for first-person memoirs. Or as Lynch puts it, “She’s not a journalist. She’s not a historian. It’s her personal recollections. It’s not a book of news.”

Nonetheless, Lynch was adamant that the manuscript she received from Wynn-Williams was fully annotated and that the author had “saved all kinds of contemporaneous communications that are underpinning absolutely everything in the book — emails, memos, DMs, all kinds of things,” ranging across the entire period she was working there, from 2011 to 2017. While she did not personally look at all of the evidence herself, Lynch said, “I knew that if I had questions about something, what there was supporting evidence for and what there wasn’t.” And of course, Macmillan’s legal team “vetted” all of it. I asked Lynch what she thought fact-checking standards should be for a memoir, as opposed to for more straightforward reportage. “This may be a question I punt to legal,” she said. Was there a fact-checking process outside of the lawyers’ vetting that the author had reason to say what she said — someone actually going through those footnotes one by one and comparing them against the text? Again, she said, “that’s a question for the lawyers.” (The lawyers, in the end, couldn’t speak to me.) When Wynn-Williams was still able to do interviews, a reporter for Business Insider also asked her whether the book was fact-checked. “I think Meta’s problem is using this to not answer the questions themselves. What I would love is for us not to fall into the distraction,” Wynn-Williams said, dodging the question in turn.

Although the gag order suggests otherwise, Careless People is a careful book: Wynn-Williams, who was in her early 30s when she began working for Facebook, presents herself as a wide-eyed idealist, a small-town Everywoman who believes in the company’s ability to do good long past the point when its harms have been publicized. The self she depicts in Careless People is one drawn helplessly to what she sees as Facebook’s essential ideals of connectivity and openness. Facebook is the “revolution” that she wants to be a part of: “We need to get this right, for the hundreds of millions who are sure to be using these platforms every day, for years to come.” She acted as a Facebook ambassador, a friendly, networky presence who was unable to make big decisions but responsible for selling them on the global stage. The book reiterates again and again that she did not stray to the dark side. She writes that she watched in horror as anti-Muslim hate speech took over Facebook feeds in Myanmar, unchecked by content moderators. (She claims that for a time Facebook’s operations team had only one Burmese speaking employee to deal with this.) She says she sounded the alarm bells when the company decided Facebook should be used as a tool to win elections worldwide but that everyone ignored her. And although she was among those who worked to get Zuckerberg an audience with Xi Jinping, she reserves special disgust for Facebook’s dealings with Chinese officials.

Lynch said that because Wynn-Williams’s tenure at Facebook ended eight years ago, “the book had to answer the question of ‘why now?’ even though I didn’t think that was a fair question. There are things that she ended up adding about the urgency of understanding some of what happened between Facebook and China because of the coming AI weapons race.” The “why now?” is mitigated by the fact that Meta continues to feature so prominently in the news — especially since Zuckerberg’s public cozying up to the Trump administration — but there is friction in the book between what Wynn-Williams appears to be feeling in the moment and her retrospective analysis of it. It’s easy to detect a kind of doublethink in sections where she expresses disgust at the company’s actions while doubling down on her belief in its essence. She often seems to be insisting that what Facebook is doing is not really what Facebook is about. After detailing Zuckerberg’s obsession with getting Facebook into China and how appalled she was when she realized it was actively building censorship tools to accomplish this, she writes, “The mission of the company — making the world more open and connected — is the exact opposite of what the Chinese Communist Party wants, particularly under President Xi Jinping.” This doesn’t quite land, as it’s clear by this point in the book that the CCP and Facebook are not opposites. They share a major interest: collecting civilian data.

Wynn-Williams was not forthcoming even during the interviews she was able to do before the gag order. She is, after all, a former lawyer, diplomat, and tech exec; she knows how to stay on message. She has been vague about her activities since leaving Facebook in 2017. When Business Insider asked her how long it took to write the book, she said, “The process was off and on …There were moments when something would happen, there would be a headline about China, and I’d think, ‘It would be so different if people knew the truth.’” Lynch told me that she didn’t know when Wynn-Williams started writing the book and that I would have to ask Fletcher, the author’s agent. The book is a page-turner, and Wynn-Williams has never written one before, so I had to wonder: Did the author work with a ghostwriter? When I asked Lynch this, there was a pause on the line. “Um,” said Lynch. “I am gonna have to leave that question to Christy because I wasn’t involved with anyone but Sarah editorially. Just … yeah, I just have to let her answer the question.” (A Macmillan publicist later told me that Wynn-Williams did not work with a ghostwriter; Fletcher did not respond to request for comment.)

Wynn-Williams has shared little about her post-Facebook career. One story described her only as a “tech policy consultant,” and both in the book and in other interviews she has mentioned “working on” the dialogue between the U.S. and China on the use of AI in weapons. She hasn’t said for whom or in what capacity she did that, but public reports show that by 2021, she was living in London and working for the Minderoo Foundation, an Australian philanthropic venture founded by a mining-billionaire couple who pour money into environmental impact and tech-related research. Wynn-Williams held the title there of “CEO of Frontier Technology” and had the capacity to direct funding toward projects related to her interests — or so it seemed to Ariella Steinhorn, another refugee from the tech-policy world who has spent the past several years trying to get funding for an advocacy project related to whistleblowers, including many from the tech world, who are muzzled by NDAs. They met on Zoom in early 2023, and Steinhorn says Wynn-Williams seemed excited by her work; Wynn-Williams said she wanted to get Steinhorn’s whistleblower-focused project some funding through the foundation. “I don’t recall her talking about the experiences. It just seemed like she was on the same page,” Steinhorn says. “There were times where I would say something and she would nod and affirm it very intensely.” Shortly after they’d connected, though, Wynn-Williams stopped responding to emails; to Steinhorn, it was as if she had “disappeared.”

Around the same time, documents made public by the SEC show that Wynn-Williams submitted a proposal to Meta that she hoped would push the company to disclose more about the inner workings of its past and present relationship with China at an annual shareholder meeting. But after hitting a series of roadblocks, she withdrew her proposal and the matter was dropped. Wynn-Williams alludes briefly to this time in the epilogue to her book, writing that she and another former Facebook employee turned tech whistleblower, Ifeoma Ozoma, started working with activist-shareholder groups to try to force companies such as Apple and Amazon to be more transparent and to stop forcing employees to sign NDAs that would prevent them from reporting abuse. They don’t appear to have been successful either.

In light of all this, Careless People starts to look more like a drastic escalation than an opening salvo: memoir as nuclear option. Vincent White, an employment lawyer in New York, says that based on the Meta employment contracts he’s seen, it’s likely she actually signed two NDAs — one when she was hired and another when she was fired. (Meta says Wynn-Williams was fired for “poor performance” and “toxic behavior”; she writes in the book that it happened after she reported Kaplan for sexual harassment and the company cleared him.) A lot of the time, companies won’t enforce NDAs against whistleblowers because it makes them look like villains. And the optics of Meta’s gag order on Wynn-Williams are terrible, White says. But “I’m guessing it’s not about her, right? Whatever she wrote, it’s already out there. You can’t put it back in,” he says. “This is to let the next person know: We are actually going to enforce those agreements. No matter how bad we look, we’ll still get you for what you said.” He guesses this is doubly on the company’s hive mind since Meta just laid off 3,600 people, or 5 percent of its workforce, in February, citing poor performance — a couple dozen of whom White is now representing.

“She’s doing a noble, brave thing, but I worry that she’s destroying herself,” says White. “First off, she may never work again. Financially, the damages from this could be astronomical. And in terms of her reputation, she’s going to always be the one who outed Meta, no matter what else she achieves. All of that will be a footnote to this.” That might not be a bad thing. After the arbitrator ordered Wynn-Williams to stop promoting her book, Stone, the Meta spokesperson, took to Threads with a link to the decision, writing, “This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published.” Commenters rushed in to block his victory lap: “i am now 500× more interested in this book!” “great sales pitch - thx big dog.” “Thanks for the heads up. Hadn’t heard about this one, but now excited to read it.” One poster, who said he was buying copies for his friends and family, summed it up: “Aren’t you fascist fools familiar with the Streisand Effect?”",vulture

Jennifer Coolidge is very much missed on this season of The White Lotus, but it doesn’t mean her presence isn’t haunting the luxury resort like a fabulous ghost. You can’t stop thinking about how it must be nice to be dead as she’s no longer with her bum ex-husband, Greg, who has made his way back into another White Lotus resort in Thailand with a new woman on his arm. She tells Deadline while she isn’t getting insider information on what’s going to happen this season, she does hope that Tanya gets to have the last laugh. “I mean, I’m praying there’s some justice for Tanya. You know, Greg was a creep. He needs to go down,” she explains. “But I just think it continues to be really interesting, really dark and then we all have to talk about it afterwards. I think it’s a really good sign.”

If you need a refresher: Greg schemed his way into marrying Tanya, with hopes of snagging her riches. However, she made him sign a prenup with eventually evolved into a plotted assassination on a boat, having her screaming the iconic line: “These gays, they’re trying to murder me!” It’s not totally confirmed that it was all plotted by Greg, but he has to be back in the show for a reason, right?

The biggest mystery for Cordelia Cupp has been solved: how did The Residence, a show filled with Kylie Minogue references, get the Princess of Pop to play along? Shonda Rhimes said the team ” didn’t know if it was gonna happen.” The answer is a lot more simple: It’s as easy as just talking to Minogue. In an interview with Variety, showrunner Paul William Davies explained that they simply approached the pop star with the project, and she “really responded” to the show. “For being Kylie, she’s a very down-to-earth, warm, accessible person who really thought it would be fun,” Davies said. “I was like, ‘Anything you’re able to do or willing to do, I’ll write for you.’ So I wrote more because she was game.” Minogue plays herself, a dinner guest who becomes a performer after Harry Styles cancels. Then, she transforms into a suspect of a murder after White House chief usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead at the party.

Most haircuts are either long overdue or a cry for help, but in the case of Adam Scott in season two of Severance, it’s a bat signal for everyone who had a crush on Ben Wyatt on Parks and Rec. Fans have been thirsting over the flashback scenes in episode 7, when a younger Mark Scout is happily in love with Gemma before both of their severance procedures. However, when Scott is looking back on the admiration, it confuses both him and Jimmy Kimmel since he isn’t actually younger in the flashback scenes. “You’re the same age, in fact you might actually be older in the flashbacks,” Kimmel points out to his talk show guest, Scott. “Literally all I did was get a haircut,” Scott explains. Haircuts do a lot for people, just ask anyone who had a glow-up on Love Is Blind.

However, it wasn’t just a simple haircut; it was Ben Stiller’s vision we have to thank for Mark S’s hair. “That’s all Ben Stiller, he loves that hair do,” Scott continues. “From the very beginning of the show, he had a very specific idea of what my hair should look like and that’s what it is.” Stiller just wanted Mark S to serve, whether it was to serve Lumon or to serve cu—",vulture

It’s time for a performance review. But don’t worry, Mr. Milchick — the internet is in charge this time, and it’s looking like you might just be meme-ployee of the month. When the season-two finale of Severance dropped on Apple TV+, it introduced us to a brand new Lumon department. And let’s just say that the choreography in Tramell Tillman’s marching band scene has been providing fans with a lot of merriment. Perhaps Tillman knew how popular his efforts would be, because he arrived at a Severance finale screening and panel at PaleyFest on March 21 with gloves, a whistle, and an actual band to lead:

“I didn’t want Milchick to dance in season two, because I didn’t want, ‘Oh, he dances in every season,’” Tillman recently told Vulture. “But there was something about the idea of playing a drum major that really excited me.” And it’s apparently been equally exciting for all the Innies and Outies who haven’t been able to stop pumping out memes about Milchella over the past couple days.

Asking for another season of Adolescence is, in some way, asking for another fictional murder to happen (just for it to be solved by the end, don’t worry.) Despite not being based on a specific event and rather inspired by several news stories in the UK, Adolescence is, right now, just a mini-series similar to Baby Reindeer. However, its focus on a recurring epidemic in youth culture does give the show an opportunity for another go. “One of our aims was to ask, ‘What is happening to our young men these days, and what are the pressures they face from their peers, from the internet, and from social media?’ ” Series co-creator and star Stephen Graham explained to Netflix on the core thesis of the series. “And the pressures that come from all of those things are as difficult for kids here as they are the world over.”

While Netflix originally green-lit Adolescence as a mini series, it’s not out of the question to give it an upgrade to a multi-season show. The streamer did that for Beef once it saw the high reception and praise for the show; it’s even a possibility for shows outside the Netflix sphere as well, Max also upgraded The White Lotus to the luxury suite on their roster. Hopefully, Graham has a few pitches in mind for other epidemics to explore, maybe looking at Katie’s family’s perspective as one idea.",vulture

Spoilers follow for the Netflix series Adolescence, all four episodes of which began streaming on March 13.

You may think you know what a Stephen Graham performance is going to be like. The British character actor who started his career working with gangster-mythmakers Guy Ritchie and Martin Scorsese can be relied upon for a certain amount of machismo. Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire, an underground crime lord and boxer in A Thousand Blows, a neo-Nazi play-acting at being a father in This Is England, a coolly unemotional dystopian leader in Bodies. Graham’s filmography is dotted through with dudes who have a short fuse and the fighting skills to back it up. But in Adolescence, the four-episode Netflix series about Jamie Miller (newcomer Owen Cooper), a budding 13-year-old incel who stabs a female classmate (Emilia Holliday) to death, the swagger some might associate with Graham is absent. In its place is a raw wound of regret, vulnerability, and confusion, which Graham, who also co-created and co-wrote the series with Jack Thorne, uses to play Jamie’s father Eddie as he struggles with the truth of what his son has done.

Each episode of Adolescence was filmed with one camera in one uninterrupted take, and that level of immersion makes the characters’ emotional highs hit harder. The series banks on us being shocked by Jamie’s transformation after seven months in a youth facility in “Episode 3,” which centers on a psychologist’s interview that sends Jamie into bursts of rage and bitterness. But it breaks our hearts in “Episode 4” by spending its entire final installment with the Millers, who on Eddie’s 50th birthday learn that Jamie has decided to plead guilty.

Jamie’s phone-call confession sends Eddie into a teary existential crisis, one that ends with Eddie in Jamie’s bedroom, where his teen son tumbled down the social-media rabbit hole and peed his pants when cops came to arrest him. Graham’s version of Eddie’s achingly analytical, Everyman masculinity was informed, he says, by observing his father and uncles, hearing relatives’ stories about growing up with corporal punishment in schools, and parenting his two children with wife Hannah Walters, who produced the series with Graham under their banner Matriarch Productions. “Eddie was trying to hold it together, constantly trying to hold it together, from that moment where he sees in “Episode 1” that his son has done it,” Graham says. “He’s poleaxed and will never be the same again.”

In Episode 4,” Eddie and his wife Amanda (Christine Tremarco) speak to each other about Jamie with a lot of questions. You ask her, “We’ve done nothing wrong, have we?” She asks you, “But we made him, didn’t we?” Why did questioning feel right for this dynamic, now 13 months after Jamie killed Katie?

If you listen to conversations, man and wife are constantly asking each other questions, in many ways. And in this situation, they’re trying to find the justification, but also seeking that kind of reassurance. “We did do the right thing, didn’t we? We do see this the same way, don’t we? We are on the same page here? We have tried everything we could try?” Jack writes the human condition beautifully.

How we worked was, we had a full week to go through the script. We sit down for one day and talk and read and talk and read. For the first day, we sat in the living room. The second day, we walked around the house. We had Jack with us for the first three days of every rehearsal week. We could really dissect the language and pick out every single nuance. It was about trying to make the conversation as naturalistic and as free-flowing as possible. That’s the beauty of this particular process that we’ve managed to find, this one-take process. You’re in a state of flow. You start at the beginning, the whistle goes, and we’re all off. The language becomes really rhythmic. There’s a real kind of nice melody that happens with Jack’s writing.

In the second week, that’s when Matthew Lewis comes in, our amazing DOP. The first day, it’s just him and his camera team, and we spend the whole day moving through the space and being with Matt and Lee David Brown, our other camera operator. They’re passing the camera to each other. It’s choreographed with meticulous detail. The next day, all of the crew were in. Now we’re all together. I don’t wish to sound pretentious, but I can’t help it. [Laughs.] It’s like you’re building a little symphony. It just builds and it builds and builds. You’ve got the sound operators hiding little mics in certain places where they can’t be seen, and you’ve got the props department coming in and putting things down and then making sure that they’re not there when you move away.

“Episode 4” is set 13 months later. I’m curious about how you wanted your physicality to be different. How did you approach communicating how the passage of time might have changed Eddie?

Weight — weight on his shoulders. From the get-go, Eddie was supposed to be mowing the garden. I think the crew were a bit shocked at first because I actually fucking mowed the garden. [Laughs.] Before we did the very first take, I mowed the whole garden to get me into it. Not that I’ve never mowed a garden, but I wanted to be in Eddie’s garden. He’s 50. As he puts the mower in the shed, he sees the bike he bought for Jamie; I wanted a specific BMX with mag wheels because it was the bike he never had when he was a kid. Eddie’s reliving his childhood, or trying to capture the childhood that he never had, through his son — and just that looking at it and holding that for a moment, that weight. You’re trying to escape it by doing a mundane thing, mowing the garden. I’m going to have a good day today. And then I see the bike: He’s not here. Fuck.

To maintain the oners, the camera is moving around — it’s being handed off to someone at the top of the stairs in the Millers’ house, it’s being placed on a drone, it’s being mounted on the hood of Eddie’s defaced van. Was there one technical thing about the process that required an even higher level of choreography and finesse in the fourth episode?

The first moment when we come out of the house in order to shut the door and get in the van and go. There’s a rig set up on the van, and they have to take the camera and attach it to the rig seamlessly. We time it. Don’t forget you’ve got to get it off the rig as well. So it’s both of those moments. At the beginning, you’re rehearsing everything. In the scene where Eddie goes through a fence to chase the teen boys who graffitied his van, I used to go, “Matt, I’m not happy with you trying to get through that hole in that gate. Can we lift the wire up a little bit?” It’s very quick, and it’s not a big gap! So for the first couple of takes, you’re kind of like, Whew! We’ve made it through the gap. And then you hit that state of flow, and it’s like, I know he’s going to make it through the gap. I know he’s going to get there. You have that confidence in the fact that it’s all going to be okay.

Teenagers can do cruel things. When Eddie’s got hold of that boy, Eddie realizes it’s wrong. But in the same respect, everything Eddie’s saying to this kid is right: “You don’t do that. You don’t know what’s going on. You don’t know what’s happening in here.” Eddie opens up to that kid more than he probably has at home. Then he becomes aware of the fear that he’s putting into this kid, and that frightens him.

On the way back from that, the camera is no longer on the hood of the van, but in the backseat, looking at Eddie, Amanda, and their daughter, Lisa, when Jamie calls to tell Eddie that he’s pleading guilty. You don’t see a lot of Eddie on the way back. You’re very compartmentalized emotionally, and you’re outside of the frame.

You don’t. When we’re in the car with Jamie (in “Episode 1”) — this was a conscious choice — you don’t see Jamie’s face. You see the side of his face. You don’t see the true impact it’s having on him. We didn’t want to show you. We didn’t want you to try to have a look into his soul. But what’s lovely about having the camera in the back (in “Episode 4”) is that Lee can move across the seat. If it was a conventional drama, we’d have had one camera in the back, two on the side, one at the front; cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, let’s see, let’s see. But I think we need to treat the audience with intelligence and with respect. As an audience, you’re really listening to what’s being said, and you’re just watching for a bit. You’re looking to see the faces, and you’re looking to see what’s going on. We’ve been given all of that back-of-head and side-of-head space and then as Eddie opens the door to take the plant out, you see his face. He’s crushed. He’s absolutely crushed. We give you that one little tiny moment, and you see: boom.

My favorite bit of all is we then go in the house with Christine, and she hangs the coat up. It’s some of the most beautiful acting I have ever seen. She reminds me of my mother, my grandmother, my auntie, my wife: that strength. She’s trying to hold it together for the family, and it just breaks for a second, and she crumbles as she’s hanging the coat up — and then she pulls it back together to go upstairs.

I have to ask about the ending, where you kiss Jamie’s teddy bear and tuck it into his bed. I know this moment wasn’t scripted, and came to you in rehearsal. Talk to me about that.

One of my favorite bits is when Amélie goes downstairs, and Eddie says, “How did we make her?” And then Christine says, “The same way we made him.” That line has so much gravity, but also, it’s so honest. I remember that, and walking into the bedroom for the first time and saying, “What are we going to do, Phil, when I come in here? I want to come in and have a look, because this is where it all started.” And then Phil put the teddy bear on the bed, and I went, “What’s that for?” He said, “I’ve just got this idea.” It just slowly comes to me to hold it. I’m very close with my children. I feel so blessed. I’m very tactile with my kids. When I used to tuck them in bed, I’d cuddle them, kiss them on the forehead and say “good night” — and it just happened. In the rehearsal process, it was just a feeling. And then when you immerse it within the context of the whole scene and the whole shot, when we’re doing this whole thing together, the energy just overtakes you.

But what Philip did do —

This is placing your family pictures in the bedroom so you could see them as you’re filming on Jamie’s bed, right? He got you really good.

[Laughs.] Yeah, he did, and in a beautiful way. He’s a very dear friend. That’s where Philip has his geniuses. He’s a proper actor’s director. You think you’ve gone as far as you can go, and you think you took it to a certain place, and he just has this wonderful ability to point you a little bit further. He can normally do it through very subtle means, but in this particular case, it wasn’t subtle at all. He had these beautiful photographs of my children, and a “We love you, Dad, we’re so proud of you” message. For Stephen to see that and for that to hit Stephen, but then to stay in the context of Eddie — that was the key thing for me. It was the last take of the very last day we were shooting.

Do you feel like you had another take to give, or did he understand that you were there?

No, no, no. I think he knew that that was it. We already had it a couple of takes back. We all knew we had it, so there was no pressure — not like in “Episode 2,” where we didn’t have it, and it was the very last take that we got it. This one — let’s just enjoy it. Let’s throw this one up there and give it to the great gods of creativity and say, “Thank you for this beautiful experience,” and let’s see what happens.

What happened with “Episode 2”? Was there something with the drone?

Well, the drone only got brought into it by Wednesday of shooting. [Laughs.] Toby Bentley from Netflix was lovely, wonderful. He said, “I think we need to see Eddie again, at the end. I want to connect Eddie to our story. But I think he should be over by the flowers. See if you can work it out.” I wasn’t allowed to rehearse that day. I’m an executive producer, but I’m not booked as an actor to do that. I’m like, “Let me just get on, then. It’s my production.” They were like, “No. We have to clear it through the right channels.” We had to rehearse it with Phil’s brother. [Laughs.] There’s a take out there with Phil’s brother, bless him.

That was on a Wednesday, and then on Thursday, we go for the first time and it’s quite wobbly. The second time, the wind’s too strong; we can’t fly the drone. We have to finish it with him by the school. On Friday morning, we got one up, but it was quite wobbly. Friday afternoon, it’s the last take. It’s the last chance. We can’t come back on Monday because we have new locations set up. We’ve got a really good take from the second take on Monday, but this new ending doesn’t exist. What are we going to do? And then — boom. It just hit like poetry. Every single performance had that kind of beautiful fluidity. It’s like jazz. It just went together lovely.

George Foreman, the Olympic gold medalist and two-time heavyweight champion who also became known for his knockout success as the salesman of his eponymous grill, died “peacefully” on March 21 while “surrounded by loved ones,” his family announced in a statement posted on his Instagram account. He was 76. “A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose,” the statement said. “A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.” No cause of death was shared, and Foreman’s family requested privacy as they “honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.”

Born in 1949 in Texas, Foreman started boxing as a teenager while he was in the Jobs Corps. According to his website, he tried the sport to “show my friends that I wasn’t afraid,” only for it to end up turning into a decades-long career. He won gold at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when he was 19, and went pro the following year. In 1974, he defeated Joe Frazier to become the world heavyweight champion. Foreman famously lost to Muhammad Ali in “the Rumble in the Jungle,” the 1974 fight chronicled in the Oscar-winning documentary When We Were Kings. Following a near-death experience after a match in 1977, Foreman stepped away from boxing and became a minister. He returned to the ring a decade later amid financial difficulties, eventually becoming the oldest heavyweight champ in boxing history at age 45 in 1994. That same year, he launched his George Foreman Grill, which ultimately sold more than 100 million units worldwide, according to ESPN. He retired from boxing in 1997 with 76 wins and five losses, though he stayed connected to the sport as a longtime ringside analyst for HBO.

In 2022, Foreman was accused of sexually abusing two women when they were minors in the 1970s, allegations that he denied. He made headlines later that year for appearing on The Masked Singer as the Venus Fly Trap, telling Entertainment Weekly after his elimination that he was now interested in recording music and doing more television. His life and career inspired the 2023 biopic Big George Foreman: The Miraculous Story of the Once and Future Heavyweight Champion of the World. In his Instagram bio, Foreman promoted that movie, listed a couple of his boxing achievements, and described himself as the “Happiest of All Time!”",vulture
https://vulture.com,"Is NewJeans Disbanding, Leaving HYBE and ADOR, or What?",https://www.vulture.com/article/hybe-feud-ador-min-hee-jin-newjeans.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 01:40:00 GMT","Photo: Korea Pool/AFP via Getty Images

Since grabbing the world’s “Attention” with their July 2022 debut, NewJeans — the K-pop group made up of members Hanni, Minji, Haerin, Danielle, and Hyein — has topped the Billboard 200, scored collabs with Apple and Coca-Cola, and inspired some truly … unforgettable covers. But in late April, they became wrapped up in something of a family feud: Their parent company, HYBE, was publicly fighting with their label ADOR’s now ex-CEO, Min Hee-jin. On September 11, NewJeans themselves livestreamed an ultimatum for HYBE to reinstate Min as CEO within two weeks. “She is integral to NewJeans’s identity, and we all feel that she is irreplaceable,” Danielle read. But the September 25 deadline came and went, and a court dismissed Min’s injunction to get the job back about a month later. Did that mean the dispute was finally over? Nope, not even close.

On November 28, all five members of NewJeans said in an emergency press conference that they were terminating their contracts with ADOR over mistreatment allegations that the label has denied. On March 21, days before what was intended to be their first performance as the newly-rebranded NJZ, a court sided with ADOR and granted a preliminary injunction that will temporarily halt their independent activities. But the members say they plan to challenge that decision, and there’s still a main lawsuit hearing to come in April.

Depending on who you ask, this all began as either the story of an exec who got greedy and girlbossed too close to the sun, or of a brave creative who was being punished by a corporation for trying to protect her artistic vision. One thing’s for sure: K-pop stans are tuned in. In case you haven’t had time to keep up with all the back-and-forth responses and press conferences and reports, here’s how this battle started, why Min said she resigned, what NewJeans has said about their (contested) departure and potential penalties, and how all of this might affect the group’s future plans.

The Latest

Is NewJeans leaving ADOR?

Depends on whom you’re asking. The members, who announced on February 7 that they are rebranding as NJZ, would definitely say that they already left last year … but ADOR thinks that the group is still legally under the label, and has been trying to prove that in court via an injunction and a main lawsuit. The label believes the entire industry could be affected by what happens next. “Allowing unilateral terminations of exclusive contracts and independent activities without legal procedures could undermine investment in the entertainment industry,” ADOR argued in a January injunction application, per Yonhap News, “and destabilize the K-pop sector.”

What happened with the injunction before ComplexCon?

On March 21, the Seoul Central District Court sided with ADOR by granting the label’s request for a preliminary injunction that will temporarily prevent Hanni, Minji, Haerin, Danielle, and Hyein from taking on independent activities without ADOR’s approval. (It only applies until a ruling is reached in the yet-to-be-resolved main lawsuit over their contracts.) The decision came two days before the group was set to perform as NJZ for the first time thanks to a March 23 headlining set at ComplexCon in Hong Kong for which they said they would debut a new song. The injunction was initially filed in January to stop the members from signing advertising contracts, but it later expanded to cover all entertainment activities, which would naturally include performances and the release of new music.

In a statement to Vulture celebrating the court’s decision, ADOR suggested that the group is still free to perform at ComplexCon … as long as they do it as ADOR artists. “With our status as NewJeans’ exclusive agency now legally affirmed, we are fully committed to supporting the artists going forward,” ADOR’s statement said. “We will be fully present at ComplexCon this weekend to guarantee the performance is presented under the NewJeans name. We eagerly anticipate meeting with the artists for a heartfelt conversation at the earliest opportunity.”

Still, the members aren’t giving up yet. In a statement posted to Instagram and attributed to NJZ, they said they plan to challenge the court’s decision by raising “additional legal issues” and submitting more evidence. “NJZ respects the court’s ruling. However, we believe that the decision did not fully take into account the complete breakdown of trust the members have experienced toward ADOR,” the statement said. It also affirmed that the members have no intention of staying with “a management that has disrespected our identities and undermined our achievement,” and explained that they decided to go ahead with the ComplexCon performance in order to “prevent unnecessary disruption or harm to those who have been looking forward” to it.

“Compared to everything we’ve been through so far, this is just another step in our journey,” the group added in a separate statement to Time. “Maybe this is just the current reality in Korea. But that’s exactly why we believe change and growth are necessary. It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”

What’s the contract-dispute lawsuit about?

Probably what you’d guess from the name. In December, ADOR sued NewJeans to try to confirm that their exclusive contracts with the label are still intact; the group is hoping to prove that their contract terminations were valid. A hearing for that lawsuit is currently set for April 3.

All five members of NewJeans previously said at a November 28 emergency press conference that they would terminate their contracts with the label at midnight on November 29. “ADOR has neither the ability nor the will to protect NewJeans,” Hanni declared, per Korea JoongAng Daily. “Staying at the agency will only prolong our psychological pain and waste our time.” According to the BBC, the group raised concerns about “manipulation,” “deliberate miscommunication,” and “mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff.” Ultimately, they argued that ADOR didn’t make an effort to rectify its alleged breaches of contract when asked. But ADOR believes that it never violated the contract in the first place. “The exclusive contracts between ADOR and the NewJeans members remain valid,” the label said after NewJeans’s press conference, in a statement translated by Soompi. “Therefore, we expect them to continue their scheduled activities ahead together with ADOR as they have until now.” The label optimistically noted that it will do its best to “support NewJeans in their activities and help them grow further as global artists.”

Regardless, NewJeans seems to have already planned a future without ADOR. The group said at their press conference that they will remain active after leaving the label, and intend to fulfill their existing schedules. They also expressed a desire to work with ex-CEO Min Hee-jin again if possible. At the time, Danielle acknowledged that the members might not be able to use the name NewJeans in the future, but said they will fight for the right to do so. “Regardless of our name, just remember that NewJeans never dies,” she added, echoing previous remarks from the group’s November 16 acceptance speech at the 2024 Korea Grand Music Awards.

NewJeans and ADOR had a seven-year contract that was set to expire in 2029. Per a Yonhap News report, the group sent a legal notice on November 13 declaring that they would terminate their contracts if the label didn’t rectify alleged breaches of contract within two weeks of receipt. All five members reportedly signed the document, known as a certification of content. (“You might have been surprised by the news, but don’t worry, we’re okay!” Danielle assured fans in a message on the fan app Phoning.) Their specific demands were not initially made public, but NewJeans previously issued a failed two-week ultimatum for Min to be reinstated as CEO in a September livestream. According to Yonhap, their November 13 notice also raised discontent over controversial HYBE internal reports, specifically pointing to a statement that it would be easier to “abandon” NewJeans.

ADOR confirmed that it received the certification of content from NewJeans on the morning of November 14 (which put the deadline at November 28). The label said in a statement that it was “reviewing it to understand the specific requests” and would “do our best to resolve the matter wisely so that we can continue to work with the artists,” according to a Soompi translation. Min announced her resignation from ADOR and HYBE on November 20. After NewJeans declared their departure on November 28, ADOR said in a statement via Soompi, “We regret that a press conference to announce the termination of exclusive contract was planned and conducted even before receiving a response to the certification of contents and without sufficient review.” NewJeans did acknowledge that ADOR sent a response shortly before the press conference, but clearly, the group did not find it satisfactory.

Will NewJeans/NJZ have to pay penalties for leaving?

They don’t think they need to, but we don’t know for sure what will happen yet. Breaking a K-pop contract before time is up is usually associated with extremely expensive fees (The Korea Times estimated that the five members of NewJeans could collectively owe more than $213 million, while Chosun reported that an associate of Min Hee-jin’s suggested to her over KakaoTalk that the total could be as high as $442 million). Multiple outlets previously speculated that NewJeans might try to file an injunction to get a court to terminate their contracts for them. But during their press conference, NewJeans said that they terminated their contracts because they held up their end of the agreement, while ADOR and HYBE did not. Haerin suggested that as a result, the responsibility to pay any penalty fees should be on the companies, not the members. We’ll have to wait and see if this argument will end up going to court and playing out between lawyers.

What did Hanni say at the National Assembly?

On October 15, Hanni testified about workplace bullying in front of lawmakers as part of the Environment and Labor Committee’s examination into working conditions in the entertainment industry. The 20-year-old spoke at length about a manager allegedly telling another HYBE artist to ignore her, an incident she first brought up in September during the surprise NewJeans livestream. She said she wanted to prevent similar things from happening to other idols and trainees. According to the BBC, Hanni noted that this wasn’t the only reason she was “honestly convinced that the company hated us.” She also alleged that higher-ups at HYBE hadn’t returned her greetings, HYBE employees had spoken negatively about NewJeans on Blind, and HYBE’s PR team had tried to get a journalist to downplay her group’s achievements. (HYBE denied the latter claim, arguing that it was trying to correct a factual error.)

ADOR CEO Kim Ju-young, who represented HYBE at the hour-long hearing, said she’d been given different accounts of the alleged ignoring incident. She also claimed that CCTV footage expired before she could request it. Kim said hearing how Hanni felt made her wonder if she could have done more, and affirmed that she would cooperate with an investigation into the incident. Hanni didn’t look convinced that Kim wanted to help, and at one point, said as much directly to the exec. Near the end of the hearing, Hanni brushed away tears and acknowledged that people have been worried about NewJeans. “Some fans apologized for making us go through this, but I’m grateful to Korea for allowing me to do what I love,” the Vietnamese Australian singer said. “The ones who should be apologizing are avoiding responsibility, and that frustrates me.”

After Hanni first spoke about the alleged ignoring incident in NewJeans’s livestream, some fans were so concerned that they filed a workplace-harassment complaint over it with the Ministry of Employment and Labor. But the government agency ultimately closed that case on November 20, citing multiple factors to conclude that the K-pop idol doesn’t count as an employee under the country’s labor laws. Hanni herself had touched on the distinction in her October testimony. “I understand that the contracts for artists and trainees may be different [from that of regular workers],” she said, per Korea JoongAng Daily, “but we are all human.”

On November 26, multiple Korean outlets reported that a lawmaker from the Progressive Party proposed the so-called NewJeans Hanni Act, which would be a partial amendment to the existing Labor Standards Act. This legislation would allow protections against workplace bullying to apply to people in special employment relationships, from K-pop idols to apartment security guards and delivery workers. If enacted, it would also establish penalties for perpetrators and employers who don’t take appropriate action in cases of workplace bullying.

Background

Who is Min Hee-jin, and why is she fighting HYBE?

Before she was nicknamed the “mother” of NewJeans, Min Hee-jin was a creative director at SM, where she worked on visuals for groups including Girls’ Generation, EXO, f(x), and SHINee. Over the course of her career, some of her concepts have been criticized as age-inappropriate. In 2022, she denied allegations that her past Instagram posts had glamorized pedophilia.

In 2019, Min joined Big Hit Entertainment, BTS’s agency, as chief brand officer. She helped it reintroduce itself as today’s HYBE Corporation, which operates a multi-label system where HYBE artists work with different subsidiary labels. (The Big Hit label, for example, is home to BTS and TXT, while Le Sserafim is under Source Music.) In 2021, HYBE announced that Min was becoming the CEO of NewJeans’s eventual label, ADOR, short for All Doors One Room. HYBE owns an 80 percent stake in it.

This conflict first went public on April 22, when news broke that HYBE had begun an audit of ADOR over allegations that Min was planning a hostile takeover for independent management rights of the label (and thus NewJeans). ADOR released a statement on the same day, denying that it was trying to seize control. From the label’s point of view, this mess actually started because Min had brought up concerns that ILLIT, a five-member girl group under fellow HYBE label Belift Lab, had copied NewJeans in styling, choreography, music videos, and more. ILLIT debuted in March with an EP that was produced by HYBE chairman Bang Si-hyuk and sold 500,000 units in the first four weeks. They took home 12 music-show wins for lead single “Magnetic.”

ADOR said it made an official internal complaint to HYBE to protect the “cultural achievements” of NewJeans, but alleged that the company chose to try to drive Min out instead of giving a solid response. (HYBE later denied this in a statement, claiming that it actually sent her a six-page answer.)

The next day, HYBE confirmed to Billboard that it was investigating top execs at ADOR and had sent an “official letter” asking Min to step down. Per multiple local reports, HYBE’s audit involved questionnaires and requests for assets such as company files and laptops. The company said in an April 25 press release that the investigation found evidence that Min was conspiring about how to break away from HYBE and getting staff involved According to HYBE, there were plans to pressure HYBE to sell its shares of ADOR, with one auditee allegedly admitting to creating documents to attack HYBE. The audit reportedly also revealed that Min had given instructions to prepare for a war of public opinion starting in May. HYBE declared in its press release that it was going to report Min to the police for breach of trust, which prompted her to call a press conference to personally deny wrongdoing.

What did Min Hee-jin say during that press conference?

During the emotional two-hour event on April 25, Min Hee-jin cried, cursed, suggested that people in her life have worried that she would try to kill herself because of this situation, and made a weird comment about NewJeans’s Minji being way prettier when she was younger. If you want a play-by-play, Korea JoongAng Daily has a lengthy summary, but Min’s main message was that she cares about protecting NewJeans and is not planning to take them away or break her contract with HYBE. Regarding HYBE’s alleged evidence, she argued that private conversations are being presented out of context. For example, HYBE claimed Min had considered involving foreign investors to facilitate a takeover plan. “We were just messing about when we mentioned the Saudi Arabia fund,” Min said, per Korea JoongAng Daily’s translation. “Would that even be possible?” In another case, she said she asked a venture-capitalist friend about contract terms, which HYBE portrayed as her reaching out to an external consultant. Basically, she argued that no plans were ever put into action and that certain scenarios just reflect the way an employee complains about their job and boss.

Min name-dropped several other K-pop groups in her claims that HYBE also slighted NewJeans and ADOR prior to ILLIT’s debut. Notably, she feels NewJeans was initially shunted aside to promote Le Sserafim (which Source Music has denied). At one point, Min pulled up screenshots of texts allegedly showing Bang Si-hyuk responding sarcastically to NewJeans’s global success. She also implied that she is under an unfair contract (which HYBE has, of course, denied). Her attorney, Timothy SK Lee, stepped in to note that the terms of Min’s contract were being renegotiated before this situation unfolded. “We asked [Min] not to make the internal report because it would worsen their relationships,” he said. “She went forward because she said that she wanted to make things right.”

In the wake of the press conference, articles and press releases were pumped out on a daily basis. On May 2, several outlets reported that, per an industry source, Min had previously asked HYBE for the right to terminate ADOR’s contract with NewJeans without board approval. (HYBE reportedly suspected this was a shady step to ultimately make ADOR an “empty shell” that she could buy back later when its value dropped.) According to a same-day statement from Min’s lawyer, Min asked in a January 25 meeting for the right to “make important decisions” regarding contracts with NewJeans as a way to protect the label’s independent management rights and “resolve the unfair interference” from HYBE during the group’s debut process. Since then, there’s been plenty of other back-and-forth allegations about salaries, stocks, shamanism, financial negotiations, and the way the audit went down, but the gist is all the same: HYBE claims it has proof Min engaged in illegal or unsavory business behavior in a way that can’t be written off as a joke or casual conversation, while she alleges that the company is lying, taking things out of context, ﻿and coercing staff to try to dig up dirt. In August, Min’s attorneys also denied a former employee’s allegations that Min had berated her for filing a sexual-harassment complaint at the company and tried to cover up the case.

And NewJeans/NJZ sided with Min Hee-jin?

They’re definitely Team Min, yes. In a September 11 livestream on a since-deleted YouTube channel, all five members of NewJeans called for Min Hee-jin to be reinstated as CEO by September 25. “CEO Min Hee-jin is not only the person that produces our music, but someone who makes NewJeans who we are,” Danielle said. “She discusses even the smallest details with us and explains them in ways that we can understand clearly. NewJeans has a distinct color and tone, and this was created with CEO Min Hee-jin.”

During the half-hour broadcast that was later re-uploaded by fans,

the girls questioned how they could continue to work if Min is not running both the production and management sides at ADOR. They also suggested that while Min fought to protect them from alleged mistreatment at HYBE, the label’s current management wasn’t bringing the same energy. For example, Hanni said she and another group recently greeted each other in the HYBE building, only for their manager to later instruct the idols — while in front of Hanni — to “ignore her.” She claimed that ADOR’s new CEO made her feel like a liar when she recounted what happened. The members additionally pointed to a recent dispute over NewJeans content and the reveal of their trainee videos as reasons to wonder who really has their best interests at heart. They further hinted that they have experienced other uncomfortable incidents that they can’t discuss owing to their contract. It’s not clear where the September 25 deadline came from or what action the members planned to take after the date passed, but Hanni said the members of NewJeans “are not going to follow HYBE’s every orders blindly.” She added, “We are more than well aware that this is getting in the way of our work and that we should be treated much, much better than how we are right now.”

While the livestream was NewJeans’s first official statement on the internal company battle, the group has expressed love and gratitude to Min in acceptance speeches at music shows and awards ceremonies. Per The Korea Times, all members of NewJeans submitted court petitions in May siding with Min’s injunction, meaning they didn’t want her to leave. (That month, screenshots circulated that allegedly showed Min making disparaging comments about NewJeans’s work ethic and a member’s weight. In a May 19 statement, Min said the messages were edited and taken out of context, adding that the NewJeans members themselves sent her comforting texts right after the screenshots began circulating.) According to Min, the girls have been deeply affected by unfolding events. During her first press conference back in April, Min said NewJeans’s youngest member, Hyein, cried for 20 minutes about wanting to speak out on the group’s fan app, Phoning, and that other members called or asked to visit.

Meanwhile, even the girls’ families got involved. Parents of NewJeans members publicly sided with Min in a Sports World interview in July, and Ilgan Sports also obtained a copy of a letter reportedly sent by the parents to Min in April that alleged that HYBE chairman Bang Si-hyuk had ignored their daughters in the company building multiple times, among other concerns. (HYBE denied the claims in a press release.)

So how did Min Hee-jin lose her CEO status?

It definitely didn’t happen A-S-A-P, baby. After initiating the April 22 audit, HYBE asked ADOR to convene its board of directors, who have the power to call a shareholders’ meeting that could approve Min Hee-jin’s dismissal. But guess who was still on the board? Per the Chosun Ilbo, Min sent HYBE an email on April 29 refusing to call a board meeting, arguing in part that the request was outside the authority of an audit. Naturally, HYBE disagreed — but it also had a backup plan. The company had already filed an April 25 court request for permission to call an emergency shareholders’ meeting to replace board members and get Min removed that way.

Ultimately, ADOR’s board met on May 10 and agreed to convene a shareholders’ meeting on May 31. Since HYBE owns 80% of ADOR, Min’s prospects of staying suddenly seemed slim. But according to The Korea Herald, Min then filed an injunction with the Seoul Central District Court in hopes of nullifying HYBE’s ability to vote in the meeting before it happened. Before the first hearing on May 17, The Korea Times reported that all five members of NewJeans submitted court petitions siding with Min. According to News 1, BTS producer Pdogg, Pledis CEO Han Sung-soo, Source Music CEO So Sung-jin, HYBE executive creator Son Sung-deuk, BTS and Le Sserafim creative director Kim Sung-hyun (a.k.a. Nu Kim), and TXT producer Slow Rabbit submitted petitions in support of HYBE.

On May 30, local outlets reported that Min had won the injunction, with the court ruling that it did not have enough evidence to justify her dismissal. The court concluded that Min was finding ways to lessen HYBE’s control over ADOR, but that it’s difficult to say she followed through on any plans and actually committed a breach of trust. This meant that HYBE couldn’t kick her out at the May 31 meeting (or at least not without the court ordering it to pay $14.5 million). HYBE said it would comply with the ruling, but would take follow-up legal action. Still, the company reportedly did use the shareholder meeting to remove some of Min’s allies. According to The Korea Herald, HYBE voted to dismiss two ADOR board members who were close with Min and appointed three HYBE execs.

It looks like those new members may have helped finally sway the balance against Min. After months of efforts, she was replaced as CEO in an August 27 board meeting. ADOR confirmed the news to Vulture in a statement that named Kim Ju-young, HYBE’s chief HR officer and an existing member of the label’s board of directors, as the new CEO. “With these personnel and organizational changes, we aim to provide strong support for the continued growth and success of NewJeans,” ADOR said at the time. The label also told Korea JoongAng Daily that Min virtually took part in what it described as a lawful meeting where the board “made the optimal decision for the future of ADOR and NewJeans.” While initial reports suggested that she had stepped down, Min said she was dismissed from the position against her wishes, which she denounced to JoongAng Daily as a “grave violation” of a shareholder contract.

Even after Min Hee-jin was replaced as the label head, she was still an employee at ADOR. Min’s legal team previously said in a September 13 statement that she planned to first be reappointed as internal director — her term was due to expire on November 2 — and then take steps to re-secure the CEO position. The first part of this plan worked: ADOR did convene an October 17 shareholder meeting where Min’s contract as internal director was reupped for three years through 2027.

She filed another injunction to get the label’s board to reinstate her as CEO, but on October 29, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the request. “We acknowledge and appreciate the court’s wise ruling,” HYBE said in a statement to Vulture. “In light of this decision, HYBE is dedicated to normalizing ADOR’s operations, improving our multi-label capabilities, and supporting the activities of our artists.” Per The Korea Herald, after the October 29 court dismissal, Min affirmed in a same-day interview that she still planned to become CEO again and is “committed to taking this as far as it can go.” ADOR’s five-member board (three of whom are HYBE execs) made its stance clear the next day by voting against Min’s return as CEO.

Wasn’t Min Hee-jin going to stay on as a producer?

When news of Min’s departure as CEO first broke, ADOR did say that Min would still serve as NewJeans’s producer. But around two hours after initial reports circulated, Min claimed in an August 27 statement to Korea JoongAng Daily that ADOR had decided that without discussing it with her. Her legal team then said on August 30 that she would not agree to a proposed two-month contract to stay on as the group’s producer, according to Korea JoongAng Daily. She claimed that the contract contained “toxic clauses,” which the label denied. ADOR later said it had also offered her a five-year contract to produce for NewJeans on September 11, with discussions about specific terms to take place in the future. Representatives for Min responded by again alleging that the proposed agreement had “numerous toxic provisions,” per a Soompi translation of a September 25 statement. Her November 20 resignation statement similarly expressed outrage that the company offered her a producing contract “full of toxic clauses as if they were doing me a huge favor.”

Why did Min Hee-jin resign?

HYBE’s commitment to battling this out in the court of law (and the court of public opinion) apparently took a toll on ADOR’s former CEO. In a lengthy November 20 statement to Forbes, Min Hee-jin announced that she was resigning as an internal director at the ADOR label — and terminating a contentious shareholder agreement to leave parent company HYBE altogether. “Even in the midst of the hellish dispute with HYBE that has lasted for over seven months, starting with HYBE’s illegal audit in April, I have done my utmost to adhere to the shareholders’ agreement and to restore ADOR to its pre-April state,” Min said. “However, as HYBE still refuses to acknowledge their wrongdoings and shows no signs of change, I have decided that further efforts would be a waste of time.” Later in her statement, she put it even more bluntly: “I didn’t want to conform to and settle in this twisted organization out of attachment to money.” She accused HYBE of using its subsidiary labels to file unreasonable lawsuits against her and “engage in unfair media play,” among other allegations.

Still, that doesn’t mean we’ve seen the last of her. Min noted that she still plans to “hold HYBE legally accountable” for allegedly violating her shareholder agreement, among other “illegal activities.” (She has already followed through; per Yonhap News, she filed a new criminal complaint against two PR execs at the company within a week.) Min’s statement also thanked NewJeans fans for their support, and suggested that she’s not done with the music industry just yet. “I hope you will show great interest in the new K-pop journey I will embark on in the future,” she said.

ADOR confirmed Min’s exit in a brief statement to Forbes on November 20. “It is regrettable that Min unilaterally notified us of her resignation,” the statement said. “ADOR will continue to provide our fullest support to NewJeans to help them grow and thrive even further.”

Why is the shareholder agreement important?

Min Hee-jin has argued that the terms of her shareholder agreement with HYBE guaranteed that she would be ADOR’s CEO until November 2026. She’s claimed that HYBE violated the still-valid agreement; HYBE’s claimed that it had already been terminated. SPOTV News previously reported that HYBE nixed the contract at some point in July, which was a contentious month in this feud (Min underwent eight hours of police questioning on July 9 tied to a breach-of-trust complaint filed by HYBE; Yonhap News reported on July 24 that she had filed her own complaint with the police against five HYBE execs). Min ultimately said she was terminating the shareholder agreement in her resignation announcement, but affirmed that she still plans take legal action over HYBE’s alleged breach of this contract.

The agreement reportedly gave Min the power to ask HYBE to purchase 75 percent of her ADOR stocks. SPOTV estimated that these put-option rights were worth around $75 million.

Everything Else

Have plans for a NewJeans album, tour, or anything else been affected?

Alongside their rebrand as NJZ, the group confirmed in a February 7 interview with CNBC that they they will debut a new song on the last day of ComplexCon Hong Kong, which runs from March 21 to March 23. Following a recent court decision that the girls plan to appeal, ADOR said the label would be at the performance to “guarantee that it is presented under the NewJeans name.” The members said they decided to continue with the performance in order to “prevent unnecessary disruption or harm to those who have been looking forward” to the headlining set.

The group previously told CNN that they’re focused on making and performing new music, which Haerin hinted will have a “very unique and different sound.” However, ADOR apparently hasn’t given up on NewJeans yet. ADOR said in a February 7 statement to Vulture that it “deeply regret[s] that the members have unilaterally made this choice [to announce a new stage name],” adding that the label is “committed to protecting the value of the NewJeans brand” and willing to meet with the members or their legal representatives to “clarify any misunderstandings and collaboratively plan for the group’s future activities.”

Min Hee-jin previously confirmed in a May 31 press conference that NewJeans had been preparing to go on a 2025 world tour, which she said would require the group to release a new album by the end of 2024. When NewJeans announced on November 28 that they were leaving ADOR, Danielle said the group wants to drop new music “next year, as soon as possible, whenever.” But aside from an instrumental demo that Min Hee-jin shared in September, we haven’t really gotten substantial updates on their first album. Both Min and HYBE acknowledged in September that album production for the group was on hold. Naturally, they blamed each other: Min suggested in a September 25 JoongAng Ilbo interview that this was part of HYBE’s “obstruction” of business against NewJeans, while a September 26 statement from HYBE to ChosunBiz pointed to Min’s alleged negligence and delayed decision-making.

When ADOR confirmed to Vulture on August 27 that Min had been replaced as CEO, the label noted that it aims “to provide strong support for the continued growth and success of NewJeans.” The girls didn’t seem too sure about that, though. “It was our dream to perform the music we wanted to make together with Min Hee-jin, and we were working hard for that dream,” Danielle said in NewJeans’s September 11 livestream in support of Min, per a Soompi translation. “But now we can no longer achieve those dreams, and we may not even get to carry out all the plans we’ve made.”

Min previously suggested in her May 31 press conference that it’s been difficult to focus on her plans for NewJeans amid her dispute with HYBE. During the livestream, NewJeans empathized with that sentiment. “Despite her being in the midst of all this current legal conflict, she’s expected to plan and creatively produce our future endeavors in just only two months, which I personally think makes no sense at all,” Hanni said in English, in apparent reference to reports that ADOR had asked Min to sign a two-month contract to continue producing for the group after her removal as CEO.

Music-video director Shin Woo-seok alleged in early September that ADOR’s new management had told him to remove already released NewJeans footage and not upload planned content. According to Korea JoongAng Daily, ADOR claimed that it only asked him to take down one video for copyright reasons. Shin later restored affected content and announced plans to take legal action against the label. “What scares us the most is that it’s not just our future that’s being threatened, but also the work that we’ve made so far,” Minji said in the NewJeans livestream, per a JoongAng Daily translation.

What’s happened to ILLIT?

Min Hee-jin has made it clear that her beef is with the adults at HYBE and Belift, not the 16- to 20-year-old members of ILLIT who were selected to debut after competing on the survival show R U Next?. But it seemed inevitable that the quintet would face scrutiny over how the choreography, visuals, and sound compared to NewJeans when they returned on October 21 with their second mini-album, I’ll Like You. “Rather than dwelling on the controversy, we concentrated on showing our true colors and improving ourselves for those who believe in us,” Yunah said at a media showcase for the comeback, per The Korea Times. Fellow member Wonhee added that Bang Si-hyuk had personally offered advice and input for this comeback.

ILLIT previously wrapped their music-show stage promotions for “Magnetic” and “Lucky Girl Syndrome” in late April, meaning they were due for a break shortly after the drama began. Still, fans remained worried about the emotional toll of this situation, especially after a member appeared to be reading and deleting negative comments during a livestream. Per Ilgan Sports, Belift has claimed in court that Min’s actions resulted in ILLIT experiencing a drop in album sales and losing both brand deals and social media followers.

On May 22, Belift announced that it had filed a criminal complaint over the plagiarism allegations, accusing Min of interference with business and defamation. According to a Soompi translation, Belift later said in a June 10 statement that it was also filing a civil lawsuit to hold Min “accountable” for damages to Belift artists and members, “as well as participating creators who have been burdened and silenced by the stigma of plagiarism.” That same day, Belift released a 27-minute YouTube video denying the plagiarism allegations. Yonhap News reported on November 22 that Min plans to sue Belift right back, with her lawyer stating that she will pursue both a civil and criminal case. This news came a day after ILLIT won Best New Female Artist at the 2024 MAMA Awards in Los Angeles on November 21.

Okay, now how did BTS get involved?

Military service couldn’t keep this conflict from reaching the group. Min Hee-jin claimed in an October 29 interview that V — whom she collaborated with on his debut solo album, Layover — sometimes called her from the military to check if she was doing okay amid ongoing events. She specifically claimed that he sent her a birthday message at dawn. But phone use is limited to specific times in the military, so some people questioned whether rules were bent for V because he’s famous. On November 21, the BTS member’s unit denied giving him any special treatment, noting that he only used his device during allowed afternoon periods.

Even a pet has gotten in it. An Instagram account for Jungkook’s dog, Jeon Bam, used colors associated with each of the NewJeans members in a September 13 post captioned, “💙🩷💛💚💜💪🏻 Artists are not guilty.” A follow-up post the next day added, “Don’t use them.” Big Hit Music said in a statement that it checked with the BTS member and confirmed he made the posts because he believed “under no circumstances should a young artist be dragged into a dispute and used as a shield.”

Previously, Yonhap News reported that HYBE’s April audit found that Min privately told other people Bang Si-hyuk had copied her to make BTS. Naturally, this vague allegation did not sit well with the BTS Army. In her press conference, Min denied ever saying this. Minutes before the conference, HYBE also claimed it had obtained transcripts of Min consulting a shaman she believed was possessed by her dead sister about company business decisions, including who to hire and which trainees to accept. But the part that went viral was a conversation allegedly about BTS’s military service. “I think it would be better for me if BTS went, what do you think?” Min said, per a Korea JoongAng Daily translation, to which the shaman responded, “I’m trying to send them.” Min claimed that the shaman is simply a friend of hers. Regarding the chat about BTS, she said she was curious about how to plan if the company’s “ace team” would be gone.

And weren’t there rumors about a cult?

Yup. In late April, a conspiracy theory began circulating online that Min Hee-jin wanted to leave HYBE because it has ties to Dahn World, which has also been associated with the names Brain & Body, Dahn Hak, and Dahn Yoga. Reports from Rolling Stone and Forbes include allegations that the group is a pseudo-religious cult. Much of the speculation about HYBE’s ties is based on “clues” perceived to be planted in song lyrics and music videos. Special attention has been paid to NewJeans’s “OMG” video, because Min showed a screenshot during her press conference claiming that she was threatened by HYBE execs over it. Multiple viral posts pointed out that six of the seven BTS members graduated from Global Cyber University, which was established by Dahn World founder Ilchi Lee (real name Lee Seung-heon). But it’s worth noting that many K-pop idols, including those who aren’t under HYBE, have degrees from that same school. Perhaps a virtual education simply offers a more flexible schedule?

On May 2, Dahn World issued a statement denying that it is a cult or has ties to BTS and HYBE. That same day, HYBE’s Big Hit label announced that it has taken legal action over posts spreading the “completely false” allegation that BTS is affiliated with Dahn World “or any religious cults.” The company said it had filed a criminal complaint over the cult claims, as well as resurfaced allegations of chart manipulation (which Big Hit also denied).

What’s up with Source Music and that Dispatch exposé?

Source Music has consistently denied Min Hee-jin’s claim that NewJeans was pushed aside to let Le Sserafim be HYBE’s first girl group. On July 15, Korea JoongAng Daily reported that Source Music had recently sued Min for defamation and disruption of business over alleged damages to Le Sserafim. Per Soompi, ADOR responded by not only denying that Min had stolen the NewJeans members, but also further accusing Source Music of copying a launch strategy Min had presented to HYBE chairman Bang Si-hyuk. Source Music firmly denied this and said it would pursue further legal action against Min on top of its existing lawsuit. Parents of NewJeans members then responded via a Sports World interview in which they maintained their loyalty to Min and ADOR, while also leveling allegations of mistreatment and misinformation against Source Music and HYBE.

On July 23, Dispatch published a lengthy report alleging that Min Hee-jin had consulted with a shaman and decided to delay NewJeans’s debut at Source Music so that she could take the trainees to her own label. Alleged screenshots of Min’s texts appear to show her deciding to eliminate trainees from the lineup based on the shaman’s advice, with one girl seemingly removed because the shaman thought she looked possessed by a ghost. The report includes a video of a seven-person “Attention” dance practice with two faces blurred out. In NewJeans’s September 11 livestream, Haerin expressed discomfort with the release of predebut content and HYBE’s inaction.

What other K-pop groups have been mentioned?

At this point, the better question might be what groups haven’t been. During a National Assembly audit on October 24, a lawmaker shared a HYBE document titled “Weekly Music Industry Report” that criticized many different K-pop groups across the industry and contained disparaging remarks about physical appearance, including that of minor members. When questioned, Belift CEO and HYBE COO Kim Tae-ho claimed that this was a collection of external opinions. But in an October 29 statement on HYBE’s website, HYBE CEO Lee Jae-sang took a more apologetic stance about the “highly inappropriate” internal document. “On behalf of the company, we acknowledge and take full responsibility for the inflammatory and inflammatory language directed at K-pop artists, the addition of the author’s personal views and evaluations, and the fact that the content was left as a document,” Lee wrote, per a fan translation. “In particular, we are deeply sorry and deeply distressed that innocent artists and members of the company have been misunderstood and harmed by the reverse viral allegations, which are completely untrue.” Sports Seoul previously reported that Min Hee-jin had taken issue with these weekly reports several times, emailing a complaint to HYBE management in April. In an October 29 interview, Min confirmed that she had sent a critique calling for objective evaluations with facts and numbers.

Yonhap News previously reported that HYBE’s audit allegedly found that Min had also accused boy groups TWS and RIIZE of copying NewJeans. Min denied this in her April press conference and went on to name-drop a lot of other groups while explaining the ways she felt ADOR and NewJeans have been wronged. She denied speculation that she had to do with the disbandment of Lil Uzi Vert’s ult K-pop group, GFRIEND, which was under the HYBE-acquired Source Music. She claimed that HYBE promised that the members of NewJeans would be HYBE’s first girl group, but that Source Music debuted Le Sserafim first in May 2022 instead. Min and HYBE have offered very different explanations for this decision. She has alleged that HYBE wanted to confuse the public into believing that Le Sserafim was her group, while HYBE has attributed the delay to corporate restructuring needed to fulfill her request to create the ADOR label.

Min suggested that Bang Si-hyuk was insecure about Le Sserafim’s competitive prospects, given the success of IVE (which, like Le Sserafim, includes two former IZ*ONE members). She also shared screenshots that allegedly show him asking if she thought she could “crush” the SM girl group Aespa. Finally, she distanced herself from comparisons to another messy industry situation: “I saw what happened to Fifty Fifty, I’m not dumb.”

For its part, HYBE brought up a few groups while hitting back against claims that it did not promote NewJeans enough. According to HYBE, its comms team distributed 273 press releases for NewJeans in 2023. In comparison, 365 were released for Pledis, which has four teams including boy band Seventeen. While stans of fromis_9 might not agree, HYBE maintained that it does its best to promote all of its artists.",vulture
https://indiewire.com,‘Warfare’ Boasts a Roster of Hollywood’s Rising Talent — Here’s Who They Play and What They’re Up to Next,https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/warfare-cast-who-they-play-where-next/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:00:28 GMT","After working together on the fictional, somewhat dystopian/somewhat familiar “Civil War,” filmmaker Alex Garland and Iraq War veteran Ray Mendoza have joined forces for an up-close-and-personal depiction of battle and the band of brothers who offer their lives to wage it. Their new film “Warfare” offers a real-time account of Mendoza’s platoon, a group of U.S. Navy Seals stationed in insurgent territory during 2006, and a conflict they were forced to engage in during their deployment.

“Warfare” features an all-star cast of Hollywood’s rising talent including D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai as Mendoza, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis, Joseph Quinn, and Charles Melton. In preparing for the project, the cast not only went through rigorous training, but lived with one another for the entire duration of the shoot.

Rather than the traditional red carpet premiere, Mendoza and Garland unveiled the film last week at the Hollywood America Legion Theater in Los Angeles to a crowd of mostly veterans and members of the military community, with representation from partners including Veterans In Media And Entertainment, Navy Seal Foundation, Warrior Heritage Foundation, Team Rubicon, Team RWB, Writers Guild Foundation — Veterans Writing Program, Screen Actors Guild Veterans Committee, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Space Force.

Addressing the crowd at the premiere, Garland said of how “Warfare” came to be, “It was based on memory. We had a handful of photographs that we got of the building, but aside from that, it was just interviews and it began with Ray and I sitting for a week and Ray just unloading everything he could remember. And then we spoke to as many people as we could. These guys opened up, never tried to make themselves look good, never tried to self-aggrandize, really dug it into themselves to try and say what really happened and what the truth was.”

Mendoza has wanted to tell this story for a long time, but didn’t understand how to until he started work on films like “Act of Valor” and “Lone Survivor.”

“When I first got out of the military, there was a lot going on with this event, and I didn’t understand how to describe it,” he said. “I didn’t have the vocabulary of the verbiage to convey it. I had to first understand what was physically going on and then just kind emotionally, spiritually, trying to figure out how to communicate.”

https://indiewire.com,Bill Skarsgård Took on His Role in ‘Locked’ Because It Was the ‘Polar Opposite’ of ‘Nosferatu’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/bill-skarsgard-locked-polar-opposite-nosferatu-1235110678/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:00:00 GMT","Bill Skarsgård may be gaining a reputation for enjoying transformative performances with roles like Pennywise in “It” and Count Orlok in “Nosferatu,” but like any other actor, he likes mixing things up too. Keeping it simple for his most recent outing, the close-quarters thriller “Locked” sees Skarsgård trapped and tortured inside the car of a sociopath played by Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins. Though his carjacker character is put through the ringer throughout the film, the part allowed him a nice change of pace from the various elements that went into making Robert Eggers’ “Nosferatu.”

“I was very happy because I had a bigger break than usual — four or five months, which I really needed in order to shake off Mr. Orlok,” Skarsgård said in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly. “But I read the script for ‘Locked’ around the tail end of ‘Nosferatu’ production. And there’s something about it that was so different from what I have been doing, and I often instinctively want to go somewhere that’s the polar opposite of my current project, just to keep challenging myself. And it’s more fun that way.”

Skarsgård told EW it was the “street weasel quality” of his character Eddie that drew him to the project, but the idea of performing alone was more of a challenge than an appeal.

“It was awkward being alone for so long. You’re like, ‘Ok, where do I look? The camera’s here, and I’m not looking at a person.’ All of Anthony’s dialogue is spoken through the car. And it got to the point where there’s some really intense stuff happening throughout the movie. You have to perform it. That’s not always easy.”

There were some scenes Hopkins had recorded his dialogue for, but other times, Skarsgård only had the Assistant Director to perform with. However, he did eventually get to share the screen with Hopkins for the perfect denouement to a complex shoot.

“When he did show up in person, that was one of the high points. That scene that we have together at the end was a joyous moment of production,” Skarsgård said to EW. “It ended up becoming very improvised. So he was improvising, I was improvising, and the scene just kind of became. To get to play and improvise with one of the greats was a special thing.”

In our review of the film, IndieWire’s Christian Zilko said, “A remake of the Argentine thriller ‘4×4,’ and often too cheesy for its own good, David Yarovesky’s two-hander stars Skarsgård as a small-time carjacker who picks the wrong self-driving vehicle to break into. He finds himself trapped and tortured over the phone by William (Hopkins), a dying man who is sick of petty crime. The film’s attempts at exploring morality might be underwhelming, but ‘Locked’ finds plenty of silly opportunities to exploit its gimmick of a premise, likely to the delight of anyone who willingly buys a ticket to a movie about Bill Skarsgård being locked in a car.”

https://indiewire.com,‘The Last of Us’ Star Bella Ramsey Thinks Their Neurodivergence Has ‘Helped’ with Their Acting,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/the-last-of-us-bella-ramsey-neurodivergence-1235110681/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 20:00:00 GMT","Having performed professionally now since they were 13 years-old, acting has become second-nature to the still relatively young talent, Bella Ramsey. Now co-lead of the hit HBO series “The Last of Us,” Ramsey has gotten more opportunities to hone their craft and in doing so, has only gotten to learn more about themself. In wake of the show’s success and their own rise to stardom, they were able to come out as non-binary. And now, ahead of the show’s Season 2 premiering next month, they’ve discussed the impact of being “diagnosed with autism” during the shooting of Season 1.

Speaking in an interview in British Vogue, Ramsey shared that a crew member with an autistic daughter noticed certain habits they were exhibiting that related to sensory issues and hyperawareness common with the diagnosis. Now that Ramsey has had formal assessments and knows more about their own neurodivergence, they have been able to embrace it wholeheartedly, especially when it comes to acting.

“I’ve always been watching and learning from people. Having to learn more manually how to socialize and interact with the people around me has helped me with acting” they said. Of the routine their career brings to their life and how it fits the way their mind works, they added, “I have a call time, and I’m told what to wear, how to stand, where to stand, and what to eat.”

As Ramsey puts it, this can be incredibly “freeing” when you’re neurodivergent and offers them a great deal of “grace” towards themselves. This diagnosis has also allowed them to further understand elements of their identity, but at the same time, they’re not interested in being thought of as just one thing.

“The label of being autistic has been so helpful to me because that’s helped me to understand myself,” said Ramsey, “but gender and sexuality-wise, labels do not feel comfy for me in any capacity, because I feel like I’m putting myself into a box. I feel trapped.”

Being one of the most famous talents in their age range has made it so that they can’t exactly avoid being in the “public eye” and while they do feel more comfortable once people are aware of their autism, they do wonder what it must feel like not to have to put themself out there, especially when it comes to exploring the more sensitive elements of their life.

“It does make me a bit sad that people who aren’t in the public eye can explore their gender identity or sexuality in private,” Ramsey told British Vogue. “That’s a privilege I don’t really get any more. If I did want to explore other things, like facets of my gender identity, that would be done publicly. As much as I would try and keep it private, if someone recognizes me on the street, say if I’m presenting differently, [and] takes a photo, then that is just talked about.”

Sure, Clooney had the looks, the charm, and a juicy part on the hit medical drama “E.R.” that gave him the opportunity to hone his craft, but in casting him to lead “Out of Sight,” and their most successful collaboration, “Ocean’s Eleven,” Soderbergh gave him a leg up few stars manage to receive today. Nowadays, it seems acting is a talent you have to be born with, and no one knows this better than recent Oscar-nominee Timothée Chalamet.

“It would appear Timothée Chalamet is a movie star,” said Soderbergh in a recent interview with Men’s Health. “Like, this guy can make movies hits, and they’re a wide range of movies. So, everybody’s chasing him. I don’t know him, but he seems to be making interesting choices.”

In discussing Chalamet, Soderbergh pointed out his draw goes beyond general appeal and speaks more to his deftness in taking on roles. Even someone like Clooney had to take on some stinkers before getting to have more control over the projects he’d agree to be a part of, but Soderbergh isn’t sure Chalamet has ever faced this problem or ever will.

“Even the stuff he’s got coming up sounds and looks interesting,” he said. “He seems to be pretty savvy about finding things that allow him to build out a range that people will accept, which is smart.”

While this is great for Chalamet, Soderbergh isn’t sure whether this has set an unhealthy expectation in the industry that young talent have to bring star power with them to a project instead of the project helping these actors rise in stature.

“It’s interesting to think about how you make a movie star now, because movies aren’t the same as they were 25 years ago,” Soderbergh told Men’s Health. “Leading men, or people who become stars, do so by getting opportunities and making good on them. A lot of the conversation now, if you talk to filmmakers in terms of casting, is using people who have already established themselves and who everybody’s chasing.”

Soderbergh empathizes with this new generation, especially considering there aren’t the same amount of options for work to cut their teeth on as there was when he and Clooney were coming up. However, in conversations he’s been have with Focus Features, A24, and Neon, he does get the sense that young people are starting to find their way into theaters, particularly if there is a director who’s work they’re really interested in seeing.

“That’s a really good sign. If that continues, they will identify certain performers as their favorites, and those people will become stars,” said Soderbergh. “But it’s a funny thing, because you can have somebody that for whatever reason can get you money, but in pure kind of financial ledger terms, and not necessarily someone you’d define as a movie star. Often, they can be somebody who has a rabid fan base in a different part of the world. The parlor game of trying to attract cast is always fascinating to me.”

The latest cast Soderbergh’s worked with for “Black Bag” includes Michael Fassbender, Cate Blanchett, Pierce Brosnan, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomi Harris, and Regé-Jean Page.

The weather shifts, the days grow longer, and fresh possibilities fill the air. A Hollywood satire starring A-listers? Shows with “mob” and “murder” in the title? What about a medical drama (another one)? A beloved romance? How about Jon Hamm and Ramy Youssef testing their voiceover talents — in narration and animation?

That’s what’s on deck for spring 2025. We say our final goodbyes (for now) to “Paradise” and “Severance” and “Yellowjackets,” wipe away our tears and lock back into our screens. As excited as IndieWire is for returning shows (the finales of “You” and “Andor” and more “The Last of Us” and “Poker Face” come to mind), we’re also thrilled to look ahead at the new titles and faces headed to streaming between now and June. From “Side Quest” and “Dying for Sex” to later entries like “Étoile” and “The Four Seasons,” spring’s TV offerings have something for everyone (especially if you’ve been aching to see Alexander Skarsgård as a robot).

https://indiewire.com,Dichen Lachman Expects Fans to Be ‘Pitching a Throuple Situation’ in Response to the ‘Severance’ Season 2 Finale,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/dichen-lachman-severance-fans-throuple-situation-1235110679/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Severance” Season 2, Episode 10, “Cold Harbor.”]

Oh “Severance” Season 2. We hardly knew you and yet here we are, obsessing over every detail of the finale and trying to figure out what it might mean for the recently confirmed Season 3. Previously, creator Dan Erickson has discussed the possibility of a workers strike playing a part in the show’s future, but star Dichen Lachman thinks fans will have more pressing interpersonal concerns for their favorite characters.

Speaking in a recent interview in the Los Angeles Times, Lachman believed that after the finale sees Mark’s innie choose Helly R. over his outie’s wife, many viewers might hope the writers find a way to maintain a dynamic between all three (or four or five or 29 depending on your perception of how severance works).

“I think people will be pitching a throuple situation maybe, where they can all live together,” said Lachman. “I certainly think [fans are] going to be very upset, but only because they’re so torn. They’ve fallen so much in love for Helly R., who’s just captured people’s hearts, but are so aware of Adam’s character being torn between thinking that his wife is gone, but ultimately she isn’t. It’s a real conundrum.”

Lachman may not be that far off, as even co-star Britt Lower was caught off-guard by the connection she had with the actress and her character as they shot the final scene.

“Helly R. seeing Gemma, Britt seeing Dichen’s performance on the other side of the door, was really affecting,” Lower told the LA Times. “That last moment where she’s seeing this heartbreaking thing happening across the hallway, my eyes were just drawn to Dichen. That was just something that happened on the day. I remember just being like, ‘I can’t take my eyes off her, even if I’m being pulled away.’ There’s a connection there.”

Lower went to explain that the moment is less about any romance between Helly and Gemma and more about “having empathy for an outie,” perhaps for the first time. Even as Mark S. and her are “running away like wild horses” and embracing the love they have for one another, there’s another thought running through Helly’s mind, which is “What’s next?”

Adam Scott viewed the scenario a bit differently. He told the LA Times that Mark S. knew “exactly what he’s going to do” once Helly appears in the hallway.

“He’s in love with Helly and can see the anguish from who he knows as Ms. Casey. But walking through that door may mean that he ceases to exist,” he said. “Walking into the [other] unknown, where you’re alive, first of all, but also, he gets to be with the person he’s in love with, I think that becomes the only choice for him.”

https://indiewire.com,‘One Piece’ Co-Showrunner Matt Owens Steps Away from Hit Series Citing Need to Focus on ‘Mental Health’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/one-piece-co-showrunner-steps-away-after-season-2-1235110659/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Looks like you can’t stay King of the Pirates forever. After being at the helm of the hit Netflix live adaptation of the popular manga and anime series “One Piece,” executive producer and co-showrunner Matt Owens announced in an Instagram post on Friday, March 21, that he would be leaving the series in order to address personal issues he’s currently facing.

“The 6 years working on the live action ‘One Piece’ has been a life changing journey. A dream come true. It’s also been A LOT,” Owens wrote in his post. “So I’m stepping off the Going Merry to take a break and focus on myself and my mental health.”

Development on the show began in 2017, with Netflix purchasing it in 2020 and bringing on Steven Maeda as showrunner in 2021. Owens was serving as head writer and executive producer on the project at the time, but given the title of co-showrunner in 2022 at the same time casting was announced. The first season dropped in August of 2023, but Season 2 was delayed as a result of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and didn’t complete production until December 2024. Joe Tracz joined Owens as co-showrunner for Season 2 after Maeda left following Season 1. While there is no official announcement, the WGA do have “One Piece” listed as being in production for Season 3, suggesting an oncoming renewal, though it’s unclear whether Owens leaving the show will upend these plans.

After thanking many involved in making the show happen, Owens said in his statement, “For now I’m gonna take a breath, do some therapy, try and rank up in ‘Marvel Rivals,’ and come back refreshed for the new adventures that await.”

Following the release of the first season, Maeda spoke to IndieWire about the challenges of bringing such a beloved manga to life, but a guiding light for him, Owens, and the rest of the team was capturing the magic of how “One Piece” made them feel.

“I knew there would be a lot of expectations, especially from the fans who are very protective and rightfully so,” Maeda said. “They don’t want their favorite manga to not be representative of the emotions they felt the first time they read it. I just wanted to faithfully keep all the fun and goofy moments while never giving emotion short shrift. That was the No. 1 goal: You want to be able to have both of those things co-exist.”

“One Piece” follows Monkey D. Luffy as he gathers a crew to seek out the One Piece treasure that will allow him to become King of the Pirates. It stars Iñaki Godoy as Luffy, Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, Jacob Romero Gibson as Usopp, and Taz Skylar as Sanji. The first season of the show spent eight weeks in Netflix’s Global Top 10, debuting at #1 in 46 countries.

“[Selena Gomez] & [Benny Blanco] I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDD,” Swift wrote on Instagram Stories, sharing a link to the album.

The 14-song record is Gomez’s first major musical release since her 2020 album “Rare.” While her fans are certainly pleased that the current queen of pop shared the project on social media, they’re also expressing frustration with other artists who are not showing support despite the fact Gomez has supported them in the past.

Prior to Swift’s glowing endorsement, one popular Gomez fan account posted to X, “No celebrity supporting Selena Gomez’s new album except Becky G. Not Even Taylor Swift.” The post has since been taken down.

Popular on Variety

Fans are also upset with Gomez’s label Interscope Records, saying that it has not properly promoted the project since its March 21 release.

“[Interscope Records] must really love losing money by not promoting one of their biggest artists,” wrote one fan on X.

Ahead of the album’s release, Spotify posted a teaser in the form of a one-on-one sitdown between Blanco and Gomez. The 33-minute conversation took listeners behind the writing process of “I Said I Love You First.”

“We’d get up in the morning and have a conversation. But our conversation was never led going, ‘What are we going to write in the album?’” Gomez said.

“I was constantly just writing whatever you said wherever we were,” Blanco added. “Sometimes, you’d be saying something really important, and I didn’t know if you even realized, but I would always open my phone and be like, ‘Fuck, that’s such a good line for a song.’”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Andrew Cuomo’s Exorbitantly Expensive Taxpayer-Funded Revenge Campaign,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/andrew-cuomo-taxpayer-funded-revenge-campaign-1235301494/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","The day Andrew Cuomo kicked off his campaign for mayor of New York City, his lawyer Rita Glavin was asked about Cuomo’s efforts to obtain the gynecological records of one of the women who came forward to share stories of the former New York governor’s sexual harassment before he resigned from office in 2021. The records, Glavin answered, were “absolutely pertinent, relevant, and if we get released from the confidentiality order, we can give you more details.”

The woman in question had dropped her legal effort months earlier, explaining that she was giving it up in the hope that Cuomo “can no longer use this lawsuit to harass me and my family.” Shortly after she dropped her suit, Cuomo threatened to sue her for defamation. (The woman did not respond to a request for comment, and her lawyer declined to share one.)

She is one of many women who are still paying, quite literally, for their decisions to speak out about the toxic workplace Cuomo fostered as governor. An investigation by New York State Attorney General Letitia James found that Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women while he was governor; the U.S. Department of Justice, meanwhile, concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 13. (Representatives for Cuomo have dismissed both investigations, with spokesman Rich Azzopardi calling the AG’s investigation “a purely political document,” and the DOJ’s report a “glorified press release” that “rubber-stamped the AG’s biased and inaccurate report.” Cuomo himself has apologized for having “acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable,” while strenuously denying the accusations against him. He has never been criminally prosecuted in connection with any of the complaints.)

Cuomo’s demand for the gynecological records, victims advocates say, is part of a pattern for the former governor and his lawyers, who they accuse of using the legal system to wage an exorbitantly expensive revenge campaign against the women who spoke out about his harassment. And the costs of that campaign — billed to New York taxpayers — continue to accrue as Cuomo pursues public office once again. Editor’s picks

According to the state comptroller’s office, in the four years since Cuomo resigned as governor, New York taxpayers have paid $60 million in legal expenses associated related to Cuomo’s conduct in office, including efforts to defend the former governor in lawsuits concerning his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, his book deal, and the sexual harassment accusations. The vast majority of that total — $46.9 million — is related to the investigation and litigation of the harassment claims. (That figure includes costs associated with the attorney general’s investigation as well as three separate lawsuits: Trooper 1 v Cuomo et al., Bennett v Cuomo et al., and Commisso v Cuomo et al.)

Because Cuomo was governor at the time of the sexual harassment complaints, both his legal defense and the defense of his deputies’ is covered by New York state. Typically, a state’s attorney general would provide that defense, but because New York’s attorney general led the investigation into Cuomo’s alleged harassment, her office recused itself from defending Cuomo not just in the sexual harassment suits but in almost all matters, and instead Cuomo has been allowed to retain private lawyers, paid for with state resources.

Ironically, the women who came forward to share their experiences of being harassed in the workplace — nine of whom were also employees of the state at the time — have not been afforded the same courtesy. They have been forced to hire and pay for their own lawyers to answer a battery of demands for discovery, subpoenas and depositions from Cuomo’s state-funded attorneys. Most of these women are not party to the lawsuits themselves; they’ve been called as witnesses, then saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills. Related Content

Advocates detailed the extraordinarily aggressive tactics employed by Cuomo’s lawyers in a letter to the comptroller’s office, which oversees payments to Cuomo’s lawyers. They include the request for the gynecologic records, which they say “serve[s] only to intimidate and humiliate… while driving up litigation costs,” and a litany of other discovery demands, including serving Verizon with a subpoena for all phone records of a witness not named in the litigation without any notice.

“The lack of sufficient oversight of reimbursements has enabled Mr. Cuomo to perpetuate the harassment of women he was already found to have harassed by multiple investigations, now through the legal system and at taxpayer expense,” Erica Vladimer, the director of Harassment Free New York, and Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, wrote in a letter to the comptroller, asking the office to pause payments to Cuomo’s lawyers and conduct a thorough audit of all payments that have been disbursed so far.

New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli responded, saying that his office has “denied payments we have found to be improper,” citing his office’s decision to reject Cuomo’s request to fund Cuomo’s Freedom of Information Law litigation against the attorney general. (Andrew Cuomo, he notes, is currently suing his office to force them to pay for that litigation as well; the matter is currently before the New York State Supreme Court.)

One woman who was swept up in Cuomo’s campaign tells Rolling Stone the experience has been “financially crippling for my family.” Another accuser, Lindsey Boylan, says she expects her bills to reach $2 million before the saga is over. “I’ve spent roughly $1.5 million” on lawyers so far, Boylan says, a figure that doesn’t include “hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of trauma therapy.”

Karen Hinton, who has spoken out about her experience with Cuomo when they worked at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the ‘90s, counts herself as lucky: She says her lawyer was able to convince the judge that her experience with Cuomo was so far in the past it wouldn’t be relevant to a lawsuit over his behavior as governor. (Cuomo’s team insists they ultimately opted not to take her deposition.) Even so, she says, her family “spent close to $45,000” on legal bills.

“There was sexual harassment, and now there’s just financial harassment,” Hinton says.

Hinton, Boylan and others have both also been the target of online harassment by trolls who, The New York Times has reported, were being directed by Cuomo’s sister. (“KH and LB need to be frightened into shutting up right now — Enough is enough,” Madeline Cuomo reportedly wrote, referring to Hinton and Boylan, who were later attacked online.)

“There are many reasons why he shouldn’t be mayor,” Hinton says. “But the one I’m talking about now is just this: He will retaliate and punish people. It’s not just a gender thing, and he does it for both men and women. And he’ll continue to do that as mayor. That is not a healthy way to run the city.”

In a statement to Rolling Stone, Glavin placed the blame for the soaring cost of litigation — to taxpayers and the women involved — at James’ feet. “The Attorney General bears direct responsibility for this entire mess,” Glavin said, citing what she deemed a costly and flawed investigation that, in her view, spawned a series of plaintiffs’ lawsuits.

“To avoid time-intensive discovery and obtain critical information for the defense, we… sought the evidence underlying the $14 million reports that taxpayers had already paid for, but the AG fought us in court, spending three years and millions more taxpayer dollars to hide the evidence. As a result, defense costs ballooned and non party witnesses were roped into the case,” Glavin said. “All of these decisions were outside of Governor Cuomo’s control.”

She added, “This is America, and anyone sued is entitled to due process and the right to defend themselves, particularly against demonstrably false allegations. All of this could have been avoided had the AG not created this $14 million mess in the first place — taxpayers should be demanding answers for that.”

Cuomo, meanwhile, has quickly emerged as the mayoral frontrunner in both polls and fundraising. In the first 13 days of his mayoral campaign, he took in $1.5 million — with his tax-payer funded lawyers among his biggest campaign boosters.

An invitation to a Cuomo camapaign fundraiser obtained by New York Focus, shows Elkan Abramowitz of Morvillo, Abramowitz, Grand, Iason & Anello — a law firm New York taxpayers have paid $2.8 million to defend Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic — hosted the event at his office. Abramowitz also gave a maximum $2,100 donation to Cuomo.

Glavin — who has been paid $5.7 million by the people of New York state to represent Cuomo — was also listed as a co-host of the fundraiser. She maxed out as well, donating $2,100 in support of his mayoral bid.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Amanda Seyfried Says ‘Jennifer’s Body’ Is “Perfect” But Marketing Team “Cheapened It”,https://deadline.com/2025/03/amanda-seyfried-jennifers-body-perfect-marketing-cheapened-1236347190/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 21:57:08 GMT","As Jennifer’s Body plots a resurrection, Amanda Seyfried still has nothing but praise for the original.

With the growing possibility of a sequel to the 2009 film, the Oscar nominee slammed the marketing team after they “cheapened” and “ruined” the Diablo Cody-written, Karyn Kusama-directed comedy horror that co-starred Megan Fox.

“I can’t critique this movie. To me, it’s perfect,” she told GQ. “It’s got balls. Diablo Cody was outspoken and beautiful and smart and funny. We were expressing a certain angst in a very specific, comedic way in a very specific genre. The special effects were so incredible, there were stunts, there was everything you could want.”

Watch on Deadline

Seyfried added, “If the critics criticize anything, it would be the marketing. The marketing sucked, it just did. And we all agree.”

Although the marketing team largely capitalized on Fox’s sex appeal in attempt to target a younger male demographic, Jennifer’s Body has since become a feminist cult classic for its intended audience.

“The marketing team cheapened it like it was just a gory romp. I think they ruined it, and I think Karyn and Diablo were a really good team,” said Seyfried. “I love Needy. It was the first time I got to play really nerdy, wearing the glasses. Megan got to turn into a demon, it was awesome. We all just had a lot of fun, so I wanna celebrate it by doing a sequel.”

After teasing a potential sequel earlier this month, Seyfried has hopes that Fox’s Jennifer can be resurrected after their bloody finale. “She’s kind of dead, right? But is she? I don’t think she is,” she said.

Cody previously recalled being “pretty humiliated” by the original’s critical and box office failure, telling Bloody Disgusting that the film’s growing cult fandom has given her renewed inspiration.

“I want to do a sequel. I am not done with Jennifer’s Body,” said Cody. “I just need to find…I need to partner with people who believe it in [sic] as much as I do and that hasn’t really happened yet. I need someone to believe in it who has a billion dollars.”",indiewire

March Madness underdog McNeese spent $1.72 million on men’s basketball last season. It will receive a $1 million buyout when head coach Will Wade leaves following the NCAA Tournament.

McNeese hired Wade in 2023, a year after he was abruptly fired by LSU on the eve of the tournament amid an NCAA investigation. He’s led the Cowboys to the NCAA Tournament in both seasons in Lake Charles, including an upset of Clemson in the first round on Thursday. Prior to that game, ESPN reported that he’d agreed to become the next head coach at North Carolina State when the Cowboys’ run ends.

Wade’s agreement with McNeese was both a lifeline and a stepping stone. The coach and school appear to have mutually understood that Wade was unlikely to be there for any length of time—athletic director Heath Schroyer told The Athletic that Wade promised him he’d stay for two years, which is exactly what the school ended up getting.

Sportico will be publishing daily stories about March Madness throughout the men’s and women’s tournaments. To receive them in your inbox daily, sign up here via Club Sportico.

Wade signed a new five-year contract in the middle of his first season at McNeese. His base salary in the deal is $700,000 per year, half paid by the school and half paid by the McNeese State University Foundation, according to a copy of the contract, obtained via records request. The agreement also included priced buyouts for what he would owe the school if he left in any of the first four years. That fee was $1.25 million in Year One, $1 million in Year Two, $500,000 in Year Three, and $350,000 in Year Four.

The $1 million buyout—which would have fallen to $500,000 if Schroyer had left before Wade—is more than half of the school’s men’s basketball budget.

“We had a two-year plan, [and] it’s been two years,” McNeese president Wade Rousse told The Athletic. “Now we have a full follow-up plan in place for what’s next. We’re ready.”

In addition to his base pay, Wade earned $10,000 this year for winning the Southland Conference regular season title, $30,000 for winning the league’s postseason tournament, $15,000 for being named the Southland Coach of the Year and $25,000 for winning an NCAA Tournament game. Each successive NCAA Tournament win will net him another $25,000.

McNeese has grabbed a number of headlines this week—not just for its upset and Wade’s employment future, but also thanks to the team’s student manager, Amir Khan, who went viral on social media and is now signing NIL deals.

The March Madness success is already paying dividends for the university, according to Wade.

“This is huge for our school,” he said following the Clemson win, before rattling off a series of statistics that weren’t immediately verifiable. “Our enrollment is up 3%, applications are up 10%. We got freaking $25 million in advertisements in the last couple of weeks. It’s going through the roof. … It changes everything.”

Bohemian Dream

Boho styles ruled the early 2010s. You know what they say — fashion is cyclical, and it was only a matter of time before the trend made its way back into the limelight. It’s time to embrace paisley patterns and flowing silhouettes again for spring 2025!

1. Crochet Galore: Evoke mother nature boho vibes in this pretty crocheted sweater from Ermonn. It works as a statement piece depending on the color you choose so you can keep the rest of your outfit simple. (AKA it transforms your everyday white tee and jeans into a boho fantasy).

2. Little Details: The dainty lace detailing featured throughout this Dokotoo top elevates the overall vibe, making it easy to dress up or down.

3. The Perfect Dress: No one does boho quite like Free People! This flowy floral number will become your spring and summer go-to.

Society Status

Picture the matriarchal society figures — Jackie Kennedy and even the fictional Emily Gilmore. Both of these ladies always looked polished and ready for the next luncheon or gala. This trend is quiet luxury upgraded. . . except we’re not being so quiet anymore.

5. Jackie O-Inspired: The first lady’s iconic fashions never go out of style, but they’re extra popular this spring. You’ll look very posh in this cropped tweed blazer.

6. You Mean Business: You’ll walk with extra confidence — whether you’re going to an important meeting or out to brunch with friends — when you wear these ultra-flattering palazzo pants. The hidden elastic waistband keeps you comfortable, too!

7. A Touch of Elegance: There’s something about a pearl necklace that pulls any outfit together. You’ll love this Faux Pearl Collar design so much, you might just wear it daily!

8, A Society Staple: Kitten heels look naturally refined — plus they won’t hurt your feet like stilettos. Vince’s slingback pair blends classic elements with trendy mesh, bringing the style into the 21st century.

Pistachio Pop

At least one pastel color is labeled the ‘it’ spring color every year. In 2025, it happens to be pistachio green. The pale green pairs beautifully with all skin tones, and we found some wow-worthy picks.

9. Upgrade Your Tee: White and black tees will always be necessities, but why not add this pale green alternative to your collection this spring?

12. A Touch of Green: Pistachio doesn’t have to be the main attraction in your outfit. For example, wearing these Marc Fisher block heels will also make your look feel spring-appropriate.

Extra Accessories

Fashion is fun! Instead of looking sleek all the time, don’t be afraid to incorporate quirky aspects into your outfit, like kitschy silhouettes and bright colors.

13. Choices, Choices: Why own one pair of sunglasses when you could have four for the price of one? This pack gives you a solid variety so you can find one that perfectly matches your outfit.

14. Fruity Tutti: It’s time to add some personality to your outfits, and these cherry earrings are a mix of fun and dainty. You’ll score tons of compliments when you wear them!

Kelce has been enjoying his time off since the Super Bowl, which saw the Eagles defeat the Chiefs in a 40-22 loss on February 9 in the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Kelce and the Chiefs quarterback are currently in their offseason until training camp kicks off in the summer.

“I know he still has love for the game,” Mahomes continued. “He’ll get to spend some time with his family and make that decision on his own, but he knows he’ll come back here with open arms.”

The Chiefs tight end was spotted out in New York City with girlfriend Taylor Swift on March 14 for a private dinner date at Del Frisco’s Grille at Brookfield Place. Swift, 35, for her part, has been on a break of her own after the conclusion of her history-making, two-year Eras Tour in December 2024.

“I am fabulous. I’m better than good, but have been accused to being otherwise,” she told the outlet. “I am very much alive. I deserve freedom, darling.”

When asked about the guardianship she’s been held under since 2022, Williams directed the outlet to her advocate, Ginalisa Monterroso.

“You guys have been asking me for years if I’ve heard from Wendy, and what I’m doing to help Wendy,” Bass said in a video shared via Instagram on February 28.

“I’m gonna be honest,” she continued, “I hadn’t heard from Wendy in years until last week. My phone rang, and it was Wendy. I cried, she cried, Brendan cried, Jack was home, my oldest, he didn’t cry, but he said I had to work.”

Williams “sounds fantastic,” Bass continued, adding that the former TV host “sounds the best she has sounded in years.”

Bass also said she’s been learning about the circumstances surrounding Williams’ guardianship “every day.”

Williams was all smiles when she was spotted at Miami International Airport on February 15, while coasting through the airport on a motorized scooter. A source close to the former talk show host told Us exclusively in January that she was doing much better amid her health issues.

“She’s still Wendy,” the source told Us at the time. “Her conversations are just as rhythmic and her mindset is open.”

“Three years ago, I tried Wegovy,” Schumer, 43, said in a video shared via Instagram on Friday, March 21. “I was puking, I couldn’t handle it. I don’t know if they’ve changed the formula, whatever. But anyway, I went on this Telehealth meeting with Midi Health, and it was cheap. I wanted to try it myself ‘cause I wanted to recommend it to my friends who are nurses and teachers.”

Midi Health, per the official website, is a virtual care clinic specializing in the treatment of menopause and perimenopause.

“They put me on estrogen and progesterone because I realized I was in perimenopause and my symptoms from being perimenopause have disappeared,” Schumer said. “My hair is fuller, my skin is better, I have more energy, I want to get down more, if you know what I mean. I’m talking about sex. So that’s been great and Mounjaro’s been great.”

According to WebMD, while Mounjaro is similar to other drugs such as Wegovy or Ozempic in that they all contain GLP-1 that assist in weight loss, Mounjaro is specifically designed to help diabetes patients with weight management. Common side effects of these drugs can include nausea and diarrhea.

“And, look, it’s not covered by insurance unless you have diabetes or like severe obesity, which most of the internet thinks I have,” Schumer said of Mounjaro. “But I’m having a really good experience with it and I wanted to keep it real with you about that.”

She concluded, “Midi Health. I liked it so much and I had such a good experience [that] I invested in the company.”

Like Schumer, the drug has also been used by other celebrities such as Scott Disick, Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Gaffigan. “I was so paranoid that I was going to be nauseous that I kind of put it off, but then it kind of worked,” Gaffigan, 58, exclusively told Us Weekly in November 2024.

Teigen was the original number-12 briefcase model when the popular game show launched in 2005. On Friday, March 21, Deal or No Deal Island host Joe Manganiello announced that Teigen will return to the series, but this time around she is replacing Howie Mandel as the show’s banker.

Teigen, who is a fan of the first season of the show, told Entertainment Weekly during filming for the show’s finale that there are several reasons why she was open to coming on board as season 2’s banker.

“My history with the show, obviously, NBC is family in our house, coming to Panama with my friends,” Teigen said.“I love the show! “I watched the first season — riveting, amazing, incredible. I’m a TV junkie. I was addicted from the first episode.”

Teigen also acknowledged her past with the show. “It was one of my first jobs in entertainment ever. And I really learned so much,” she explained. “It was my first time on a big stage and just having an [earpiece], all the little things — it’s what started everything. And I got to work with really incredible women that I saw, I really looked up to, and they were just so good at what they did.”

In fact, she added, the show really shaped her entire relationship with the entertainment industry in general.

In a 2018 interview with the Mail on Sunday, Teigen revealed that she formerly shared the Deal or No Deal stage with none other than Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex. Both women were briefcase models around the same time.

Teigen told the outlet she is “especially a fan of Meghan.”

“I was on Deal or No Deal with her and she was lovely,” Teigen said, before adding that plenty of people ask her questions about what the Duchess of Sussex is like.

“Now everyone asks me what she was like and I say, ‘Sorry, no dirt.’ She’s gorgeous,” she explained.

Teigen also previously called out Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, for comments he made about the Duke and Duchess. “Meghan was apparently upset with me for saying that she and Harry will probably have a baby soon,” Markle told the Mail on Sunday in July 2018. “But Meghan’s been saying that herself for the past six or seven years, talking about how much she wants a family. [Prince] Harry’s been saying it too.”

Teigen was quick to defend her former castmate. “This guy … This guy sucks,” Teigen tweeted in response. “What is wrong with him? Let your daughter be happy, please. This is embarrassing.”",usmagazine

“When I told the girls that Baloo was going to leave us, Ellie asked where he was going,” Kylie, 32, wrote via Instagram on Saturday, March 22. “I told her that he was going to heaven and without skipping a beat she replied, ‘Oh! He’ll get to be with Winnie again! They’ll be so happy to see each other!’”

Jason, 37, and Kylie have been married since 2018 and share daughters Wyatt, 5, Ellie, 3, and Bennett, 2, and are currently expecting again. The Kelces’ other family dog, Winnie, died last year.

“We were lucky enough to have 7 years with the goofiest, sweetest, most lovable, and tolerant dog I’ve ever met,” Kylie added on Saturday. “He wanted nothing more than carbs and pets. He was a simple guy, held together by bubble gum and paper clips.”

She continued, “The heartbreak is immense, but as Ellie so perfectly pointed out, the Winnie-Bubba reunion had to be pure magic. Miss you already Bubbies.”

Jason and Kylie had adopted both of their Irish Wolfhounds before welcoming Wyatt. On a February appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, Kylie joked that her firstborn considered Winnie to be more like an older sibling.

“We were talking about me carrying a baby right now and she was like, ‘Well, you had a baby before me,’” Kylie recalled to podcaster Alex Cooper, referring to her latest pregnancy. “I was like, ‘Excuse me?’ She was like, ‘Winnie,’ because I’ve called Winnie my firstborn child so many times that my oldest daughter thinks that I carried the Irish Wolfhound in my womb.”

Kylie had announced via Instagram in March 2024 that Winnie had died.

“When I was in high school I had a folder on my desktop labeled ‘Gods gift to earth.’ It was images of Irish Wolfhounds that I had collected from Google. I had fallen in love with the breed when I was a young and never let my fascination with them fade,” Kylie wrote via Instagram at the time. “It all led me to Winnie and holy shit did she live up to the hype. She was everything I had hoped for in a wolfie and more.”

“Oh, man, dogs are going crazy,” he said during a September 2024 episode when Baloo’s barking interrupted an episode. “I think that must mean Ky is back with the kids.”

The Prince of Wales visited British troops stationed in Estonia on Friday, March 21, in an effort to emphasize the country’s support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) operations in the region.

William visited the Tapa military camp, located just over 120 miles from Estonia’s border with Russia. The Prince of Wales was photographed speaking to troops, inspecting military vehicles and even riding on a tank while dressed in fatigues.

The trip was the heir to the throne’s first to the country. He visited with the Mercian Regiment, the group of soldiers he leads as Commander-in-Chief. Approximately 900 British troops are stationed at the camp.

What I love is the Ukrainian resilience is everywhere. You are all very smiley and very strong and very spiritual people. And honestly, that comes across everywhere.”

The Prince of Wales served in the UK military for nearly eight years full-time after he graduated from the University of St. Andrews and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a British Army officer in December 2006, and later joined the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals) as a second lieutenant.

Prison inmate Charles Miles gave notorious wife-killer Scott Peterson a beating behind bars earlier this month ... and now he's sharing his side of the story.

In an exclusive preview clip obtained by TMZ, Charles tells Court TV via phone call he went into ""attack mode"" after Scott rammed into him during a game of pickleball. He says Scott ""aggressively"" sprinted at him with his paddle in hand --allegedly to chase the ball -- and made no effort to avoid him.

This pissed Charles off, who says he ""beat him down to the ground"" and ""beat the hell out of him."" Charles says there was a bit of a struggle, but once he overpowered Scott, he climbed on him and started pounding him.

Despite the fight ... it seems like Charles and Scott are A-Okay with one another. Charles confirms to Court TV they spoke about the brawl the next day to clear things up.

He says he felt it was in his best interest to be on good terms with Scott considering how much money he has ... meaning he could pay fellow inmates to gang up on him.

Believe it or not ... Charles even says he and Scott talked it out for about two hours together directly after the altercation. That is, from isolated cells a few spots down for each other.

Charles claims he even apologized -- saying a ""primal urge"" was triggered when he saw Scott coming at him full speed ... adding that his anger was intensified over him being a convicted woman and baby killer.

He says Scott tried convincing him of his innocence ... which he has maintained ever since his wife, Laci, was found headless in the San Francisco Bay more than 20 years ago. Their unborn child was separated from Laci when their bodies were found.

Well, that side-eye might’ve been aimed at Amanda Seyfried!

Amanda appears to have indirectly spilled the tea on the ""Happy Sad Confused"" podcast this week -- we already knew she auditioned for the role of Glinda, but here’s the kicker -- she says she actually sang alongside Cynthia in auditions before Ariana Grande landed the role.

Cool moment for Amanda, sure -- but let’s rewind to November when Cynthia told the New York Times that Ariana landing the role was no shocker, adding, ""Thank goodness, because it was not the two ladies that I was auditioning with.""

Cynthia never named the two actresses she auditioned with, but it sounds like Amanda might've been one of them ... based on Amanda's new comments about the audition process.

That said, it seems Amanda either missed the shade or hasn’t caught on yet -- because she’s still reminiscing about the experience with nothing but fond memories!",tmz

The comedian says in a statement to Page Six he ""used poor judgment"" in the past and has therefore ""violated the trust of the people"" he loves ... but is confident anyone who knows him knows he ""wouldn’t assault anyone.""

He adds, ""Working on myself is an ongoing process, and I am now going to take some time away from the public eye to focus my energies where I need to.""

Joe notably left the popular truTV series in January 2022 over ""some issues"" in his personal life ... and simultaneously announced his separation from his wife of nearly a decade, Bessy Gatto. They reconciled in 2023.

TikTok user joozyb accused Joe of sexually assaulting her just after he got back together with Bessy in a series of TikTok videos she began sharing Thursday.

She claims their first interaction occurred when she and her mother saw him at a brunch and asked for a photo. After that, she says she DMd him in hopes of snagging free tickets to his Milwaukee show at the Pabst Theater.

Joe indeed had a show at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee on Sept. 8, 2023, according to a website for shows in the area. Joozyb says he granted her two tickets with meet-and-greet access.

After the meet-and-greet, she alleges she and the reality star spoke again via Instagram direct messages ... and that's when Joe gave her directions to his hotel room.

The TikToker admits to being drunk and agreeing to meet him, which is when the alleged assault allegedly occurred. While she has not gone into detail, she claims ""some stuff happened"" ... and even posted a photo of her bruised butt -- which she says Joe allegedly caused with his teeth.

The user says Joe used ""vanish mode"" on their DMs, meaning they disappear once the conversation is exited. However, she shared an image she allegedly took from inside the unnamed hotel after the assault. The alleged metadata shows the messages were sent hours after the Milwaukee show.",tmz

Former “Impractical Jokers” star Joe Gatto is shutting down a TikTok user’s claims that he sexually assaulted her when she was 19 years old — but admits he didn’t make good decisions.

“I have used poor judgment and as a result have violated the trust of the people I love most,” the comedian tells Page Six exclusively on Saturday.

“But anyone who knows me at all knows full well that I wouldn’t assault anyone.”

Gatto, 48, added, “Working on myself is an ongoing process, and I am now going to take some time away from the public eye to focus my energies where I need to.”

The woman, who goes by joozyb on TikTok, first made her allegations public on Friday.

“I got sexually assaulted by Joe Gatto, the ‘Impractical Joker,'” she claimed in a video posted on the social media platform.

She claimed the incident took place in a hotel after she met the comic at one of his shows in Milwaukee in September 2023 — when he had just “gotten back together with his wife.”

The TikTok user did not go into great detail about what allegedly occurred between her and Gatto during the alleged assault. She claimed, however, that “some stuff happened.”

As evidence of them meeting, the woman provided screenshots of a DM exchange via Instagram in which the “Mystery Index” alum allegedly said he left “two meet and greet passes” for her at the box office.

She also featured in her video a picture of her and her sister posing with Gatto backstage.

The TikTok user alleged that after the show, they continued to communicate, claiming, “I was drunk, whatever, and he was texting me all this stuff. And, like, it was starting to get a little weird, you know.”

She claimed that Gatto then put their DMs into vanish mode, which conceals their messages, and he then provided her with information on where he was spending the night.

The woman concluded, “I’ve been wanting to tell people this for so long.

“I’ve like, tried in different ways, but it’s hard with somebody this big. [I’ve] come to the realization that if I do say something, that I’m really saying something.”

Page Six has reached out to her for more information but did not immediately hear back.

Gatto has gone through a series of personal challenges in recent years. He left “Impractical Jokers” in 2021 after 10 years on the prank show to work on his family life following his split from his wife.

“Alongside my friends, I’ve devoted a decade of my life to building this franchise and couldn’t be prouder of what has been accomplished,” he said in a statement on Instagram at the time.

“However, due to some issues in my personal life, I have to step away. Bessy and I have decided to amicably part ways, so now I need to focus on being the best father and co-parent to our two incredible kids.”

Gatto then shared in September 2023 that he and his wife, Bessy Gatto, had decided to reconcile. The couple shares two children: Milana and Remington “Remo.”",tmz

He also shared a smiling throwback pic of himself as a child, along with one of his son Jack chilling on a blanket, watching a movie on a projector -- so it seemed like the point of him sorting through his anger was for his son, who he shares with wife Hailey Bieber.

An upstate New York high school girls’ basketball coach has been canned after he yanked a player’s hair following their team’s loss on Friday -- an appalling moment was caught on camera.

As you can see, Northville High School player Hailey Monroe was already in tears after the game, but to add insult to injury 81-year-old coach Jim Zullo appeared to viciously yanked her back by her ponytail.

In the upsetting moment -- Monroe tried to pull away as another player appeared to tell Zullo to stop, but the coach was seen berating her, wagging his finger in her face and screaming at her.

WRGB reports that Monroe, the high school senior and all-time leading scorer, had fouled out of the game before the shocking incident unfolded.

Zullo tried to defend himself ... telling NEWS10 ABC that Monroe allegedly swore at him after he told her to shake hands with the other team, and that’s when things went south.

The Northville Central School District released a statement saying they expect the highest standards of professionalism and sportsmanship from their coaches, and Zullo’s behavior was totally unacceptable.

They made it clear he’s done not just at the school but in the whole district, and they’ll be offering support to the players and their families affected by the incident.",tmz

This is almost too outrageous to process ... Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said proudly and loudly ... if his 94-year-old mother-in-law didn't get her monthly Social Security check, she would just wait for it to come the next month, and anyone who would dare complain they didn't get their check is a criminal.

Lutnick's mother-in-law shouldn't worry ... after all, her son-in-law is worth north of $800 million. But hey, for someone who lives check to check -- well, screw 'em.

Lutnick says anyone who loudly complains they didn't get their check is a fraudster. In fact, he likes the idea of actually withholding checks because he thinks it will root out those criminals. Seriously, watch the video.

Of course, some people who don't get their checks will go without food, or medication, and may well die. But them's the breaks, according to Lutnick.

Thing is ... Lutnick is actually intimidating people who don't get their Social Security checks -- intimidating them into silence, for fear if they speak up they'll be arrested for fraud. So if you're starving or just plain dying, well, don't bitch to someone who's supposed to care.

BTW ... as if it can't get worse, the Trump administration is closing down Social Security offices all over the country, and they want to make it harder for people with grievances to get their checks. There's a plan to make recipients appear in person at the remaining Social Security offices to correct problems -- the phone will no longer be an option.",tmz
