Energy secretary Ed Miliband has ordered the National Energy System Operator to “urgently investigate” the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday.

He is working with Ofgem and using powers under the Energy Act to formally launch the grid operator’s investigation.

“We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned,” Miliband said.

“That is why, working with Ofgem, I have today commissioned the National Energy System Operator to carry out an investigation into this specific incident and to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future.

“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow.”

The National Energy System Operator (Neso) is expected to report to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and Ofgem with initial findings within six weeks.

Heathrow fire

Flights resumed at the west London airport on Friday evening and restrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted after hours of closure.

A blaze knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes the previous evening.

Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police initially led the investigation, but the force has confirmed the fire is believed to be non-suspicious, so London Fire Brigade is now leading the probe which will focus on the electrical distribution equipment.

Heathrow said it has added 50 slots to Saturday’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.

A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today.

“Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday’s outage at an off-airport power substation.

“We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.

“Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight.”

The airport later added that all terminals and all car parks are open.

‘Significant disruption’

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said: “This incident caused significant disruption but Heathrow, National Grid, and our emergency services have worked swiftly to get people travelling again.

“Heathrow is a massive airport that uses the energy of a small city, so it’s imperative we identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong.

“Whilst Heathrow is back to business, some disruption is expected over coming days as things get back to normal so I encourage anyone travelling to check with their airlines and plan their journeys.”

Akshay Kaul, director general for infrastructure at Ofgem, said: “We saw yesterday the huge disruption that comes when energy supply is disrupted, and it’s important we now understand how that happened.

“Households and businesses should be able to have confidence in the resilience of critical national infrastructure, and Ofgem will work with the government and others to ensure Neso’s review goes as far as possible to ensure steps are put in place to avoid any repeat of an incident of this scale in the future.

“To the extent the review finds any breaches of standards or licence obligations, we will not hesitate to take action.”

Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye welcomed the investigation, adding: “We will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday’s off-airport incident and we are committed to working closely with all stakeholders to ensure a thorough investigation to help strengthen the airport’s future resilience.”

BA, which has a major presence at Heathrow, said it expects to operate around 85 per cent of its scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday.

The airline would usually expect to run nearly 600 departures and arrivals on Saturday but it is understood some cancellations will be made, where possible to high-frequency routes.

Cassandre Beaugrand is among the entrants for the T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup in Lievin tonight

You’ve heard about the four-minute mile, but what about the 10-minute triathlon? That’s the order of the day tonight in Lievin, northern France, where the first T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup is due to take place.

The short-course event consists of a 200m swim, 2.8km cycle and 1km run and, uniquely, all takes place in the same arena near Lille. More than 100 elite male and female triathletes are set to take part, with the fastest expected to finish inside 10 minutes.

Part of the Lievin Triathlon Indoor Festival, it took place last year as the World Triathlon Indoor Cup but has now been rebranded as a T1 event in collaboration with the Professional Triathletes’ Organisation (PTO), which runs the T100 tour.

That also means it will be available to watch on TNT Sports in the UK, thanks to the PTO’s close relationship with Warner Bros Discovery. The broadcaster is a minority shareholder in the organisation and televises its T100 events.

Athletes scheduled to take part in Lievin include Olympic champion and home favourite Cassandre Beaugrand and New Zealander Hayden Wilde, who was pipped to gold in Paris last summer by Britain’s Alex Yee.

“The fact that the Lievin event has achieved so much momentum in such a short space of time is testament to the electrifying atmosphere and excitement it creates, both in the stadium and for those watching at home,” said World Triathlon president-elect Antonio F Arimany.

“The broadcast product this year will be the best yet and the TV audience the biggest, with the fans’ favourite and Olympic champion Cassandre Beaugrand ready to raise the roof.

“The future for this enthralling format looks incredibly bright as we continue to develop our partnership with PTO.”

The T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup is held in a single arena in Lievin, France

What is the T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup format?

The competition format is the same for both men and women, with five heats followed by a repechage deciding which 36 athletes advance to the semi-finals.

In the three semi-finals, the top four qualify for Final A while those finishing fifth to eighth go into Final B, which decides who finishes in places 13-24 in the final standings.

The event comes a fortnight before the first leg of the T100 Triathlon World Tour season in Singapore, and days after a $10m investment by niche fund Cordillera.

The T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup is live on TNT Sports 4 from 8:30pm. It will also be shown on the PTO’s T100 YouTube channel and PTO+.",cityam

CitizenM Gare de Lyon breaks every Paris hotel rule, but it’s one of the most memorable stays in the city, writes Anna Moloney

When thinking of Paris, CitizenM Gare de Lyon, a hulking grey block tower that protrudes over the Seine, is not likely the image that comes to mind. But don’t count it out. Sitting in the sweet spot of ‘affordable luxury’, CitizenM is a new breed of hotel that provides all the comforts you actually want – good sleep, good shower, good service – and leaves the excitement for the city. After all, swirled balconies on pretty white town houses are ten a penny in Paris.

“When I’m in Paris I go to the Eiffel Tower because it’s only when I’m there that I can’t see the damned thing” William Morris on the benefits of being in ugly buildings

THE CONCEPT

CitizenM is certainly quirky. On arrival, you’ll be greeted not by a concierge, but a screen with which to check yourself in. From here you’ll be assigned a room, printed a key and sent on your way by the elusive, faceless voice of ‘CitizenM’, who authors all communication in the hotel. CitizenM says: howdy Citizen Anna. CitizenM says: go to your room. CitizenM says: time to wake up. Citizen Anna thinks CitizenM is a bit bossy, but she can’t deny he’s a good host.

Citizen isn’t no frills, it’s just very select frills. There’s food and drink available 24/7, for example, but in a serve yourself canteen-style rather than in a restaurant. There’s no concierge falling over themselves to assist you, but the lobby is sociable and inviting, with sofas and coffee tables; useful for getting some work done if needed. Its vibe is a bit ‘luxury communism’, and I was into it.

THE ROOM

Every room at CitizenM is exactly the same – that’s anywhere around the world – which means a happy farewell to choice fatigue. When you check in, you’ll be asked (by virtual CitizenM) what view you prefer, which at Gare du Lyon consists of a choice between grey-build street vs different grey-build street – follow your heart.

As mentioned, this isn’t a destination hotel, and that’s by design. CitizenM co-founder Michael Levie said he felt the days where people would travel to be inspired by hotels themselves were long gone. Instead, CitizenM specialises in spaces that feel comforting, but not so much that you don’t want to leave. After all, you’ve got the whole of Paris to explore.

The rooms are small, plush and perfectly formed. Cosy yet utilitarian: big squishy beds, blackout blinds, a waterfall shower plus an iPad to control the lights and temperature. The iPad also allows you to programme an alarm, which coordinates your lights, blinds and music for a main character wakeup.

WHAT TO DO

Just five minutes from the metro and 25 minutes from the Eurostar, you are well situated to get anywhere in the city, but there are also sights worth exploring on your doorstep. Steal a croissant from the breakfast buffet and head for a scenic stroll at the Coulee Verte, aka the Promenade Plantee, a former railway line turned garden walk which inspired New York’s High Line.

Alternatively, head 30 minutes down the river and you’re at the newly madeover Notre Dame for your fix of culture. I was staying in Paris alone and ducked into the historic Le Caveau de la Huchette, a sexy, sweaty underground jazz bar featured in films from Funny Face to La La Land, which is great for both dancing and people watching. Strolling back by the moonlit river, I felt more than sufficiently dosed up on Parisian romance to climb happily back into my spaceman cave. Who needs balustrades?

https://cityam.com,Chancellor rules out ‘tax and spend’ policies ahead of spring statement,https://www.cityam.com/chancellor-rules-out-tax-and-spend-policies-ahead-of-spring-statement/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:24:10 GMT","Chancellor rules out ‘tax and spend’ policies ahead of spring statement

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has ruled out “tax and spend” policies ahead of her spring statement next week.

The Chancellor has ruled out “tax and spend” policies ahead of her spring statement next week.

Rachel Reeves is under pressure to increase taxes or cut spending to meet the financial rules she set at the budget in October amid disappointing growth figures and higher-than-expected borrowing.

Figures released on Friday came as a further blow, showing that government borrowing had soared past forecasts in February.

She signalled that she would neither raise taxes nor government budgets in an interview with the BBC.

“We can’t tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That’s not available in the world we live in today,” she said.

The defence budget has already been boosted by slashing spending on aid, and sweeping cuts to welfare were announced this week.

OBR forecasts

When she delivers her spring statement on Wednesday, Reeves will be responding to new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) made after the Bank of England reduced its forecasts for growth this year.

Public sector net borrowing was £10.7bn in February, £4.2bn more than had been forecast by the OBR.

Former Labour work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett has urged the Chancellor to loosen her fiscal rules.

Read more Chancellor facing £10bn headache in Spring Statement

“I would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules, this is Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst,” he told BBC Radio 4’s the Week in Westminster.

“I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least £10-15bn and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in ‘97 with the new deal for the unemployed.”

Chancellor scrutiny

Treasury minister Darren Jones denied the government was “blindly cutting spending” and moving towards austerity earlier this week.

Government departments have been asked to go through their spending line by line.

Experts estimate that around a million people in England and Wales will lose their disability benefits as part of a welfare overhaul that the government believes will save more than £5bn a year by the end of the decade.

Reeves told the BBC: “I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I’m doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny.

“I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers’ money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people is properly scrutinised. That’s part of the job.”

Heathrow Airport, British Airways Airbus A380 come in to land,

Heathrow Airport said it is “open and fully operational” on Saturday after the airport was shut over a loss of power caused by a substation fire.

Flights resumed at the west London airport on Friday evening and restrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted following hours of closure, after a blaze knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes late on Thursday evening.

The Metropolitan Police are not treating the incident as suspicious and the London Fire Brigade’s investigation is focusing on the electrical distribution equipment.

Heathrow also said it has added 50 slots to Saturday’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.

A statement from Heathrow says flights have officially resumed and advised passengers to contact their airlines if they are due to fly on Saturday.

The statement, posted to X, says: “Flights have resumed at Heathrow following yesterday’s power outage.

“If you’re due to travel today, we advise you to still contact your airline for your latest flight information before heading to the airport.

“We apologise for the disruption and appreciate your patience whilst operations return to normal.”

Heathrow reopened

A further statement from Heathrow said the airport was “open and fully operational”. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today.

“Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday’s outage at an off-airport power substation.

“We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.

“Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight.”

The airport later added that all terminals and all car parks are open. Firefighters and workers were still at the electricity substation on Saturday morning.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander posted on X: “Good to see Heathrow Airport return to full operations this morning. Passengers should continue to check with their airline before travelling.”

‘Fantastic’ response

An American tourist has praised his airline’s and Heathrow’s “fantastic” response to a fire that closed the transport hub on Friday.

Speaking at Heathrow, Tim Kolb, who travelled to the UK on holiday from Dallas, Texas, told the PA news agency: “I was just getting ready to board the plane on Thursday night, and the news actually started coming across on our phones quicker than on the (airport) desk.

“But American Airlines did a fabulous job – we didn’t have to wait in the line or anything. They got us our accommodation reservation.”

Kolb, 55, added: “I thought I was going to be there (Dallas) delayed two days, but I went over yesterday. It was organised well.

“In fact, they had several planes leaving within an hour of each other to Heathrow. The way everybody responded and fell into action, it was fantastic.”

According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, British Airways (BA) flight BA56 from Johannesburg, South Africa was the first regular passenger flight to land at Heathrow since Thursday evening, touching down at 4.37am.

BA, which has a major presence at Heathrow, said it expects to operate around 85% of its scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday.

Read more Heathrow Airport to restart some flights following fire

The airline would usually expect to run nearly 600 departures and arrivals on Saturday but it is understood cancellations will be made, where possible, to high-frequency routes.

Continued delays

A spokesman said: “We are planning to operate as many flights as possible to and from Heathrow on Saturday, but to recover an operation of our size after such a significant incident is extremely complex.

“We expect around 85 per cent of our Saturday Heathrow schedule to run, but it is likely that all travelling customers will experience delays as we continue to navigate the challenges posed by Friday’s power outage at the airport.”

Restrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, the Department of Transport (DfT) said.

According to Heathrow’s website, there is no formal ban on night flights but, since the 1960s, the government has placed restrictions on them.

There is an annual limit of 5,800 night-time take-offs and landings between the hours of 11.30pm and 6am as well as a nightly limit, which caps the amount of noise the airport can make at night.

Of the power outage, Heathrow Airport’s chief executive Thomas Woldbye said a back-up transformer failed, meaning systems had to be closed down in accordance with safety procedures so that power supplies could be restructured from two remaining substations to restore enough electricity to power what is described as a “mid-sized city”.

He apologised to stranded passengers and defended the airport’s response to the situation, saying the incident is as “as big as it gets for our airport” and that “we cannot guard ourselves 100 per cent”.

After announcing early on Friday it would be closed until 11.59pm, Heathrow later reopened with a focus on repatriation flights for passengers diverted to other airports in Europe.

Following that announcement, several airlines said they would restart scheduled flights both to and from Heathrow, including British Airways, Air Canada and United Airlines.

Busiest airport

Around 200,000 passengers have been affected by the closure of what is Europe’s busiest airport.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said she was in close contact with the Energy Secretary, the Home Secretary and with Heathrow to “make sure that any lessons we need to learn from the systems that the airport has in place are learned”.

Some 120 aircraft heading to the airport on Thursday evening at the time of the incident were forced to either divert or return to their point of origin, which saw passengers on Qantas flights to Heathrow from Singapore and Perth divert to Paris before taking buses to London.

Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police have been leading the investigation into the cause of the fire, which did not result in any casualties at the scene.

“After initial assessment, we are not treating this incident as suspicious, although inquiries do remain ongoing,” Commander Simon Messinger said.

Thousands of homes were left without power and more than 100 people were evacuated after a transformer within the substation caught fire.

Heathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9m passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024.

This is believed to be the worst disruption at Heathrow since December 2010, when thousands of Christmas getaway passengers camped in the terminals because of widespread cancellations caused by snow.

In April of that year, air travel was grounded across Europe because of an ash cloud caused by an Icelandic volcanic eruption.

Western military planning to enforce a potential ceasefire in Ukraine is set to intensify in London next week as No10 said “nothing is off the table” over possible troop deployment for Kyiv.

No10 said “thousands” of personnel would be required to support any operation whether by “sea, on land or in the air” as allies prepare “for all eventualities” amid diplomatic efforts to end the war.

Officials from the so-called coalition of the willing will “accelerate the pace and scale” of work to consolidate proposals for possible troop deployment across land, air or sea to safeguard any Kyiv peace deal, a No10 spokesman said.

Sir Keir Starmer said new military sub-planning groups would continue talks during “three intensive planning days” next week, in a call with EU chiefs and non-EU countries on Friday.

It comes after Sir Keir warned Vladimir Putin would face “severe consequences” for breaching any truce as he met defence planners for the first stage of talks at the UK’s Northwood military headquarters on Thursday.

Downing Street on Friday said officials from allied countries will meet again at the same site next week to firm up a strategy to protect Kyiv as plans enter an “operational phase”.

‘Nothing off the table’ – No10

Asked whether the focus of discussions had shifted away from the prospect of ground troops for Ukraine, a No10 spokesman said: “No, nothing is off the table on any of these fronts, so I wouldn’t start ruling anything out.

“But clearly thousands of troops will be required to support any deployment, whether that is at sea, on land or in the air.”

Any deployment will require significant support and the firming up of “basic logistics of … moving people and ensuring deployment rotations, so as the Prime Minister said we need to be prepared for all eventualities,” the No10 official said.

“We’ve moved into an operational phase now and what that means is … bringing together military planners to look at the potential design of force structures, interoperability and what capability is needed to ensure a sovereign Ukraine is able to defend itself for generations to come.

“Next week, we’ll continue to accelerate the pace and scale of operational planning with further meetings at our Northwood headquarters as we look forward more closely at the details and structure of any future force.”

European and Commonwealth allies are seeking to pressure the Russian president as he resists accepting in full a US and Ukraine-backed ceasefire, as well as ensuring a peacekeeping plan is in place if an agreement is reached.

EU defence talks

Sir Keir spoke to the presidents of the European Council and European Commission as well as the leaders of Turkey, Norway and Iceland on Friday.

He updated them on the Northwood meeting with defence planners from 31 countries and said it “reinforced to him the importance of ensuring the coalition had the necessary plans in place for any eventuality”, a Downing Street spokesperson said.

“The Prime Minister also outlined the new military sub-planning groups, across land, sea, air, regeneration and reconstruction, which would continue discussions across three intensive planning days next week.”

He told them it was clear that President Putin is trying to “delay and add conditions to any meaningful ceasefire”.

Moscow agreed to pause attacks on Ukrainian power plants after a phone call between Putin and US president Donald Trump, but Kyiv has said civilian targets including hospitals have since been struck.

Meanwhile, delegations from Kyiv and Moscow are expected to meet separately with US officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days for further peace talks.

Trump and Zelensky

Zelensky has said he is hopeful a “lasting peace can be achieved this year” after he spoke on the phone with Trump on Tuesday, but appeared to contradict a suggestion that Washington could take ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security.

The Ukrainian leader said this would only relate to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the south-east of the country and that plants “belong to the people of Ukraine”.

Speaking on Friday at a White House press briefing, Trump said he believed “we’re going to pretty soon have a full ceasefire” and “the contracts in terms of dividing up the lands et cetera, et cetera, it’s being negotiated as we speak”.

Russian drones pummelled the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, injuring three people and sparking massive fires late on Thursday, according to officials. Separately, glide bombs injured at least six people, including a child, in the Zaporizhzhia region overnight.

The strikes underline Moscow’s intention to pursue aerial attacks even after it agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy facilities.

The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired 214 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks, 114 of which were intercepted and another 81 jammed.

Russia’s Defence Ministry said it had shot down 43 Ukrainian drones, 34 of them over the Volgograd region and others over the Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions.

The authorities did not report any casualties or significant damage.

Net migration in and out of the UK has dropped by 20 per cent to around 728,000 in the past year, official figures have shown.

More than 5,000 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the English Channel so far this year, latest figures show.

Some 341 people made the journey in six boats on Thursday, bringing the provisional total for the year so far to 5,025.

This is the earliest point in the year that crossings have reached the 5,000 mark since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018.

Last year, the 5,000 arrivals mark was passed on March 31.

The cumulative number of arrivals so far in 2025 – 5,025 – is 24 per cent higher than at this stage in 2024, when the figure stood at 4,043, and 36 per cent higher than at this point in 2023 (3,683).

The highest number arriving in one day this year so far stands at 592 people, crossing the Channel in 11 boats on March 2.

Channel crossings

The latest figures come after the French coastguard confirmed two migrants died in two days trying to cross the Channel on Wednesday and Thursday.

One person died after being pulled from the water while the other person died after trying to cross in an overloaded boat, despite rescue efforts to save them.

The UK signed a “road-map” agreement with France earlier this month aimed at bolstering co-operation to tackle people smuggling across the Channel.

The government’s new Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill also continues through Parliament with plans to introduce new criminal offences and hand counter terror-style powers to police and enforcement agencies to crack down on people smuggling gangs.

Home Office

A Home Office spokesperson said: “We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security.

“The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay. We will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice.”

A No10 spokesman said on Friday: “We’ve acknowledged that there is a flow of migrants into this country by illegal means on small boats and we’ve seen a number of incidents this week in French waters.

“That’s why this government has put forward a serious credible plan to finally restore order to the chaos we inherited in our asylum system.”

Aston Martin’s Formula 1 team this weekend honoured former paddock legend Eddie Jordan with his name on their racing car.

Jordan passed away last week aged 76 from an “aggressive” form of cancer.

His Jordan Grand Prix team has gone through many iterations, with the current one being Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team.

The team, which is run by Lawrence Stroll and boats his son Lance and two-time world champion Fernando Alonso on their roster, made a number of references to Jordan on this weekend’s car at the Chinese Grand Prix.

His name and a clover was placed on the rear wing of the car, as well as the main body, in a touching tribute to the paddock icon.

Jordan was a deal-maker, and not afraid to speak his mind. He was close with former Formula 1 bigwig Bernie Ecclestone, gave Michael Schumacher his debut and managed design guru Adrian Newey during his move from Red Bull to Aston Martin.

Aston Martin tribute

Jordan Grand Prix became Midland Group in 2006, before adopting Spyker F1 for 2027. In 2008 that team became Force India for a decade until it adopted Racing Point under Stroll ahead of a transfer to Aston Martin.

Stroll said: “Eddie Jordan was a true racer, a great leader, and one of the biggest characters in our sport.

“He was a friend who I have known for more than thirty years and I will miss him greatly. My thoughts, and those of everybody at Aston Martin, are with his family and friends.”

Added team principal Andy Cowell: “Eddie Jordan was one of the all-time motorsport greats. He was a one-off, a wonderful human being, and a charismatic leader who founded this team and took it to F1 in 1991.

“His vision laid the foundations for us and he leaves a lasting legacy for the entire motorsport community. Today we pay tribute to a legend of the sport and our thoughts are with his family, friends, and colleagues.”",cityam

Two entrepreneurs from Germany and Great Britain wanted to produce the largest reality TV show ever. 24 candidates from all over the world should compete against each other in global competitions, which winners are shot into space with a rocket. Also present: prominent partners such as NASA, SpaceX, CBS and Hollywood producers. But the show was never broadcast. Hundreds of internal documents, exclusive contracts and conversations with insiders show why the project failed and how investors were apparently brought by millions with a network of empty promises. All details with BI+. A British and a German wanted to create a global reality TV show, in which the winner flies into space with a SpaceX rocket. The seasons should play on all continents and inspire millions of people. To finance this, they collected money from private investors from all over the world. Including Hollywood sizes and astronauts. They promoted NASA and SpaceX, although they were not allowed in part. And they caused exclusive TV contracts. Exclusive research by Business Insiders show how the once ambitious plans became a network of empty promises - and as it apparently lost millions.

Tens of thousands of people stand in front of a festival stage, behind it a dragon rocket from SpaceX shoots into the sky. Under roaring cheers, she flies the winner of the biggest reality TV show ever into space: Space Hero.

That was the vision of a German entrepreneur and his British business partner. Both planned the most complex TV show for years that should ever be produced.

Also present: prominent partners such as SpaceX, the NASA, CBS, Hollywood producers and space companies from all over the world. More than two million euros invested private individuals and venture capital providers in the project. At least seven seasons were planned, the first should start in 2022. But exclusive research by Business Insider show why the ambitious project failed. It is about empty promises, powerless investors and the disappearance of money in the millions.

We have evaluated hundreds of internal documents, viewed exclusive contracts and spoke to insiders that were deeply involved in the project. The research draws a picture of two entrepreneurs who wanted to change the TV world, but failed due to their overambitious ideas.

The Boston Celtics are sold. Buyer is an investor group that is a record amount of $ 6.1 billion for the NBA team.

William Chisholm, Managing Partner of Symphony Technology Group, leads the group of investors - but so far he has been a completely blank.

Chisholm founded a private equity company for technology companies in 2002. There he is Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer.

The Boston Celtics are one of the most prestigious teams from the US professional basketball league NBA. You can look back on 18 titles won in the club's history. And now they have been sold-for the record amount of $ 6.1 billion (5.6 billion euros). For comparison: The latest purchases from NBA teams were between three and four billion US dollars.

No matter whether football or basketball clubs: If new investors buy a team, they are usually publicly known. But the Boston Celtics are now moving into the hands of an investor group, the head of which is a completely blank leaf in the general public. There are hardly any pictures of him online.

William Chisholm is Managing Partner at a private equity that is also hardly known. The deal not only surprised NBA insiders, but also Chisholm itself, reports the ""Wall Street Journal"" (WSJ). It was a ""Kneif-Mich moment"".

Chisholm founded the private equity company Symphony Technology Group in 2002 and is still managing partner and Chief Investement Officer there. According to the WSJ, Chisholm's company is investing in technology companies that deal with cloud security software or operate platforms for job searches.

Chisholm's curriculum vitae reads straight - MBA at the renowned Wharton School, stations at Bain Capital, according to the WSJ. ""The capital, to put it together, is openly, the simple part,"" quotes him, the journal. Above all, you have to get the right people at the table.

In addition to Chisholm, Rob Hale, Bruce A. Beal-President of the Related Companis-and the investment company Sixth Street include. According to WSJ, how much money Chisholm himself has contributed. But he is a majority owner-his comparatively small private equity company must have dropped a good rod for him. According to the WSJ, the STG manages assets of almost $ 12 billion (around 11 billion euros).

https://businessinsider.com,Elon Musks Tesla's assembly shows what he can afford,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/elon-musks-tesla-betriebsversammlung-zeigt-was-er-sich-erlauben-kann/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:23:09 GMT","Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images

Elon Musk's evening all-hand meeting at Tesla shows that he can afford more than other CEOs. A late discussion at the last minute also carries the risk of being unorganized, according to a leadership expert. The meeting with the Tesla employees was a memory of Musk's holistic approach at work.

With every other CEO it would have been an emergency with five alarm levels.

But Elon Musk's recent meeting with the Tesla employees at the last minute was a memory that the company's front man can get through with a lot. And maybe in a unique way is free of the norms that other bosses adhere to.

The big question is: when is it too much?

Even though he has convinced his employees over the years to work in tents and sleep in the office, his scope is not unlimited to employees, investors and customers, said Musk observer to Business Insider.

""There is no version in which he does so many things at once and is going well,"" Wil Schroter, founder and CEO from Startups.com, a tech accelerator, told BI.

He pointed out the sheer number of points on Musk to-do list-from control over half a dozen companies, including Tesla, X and SpaceX, to attempt to redesign the federal government.

A big challenge for the employees

Musk's decision to hold a company -wide meeting at 9 p.m. in Austin without notice - although technical problems continued to delay the beginning - sends several negative signals. That said Melissa Schilling, professor for management and organizations at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

Schilling, who dealt with Musk's career and his companies, said Bi that one of these signals was a feeling of uncertainty. ""This is a really dangerous position for someone who is so central to the brand,"" said Schilling.

Starting a meeting, if the employees are already in bed, can also affect the work ethic. ""If you signal the employees that their time is not valuable, you harm the relationship with them,"" she said.

It is one thing to get over some corporate standards in the initial phase of a company. But Musk has long been behind this honeymoon, says Schilling. ""His actions now affect too many people to get through with this behavior,"" she said.

Musk did not respond to a request from BI.

Schroter said that Musk is often preferred in case of doubt, but if he were confronted with a larger crisis, such as a drastic decline in Tesla shares compared to their high in December (they fell by about 50 percent), the musk supporters would be less forgiving.

In such a case, ""you can't go around with the government and make cuts,"" said Schroter, referring to Musk's other role at the head of Donald Trump's advisory group for the efficiency of the government (Doge).

On the couch

It is not the first time that Musk stands out with his attitude towards work.

As is well known, the richest man in the world said that he slept on the floor in the Tesla factory when the company was in the “production hole” for his model 3. He also said that he was sleeping on the couch when he converted Twitter to X.

Even if a certain start-up mode is part of Musk's operating model, Schilling said that the evening Tesla meeting suggests unprepared and that it only realized that something important in the company was happening.

Tesla had recently suffered from vandalism from his vehicles and in his exhibition rooms, which he attributed to the political left, and a decline in shares.

The carmaker's shares recovered somewhat on Friday, as the investors by Musk's message seemed encouraged during the meeting on Thursday. In it he asked the employees to stick to their shares and campaigned for the company's cybercab.

A little chaotic

One reason that Musk can pull through an evening session at the last minute is that most people expect him to be ""a bit chaotic"". And anything but traditional, says Dorie Clark, a communication trainer who teaches the Columbia Business School and wrote the book ""The Long Game""

""This is a person who smoked in the Joe Rogan Show Dope,"" she said to BI.

Clark said that Musk's reputation as an improvisation -loving, emotional CEO could remember possible that he was unpredictable.

She said that the meeting could have sent a message to the employees instead, that Musk is still aware of and takes care of his companies.

However, according to Clark, this will probably not be enough to further raise the mood among the employees and investors if he does not show through further measures that he is facing the challenges at Tesla.

The steve job effect

Schroter, who heads the Tech Accelerator, said that Musk's decision to speak directly to the workers is more effective to send an email or to rely on a company's communication team.

""It is different when you stand in front of people, even if it is over zoom where they see that you speak, see how to move,"" said Schroter.

It is a way to show that you share your worries. Nevertheless, according to Schroter, the question of how many managers can demand from their employees often depend on how much they are willing to ""follow them through a fire""

He said that at Musk, as with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the loyalty of employees is often so great that they endeavor to meet high expectations, including long working hours.

""There is only one Elon Musk,"" he said. ""I'm not a fan of him at all. I'm just saying how it is.""

Schroter said Musk's track record showed that he usually has the front, but that ""99.9 percent of CEOs"" did not have the luxury to ask for as much as he was.

""The people who follow him-the people who work for him-believe in the Elon cult,"" said Schroter. ""Most founders or CEOs don't even have this kind of attraction.""",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,I worked in Disney World - and was still homeless,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/ich-habe-in-der-disney-world-gearbeitet-und-war-trotzdem-obdachlos/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:02:25 GMT","Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BI

Jessica Cody worked in Walt Disney World in Florida in the 2010s. During her time at Disney, she was homeless and slept in an employee car park. A second job at the Universal Orlando Resort finally helped her to make ends meet.

This essay is based on a conversation with Jessica Cody, a 36-year-old woman from Central Florida. From 2010 to 2014, Cody worked as an actress in Walt Disney World and performed as Lady Tremaine, Pluto and other figures. She also worked as an actress and dancer at the Universal Orlando Resort from 2010 to 2013. The following text was revised for reasons of length and clarity.

After the big stock market crash in 2008, I worked full -time in Walt Disney World. I was divided for about 70 hours, and at first it was fine. I could rent a room. But at some point Disney covered the number of working hours.

At this point I could no longer pay rent. So I lived in my 2005 Chevy Malibu, which I parked on the West Clock, the parking lot for Magic Kingdom employees. I slept there for months and showered in the changing room every day to get more hours.

I wasn't the only homeless employee

To be honest, there were so many people who slept in their cars in the parking lot.

It is not allowed to sleep on the site, but the company pressed an eye. When I slept in my car, I was one of dozens of others - not only me alone. The security guards knew that we were doing and they knew that we could not go anywhere else.

It was an amusement park that brought me into this situation, but it was also an amusement park that helped me get out of this situation. In November 2010 I was employed as an actor and dancer at Universal. My first role there was for ""Grinchmas"", a Christmas event in the theme park. Universal paid me $ 15 an hour, which, together with my Disney hours, helped me to finally rent an apartment with two other people and enable me to have the basic needs.

Jessica Cody

I would not want to exchange my time at Disney for anything. I learned more about the entertainment industry when I ever learned on college or when I was audition in New York City. I just find it ridiculous that people have to choose between financial security and a job that fulfills them.

I no longer work on Disney or Universal. At Disney I was degraded into a seasonal worker, and if you are a seasonal worker, you have to work a certain number of hours a year to keep your status. I just didn't work enough.

At that time I got my son at that time, so I switched to another department. In the last six months of my time at Universal, I worked in the Call Center.

Now I'm a dance teacher and choreographer.

Human resources need existential wages

Disney has made some positive changes with programs to support employees in recent years. They also increased the minimum wage for the employees. But in my opinion this is still not a existential wage when it comes to Orlando.

You can love Disney and still expect you to do it better. There is no reason why an employee of the staff is dependent on food brands or that the basic needs cannot afford. As long as there are no employees who are homeless or live on public support, we are not yet at our goal.

This place would not be open without the committed and great people who work there and work out to give families.

These are the people who are responsible for the success of the theme park.

Editor's note: Walt Disney World set a minimum wage of $ 15 for employees in 2021 and increased it to $ 18 in 2023. The company offers employee packages with additional services. In 2022, Walt Disney World Resort announced that it will build affordable apartments with over 1,000 apartments for employees and the community in Orange County, Florida.",businessinsider

CEO Sergio Ermotti earned CHF 14.9 million-which makes him one of the top earners in Europe.

Ermotti's salary exceeds the median of the CEO salaries of the top 10 stock exchange groups by 53 percent, according to Ethos.

The major Swiss bank UBS published its annual report for 2024 on Monday. This could not only be seen that one of the largest asset managers in the world made a profit of 5.1 billion euros. But also that his CEO, Sergio Ermotti, is one of the absolute top earners in Europe.

As the ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"" (FAZ) first reported, Ermotti's salary was CHF 14.9 million last year - the equivalent of around CHF 15.4 million. For comparison: Christian Sewing, head of Deutsche Bank, came to 9.75 million euros last year.

Ermotti's basic content is therefore CHF 2.8 million. There is also a variable remuneration of CHF 12.1 million. Ermotti received CHF 14.4 million as early as 2023.

According to a calculation of the Swiss investment foundation Ethos, Ermotti's overall remuneration is 53 percent above the median of the CEO salaries of the ten largest Swiss stock market companies.

https://businessinsider.com,Discharge: With these 6 strategies I found a new job,https://www.businessinsider.de/karriere/entlassung-mit-diesen-6-strategien-habe-ich-einen-neuen-job-gefunden/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:36:09 GMT","Jt McCallen

JT McCallen found a new job five months after his release last year. A career coach helped him create a curriculum vitae and a cover letter that could outsmart the AI-Bots that the applicants scan. He added that it helped his mental health and bank account to stay social and to have a secondary employment.

This essay is based on a conversation with JT McCallen, a 37-year-old account manager who lives in the US state of Tennessee. The following text was revised for reasons of length and clarity.

About a year ago I had an idea that it was not going well in my job and my company. So I started looking for work. At the beginning of August the dismissal I had expected came.

I was told that I would receive a three-month severance payment, but there was no indication of the outplacement services that I knew that they were sometimes offered by companies and offer access to various resources for work search. I asked my supervisor whether one of these services could be included in my severance payment package, and while I was cleaning up my office, I learned that my request had been granted. I would have access to a service for about three months.

Before discharge, my search was generally to search job exchanges such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Monster to search and to set up notifications for the types of places in which I was interested. I had worked as a manager for inventory control at a company for medical devices and hoped to find a similar position in the supply chain sales industry.

When I was released, I took my search much more seriously. First I turned to all recruiters with whom I had previously been in contact, and agreed a 30-minute phone call in which I was able to exchange ideas about possible job offers and their view of the setting situation.

They told me that I had to find a way to bypass the AI ​​bots that some companies use to filter applicants. They also said that I should take care of job advertisements, do not actively hire the companies, but to publish it in part to give the impression that they would hire. A job advertisement can look good, but it may not be really real.

The conclusion: my job search may not be easy.

My career coach helped me to find the right way

When I started to apply for jobs, I felt like I was throwing stones into the sea and I struggled to get an interview. I hoped that the Outplacement Service Randstad Risesmart would help me turn the tide. In September, about a month and a half after my release, I started to meet a career coach every few weeks.

My career coach helped me to improve my curriculum vitae and my cover letter and to coordinate them to the respective position for which I had applied. He recommended that every company in which I applied to research and in my cover letter to name details such as the mission statement, the location and the exact job name.

The hope was that I would overcome the AI ​​filters through the recording of relevant keywords and my cover letter and would come to an interview on the phone, in which I could speak to a real person and explain my expertise.

I was also recommended to write to people on LinkedIn who work in the companies where I applied and say: ""Hey, I just applied for this position. Can you get in touch with the HR manager?"" You will probably ignore it in 99 out of 100 cases, but maybe you will reach a few people. That was something that had worked in some clients of my career coach in the past.

After I was almost no luck with my applications before I was released, the sheet began to turn. I might have had a telephone interview between May and August, and there were five or six between September and December. With three or four jobs I came to the second round of introductions and in two of them in the final round. On Christmas Eve I received an official job offer that I finally accepted.

In January I started my new position as a key account manager at a company that works in the same industry as my previous employer. The task is somewhat more customer -oriented than my old, but many of the knowledge and experience from my previous job were transferable. My new job is not quite as well paid as my old one, but it is in the salary span that I imagined.

My advice for job seekers

I would recommend other job seekers to take the time to improve their curriculum vitae and cover letter - and at least for a while to take professional help if they are not sure how to do it.

I would also recommend that people think about how they can make some money while looking for work. Shortly after my release, I was stopped by a company that cleans swimming pools and the water chemistry was waiting: I already had some experience with this work because I managed my pool at home. I worked between 20 and 35 hours a week, and although the hourly wage of $ 20 (18.40 euros) was far below what I was used to, I was able to avoid that my savings were attacked. My wife works full -time, which gave me an additional source of income.

Finally, I recommend that you take care of your mental health. I tried to eat at lunch at least once a month with a few people with whom I used to work. These meetings gave me the feeling that I had people at my side who supported me and helped me keep me up to date on industry trends.

My therapist was also very helpful. He said that he had already helped many other people to deal with changes in life like layoffs, and it was good to have this point of reference: ""Hey, others have already gone through it again. Here are some ways to keep them and motivate them.""",businessinsider

Icing

Janet Truncale is uncomfortable to be the first woman at the head of a big four company. But the global chair and CEO from EY Learn to make friends with it, she recently said in an interview. Truncale said her colleagues told her that she should get used to the name to inspire future female managers.

In 2024, Janet Truncale became the first woman at the head of one of the Big Four consulting companies-Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PWC.

As a global chair and CEO of EY, she is now responsible for the management of 400,000 employees and the supervision of a global network, which brought in over $ 50 billion (around 46 billion euros) last year.

But Truncale does not feel so comfortable to be known as a female pioneer, she said Kristin Peck, CEO of the animal pharmaceutical company Zoetis, in an interview that was released on the Zoetis YouTube channel.

""In the early nineties I was usually the only woman in the meeting room""

""When the news of my choice came about a year ago, I remember that in the headlines of the 'first woman at the top of one of the Big Four'. And my first reaction was: 'Oh, why is that?'""

Truncale said she felt the same way when she became the first woman at the head of Ey’s America's Financial Services Organization, her role before the CEO position, and tried to downplay the achievement in a meeting with partners.

But ""many very strong women"" in Truncale's practice told her at the time that she had to accept the title ""First Woman"". ""It's not about you, but about us and the next generation to see that it is possible,"" said Truncale.

When she became CEO and global chair, she heard the voices of these women again, she told Peck in an interview. ""Now I am learning to accept them, even if it is certainly a little uncomfortable.""

Truncale, who came to EY in the 1990s, announced her advice for women who are outnumbered on their career path. ""This is the story of my entire career"", confirmed Truncale. ""I grew up in the auditing industry and was one of 15 women. In the early ninety, I was usually the only woman in a meeting room.""

The goal of EY UK: 40 percent women's quota at partner level

She said Peck that it was important to remember that you have a place at the table due to your background and specialist knowledge, and to support and take others as a mentor. ""Whether thirty years ago or today, they have something to say,"" said Truncale. ""This does not only apply to women. This also applies to men.""

According to the DEI report (diversity, equity, inclusion) for 2024, 48 percent of EY employees are women in the USA and 36 percent of US partners. The position of the partner is the highest rank in the classic consulting career ladder. In September 2024, 29 percent of EY partners in the United Kingdom (UK), where the company has its headquarters, were women. EY UK's goal is to double this share to 40 percent by July 2025.

In contrast to Deloitte, KPMG and Accenture, EY reports have not made any cuts in the Trump government since the Trump government took office or transparency reports. The advisory giant Accenture (not part of the Big Four) is the only other leading service company with a female CEO. Julie Sweet was the first woman to be appointed to this position in 2019.",businessinsider

Getty Images / Olga Rolenko, Collage: Business Insider

According to the personnel consultant Kristine Capek, the key to a successful job interview in competence -based questions, which enable a precise assessment. The question ""Why should we hire you?"" On the other hand, put the applicants under unnecessary pressure. ""The application process is no longer just about a one -sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level."" Instead of pushing the applicants into a sales situation, companies should specifically ask about their motivation - for example: ""Why did you apply for this position?""

An interview can decide on the professional future - but often these conversations are anything but ideal. Companies present themselves in detail, applicants lose themselves in irrelevant details, and some questions have a daunting than effective.

Kristine Capek knows the typical stumbling blocks. As the founder and managing director of the personnel consultancy ""Ivies"", she has been teaching specialists in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry for over 15 years. She gives career tips on Tikkok as a ""dieheadhunter"". In an interview with Business Insider, she explains what really matters in a successful interview - and what questions should be deterrent.

How does an ideal interview work?

According to Kristine Capek, an ideal interview always starts with small talk. This creates a pleasant atmosphere and relaxes the situation. This is followed by a brief introduction to the company and Hiring management. ""But short and concise, because the focus is on the applicant, not the management or the team,"" emphasizes Capek.

Also read 6 psychological tricks to look more likeable in an interview

""When managers only present themselves for minutes, it is a clear red flag and says a lot about corporate culture."" Instead, the conversation should quickly pass to the applicants - this signal real interest on the part of the company.

The perfect self -presentation in the interview: neither too long nor too short

As an applicant, your self -presentation should take between five and ten minutes. No less, nothing more. You should leave out irrelevant details and concentrate on what is really important for the position, the personnel consultant advises. From the beginning, this creates a targeted connection between your own experience and the new position. However, reality often looks different. Capek knows: ""Many start with their Abitur - and lose their focus.""

Reading I also had over 1000 interviews - this one question should always ask applicants

However, this is not surprising that many companies vote for the first question to applicants very openly. You would say, for example: ""Tell something about yourself."" Instead, companies should target the interview and ask more specific questions. For example: ""Why did you apply for this position? What competencies do you bring with you that enable you for the job?"" The key to a successful interview? Competence -based questions.

Why competence -based questions are the key

For a successful interview, it is crucial that companies define in advance exactly which skills are required for the open position. ""For example, if negotiation skills are required, one could specifically ask for experience with difficult negotiations,"" explains Capek. Applicants could specifically explain how they have already used this competence.

As an applicant, on the other hand, you should not only worship past positions. Focus on the skills and strengths you have developed in previous roles and what added value you could offer in your potentially new role.

This question is a red flag in an interview: ""Why should we hire you?""

Not every question in the interview makes sense - some could (and should) even put off applicants according to the expert. One of them: ""Why should we hire them?"" This question is often asked from above, with the unspoken message: convince us first. The application process is no longer just about a one -sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level.

Reading you also ask no questions in the interview? Why this is a mistake according to HR and which you should at least make

Capek advises companies to formulate the question differently in order to put the applicants less under pressure. For example: ""Why did you apply for this position?"" This question rather aims at what applicants interested in the position and the company. Unlike the other question, it is not about how well someone can sell. Rather, it is about finding out how well someone is suitable for the open position.

This is how you react confidently to problematic questions in the interview

In one of her Tikok videos, Capek says: ""If you as an applicant are asked, why you should be set, then pack your things together and take a tear.""

But if that is too dramatic for you, for example, you can answer instead: ""I was invited because my qualifications fit the position. I would be happy to explain again which skills I bring with me and how I can bring them in.""

Then you could play the ball back and ask your interlocutors whether it is covered with all skills relevant to the position or whether they would like to talk about further qualifications. ""This remains the conversation professionally and at eye level,"" concludes Capek.

Elon Musk addressed the persistent Tesla protests and vandalism incidents during a company meeting on Thursday. The CEO said he understands when people don't want to buy Tesla, but they should not use property destroy. The Ministry of Justice and Trump have declared that attacks on Tesla dealers are regarded as domestic terrorism.

Elon Musk has a message for Tesla vandals: ""Stop being psychos.""

""I understand if you don't want to buy our product,"" said Musk on Thursday during a spontaneous company meeting with Tesla employees who were transferred to X live. ""But you don't have to burn down, that's a bit unreasonable.""

Musk initially silent about the protests that took place at the Tesla dealers, and described them as ""fake rallies"" with ""hardly any people"". However, when the protests increased and Tesla dealers and owners of several vandalism incidents, Musk condemned the actions.

""When you read the news, it feels like an Armageddon,"" said Musk on Thursday evening. ""I can't walk past the TV without seeing a burning Tesla.""

Musk commented on the attacks on X at the beginning of the week and called it ""deeply wrong"". He also spoke about vandalism during a appearance at ""Hannity"" on Fox News on Tuesday. The billionaire said that vandalism had reached a new level and he was shocked.

Donald Trump: Attacks on Tesla dealers are ""domestic terrorism""

""Tesla is a peaceful company,"" he said. ""We have never done anything harmful.""

During the one -hour company meeting in Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, Musk also spoke about the security balance of Tesla, the extradition figures, autonomous driving and robotics. He also asked employees and investors to capture their shares despite the recent slump in the number of delivery, boycotts and public demonstrations.

Since the company is increasingly confronted with a political headwind, especially from the left, US President Donald Trump campaigned for Tesla and even bought a model in front of the White House after a sensational photo shoot last week. He also indicated that he was called ""domestic terrorism"" attacks and that ""the same people who are bothering at our schools and universities are"" domestic terrorism "".

The Ministry of Justice joined Trump's words and described the attacks in a statement on Tuesday evening after the vandalism incidents at Tesla on Monday and Tuesday as ""domestic terrorism"".

At least five Teslas were destroyed in Las Vegas this week after the police assumed that they were set on fire. According to the police, a suspect fired at least three shots on a Tesla shop in the early Tuesday and sprayed the lettering ""Resist"" onto the facade of the business. In Kansas City, the police are investigating possible arson after two cybertrucks were damaged this week.

US Ministry of Justice: Up to 20 years in prison possible

The latest attacks are followed by a number of other vandalism incidents in car dealerships in the US states of Colorado, Oregon, South Carolina and Massachusetts. Tesla owners were also targeted, with some of them reported on their recent experiences with harassment and vandalism on their vehicles.

The Ministry of Justice has charged several suspects, some of whom are threatened with minimum penalty of five years. Trump said on Thursday evening in a contribution to Truth Social that those who would deliberately damage Teslas would have to expect up to 20 years in prison.

""People who are caught in the sabotage of Teslas have a good chance of getting into prison for up to twenty years, and that includes the donors,"" said Trump in the posting. ""We are looking for you !!!""

Tesla did not react immediately to a request from Business Insider after a comment.

https://businessinsider.com,Nvidia: Jensen Huang's joke could cost its customers billions,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/nvidia-jensen-huangs-witz-koennte-seine-kunden-milliarden-kosten/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 09:39:29 GMT","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Nvidia's new Blackwell GPUS mean that the older Hopper models are less useful, which affects cloud giants. The rapid technical progress could force cloud giants to adapt the depreciation of assets, which would have a negative impact on the yields. Amazon is a leader in adapting the service life of servers. Meta and Google could suffer profit losses.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a joke this week, which its largest customers will probably not find funny.

""I have already said that Hoppers cannot be given away if Blackwell is delivered in large quantities,"" he said on Tuesday at the Nvidia big AI conference.

""There are circumstances under which Hopper is okay,"" he added. ""Not many.""

He spoke about Nvidia's latest AI chip and server package, Blackwell. It is significantly better than the previous version Hopper, which came onto the market in 2022.

Large cloud companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google buy a lot of these GPU systems to train and carry out the huge models that drive the generative AI revolution. Meta has also invested a lot in graphics processors in recent years.

""Hyperscalers probably overestimate the yields,"" he wrote.

Google and Meta did not answer the questions of Business Insider on this topic on Friday. Microsoft refused to comment.

Amazon dares to jump first

Take the example of Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider. In February the company was the first to take the pain.

At the Amazon profit notification, CFO Brian Olsavsky said that the company was ""observing an increased pace of technological development, especially in the field of artificial intelligence and mechanical learning"".

""As a result, we shorten the service life for some of our servers and network devices from six to five years from January 2025,"" said Olsavsky, adding that this will reduce operating income this year by about $ 700 million (around $ 640 million).

Then even more bad news: Amazon sent some of his servers and network devices ""retired prematurely"", said Olsavsky and added that this ""accelerated depreciation"" costs around $ 920 million (845 million euros) and that the company expects the operating result in 2025 to reduce about $ 600 million (around $ 550 million).

A much bigger problem for others

Sandler, the analyst of Barclays, added a striking graphic to his Research Note on Friday. It shows the cost of renting H100 GPUs that Nvidia's older Hopper architecture use. As you can see, the price has dropped when the company's new, better blackwell gpus became available.

The diagram shows the costs for the rent from NVIDIA H100-GPUs. Ross Sandler/Barclays Capital

""This could be a much bigger problem with Meta, Google and other margin -strong software companies,"" wrote Sandler.

For Meta, he estimated that a shortening of the company's useful life by one year would increase depreciation in 2026 by more than $ 5 billion (4.5 billion euros) and that the operating result would reduce a similar amount.

For Google, a similar change would reduce the profit by $ 3.5 billion (3.2 billion euros), Sandler estimated.

An important reservation: just because a large cloud provider has already made such an adjustment does not mean that the others have to do the same. Some companies could design their AI calculus centers differently, so that the NVIDIA GPU systems last longer or are less likely to be outdated.

The time is ripe

When the generative AI boom picked up speed in the summer of 2023, the analysts from Bernstein were already thinking about this impairment.

""All of these Nvidia GPUs have to be accommodated somewhere. And how quickly are these newer servers written off?

An analyst of amber, Mark Shmulik, discussed this with my colleague Eugene Kim.

""I could imagine that the tech companies keep an eye on the useful life of the GPUs, but I would not expect anyone to change his depreciation time plans now,"" he wrote in an email to BI.

Elon Musk held a meeting with all Tesla employees at the last minute on Thursday evening. Musk said investors had to ""hold on to their shares"" while he was addressing the cybercab and optimus robots. The meeting took place after Musk had been criticized by investors that he was not concentrating enough on Tesla.

Elon Musk held a meeting with all Tesla employees in the Gigafactory in Texas on Thursday evening.

The short -term meeting was transferred to X by livestream. Eastern Time was supposed to start at 9:30 p.m., but the livestream was abruptly interrupted, which caused confusion in some employees.

Tesla then started a new livestream that showed a loading screen until the meeting started at 9:58 p.m. Eastern Time. Tesla usually holds his company meetings during regular working hours.

In the first half of the one -hour meeting, Musk informed about the security balance of Tesla, the delivery figures and the work of the company in the areas of autonomous driving and robotics. The rest of the meeting was available to the employees for questions.

Here are the five most important findings from Tesla's all-hand meeting.

1. Musk said that investors ""have to stick to their shares""

Musk alluded to the turbulence around Tesla's share price when he spoke about the ambitions of the company in the field of autonomous driving.

""It is very difficult for people on the stock exchange- especially for those who look into the rearview mirror what most people are- to imagine a future in which a fleet of 10 million vehicles suddenly has five to ten times use,"" said Musk to the employees.

The Tesla share has decreased in the past few weeks because the company has to deal with falling sales and the controversy about Musk's cooperation with the Doge office of the White House. The Tesla exhibition rooms were hit by vandalism and protests nationwide.

""If you read the news, it feels like an Armageddon. I can't walk past the television without seeing a burning Tesla. What's going on?"" Musk said on Thursday evening.

The company's share price has fallen over 50 percent since its record high in mid -December. The Tesla shares closed at around $ 236 (216 euros) on Thursday, after they had reached a maximum of $ 479 (440 euros) in December.

According to Musk, autonomous driving will release the true value of Tesla.

""It is so profound that there is no comparison with the past. It is simply not predictable. But in the future it will pay off. And some people like Cathie Wood Invest see the future,"" said Musk on Thursday. ARK Invest had set a price target of $ 2,600 (2390 euros) for the Tesla share in June.

""What I want to say is: 'Hold on your shares',"" added Musk.

The course of the Tesla share fell by half a percentage point.

2. Musk wants Tesla's company team to focus on the cybercab line

When asked by an employee, which the Tesla business team should concentrate on in the next few years, Musk referred to the Robotaxi, also known as cybercab.

""Well, of course we want to raise production with the cybercab to a new level. The cybercab is not only a revolutionary autodesign, but also a revolutionary manufacturing process,"" said Musk.

Musk said that the production process for the cybercab was not like a ""normal car manufacturing street"", but similar to a ""high -speed line for consumer electronics""

""The line will move so quickly that people can't even get around. I think it will be able to produce a car in less than five seconds,"" added Musk.

In order to produce cybercabs at such a speed, Tesla would have to expand its casting process, said Musk.

""Let's see where the boundaries of physics lie, how big a watering machine can be. Let us find out. I'm there. I am there,"" continued Musk.

Musk presented the Cybercab of Tesla on the company's ""WE, Robot"" event in Los Angeles in October. During this presentation, Musk said that the Cybercab would go into production before 2027.

During a conference conference on the Tesla results in October, Musk told investors that the cybercab would cost ""about $ 25,000"". At the ""WE, Robot"" event, Musk said that he would expect to sell the cybercab for ""less than $ 30,000"".

""We are striving for at least 2 million units of the cybercab per year. This will happen in more than one factory, but I think there are at least 2 million units a year, maybe even 4 million,"" said Musk at the time and added that the numbers were his ""best estimates"".

3. Tesla builds Optimus robots in large quantities

Musk said he expects Tesla to start his production of Optimus robots this year. ""This year we will hopefully be able to produce about 5,000 optimus robots,"" Musk said when asked by an employee when the robots will be available to the public.

Musk said Tesla wanted to have enough parts to produce “10,000, maybe 12,000” robots.

""But since it is a completely new product. Everything is completely new. I would say we are successful when we reach half of the 10,000. But even 5,000 robots, that is the size of a Roman legion,"" said Musk.

""I think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year,"" he added.

In April, Musk said during a telephone conference that the Optimus robots were the most valuable good of Tesla.

""Because if you have a sensitive humanoid robot that is able to find your way around in reality and to do tasks on request, there is no sensible limit for the size of the economy,"" Musk told investors.

4. No Tesla employee asked about politics

During the 30-minute question time, the employees did not ask Musk questions about politics.

Some Tesla investors have criticized Musk's political engagement and claims that it contains the company. The analyst of Wedbush Securities, Dan Ives, wrote on Wednesday in a joint note that Musk's work with the office of the White House Doge Tesla made a ""political symbol"". Ives has always been positive about Tesla.

""This is bad,"" wrote Ives, adding that Musk ""had to step back and to balance his Doge and Tesla CEO roles"".

Last week Ross Gerber, a long-time Tesla investor, told BI, he did not expect the Tesla share to recover this year. Musk has freaked Tesla's customers with his political activities and positions, says Gerber.

5. Musk said he was ""quite drained""

Musk told his employees on Thursday that he was ""quite drained"" after an employee asked him if he wanted to produce other products such as planes or trains.

""At the moment I have about 17 jobs. I just go to sleep, work, go to sleep, work and do it seven days a week,"" said Musk. ""I guess I like to be productive. I like to do things,"" he added.

Musk leads half a dozen companies. In addition to Tesla, Musk divides his time between his rocket company SpaceX, the social media platform X, the tunnel construction company The Boring Co., the startup neuralink for neural interface technology and the Ki startup Xai.

In addition, there is his commitment to the White House office (Doge), where he works for the reduction in government spending.

In an interview with the FOX Business moderator Larry Kudlow, which was broadcast on March 10, Musk said that he could ""only"" bring his political and business work under one roof

The cruise industry is booming - especially in Germany. The opportunities for everyone who strives for a career on the world's oceans are correspondingly diverse. We present you which positions on the ships of the largest European cruise brands are currently free: AIDA, Costa Crociere, MSC and TUI Cruises. The shipping companies are looking for candidates for all areas - from bartenders and waiters to golf instructors and actors to doctors and engineers.

As many Germans like never before set sail: Almost three million tourists spent their vacation on cruise ships in 2023. Only American passengers travel more often over the world's oceans, as the Clia industry association writes in its report 2024.

Your crew members guarantee that the processes on board the ocean giants are going smoothly. Around 1,500 employees provide more than 5000 passengers on ships such as the AIDA Cosma-one of the largest ships in the AIDA fleet.

If you dream of a season job or even an international career on the high seas, you have a good chance. Almost 300,000 employees employ the three largest cruise shipping companies Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises and MSC Cruises. Because the demand for cruises is increasing, the companies will even expand their capacities, Clia estimates.

From the job at the bar to curating the art exhibitions to the officer: We present you which positions on the cruise ships of the big European brands are open in spring 2025 and how much you can earn gross there.

The salary teams are based on information from current and former employees that they have given on job platforms such as Kununu and Glassdoor, and are therefore not necessarily representative. Business Insider asked the large European cruise control and asked for comment. AIDA, TUI Cruises and MSC did not want to provide any concrete information; A response from Costa Crociere has so far been pending.

It is important to know that the salary information at Kununu and Glassdoor are based on the number of users and their personal information, these are more direction values. Deviations to the salaries actually paid are of course possible. In addition, some companies also pay bonuses or extra grants, for example with personal target agreements. These can differ from individual employees.

AIDA is looking for temporary workers, beginners and professionals

AIDA Cruises currently employs around 18,000 employees on land and sea as a market leader in the German boom industry. 16,500 of them work on the eleven AIDA cruise ships. Via the Italian company Costa Crociere, the brand based in Rostock is the largest cruise group in the world, Carnival Corporation.

In her online career portal, AIDA currently says 34 (mostly temporary) jobs on board. Almost a dozen only apply to the area of ​​gastronomy. Here the company is sometimes looking for employees in service, cooks and cooks and bartender.

The employer always requires good knowledge of English, but not mandatory training for jobs at the bar or as a service. Further eleven jobs are open in the areas of hotel and administration as well as spa and sport. As a corporate housekeeper, for example, you moniture and optimize the processes related to the guest welfare in the board cabins of all AIDA ships. As a manager Accounting and Administration, you take care of the bookkeeping and financial processes of the hotel company. Both jobs require completed training in the hotel department or a commercial training and management experience.

On average, AIDA pays its administrative employees between 28,700 and 39,000 euros, according to Kununu. According to Glassdoor, receptionists, who also sets AIDA, can count on an annual salary between 20,400 and 24,000 euros.

Further vacancies at AIDA are advertised in the areas of fitness training, cosmetics, hairdresser and spa management. The annual salary span of the positions in this area puts between 20,900 and 55,000 euros, depending on qualifications and responsibility.

Reading I also did work on a cruise ship - these things bothered me while working

AIDA is particularly looking for creative reinforcements in the areas of art, entertainment and media: as a DJ in the brewery restaurant, video editor. According to Glassdoor, the annual salary is between around 24,000 euros for DJs up to around 55,000 euros for gallerists.

By far the highest annual salaries move into the first engineers at AIDA. They are responsible for the maintenance of the machines and systems - and thus earn between 61,140 and 72,000 euros a year, according to Glassdoor.

Dual students can also start their career at the brand with the famous kissing mouth: Anyone who completes academic training in nautics, ship operating or electrical engineering can hire as an intern. AIDA not only promises benefits such as use of the guest areas, but also a takeover after the university degree.

The following applies to all jobs on the high seas: According to international sea work, seafarers can work up to 72 hours a week. Many employers, including AIDA, offer free meals in the employee restaurant, provide accommodation and pay arrival and departure. ""We offer our crew an attractive remuneration with many other benefits. Our employees receive in addition to their wages,"" the company answers when asked about a BI.

In addition, the company has agreed with employee representatives about the employment conditions on board, working time regulations and salary systems. The applicable collective agreements are ""without exception with the responsible unions"".

TUI Cruises only employs 200 employees at sea ...

The same applies to direct competition, TUI Cruises from Hamburg. The joint venture between Deutsche TUI AG and the American Royal Caribbean Cruises employs almost 1,000 people, the far larger part works on land. For the approximately 200 employees at the sea, a ""market and performance -based remuneration"" applies, according to the sustainability report 2023.

In addition to the eight ships of the Mein Schiff fleet, TUI Cruises also operates the exclusive brand Hapag Lloyd Cruises. The eight open, mostly temporary positions in the career portal only describe positions as officers and for medical staff.

According to only two Kununu information, health and nurses at TUI Cruises earn around 35,100 to 39,600 annually, nautical officers between 44,700 and 71,200 euros. Anyone who completes an apprenticeship - such a nautical officer assistance is advertised - according to the portal, 9400 to 13,600 euros a year. Doctors earn much more on board. As the magazine ""My Agricultural Excursions"" reports, your wages amount to 7,500 to 8,500 euros per month.

... and recruited his crew about third parties

Tui Cruises commissioned concessionaires for hotel and wellness on board. The largest among them is the Swiss personnel service provider Sea Chefs. According to the TUI Cruises Sustainability Report, the company sends 8,000 employees on board the ships of the German-American joint venture.

It is very surprising that Sea Chefs 89 occupies a wide range of positions for the Mein Schiff fleet. The website lists numerous advertisements for temporary help, catering and hotel specialists, receptionists and shop employees. Even golf teachers, musical actors and actors are looking for Sea bosses. The TUI-Business partner almost always requires knowledge of English. The employer demands relevant training for qualified bodies.

Candidates apply to Sea bosses for the specific department of a shipping company, according to the career side. Anyone who convinces in the detailed application process can take off with one of the eleven university customers. The company bears the arrival and departure costs.

Employees from Europe receive Maltese employment contracts, because Malta's vehicles are registered in Malta. There is a comparably low minimum wage of 750 euros per month. After all, for the crew members who are employed by Sea boss service provider, there is a collective agreement with the Verdi union, Tui Cruises writes in the sustainability report.

According to Kununu, waiters earn between 20,000 and 29,300 euros, chefs between 51,900 and 55,200 euros and hotel directors between 42,100 and 73,100 euros.

Tui Cruises also works with service providers elsewhere. Cruise Vision, for example, employs a freelance basis of film and photo teams who hold the holiday moments of passengers on board and on land. The client insures you and pays, depending on the place of residence, also arrival and departure. The fee agreements and models varies each experience, availability and your own equipment that you bring on board. The net fee is mostly at 1000 to 1950 euros, as the company reports on request.

Industry giant MSC: Inquited gastronomy skills

MSC Cruises also stops numerous as the third largest cruise provider in the world. Almost 20,000 employees work at sea for the daughter of the Italian-Swiss logistics group Mediterranean Shipping Company. 23 of the ships run under the name MSC, two more are in the service of the Explora Journeys premium line.

There are currently 85 jobs open: from service to technology, from fire brigade operations to the specialist for meat products. MSC is particularly looking for in the areas of gastronomy, entertainment and craft in its own career portal. Here you also register for an application, upload your resume and run a knowledge test in the next step before you are invited to the job interview. According to its own sustainability report, 2022 is looking for MSC Cruises worldwide.

In view of the diverse profiles, MSC makes very different qualifications for the condition for a setting. In the service sector, MSC requires about several years of work experience in the upscale gastronomy or hotel industry. In entertainment, good knowledge of English and often in Italian and other languages ​​include. According to the website, experience is primarily important for craft work.

The Career website Comparables in the median estimates the salaries at MSC Cruises at around 110,000 euros a year-top positions in management on land. How many German employees can earn on board does not arise from the job advertisements or data from Glassdoor or Kununu. The ships ride under the flags of Maltas and Panama, where lower minimum wages apply than in Germany.

The ships of the traditional Italian provider Costa crociere crossed the sea for almost 80 years. In 2022, their ten ships at that time brought over one and a half million passengers to 139 ports, according to the latest sustainability report. Over 17,000 people therefore work for the daughter group of the world market leader Carnival Corporation. 15,500 of them belong to the crews on board the ships.

In the meantime, the Costa Crocie fleet still comprises nine ships, all under Italian flag. Online, the company from Genoa wraps 29 jobs, including training positions, jobs in the on-board shops and as animators as well as the first engineer. If you want to work here, you need a school leaving certificate, relevant training, economic degrees or, depending on the respective bodies, several months of work experience.

The company is also explicitly looking for candidates for a job as ""German International Host/Hostess"" on board. These service employees are supported by German-speaking guests as contacts on the high seas.

Glassdoor only occurs isolated salary information from Costa employees who-similar to the salaries specified above-have rarely been repeated. According to the portal, receptionists deserve around 12,641 to 13,799 euros, personnel fitness trainers 34,538 to 37,088 euros and photographers around 51,373 to 55,706 euros. In the Costa Sustainability Report of 2023, the company promises ""fair payment and working hours"".

Those who hire on a cruise ship ultimately take up long working hours and a life far from their own family. After all: Most jobs are limited to months and the entry and exit into the industry are always possible with their expected growing personnel requirements.",businessinsider

https://cnbc.com,It's time to buy when markets reach 'peak uncertainty.' Are we there yet?,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/its-time-to-buy-when-markets-reach-peak-uncertainty-are-we-there-yet.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Every investor knows, or should, that the moment of maximum uncertainty is a time to buy. The only trick, then, is discerning when we've reached peak uncertainty. The stifling lack of clarity about the breadth or severity of the Trump administration's promised ""reciprocal"" tariffs due on April 2 is the obvious eye of this uncertainty storm. But swirling around it are immigration restrictions, headlong and haphazard reductions in Federal spending and a separate but related confidence shock weighing on consumer behavior. Friday's midday rally in the S & P 500 from an early 1% decline to a minimal gain by the close came after President Trump said there would be some ""flexibility"" in the application of those April 2 trade measures. A vague and entirely reversible utterance, but the upward twitch in the index sends the message that after a month of volatile trading and universal fixation on policy risk, the potential for a relief trade is ample. .SPX 5D mountain S & P 500, 5 days Renaissance Macro Research has consistently pointed out that when the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is near an extreme high (in the top 10% of all readings since 1985), forward equity performance is better than average. Over the ensuing three months, the S & P 500 has been up 80% of the time with an average gain of 8.8%. And perceived certainty is bearish: The lowest 10% of policy-uncertainty readings were followed by a positive stock market performance only 36% of the time. Currently, it hardly needs to be said, this index is at a record, eclipsing even the peak of the Covid panic. This Sunday is the fifth anniversary of that crescendo of fear in the market, marking the low of a violent V-bottom that launched stocks to a 100% gain over the next 22 months. No confidence in forecasts The suspense over the tariff details — and apprehension about how they will interact with the fragile confidence evident in recent surveys of consumers, business leaders and investors – has drained conviction from economic handicappers, including those who work at the Federal Reserve. After the meeting last week in which the Fed left interest rates unchanged and preserved a tentative outlook for a half-percentage-point worth of cuts the rest of this year, Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""I don't know anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast."" Here's a visual illustration of this collective shrug of the shoulders. JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli plotted the ""risk bias"" of FOMC members, or which direction they believe their inflation and GDP-growth forecasts are in jeopardy of being wrong. Nearly all say the risk on core PCE inflation is to the upside, and to the downside for real GDP growth. So there is no peace on either of the two fronts that define the Fed's mandate. Is this inherently negative for the economy and markets, though? Look at the last time those lines gapped apart to a similar degree. It was in late 2022, just as reported inflation was peaking, recession expectations were near-universal — and the S & P 500 bottomed after its nine-month, 25% bear market. Hindsight is unfailingly comforting in clarifying such market proclivities. What's tricky right now is not simply that perceived uncertainty can always go to more extreme extremes for a while. It's also that the market itself has not shown anything like the degree of panic or repriced fundamental expectations evident in the uncertainty gauges or experienced in early 2020 and late 2022. What we've had is a sharp little correction in the S & P 500 that kissed the 10%-loss threshold before bouncing a week ago Friday, having started from elevated valuations and ebullient investor expectations following consecutive 20% annual gains. When perceived uncertainty rages (yes, perceived; the world is inherently uncertain even when we're all sure of what comes next), it is helpful to anchor to what we know about the probabilities. Recession is what matters Warren Pies, founder of 3Fourteen Research, dissected the 52 S & P 500 corrections since 1950 (which works out to around one every year and a half or so.): ""Once the market falls into a correction, a 'serious correction' of at least 15% becomes a probability (30 out of 52 cases). However, within those 52 corrections, 28 occurred with no recession ahead in the next 12 months. Out of these cases, only 12 went on to become serious corrections."" Simplistic as it sounds, the odds of a decline something much deeper and more long-lasting hinges on whether the slowdown underway sags into an economic contraction. Of course, non-recession bear markets occur, we just had one in 2022, but we're talking probabilities here. This is why tariffs are more than simply a psychological overhang on the market, because at some level of severity and in certain escalation scenarios they are much more potentially damaging in undercutting economic activity than in mechanically resetting some prices higher. For now, the hesitant but still healthy corporate-credit market is doing a lot of the work in holding off a recessionary setup. Weekly unemployment claims remain at benign levels. Consumer activity has slowed and retail and travel stocks have taken lumps for it, but household balance sheets aren't badly stretched in aggregate. Industrial production was reported at a record high, something that has never immediately preceded an economic contraction. Even still, about 40% of all 10% setbacks in stocks slide at least to a 15% total decline even without a recession. And in any case, corrections and bottoms are a process not a moment. Ned Davis Research U.S. equity strategist Ed Clissold points out that after an initial rebound rally, there is typically a period of churn and retesting. ""The duration of the retesting phase can be roughly proportional to the original decline,"" he says. ""The Feb. 19 peak in the S & P 500 to the March 13 low was 16 trading days. Another 16 days would bring us to April 4, near President Trump's April 2 deadline for instituting reciprocal tariffs. Since tariff concerns were the main catalyst for the selloff, the April 2 deadline could bring a resolution, one way or the other."" Levels to watch I won't argue too strenuously against the assertion that tariff concerns are the proximate headline driver of the downside chop. Yet the heaviest pressure on the market has come from not from dealers in cross-border goods but the Magnificent Seven mega-cap growth group. The ""other 493"" stocks in the benchmark are up slightly on the year and less than 6% below their peak. A week ago here , in suggesting the snapback rally had plenty to prove after four losing weeks, I noted that five-week losing streaks were rare and this past Friday's triple-witching derivatives expiration looked to have a slight upside bias. Those notions held up, but barely. The S & P 500 was up half a percent on the week. It failed to hold above the 5,700 level on three separate days, finishing at 5,667, its precise mid-July high, coinciding with the peak in Mag7 dominance. It has reclaimed just a quarter of its peak-to-trough decline. .SPX 1Y mountain S & P 500, 1 year The correction low from seven trading days ago still seems a plausible, if not fully persuasive, tactical pivot point. Sentiment readings got ""low enough"" to allow for a market turnabout, even if investor positioning never got profoundly washed out. The S & P 500 Volatility Index put in a nice spike, peaking near 30 and then declining below 20, often a sign the fever has broken. The S & P 500 shed two P/E points in three weeks, though the freshest results and muted outlooks from Nike and FedEx prompted negative stock responses and even now that forward P/E is above 20. And it's tough to see many catalysts for analysts to be lifting profit forecasts soon, especially given second-half estimates have held up as GDP forecasts have come down. Strategists at two Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital, have cut their year-end S & P 500 targets in recent weeks. That can sometimes be a sign that expectations are being reset in a constructive way, an acknowledgement of an intrinsically unsure future, which now seems even more unsettled thanks in part to a White House with a flair for ""event programming.""",cnbc

A few consumer-focused names made this week's oversold list. Retailers Costco and Target were among them. Target has a 14-day RSI score of just 19.13. Shares finished 0.6% lower on the week, and it is down more than 16% in March. The company recently warned that February sales were soft and that it sees a ""meaningful"" drop in first-quarter profit compared with a year earlier.

They include buy-rated stocks such as: Analog Devices, Nvidia, Broadcom , Marvell and AppLovin.

""Everybody says it's inflationary if we mail these checks to these people. Well, think about if the government spends the money, they spend a dollar and you get whatever multiplier effect you think of that if they don't spend the money, and say give it back to people. Then if they spend a dollar, then it's a wash. If they save some of it, inflation goes down. It's the idea that it's inflationary is just again, people should study their economics textbooks a little bit before they make partisan points.""

Trump's head of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, said in a recent CNBC interview that the DOGE dividend check makes a ""great deal of sense,"" and he has argued that anyone saying it would stoke inflation doesn't understand economics.

""If people spend it, demand spikes, and inflation follows. If they save or invest it, the impact is less immediate, but long-term effects depend on how markets react. The biggest risk? Short-term relief turns into long-term inflation pain,"" Cirksena said.

""Dumping $5,000 per person into the economy sounds great on paper, but it's essentially pouring gasoline on an already hot fire,"" warns Aaron Cirksena, CEO of investment firm MDRN Capital.

While the idea of a no-strings check may sound enticing, many economists warn that it's a bad idea.

""Now look, for folks who want to criticize this plan and say, well, DOGE would never deliver $2 trillion in total savings, we disagree, but let's just assume that they're right on that,"" Fishback told NBC News ""Let's say it's only $1 trillion. OK, so then the check goes from $5,000 to $2,500. Let's assume that it's only $500 billion. … Then the check is $1,250. That's real money.""

The exact amount of any DOGE dividend check is unclear, but some analysts have equated a 20% dividend to $5,000 per taxpaying household (20% of the ""savings"" from cuts could amount to that). Even James Fishback, the CEO of an investment firm that initially proposed the dividend idea , isn't sure what the final dividend would be.

As Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues its effort to gut the government, the idea has been floated that savings could end up in checks mailed to taxpayers. That idea has come and gone in the headlines, but it is one that Trump has expressed support for in the recent past. ""I love it. A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money we're saving by going after the waste, fraud, abuse, and other things happening,"" Trump told reporters at one point.

There's at least one more way for the administration to placate the public.

Trump has renewed his pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to help ease the pain of tariffs as more Americans become worried again about their financial situation.

Stocks are wobbling. Inflation is expected to tick higher again, if maybe only in the short-term , if President Trump follows through on expansive tariffs threats against trading partners around the world. The messaging from Trump and his top economic advisors is that he plans to do just that on April 2 , and any short-term market correction or economic ""detox"" is a price worth paying to reset the U.S. economy.

But economists worry the proposed payments are not sound fiscal policy.

John W. Diamond, CEO of Tax Policy Advisers, and adjunct professor of economics at Rice University, recently argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed co-written with former Secretary of State James Baker that entitlement reform tied to a healthy dose of DOGE could help get the federal deficit under control — but DOGE alone can't do it. For that reason, Diamond says he is a supporter of DOGE (although he's clear in saying he isn't a fan of the entire methodology), but sending money to taxpayers doesn't make sense.

""I can't get behind the DOGE dividend, it doesn't make sense to cut spending to reduce the deficit and then turn around and send it back to taxpayers,"" Diamond said. ""I think 100 percent should go to deficit reduction, there is no reason to return money to current taxpayers when we would just be imposing a bill on future taxpayers,"" Diamond added.

A lot of it comes down to what the recipient does with any potential payout, says Alice Kassens, director of the Center for Economic Freedom and a professor of economics at Roanoke College. ""The stated plan is for the dividends to only go to net payers of income taxes. The hope is that it does not act as a stimulus (like stimulus checks during the pandemic, which were geared to help maintain consumption) and instead is saved by these households with a greater propensity to save,"" Kassens said.

In such cases, a DOGE dividend would increase the national savings rate, which would, in turn, assist with investment and economic growth in the future.

""The plan is to use most of the savings identified by DOGE to pay down the national debt, with only a small share — 20 percent — going towards the dividend to taxpayers. This would reduce the debt less than if the whole amount was put towards this purpose, but this could be partially offset in the long run by added personal savings, investment, and economic growth,"" she said.

Worries about 'sugar rush, adrenaline shot' for economy

Economists and many in the market are not convinced.

MDRN Capital's Cirksena said that while some portion of a new government check to the public could go into savings, as some money from Covid stimulus checks did, it also will fuel immediate demand, and people spend it on goods and services. If supply can't keep up, prices rise. Meanwhile, infrastructure spending can also be inflationary, but it's spread over time and invested in economic productivity, making it more sustainable.

""It comes down to how the money circulates,"" he said.

There's a difference between sending taxpayers $5,000 and the government spending money on programs like the Inflation Reduction Act.

""Infrastructure spending is slower — it gets distributed over time and goes into wages, materials, and productivity-boosting projects. It builds value,"" Cirksena said, whereas direct stimulus hits the economy like a sugar rush — fast spending, quick demand spikes, and a higher risk of inflation without lasting economic growth. ""One is a short-term adrenaline shot, the other is a long-term strength program,"" Cirksena added.

Right now, the administration isn't prioritizing a DOGE dividend in public comments. Beyond tariffs policy as an economic focus, Trump's recent speech to Congress prioritized tax cuts and infrastructure spending. And if the administration is worried about tariffs policy placing short-term inflation pressure on the economy, that would make sense. Dropping $5,000 per person into the mix would be like throwing fuel on a fire that's already burning hot.

The administration is leaning into economic growth through investment and tax incentives, not direct cash handouts, Cirksena said, adding that Trump's focus on tariffs and domestic production suggests he's looking to shift money toward industries, not directly into people's pockets.

""So it sounds like it doesn't fit,"" Cirksena said.

Case Western Reserve University economics professor Jonathan Ernest says that now would be an unusual time to inject stimulus because all indicators show a strong economy. It might be a good political, if not economic, strategy, but ultimately, Ernest says it might slow down the Fed's efforts to tame inflation and lower interest rates.

A stimulus check now while inflation is still persistently above where the Fed wants it would risk stimulating demand, which would drive up prices, Ernest said, and he added it could reduce the likelihood that the Fed achieves its goals. ""A stimulus now is not quite going hand in hand with current monetary policy, which has guided the soft landing up until this point,"" he said.

The Fed's Chair Jerome Powell said after its FOMC meeting on Wednesday that a good part of any higher inflation would come from tariffs, but an economic growth decline would balance out that, although it could ""delay"" the Fed's progress in hitting its 2% inflation target.

Ernest also thinks paying down the deficit as an administration priority is at odds with sending out stimulus checks.

""Stimulus would be a confusing strategy because we are running deficits, and instead of using savings to pay off the deficit, we would be returning it to consumers,"" Ernest said.

The Treasury Department puts the country's national debt at $36.22 trillion.

That doesn't mean the idea may not be floated again, especially if the economy slows significantly and as mid-term elections approach.

For now, the Fed says that external surveys on the risk of recession aren't a factor it pays attention to, and the economic data remains relatively solid. But fears of recession at the back of the year are rising, and in the least, slower GDP growth is the expectation from the markets. Meanwhile, job cuts across the federal government, as well as deportation plans, are contributing to uncertainty about a national labor market that is also holding up so far, though hiring has slowed.

One irony of a DOGE dividend, Ernest says, is that perhaps administration policy, such as the job cuts at the government level, will destabilize the economy enough that a stimulus payment would be warranted.

""Typically, when we think of these things, we are in an economic slump, and we want to do a little bit of stimulating demand by putting more money in people's pockets so they can prop up the economy,"" he said.",cnbc

The Securities and Exchange Commission's years-long crusade against the crypto industry appears to be over.

The final chapter closed on Wednesday, when Ripple announced that the SEC had officially dropped its four-year-old lawsuit against the company. The suit, filed on Jay Clayton's last day as SEC chair, accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through the sale of its XRP token without registering it as a security.

Crypto companies and exchanges Coinbase , Kraken, Robinhood , Binance, and OpenSea all previously saw lawsuits or investigations dropped, resolved or put on hold. Ripple is now taking a victory lap.

""Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back — and won on essential legal questions — throwing a major wrench into the SEC's plans to destroy crypto in the U.S. through enforcement,"" Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told CNBC in an emailed statement. ""The SEC has now abandoned its appeal in our case. In a fitting irony, Ripple was the first major case they brought and will now be the last one they walk away from.""

XRP was created in 2012 as one of the first non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies. It was started by the founders of the company Ripple, and became the platform's native currency. Like bitcoin, XRP can be bought and sold by retail investors. XRP jumped about 11% after Wednesday's announcement.

Ohio native Lauren Scott, 29, had lived in Los Angeles for 10 years working as a freelancer in the film industry, when she decided she was ready to buy a house. At the time, Scott lived in a studio apartment and paid $1,175 in rent. Scott started her search in 2019 and wanted to stay under $400,000. But then the covid-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, and she found herself outbid every time she put in an offer on homes in the city. ""I didn't think I was ever going to be able to buy in California, much less Los Angeles, which is somewhere I've kind of called home for such a long time and that really sucked,"" Scott tells CNBC Make It. Scott realized buying in California was close to impossible, so she started looking in other states like Florida, where her family lives. She quickly realized she wouldn't be able to find a job that would match her current lifestyle. Scott was also disappointed in the quality of life in the United States and set her sights on Mexico, Portugal and Italy because they all had weather similar to California.

Scott found a two-bedroom, one-bath townhouse one hour outside of Florence. Lauren Scott

The contention between locals and expats over rising housing costs, made Scott dismiss Mexico and Portugal pretty quickly. So she focused on properties in Italy. She set a budget of $50,000 and did her house hunting online. ""I didn't fly over and bought sight unseen, which I don't recommend,"" Scott says. ""I reached out to a lot of agents and just ended up paying somebody to do it all for me."" After several weeks of searching, Scott found a two-bedroom, one-bath townhouse one hour outside of Florence. She could walk and use public transportation, which was a big priority for her. ""I didn't want to deal with a car since I'm not there full time and just being in the mountains and having that view made me feel super at peace,"" Scott says.

The townhouse was listed for 32,000 euros. Lauren Scott

The townhouse had been on the market for 32,000 euros or $34,905 USD. The previous owner told her the price was set low because the hot water boiler would need repairs. ""She left it completely furnished and just wanted to get out and move to a different part of Italy but was having problems selling the home,"" Scott says. ""I really lucked out because there's nothing wrong with it except for needing to replace that one part of the home."" Scott paid the full asking price of $34,905 and an additional 4,200 euros, or $4,581 USD, in closing costs. Not wanting to deplete her savings, Scott secured a $20,000 personal loan from a local bank to help purchase the house, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Scott closed on the townhouse in August 2022 and flew to see it in person for the first time that November and says when she first arrived, she was overcome with emotion. ""It was just a surreal feeling. I couldn't believe I owned a home in my 20s because I didn't think this would ever happen. I think I cried too,"" Scott says.

The previous owner told Scott the house's price was set low because the hot water boiler would need repairs. Lauren Scott

Scott's original plan for the house was to rent it out, but she realized she didn't want to deal with the issues that could arise with tenants or short-term renters. ""The cost of just having it empty would probably outweigh the cost of renting it out and having somebody break something,"" she says. ""I'm kind of protective over my house."" Scott visits Italy twice a year now and uses the townhouse as a vacation home, but she is currently trying to secure a digital nomad visa to stay in the country for a while. In 2024, Italy launched its ""Visa for Remote Workers,"" allowing a one-year residency with the option to renew for highly skilled professionals to work remotely as employees or as self-employed freelancers. ""I'm hoping at some point within the next year I can officially move but if I end up staying in the States, I plan to use it as more of a retirement plan because I know I'm not going to be able to retire in the U.S.,"" she says. ""I'm thinking of it more as a long-term investment to get out of the U.S. As a freelancer, it's actually concerning because I don't always have health care, I don't have a 401K and I can't afford to invest, so I think just being able to know that I have something secure and a place to call my own for when I am older is really comforting.""

The view from the townhouse was a major selling point for Scott. Lauren Scott",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,"As consumer confidence dips, off-price retailer TJX remains a top stock to own",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/as-consumer-confidence-dips-retailer-tjx-is-a-top-stock-to-own-.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","We know many of the shoppers who frequent TJX Companies ' off-price chains love treasure hunting. What entices them to keep coming back for all those discounted designer clothes and trendy home furnishings, however, is something less talked about and works even in tough economic times. According to UBS analyst Jay Sole, it is TJX's strong relationships with 21,000 vendors around the globe that allow it to get the best deals on merchandise for its stores, which includes T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods. ""For a lot of vendors, TJX is their biggest customer,"" Sole told CNBC at last week's UBS consumer and retail conference in New York City. ""They want to grow with a company like TJX that's winning and taking market share, especially if some of their other retail partners are losing market share."" Sole, who covers TJX, has a buy rating on the stock and a $151 price target. TJX benefits when retailers need to unload excess inventory to generate cash and mitigate losses. ""A lot of public companies are aggressive on cutting merchandise in advance because they have to grow their earnings,"" said TJX CEO Ernie Herrman during the company's earnings call on Feb. 26. This trend has been intensified by a slowdown in consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan's preliminary March index fell to 57.9 — a 10.5% drop from the prior month and a 21% decline year over year as Americans expect a higher rate of inflation within the next year driven by higher prices from tariffs imposed and threatened by President Donald Trump . While this presents challenges for retailers, it has created an opportunity for TJX's buyers to secure high-quality inventory at better margins, an advantage that ""tends to work pretty well for TJX,"" Herrman said. TJX YTD mountain TJX Companies TYD Jim Cramer has long touted the TJX's vendor relationships as a strength no peer can match. It's one of the main reasons why it's one of Jim's favorite stocks to buy right now . During the March Monthly Meeting , he said store closures and high levels of excess inventory bogging down the likes of Kohl's and Macy's is what determines the stock's upward trajectory. Shares of TJX have lost more than 5% year-to-date — a little worse than the broader market but much better than the basket of retail stocks in the XRT exchange-traded fund, which has dropped 13% in 2025. TJX is one of our 12 core portfolio holdings. We increased our price target to $140 per share after TJX delivered a better-than-expected quarterly report in late February. We kept our 2 rating . Secret sauce So how does TJX do it? As retailers offload excess inventory— a trend that's accelerating as consumer confidence dives — TJX swoops in to buy the highest-quality stuff at cheap prices. These elements ""tend to work pretty well for TJX,"" Herrman said during February's post-earnings call. TJX's size also gives it more buying power and a negotiating edge over its off-price peers. The company posted $56.4 billion in net sales in 2024, the company's fiscal 2024. That's nearly double its next two competitors, Ross Stores and Burlington , which last year generated $21 billion and $10.6 billion in sales, respectively. TJX's market dominance enables it ""to make sure they can create win-win situations where the vendors are still happy to work with them and they're still able to get inventory at the price they need to offer great value to the consumer,"" Sole explained. Analysts at Morgan Stanley agree. In a note Friday, they said TJX's ability to purchase new inventory and quickly convert it into sales is a key part of the company's unique moat, or competitive advantage, that ""enables opportunistic buying."" During the analysts' recent meeting with TJX management, the retailer's executives emphasized that its ""importance to vendors has grown considerably over the past few years."" Morgan Stanley described TJX as offering ""simple"" and ""consistent"" relationships with vendors that don't include advertising or markdown dollars, inventory takebacks, and no issues with late payments. ""As a result, TJX is sometimes able to negotiate better margin,"" analysts said — adding ""this negotiating power likely only grows with further scale."" That growth is steadily taking shape as TJX recently increased its long-term store target of 7,000. TJX's core market is the United States, with locations in all 50 states — plus Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico. But it also has stores in Canada, Australia, and Northern Europe. It recently expanded into the Middle East and Mexico through partnerships and has plans to open new stores in Spain in early 2026. TJX also uses a ""roll-up strategy,"" wherein the company partners with local businesses to offer its expertise in supply chain and inventory management. TJX takes a stake in these businesses and benefits from their growth. Last year, TJX announced a pair of joint ventures with international off-price retailers: Mexico's Grupo Axo and Dubai-based Brands for Less. ""This can help local businesses grow but also help TJX ultimately make money and expand all over the world,"" UBS' Sole said. TJX's Herrman has previously called the company's merchandising talent the ""secret sauce"" that sweetens these kinds of investments during the company's post-earnings call last August. Morgan Stanley, for its part, concluded that TJX is a ""scarce, high-quality retail investment option"" that has room for higher profits in the future. Analysts have a buy-equivalent overweight rating on the stock and a price targe t of $136 per share. In a separate note Friday, Goldman Sachs characterized TJX as being ""the most defensive"" in the off-price sector. While the overall retail industry has been hard hit by tariff concerns, economic uncertainty, and the health of consumer spending, Goldman continues to see the consumer as a ""source of strength"" and remains ""constructive on off-price."" Analysts find TJX as a defensive stock that can be bought to protect against economic downside. They have a buy rating and price target of $142 on the stock. However, if the U.S. economy goes into a recession, TJX ""won't be able to maintain the same-store sales growth rate,"" UBS' Sole explained. Still, TJX tends to have a more consistent performance than your typical retail stock and can steal share in any economic environment, even in a weaker scenario. ""If the economy is weak, maybe some of their core customers pull back a little bit, but then they gain new customers from other customers trading down,"" according to Sole.

""I've heard, 'I can boost my immune system if I take a lot of vitamins.' It could be vitamin D, vitamin A [or] zinc,"" Bland says. ""[But] those nutrients don't boost the immune system. Those nutrients may fill the gaps in a person who needs them to meet their daily requirements for proper immune function, but you're not going to boost the immune system like you do with a vaccination.""

Getting vaccinated causes a physiological effect that boosts the function of the immune system. Supplementing with nutrients doesn't have the same effect, he says.

Instead of a sole focus on boosting immunity, Bland says you should be thinking about rejuvenation. Roughly every four months, the cells that make up our immune systems are replaced with new cells.

For the first time, the value proposition of designer handbags from top brands, such as Hermes, Chanel, Goyard and Louis Vuitton are growing across the board, one report by luxury resale site Rebag found last year.

""These trends signal exciting investment opportunities across both heritage and more attainable brands,"" the Rebag report said.

Handbags are among the least volatile of any collectible asset and offer a good risk versus reward, they have also proven to be a worthwhile hedge against inflation, according to a separate 2022 study by Credit Suisse.

However, while some designer handbags, particularly classic and sought-after styles, can potentially retain or even increase in value over time, they are not a traditional investment in the way stocks or real estate are, expert say.

In 2020, the stand-up comedian and her husband had just bought a new home that was feeling conspicuously empty. ""I was looking at other people's Instagrams and being like, 'How can they afford furniture?' We were just trying to buy stuff,"" Brannon, 33, tells CNBC Make It. ""And I came across a video about an estate sale, and then I was immediately obsessed."" It wasn't just that she was finding interesting items at bargain prices. The sales were like little windows into other people's worlds. ""I was obsessed with the fact that you can just walk around someone's house, see what they're interested in and shop their things,"" she says. ""I love learning about people and seeing what they're into."" When Brannon start posting about estate sales on Instagram, she found her inbox full of people who were just as curious as she was. These days, her account, from which she posts estate sale tours and previews as well as recommendations for upcoming sales, has nearly 60,000 followers. For now, Brannon's estate sale obsession — including her social media accounts, podcast and newsletter — is a fun, yet time-consuming passion project. Other than some subscription fees on her newsletter, she's not earning money on it. But even if it's not yet making her a fortune, she's still driven by the prospect of helping people find great deals on hidden gems they'll love. Here are her three best tips for shopping at estate sales.

1. Go on the last day

Estate sales often go on over the course of two or three days. For bargain hunters, the best time to go is as late as possible, Brannon says. ""If you're looking for the best deal at an estate sale, it will generally be during the last few hours of the last day of the sale,"" she says. The reason is simple. As the end of the sale nears, the company running things becomes more and more anxious to sell as much of the merchandise as possible. While a sale may not allow haggling during the early hours, rules often go out the window toward the end, Brannon says. ""They'll start doing deals with you in terms of, if you buy a bunch of stuff, you can just be like, 100 bucks, 200 bucks, and they'll take it,"" she says. ""Otherwise they need to figure out what to do with the remaining items. So they're really motivated to get it sold."" ""That's my best tip for the absolute best deal you can get at an estate sale,"" Brannon says.

2. Know where the bargains are

Technology has made it easier than ever to figure out what something is really worth, a paradigm which cuts both ways. You can likely figure out a fair retail price for something on your phone, but so can the estate sale company. ""Before Google Lens, I think estate sales were pretty price flexible. It was more of a treasure hunt to figure out if someone could identify something as valuable,"" Brannon says. Chances are, you won't find an antique Rolex in a shoebox of watches. But there are still deals to be had, especially if you're not focused on labels. Brannon says there are often attractive prices on on rugs, furniture and sets of glassware. ""Glassware is one of the best things you can buy at an estate sale,"" she says. ""I've bought a lot of my glassware from estate sales, because you can generally get a full set for $10 or $20."" Her other top category: tchotchkes. ""My favorite things are the pieces they call 'littles.' You might find a ring dish or Depression glass or a cat figurine,"" she says. ""These things are usually really cheap at estate sales.""

https://cnbc.com,Japanese baseball fans are crazy for Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers. MLB has a plan to get them to root for every team,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/how-mlb-plans-to-grow-ohtani-dodger-fandom-in-japan-into-billions-for-league.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Shohei Ohtani #17 of the Los Angeles Dodgers waves to fans while leaving the field after the MLB Tokyo Opening Series between Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs at Tokyo Dome on March 19, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. Gene Wang | Getty Images

On the morning of the second and final game of Major League Baseball's Tokyo Series between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 19, a dusting of snow fell on Japan's capital city — an extremely rare occurrence for a time of year more known for cherry blossom blooms. But that didn't dissuade more than a thousand people from lining up to shop at the 31,100-square-foot Fanatics-operated MLB store outside the Tokyo Dome when it opened that morning. That is a reflection of the type of impact that Shohei Ohtani is having on MLB's business in Japan, an impact that has only grown in size since he signed a then-professional sports record 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023, following that up with MLB's first-ever 50 home run and 50 steal season, in addition to winning both the National League MVP and a World Series title. Last year, Fanatics, which operates the MLB's merchandise business globally, saw a 170% increase in MLB merchandise sales year-over-year in Japan, according to Nori Kawana, East Asia managing director for Fanatics. In the past five years, Ohtani-related merchandise has accounted for 57% of all MLB sales in MLB Store Japan and Fanatics Japan, while Dodgers merchandise sales are up more than 2,000% year-over-year since he signed with the team, Kawana said. Japan has a deep baseball history and is the country's most popular sport for both spectators and participants. MLB also has had a long connection to the country, dating back to barnstorming games that saw players like Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig play in exhibition games in Japan to the now deeper relationship between MLB and Nippon Professional Baseball. Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner of business and media, said Japan is by far the league's largest commercial market outside of the U.S. and Canada, something he attributes to those long-term investments. ""It just doesn't happen overnight,"" Garden said. However, he added: ""And then you've got this-once-in-a-lifetime talent."" Garden said that when MLB looks around the globe, ""the business stuff generally lags the fandom by a few ticks."" In Japan, where MLB is ""just scratching the surface,"" Garden said, ""the opportunities are exploding."" The first game of this year's Tokyo Series was watched by 25 million viewers in Japan, according to MLB, setting a new record for the most-watched game in the country — Japan's population is roughly 125 million. The second game averaged more than 23 million viewers. While it's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison, the Dodgers-New York Yankees 2024 World Series averaged 15.8 million viewers in the U.S. (and 12.1 million in Japan where the games began in the morning). MLB plans to feed that growing fanbase in Japan with content. The league has long had an office in the country, and recently expanded its original and translated Japanese content for the MLB app and on MLB.com. It is also adding a newsletter and a content hub that follows Japanese-born players. as well as updating its MLB Gameday product, which provides game tracking and advanced stats, to be in Japanese.

Garden said that a growing audience is changing the way the league is thinking about its next media rights contract, with both its international and domestic deals expiring after the 2028 season. ""When the next set of deals are up, you're going to find people that are looking for worldwide rights, especially the streamers,"" Garden said. ""The amount of people engaging with and watching the game internationally I think has opened everyone's eyes."" For the Tokyo Series, games were broadcast locally on over-the-air NTV, as well as streamed on Amazon Prime. That also carries over to sponsorships, Garden said, with American companies seeing an opportunity to further break into the Japanese market while Japanese companies are able to not only do things with MLB now locally but reach U.S. consumers as well. In the last two years, MLB has signed 14 new sponsors in Japan, and the Tokyo Series was the league's largest international sponsorship event ever, generating a 240% increase in revenue compared to the 2024 Seoul Series played in Seoul, South Korea. ""We're benefitting from all that kind of converging at the same time,"" Garden said. Garden said the league expects the Tokyo Series to be ""the most successful international game we've done financially."" The two games between the Cubs and Dodgers were instant sell-outs, in addition to the exhibition games held between the MLB teams and local Japanese games. Demand was so high, the games were aired in roughly 150 movie theaters in Japan. The Tokyo Series recorded the best merchandise sales of any MLB international event, with sales eclipsing the 2024 London Series by 320%, MLB said. Sales at the store at the Tokyo Dome surpassed every MLB All-Star Week ever, selling more than half a million products. Unsurprisingly, the most popular item was an Ohtani jersey with the Tokyo Series patch. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told the New York Times that he expects the Tokyo Series to set records across the board for a league special event, and could bring in upwards of $35 million. However, he said the larger goal is to grow the league's total business there: ""We do believe there are payoffs in the B's: billions,"" Manfred told the Times.

Connecting Japanese fans with all MLB players, teams

That growth will only continue as Ohtani, alongside other Japanese-born players like the Dodgers' Roki Sasaki and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and the Cubs' Shota Imanaga and Seiya Suzuki, continue to make an impact in MLB. But the challenge for MLB and its partners in reaching that lofty goal is to build up the rest of the league's players in Japan as well. David Leiner, president of trading cards for Fanatics Collectibles, where he oversees Topps, said that the fandom around baseball in Japan is undeniable, with plenty of support not only for the Japanese MLB stars but the local NPB teams as well. Topps has grown its business into the eight figures in the country, Leiner said, ""with Ohtani sprinkling a little accelerant into the growth."" The company also holds the licenses for the Japanese baseball and soccer leagues, as well as other entertainment properties, and Leiner said Fanatics sees the potential for the market to generate upwards of nine figures. Japanese baseball card collectors aren't very different from American ones, Leiner said, but one of the significant differences is how much they look to support players from their country. ""Do they want the Derek Jeter [card] or Mike Trout [card]? Of course, but they lean a little more towards the Japanese players in MLB, and there's a lot of pride in that,"" he said. Leiner said that does lead to the fandom of teams that Japanese players played on, and that does stick over time — for example, there is a contingent of Seattle Mariners fans in Japan due to Ichiro Suzuki's time with the team. But there are other examples of it being a fleeting phenomenon, as Japanese fans flocked to one player and then stopped following as closely when that player left MLB. Now, the growth of Japanese players, and their impact within the league, is helping to build a broader fandom for MLB. Last season, there were 10 Japanese-born players on MLB rosters on Opening Day, the most since 2013 when there were 11. While that significantly trails some of the other countries represented in the league, like the Dominican Republic and Venezuela — which had 108 and 58 players on Opening Day rosters, respectively — few countries can match the star power of the current group of Japanese players. MLB has not yet required teams to finalize 2025 Opening Day rosters, but the number of Japanese players is expected to grow. Kawana, who is based in Tokyo, said that while Japanese fans have historically been player-fandom focused, he is now seeing a growth in team fandom especially as it has become easier to follow those teams. Having MLB teams on the ground hasn't hurt either. Before this year, the last time MLB played official games in Japan was in 2019, and Garden said that the league is hoping that when it agrees to its new CBA, set to expire in 2026, it will come with ""an even bigger [international] plan."" MLB will host a slate of games in Monterrey, Mexico, later this month. ""These sorts of things are years in the making, and it takes a long time from participation at the youth level on up to really mature,"" Garden said. ""You're seeing the culmination of it now, and this should usher in a new era of prosperity for MLB and baseball in Asia.""",cnbc

Some are born with generational wealth that gives them a head start, while others work their way up through grit, determination and well-timed career decisions. Luck may also be a factor. But there are a few common habits among wealthy people, self-made millionaire, author and TV host Ramit Sethi wrote in a recent newsletter. ""It's time to stop worshipping rich people — and start copying what they actually do,"" he wrote. Here are five rules Sethi said rich people live by and how you can use them to grow your own wealth.

1. Know the ins and outs of your finances

If you know how much money you make in a year, you're already a step ahead of many of the people Sethi has spoken to over the two decades he's been helping people with money. ""You have to know your numbers,"" Sethi recently told CNBC Make It. ""Shockingly, 50% of the couples I speak to do not know their own household income. 90% of people in debt do not know how much debt they owe."" It's easy to track and obsess over ""$3 questions"" like the price of eggs or a gallon of gas, Sethi said. But those factors are probably not making the difference between being able to retire and working full-time well into your golden years. Instead, focus on seven key questions, he wrote: How much money do I make? How much debt do I have and when will I pay it off? What percent of my income goes to savings? What percent of my income gets invested? How much of my income do I spend on housing? What do I want to spend more on and less on? What are my money beliefs? Of course, knowing the answer to these questions and not making any adjustments won't get you far. But understanding your own financial position is key to figuring out what your next steps are. ""Rich people who are savvy with money can tell you how much they'll have next month, next year, and even five years from now,"" Sethi wrote.

2. Have systems in place for making money decisions

Don't rely solely on willpower to make smart money decisions. ""Willpower is great ... until your kid throws a tantrum, you catch the flu, or your entire mood tanks because last night's 'Bachelor' episode sucked,"" Sethi wrote. Instead of setting a budget and committing yourself to sticking to it, try putting systems in place to handle your money automatically, Sethi said. Your savings, investments and bill payments can all be automated, so you don't even have to think about things like whether you can afford a vacation this year. You can do this by setting up payroll deductions for your 401(k) or automatic bank transfers to your savings or brokerage accounts. Additionally, you can set money rules for yourself, like deciding that a certain percentage of every cash windfall gets invested and the rest can be used for fun. ""Rich people don't gamble their financial success on how motivated they feel today,"" Sethi wrote. ""They build airtight systems that handle their money automatically.""

3. Have a plan before you need one

For better or worse, life is full of unexpected surprises. But what often sets rich people apart is that they have a plan for the future, Sethi said. They not only have a healthy emergency fund, but also have a solid understanding of what they want their lives to look like. ""Most people don't know how much they should be saving or investing,"" Sethi wrote. ""They just pluck a random number out of the air and then feel guilty for the next 45 years."" Figure out what exactly you want to be able to do with your money, whether that's quitting work entirely by the time you're 60 or starting your own business when you leave your 9-to-5. ""Once you have that decided, you need to create a timeline and make a plan,"" Sethi wrote. ""Build a system so your back is never against the wall.""

4. Live by the 80/20 principle

""[Rich people] live by the 80/20 principle: 80% of your results come from 20% of your effort,"" Sethi wrote. In a business setting, this may mean that 80% of profits come from 20% of customers. But on a personal level, it means instead of worrying about $3 questions, like the whether you should buy a latte or make coffee at home, focus on ""$30,000 questions,"" like whether you can negotiate a raise or significantly lower your housing costs. ""These questions are worth tens of thousands of dollars and yet we remain in the weeds and play small by asking the $3 questions,"" Sethi previously told CNBC Make It.

It breeds doubt, uncertainty, and even resentment from people counting on you to make a call so they can move forward. When you let multiple options linger, it can sap everyone's energy and make them question your ability to get things done. I've studied mental strength for decades and, as I lay out in my book, ""The Mentally Strong Leader,"" decision-making is an essential component, along with fortitude, confidence, boldness, and more. Here are five things you may be doing that signal indecision — and what to do instead.

1. You avoid and delay

It's one thing to be prudent in decision-making, another to be paranoid. You can take much longer to decide than necessary because you're busy ruminating over the implications of making the wrong decision. DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money For example, let's say you can't decide if you should ask that friend of a friend out to dinner because you worry about getting rejected. You spend weeks dawdling. Meanwhile, someone else takes initiative and just like that, your crush is in a relationship that doesn't involve you. What to do instead Sometimes waiting to decide is warranted, like if you're expecting key pieces of information to fall into place. Often, though, delaying and avoiding makes you feel like all options are still open even as the window closes on some opportunities. Considering the cost of not deciding — like missing out on the chance to get to know someone you're interested in — can spur you into making a great choice.

2. You debate indefinitely

It's natural to take as much time as you possibly can to make a decision. Without a deadline, or with a deadline too far in the future, you can easily fall victim to Parkinson's Law, which says that work expands to fill the time allotted. In other words, you use the extra time you've given yourself to consider more decision inputs for longer than necessary. What to do instead Give yourself a deadline if there isn't one imposed on you already — erring toward sooner rather than later — and create consequences for missing it. For example, commit to your boss that within two weeks you'll decide who you're hiring for a key position (a reasonable timeframe, with just a little cushion). You'll be motivated to stay on track because you know missing the deadline won't look good. And you don't give yourself too much time to overthink it.

3. You ignore obvious decisions

Sometimes you know deep down what you need to do, but you look for justification to do something else. Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that confirms an existing belief or, in this case, a decision you want to make. For example, you need to cut a toxic person out of your life. But you keep searching for signs that they're worth keeping around because it's too painful to admit to yourself that they're not who you thought they were. What to do instead Accept inevitabilities sooner. Stop trying to find support for what you want to decide, and accept the reality of your situation. Don't let your distaste for something you know you have to do cloud your judgment.

4. You try to please everyone

You don't want to make a decision you know not everyone will like, fearing the pushback you'll get or angst you could cause. But leadership — and mental strength — means being willing to make tough calls at times. What to do instead Make the best call you can with the information available at the time, and move forward. Know that the goal is not to have 100% approval. You can't please everyone. Instead, strive to make choices that feel authentic and align with your values. And know that people will appreciate that you've made a decision, even if they don't agree with it.

5. You get overwhelmed and stuck rehashing the same information",cnbc

Spencer Kimball | CNBC

COVERT, Mich. — A nuclear power plant on the shores of Lake Michigan is aiming to make history this fall by becoming the first reactor in the U.S. to restart operations after shutting down to be eventually dismantled. The effort to restart the Palisades plant near South Haven, which shut down three years ago, is a precedent-setting event that could pave a path for other shuttered reactors to come back online. But Palisades needs major repairs to restart safely, highlighting the challenges the industry will face in bringing aging plants back to life. Palisades began commercial operations in 1971 during the early wave of reactor construction in the U.S. The plant permanently ceased operations in 2022, one of a dozen reactors to close in recent years as nuclear energy has struggled to compete against cheaper natural gas and renewables. The owner of the plant, Holtec International, has said it hopes to restart Palisades this fall, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The restart project is backed by a $1.5 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, $1.3 billion from the Department of Agriculture, and $300 million in grants from the state of Michigan. The Energy Department on Monday approved the release of nearly $57 million from the loan, a sign that the Trump administration supports the project amid the turmoil and uncertainty in Washington over federal funding for projects started under the Biden administration. But Holtec is facing major repairs to Palisades' aging steam generators that could delay a schedule the NRC has called demanding. Holtec has disclosed to regulators that its inspections have found damaged tubes in the plant's two generators, which were installed in 1990.

Those tubes are crucial components that protect public health. If a tube ruptures at a nuclear plant, there is a risk that radioactive material will be released into the environment, according to the NRC. Plant owners are required to demonstrate to the NRC that if a tube does fail, any radiological release beyond the plant's perimeter would remain below what the regulator describes as its ""conservative limits."" ""The NRC is scared to death of steam generator tube ruptures. It's a very real accident. It's not a hypothetical,"" said Alan Blind, who served as engineering director at Palisades from 2006 to 2013 under previous plant owner Entergy. Blind, who is now retired, said he supports nuclear power but is concerned about the condition of the Palisades plant based on decades of experience in the industry. Palisades is currently in a safe condition, NRC spokesperson Scott Burnell said, as the steam generators are not in use because the plant is shut down and defueled. Holtec President Kelly Trice told CNBC the company has done a ""complete characterization"" of the generators and ""they are fully repairable."" The company has asked the NRC to complete its review of the repair plan by Aug. 15, but federal regulators are skeptical of the company's timetable. NRC Branch Chief Steve Bloom warned Holtec during a Jan. 14 public meeting that the work required to review the plan will ""add to a schedule that is already very aggressive."" Eric Reichelt, a senior materials engineer at the NRC, called the schedule ""very demanding,"" telling Holtec at the meeting that only a few people are available at the regulatory body to do the necessary review work.

Steam generator repairs

In nuclear plants such as Palisades, water heated by the reactor passes through tubes in the generators, causing water outside the tubes to boil into steam that drives the turbines to produce electricity for the grid. The radioactive water that circulates through the reactor and the clean water that boils in the generators do not come into contact with each other. If a tube ruptures, however, the contaminated water mixes with the clean water and radioactive material could be released into the environment through valves that discharge steam, according to the NRC. Holtec's inspections found more than 1,400 indications of corrosion cracking across more than 1,000 steam generator tubes at Palisades, according to a company filing with the NRC in October 2024. The tubes have not failed, Holtec CEO Krishna Singh told CNBC in February. Several had corrosion cracking with more than 70% penetration, according to the filing. Due to the plant's age, Palisades steam generator tubes are made of an alloy that the industry has since learned is prone to corrosion cracking, according to NRC. Holtec said it is using a technique to repair the tubes called ""sleeving"" in which a higher quality alloy is inserted and expanded to seal the damage.

Inside the control room at the Palisades nuclear power plant in Covert, Michigan, Feb. 24, 2025. Spencer Kimball | CNBC

""The techniques of repair which we're using, which is called sleeving, has been done in about 10 plants across the world and in some plants is done every outage, so this is not new, exotic technology,"" Trice said. ""It is a common repair technique, and we expect it to be done on time and on schedule."" Holtec's repair plan is scheduled to start this summer following inspection and testing, spokesperson Nick Culp told CNBC. Holtec can go ahead with the tube repairs on its schedule, but the company does so at its own risk as the NRC will decide whether the repairs meet requirements in the end, Burnell said. But during the Jan. 14 meeting, NRC branch chief Bloom pushed back on Holtec's statements that the company's repair plan is following industry precedent. ""Even though you're quote, unquote, following a precedent, it's not exactly, because it's a different material, different type of sleeving,"" Bloom said at the January meeting. The sleeve design that Holtec is proposing for the repairs has not been installed in steam generators before, though it has been used in other heat exchangers at nuclear plants, according to a company filing. The sleeves are made of an alloy that has not shown signs of cracking in U.S. or international plants, according to the filing. The component has a service life of no more than 10 years, the filing said. Culp said testing and analysis of the sleeves ""support the expectation of longer-term performance."" The issues with the tubes raise the question of whether the aging steam generators should be replaced, an expensive project that Palisades' previous owners knew would be necessary at some point but never tackled.

Consumers Energy , for example, sold the Palisades to Entergy in 2007 for $380 million in part due to ""significant capital expenditures that are required for the plant,"" including the replacement of the steam generators, according to a filing with the Michigan Public Service Commission. Consumers Energy assumed that the generators needed to be replaced in 2016, according to the filing. Entergy, however, did not replace them after purchasing Palisades. The utility found that purchasing new generators would make the plant economically unfeasible, said Blind, who was engineering director at Palisades during that time. ""They felt that with their expertise that they could prolong the remaining life, which is exactly what they did up until they shut it down,"" Blind said. Entergy closed Palisades in May 2022 and sold the plant to Holtec to take over its dismantling. But Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a letter to the Department of Energy pushed to keep Palisades open, citing the jobs supported by the plant and the need for reliable, carbon-free power. Backed by the governor's office, Holtec first applied for federal support to restart Palisades two months after it closed.

Indian Point leak

A steam generator tube rupture at the Indian Point nuclear plant — located 24 miles north of New York City in Westchester County, New York — demonstrates the potential risks such incidents pose to public health and the finances of utility companies. On Feb. 15, 2000, operators at Indian Point Unit 2 received a notification that a steam generator tube had failed, according to the NRC's report on the incident. Consolidated Edison issued an alert and shut the plant down, the regulator said. It would stay closed for 11 months while the cause of the rupture was investigated and the condition of the four steam generators was analyzed. The rupture resulted in ""a minor radiological release to the environment that was well within regulatory limits,"" according to an NRC task force report. The incident ""did not impact the public health and safety,"" according to the report. Still, the NRC slapped Con Edison with a red citation, the most serious violation, after determining the leak was of ""high safety significance."" The leak was contained and there was no evacuation of neighboring communities, but authorities in Westchester County at the time were deeply worried about the risk to the public, said Blind, who was Con Edison's vice president of nuclear power at Indian Point during the incident.

https://cnbc.com,Take a look inside French luxury retailer Printemps' first U.S. store,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/look-inside-french-luxury-retailer-printemps-first-store-new-york.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Printemps' new store is located in New York City's Financial District. The store has creative merchandise displays, such as in its sneaker room.

A piece of Paris has landed in New York City.

French luxury retailer Printemps officially opened its first U.S. store this week in the city's Financial District. The retailer celebrated its opening on Friday, which coincided with the start of spring — its namesake.

The 55,000-square-foot store spans two floors and carries a wide range of merchandise, including clothing, shoes, handbags, makeup and more. About 25% of its brands are either not available or rare in the U.S., such as the Joseph Duclos brand, a French luxury name that made a handbag sported by Taylor Swift, Printemps CEO Jean-Marc Bellaiche said.

In an interview with CNBC, Bellaiche said the retailer aims to stand out from other luxury players with the store's eye-catching architecture; unique mix of popular luxury brands and hard-to-find French brands; and programming and services, which include beauty and spa treatments and clothing and accessory repairs.

Printemps Group was founded in 1865 and operates 20 department stores in France. Compared with its French stores, the U.S. location has more of an experiential bent, with rotating displays of merchandise resembling pop-up shops and food concepts, including a restaurant and a café with French pastries. Its playful design is inspired by a Parisian apartment, and it is located at One Wall Street, a historic Art Deco skyscraper.

For instance, one of the highlights of the Printemps store is the Red Room. The Art Deco-style room was decorated floor to ceiling with red and gold mosaics by master muralist Hildreth Meière and completed in 1931. It was previously a reception room and banking hall for the Irving Trust and Bank Company, and was designated an interior landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

Printemps restored the room and turned it into a ""shoe forest"" where shoppers can browse for footwear or order a glass of wine at a nearby bar.

The store also will include Maison Passerelle, a fine dining restaurant steered by Gregory Gourdet, a two-time Top Chef finalist and three-time James Beard award winner. It will open in April.

Printemps is opening the U.S. store as luxury spending slows across the globe. Even some wealthier consumers have pulled back on discretionary purchases because of inflation and economic uncertainty. In China, a key market for higher-end goods, luxury spending has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels.

Sales in the global luxury industry are projected to grow 1% to 3% annually through 2027, according to a report last month by consulting firm Kearney. The report attributed the slowdown to weaker demand among Chinese consumers, inflationary pressures in the U.S. and economic uncertainty fueled by trade disruptions and policy changes by the Trump administration.

That is a marked change from 2020 to 2021, when global luxury spending jumped about 27%, according to Kearney's report. Global luxury spending across goods and services totaled an estimated $500 billion in 2024.

Still, Brian Ehrig, one of the report's authors and a partner in Kearney's consumer practice, said the U.S. remains an attractive market for luxury brands because of consumers' resilience.

""On a relative basis, we have the healthiest economy, if you look at the major economies,"" he said. ""And then the other thing is, Americans love to shop.""

Ehrig added that other high-end retailers have doubled down on investments in large and eye-catching physical stores, too, such as LVMH -owned Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton opening new stores in New York City. He said the in-person experience is more critical in a sector where items come with such high price tags and expectations for personal service.

""There's something special about being in a luxury retail store, about the way you're taken care of and you're made to feel like a VIP when you're there,"" he said. ""And there's just no way to do that online or on an iPhone.""

Other internationally based retailers with lower price points are expanding and opening more stores in the U.S., too, including Ireland-based Primark and Spain-based Mango.

For Printemps, the U.S. opportunity became clear, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, as more Americans visited Paris and came to its stores, Bellaiche said. In terms of sales, Americans are the third-largest spenders for Printemps after the French and Chinese, he added. Yet, Americans are closing the gap, with sales to American customers tripling from 2019 and 2024, he said.

Even with its luxury focus, Laura Lendrum, CEO of Printemps America, said the store mixes in more approachable items for tourists or aspirational shoppers who may stop by for a cup of coffee or browse for a $50 gift.

Pope Francis is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital on Sunday, his doctors at Gemelli Hospital said.

Francis, 88, was hospitalized for bronchitis on Feb. 14 and remained under care for more than five weeks. At times, the pope was in critical condition and required high-flow oxygen therapy, according to the Vatican, and his changing health status captivated the world's attention.

Addressing reporters outside the hospital in Rome on Saturday, the pope's doctors acknowledged that his condition had been ""life threatening"" on two occasions, but confirmed he has remained stable for at least two weeks.

""We have prepared to welcome him home,"" Dr. Luigi Carbone said.

His doctors added that he will be under a ""protected discharge,"" which will require ongoing medications, oxygen assistance as needed and a period of rest ""for at least two months.""

""Immediately, he won't be able to continue his work activity of meeting groups of people or important work, that he will likely be able to do once he has finished the period of convalescence prescribed and the clinical improvements are verified,"" Dr. Sergio Alfieri said.

Carbone added: ""The Holy Father is improving, so let's hope that soon he will be able to continue his normal activity.""

Throughout his illness, the Vatican has maintained that Francis has has continued to fulfill his duties. However, he has remained out of the public eye for weeks. Notably, Francis was unable to attend the Catholic Church's jubilee celebration, a tradition dedicated to the remission of sins that occurs every 50 years, also known as the Holy Year.

Despite his health battles, the Vatican made no indications that the pope would resign, unlike his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 in a move that prompted global outrage.

The Vatican said in a statement earlier Saturday that the pope will greet a crowd of gatherers outside the hospital on Sunday, marking his first public appearance since his treatment began.

Francis' hospitalization in recent weeks was not his first time battling serious ailments. In 2021, he underwent surgery for a gastrointestinal disease called diverticulitis, and again in 2023 for a hernia.

In the weeks before his hospitalization, the pope was seen with a sling around his arm, which, according to the Vatican, was necessary after the pope suffered a fall.

Foreman, known as ""Big George,"" won an Olympic gold medal in boxing at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City when he was 19 years old.

He won the world heavyweight championship five years later in a stunning knockout of Joe Frazier in two rounds in 1973, but he lost it to Muhammad Ali the next year in the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle.""

But Foreman was not finished. At 45, Foreman reclaimed the heavyweight title in 1994 when he beat Michael Moorer — a comeback that made him the oldest boxer to win the championship.

Foreman retired from boxing in 1977 and became a born-again Christian. He said in his biography on his website that he had a religious experience in a dressing room after losing in a decision to Jimmy Young on March 17, 1977, in Puerto Rico.

He was ordained as a minister the next year, founded the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in 1980, and in 1984 founded the nonprofit George Foreman Youth and Community Center in Houston.

Foreman returned to boxing in 1987, a decade after he retired.

https://cnbc.com,Carl Icahn brings two directors to Caesars’ board. What could be next as the activist aims to build value,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/icahn-brings-two-directors-to-caesars-board-how-the-activist-may-build-value.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Business: Caesars Entertainment is a diversified gaming and hospitality company which operates through several segments: Las Vegas, Regional, Caesars Digital, and Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. Its Las Vegas Segment properties include The Cromwell, Flamingo Las Vegas and The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Its Regional properties include Circus Circus Reno, Grand Victoria Casino and Horseshoe Baltimore. Its Managed and Branded properties include Harrah's Ak-Chin, Harrah's Cherokee, and Harrah's Cherokee Valley River. Its resorts operate primarily under the Caesars, Harrah's, Horseshoe and Eldorado brand names. It offers diversified gaming, entertainment and hospitality amenities, destinations, and a full suite of mobile and online gaming and sports betting experiences.

Earlier this month , Carl Icahn and Caesars reached an agreement in which the company consented to expanding the size of the board to 12 directors and appointing Jesse Lynn (general counsel of Icahn Enterprises) and Ted Papapostolou (chief financial officer of Icahn Enterprises) as directors to the company's board. Icahn agreed to abide by certain customary standstill and voting provisions.

This is not Carl Icahn's first foray at Caesars. He filed a 13D in February 2019 stating then that he believed the board should conduct a strategic review with a view toward a sale of the company being the optimal path to shareholder value creation. On March 1, 2019, Icahn and Caesars entered into a director appointment and nomination agreement, pursuant to which John Boushy, Matthew Ferko and Christopher Williams resigned from the board and James Nelson, Courtney Mather and Keith Cozza were appointed to fill the resulting vacancies. On July 20, 2020, Caesars merged with Eldorado to form Caesars Entertainment with Icahn's support. Courtney Mather is still on the board of Caesars but no longer works for Carl Icahn.

Since the merger, Caesars has been attempting to strengthen its balance sheet, pursuing strategic divestments and acquisitions and expanding into the growing digital gaming market along with the rest of the brick-and-mortar gaming industry. Many of these initiatives have been successful and some have been disappointing. On Oct. 1, 2021, Caesars' stock price topped $119 per share. Now, almost five years later, the stock has dropped back below the price when Icahn merged Caesars with Eldorado in 2020 – in the heart of Covid – despite revenue increasing from $9.6 billion in 2021 to $11.2 billion today and operating income increasing from $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion over those respective periods. Icahn clearly sees a great business at a very attractive price.

Icahn and the company recently entered into an agreement in which Caesar agreed to expand the size of the board to 12 and appoint Jesse Lynn (general counsel of Icahn Enterprises) and Ted Papapostolou (chief financial officer of Icahn Enterprises) to the company's board. In the press release announcing this agreement, Icahn stated that they, ""look forward to working with [management] and the Board to maximize value for all shareholders, including by exploring strategic alternatives for the Company's underappreciated digital business.""

A spin-off of Caesars Digital makes sense for several reasons. In 2024, Caesars Digital generated $1.16 billion in revenue, accounting for 10.3% of the company's total revenue. This represented a 19.5% growth from the year prior and 112.2% growth since 2022. Consensus estimates suggest that Digital can continue to grow in mid-double-digits. Digital's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) has also surged 207.9% from 2023 to 2024, with projections of another 160.9% increase in 2025. In contrast, the company's brick-and-mortar segments (Las Vegas and Regional), have remained relatively stagnant, with revenue declining 2.34% from 2023 and 1.78% from 2022. EBITDAR has also declined by 6.56% and 5.87% over the same periods, respectively, and consensus estimates predict a similar trend going forward. Clearly, these are two businesses at vastly different points in their growth cycles, making it difficult for the market to fairly evaluate them as a single entity. Currently Caesars trades at 8.43-times EBITDA, whereas digital peers of Caesars Digital trade at 15 times to 25 times. Applying that multiple range to Digital's $305 million of 2025E adjusted EBITDA would render an entity with a value of approximately $4.6 billion to $7.6 billion. As Digital only represents 3% of the company's current EBITDA, this separation would unlock a ton of value, as Digital's standalone valuation would represent 15% to 25% of the company's total current enterprise value – significantly higher than what its implied valuation is right now within Caesars. This separation would also allow investors the option to invest in a consistent legacy casino business or a riskier high-growth digital business. This does not have to be a straight sale or spinoff, either. Icahn is one of the most creative investors ever and his two nominees will likely work to figure out what the best structure is for shareholders. For example, the company could retain a piece of the digital business or enter into an agreement with the new entity to run the business.

Carl Icahn knows a ton about the casino business. He has had a tremendous history of creating value at casinos. In 1998, Icahn acquired the Stratosphere casino operations, fixed it up, grew it and sold it for more than $1 billion about a decade later. Icahn acquired an interest in Tropicana in 2008 when it was bankrupt, brought in new leadership and restructured it and sold it in April 2018 for $1.85 billion. And of course, he disclosed a stake in Caesars in 2019, replaced departing CEO Mark Frissora and orchestrated the Eldorado merger. So, there is no other activist more qualified to create value at a company like Caesars. The stealth nature and structure of the agreement in addition to the comments made by Caesars and Icahn strongly indicate that this is a very amicable arrangement, and that Icahn is confident in management's ability. While CEOs do not generally like to spin off assets, all indications are that Caesars' management is receptive to this strategy.

Icahn is not a micro-manager and trusts his people and management to execute effectively. This has been an area rife for activism with Icahn protege Keith Meister on the board of MGM, two activists in Penn Entertainment and two more activists in Entain with Eminence founder Ricky Sandler on the board. This industry is at an inflection point with the onset of interactive gaming. The companies that navigate this better – likely through acquisitions and alliances, and without significantly weakening their balance sheets – will be the winners. I am not sure you can have a better ally in that type of initiative than Carl Icahn.
