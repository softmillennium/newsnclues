Boxing heavyweight legend George Foreman has died aged 76, according to his family.

During his professional boxing career he amassed an astonishing total of 76 wins including 68 knockouts, but he famously lost to Muhammad Ali in the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. 

Speaking to CBS in 2016, he reflected on that night in Kinshasa, saying he was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

'No comment': Heathrow boss asked if he should stay in job

Edited by Matt Spivey

The power outage that forced Heathrow to close yesterday was caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation

The independent National Energy System Operator (NESO), which will investigate the power outage, says it ""welcomes the government's commission"".

Fintan Slye, NESO's chief executive, says in a statement: ""We will now work with all relevant stakeholders to understand the lessons that can be learned to improve future resilience of Great Britain's energy system."" 

The Department Energy Security and Net Zero says it expects NESO to report back with initial findings within six weeks. 

NESO is expected to work with Heathrow Airport to ensure the investigation is ""comprehensive and thoroughly examines the causes of the incident,"" the statement adds. 

Heathrow Airport's Chief Executive Officer Thomas Woldbye welcomes the investigation into the power outage that closed Heathrow Airport on Friday.

In a statement issued in the last few minutes, he says he hopes the findings will ""help strengthen the airport's future resilience"".

""We will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident and we are committed to working closely with all stakeholders to ensure a thorough investigation,"" Woldbye adds.

Earlier, Woldbye was questioned on BBC's Today programme, where he described the fire at a substation near to Heathrow ""unprecedented"", adding he is ""proud"" of how the airport handled the incident.

Akshay Kaul, director general for infrastructure at Ofgem, says in the Energy Security and Net Zero department's statement that the authority ""will not hesitate to take action.""

He adds that Ofgem will work to ensure the National Energy System Operator's review ""goes as far as possible to ensuring steps are put in place to avoid any repeat of an incident of this scale in the future"".

The statement from Kaul also says that households and businesses ""should be able to have confidence in the resilience of critical national infrastructure"".

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says it is ""imperative"" to ""identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong"".

Within the statement from the Energy Security and Net Zero department, she warns ""some disruption is expected"" over the coming days and urges passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling.

Alexander adds that the incident caused ""significant disruption"" but praised emergency services for working ""swiftly"".

We're now seeing a full statement from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, following Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's comments a short while ago.

The department says the National Energy System Operator's investigation will support efforts to ""build a clear picture of the circumstances"" surrounding the power outage at Heathrow and the UK's energy resilience more broadly so that it's prevented from ever happening again.  

""The government's Plan for Change is rebuilding Britain's resilience, including boosting the country's energy security with homegrown power. Separately, the resilience review led by the Cabinet Office is ongoing and is due to conclude in the Spring,"" the statement reads.

The statement also includes further comments from Energy Secretary Miliband, who says the government is ""determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow. This review will be an important step in helping us to do so, as we deliver our Plan for Change"".

We'll bring you more from the department's statement in our next few posts.

A moment ago, we brought you news that the energy secretary has commissioned in investigation into the incident at Heathrow. 

In a post on X, Ed Miliband writes: ""The loss of power to the Heathrow area has caused major disruption to thousands of people and many businesses. 

""We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned.""

He says he is working with Ofgem and has commissioned the National Energy System Operator to investigate the incident. Miliband says the investigation will look for ""wider lessons"" on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure. 

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has commissioned an investigation into the incident at Heathrow, to be carried out by the National Energy System Operator. 

We'll bring you more on this in our next post.

Anna HolliganReporting from Amsterdam's Schipol Airport

Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is Europe's fourth-largest, serving approximately 67 million passengers annually. 

Schiphol has faced power-related issues in the past, such as a voltage drop in Tennet's high-voltage grid in 2018, which led to disruptions in operations. 

This incident resulted in improvements in monitoring of the emergency power generators and response systems. Schiphol is implementing energy storage solutions, such as iron flow batteries, to reduce reliance on diesel generators and improve environmental sustainability. 

Despite these measures, like Heathrow, in the event of a major power substation failure Schiphol's systems might not be designed to power the entire airport indefinitely without external support. 

Both incidents resulted in substantial disruptions to flight operations. At Schiphol in 2018, the power outage led to the closure of the airport, with flights delayed or cancelled, affecting thousands of passengers.   

But the Schiphol outage in 2018 was due to a general power failure in the Amsterdam region, with the airport reopening after several hours once check-in systems were restored.   

Both scenarios highlight the importance of robust backup systems and emergency response plans to mitigate the impact of power outages.

More than 100 flights through Heathrow have been cancelled today, one day after a power outage brought the airport to a standstill.

Although Heathrow Airport is now ""fully operational"", we've been keeping a tally of all the cancelled flights on Heathrow's departure and arrival boards today. British Airways has been particularly affected, but other carriers are seeing cancellations, too.

Here's what we found:

More than 30 departing flights cancelled

You can check the status of your departing flight via your airline and on Heathrow's online departure board., external

More than 70 arriving flights cancelled

You can check Heathrow's arrival board on their website, external.

The term substation has been in the forefront of our coverage, as the disruption at Heathrow Airport yesterday was caused by a fire at a power substation in Hayes. 

Elizabeth Orchard from the Institution of Civil Engineers explained to our colleagues at BBC Breakfast exactly what a substation is. 

She describes it as a ""stopping point"" for electricity as it journeys from where it is generated to where it is used.

Large amounts of energy are used to enable the electricity to travel long distances. There are two types: transmission substations and distribution substations.

Transmission substations handle high-voltage electricity transmission over long distances, while distribution substations bring down the voltage for local distribution to homes and businesses.

Orchard adds that fires are ""incredibly rare"" as ""substations are some of the best maintained infrastructure around the country"".

We're now hearing from Labour MP Ruth Cadbury who tells the BBC that there is ""a lack of power grid capacity"" in the area surrounding Heathrow, with no new overhead lines expected until 2036.

She says it is too soon to tell whether this shortage had an impact on the closure of Heathrow Airport yesterday, after a substation fire caused a power outage.

Cadbury, who is chair of the Transport Select Committee, adds that the previous government has shown a lack of interest in Britain's infrastructure over the past 15 years.

She insists the Labour government is picking up on these issues but says it will take time to ""ensure our key national infrastructure is fit for purpose"".

Asked about plans for a possible third runway, she says it will take years but by that time ""West London may have secured the additional grid capacity it needs"".

In terms of mitigating the type of crisis we saw yesterday, she adds that Heathrow and airports in other countries will be ""looking at their systems in the weeks to come"".

BBC's Emma Barnett earlier put it to Heathrow's Chief Executive Thomas Woldbye that yesterday's full closure may impact passengers' trust in the airport - especially ahead of its controversial plans to build a third runway.

Woldbye said that he has ""full trust in the fact the airport can build a third runway that is resilient"".

Let's take a look at those plans for a third runway:

Marc AshdownBusiness correspondent

Yesterday's closure at Heathrow Airport was caused by a power outage following a fire at a substation in West London

In the end, Heathrow Airport was only out of action for 18 hours, but it left vital cargo - such as life-saving organs - stranded mid-transit. While passengers, pilots and planes have been scattered across Europe.

The airport's boss Thomas Woldbye said planes could have taken off and landed yesterday, but it was not safe to do so without back-up power to infrastructure such as runway lights, fuel systems and air bridges.

He insisted any airport would have responded in the same way, and said Heathrow uses as much power as a city and would need to install an expensive standalone generator to absolutely guarantee no power outages.

With one business leader labelling the UK a ""laughing stock"" over the incident, could this incident now weigh on its future investment plans?

Heathrow recently announced a multi-billion pound expansion plan, including revamping two terminals and adding a controversial third runway.

But the question of how to safeguard against damaging power outages has now entered the equation too.

We're seeing images showing passengers filing into Heathrow after it was announced that the airport is ""fully operational"" today.

Although flights to and from the airport have resumed, some airlines are warning passengers to expect delays. 

Air India has just announced that their operations to and from Heathrow Airport have started again following yesterday's disruption. 

""Today's flight AI111 was on schedule and other flights, to and from London, are expected to operate as per schedule,"" it says in a statement. 

Meanwhile, flight AI161 - which diverted to Frankfurt - ""is expected to leave Frankfurt at 14:05 pm local time"", the airline says.

Farah Rafeeq (L) and Niken Wulan (R)

Farah Rafeeq, 24, says she is frustrated to miss part of her close friend's wedding after the fire which closed Heathrow Airport on Friday.

She was due to travel with Singapore Airlines with her 32-year-old friend Niken Wulan, who is pregnant, to a wedding in Cambodia on Sunday.

The mass-cancellation of flights means they will now miss part of the ceremony.

They have found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport with Turkish Airlines and Bangkok Airways that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon.

Farah tells the PA news agency today that the last few hours have been ""nightmarish"" because ""it is one of our closest friends' wedding and we have to travel for at least 20 hours to get there"".

“We had to pay double the amount, between £600 and £700, for the new flight, and we had planned this trip for months and had hotels booked,"" she says.

“We are missing the morning ceremony but at least we can make it for the reception.”

""Around 85%"" of British Airways' schedule at Heathrow will run as planned today, the airline has said in a statement, as it advises passengers to travel to the airport unless told otherwise.

The airline has been the worst affected, travel expert Simon Calder told the BBC earlier. 

Its latest statement explains customers will ""likely"" experience delays however as it offers those booked on flights to or from the airport this weekend ""flexible options"" to rebook for free. 

We're continuing to bring you stories from people who have been impacted by yesterday's disruption at Heathrow Airport.

Jane
     Davies, a headteacher from County Durham, was stranded in Dubai with eight
     of her pupils on a school trip.

She says they were just about to leave their hotel when a newsflash came up on her phone about Heathrow being closed.

“My heart sank,"" she says. ""We didn't say anything to the children,
knew we'd just have to get to the airport.""

Davies says they later heard the flight would take off, but delayed.

“I've got a WhatsApp chat with the parents, just making sure that they're kept informed all the time because obviously I'm
very conscious that they're sitting at home really worried how their children
are coping.”

Heathrow Express has just announced that any unused tickets purchased yesterday will be valid for today.

""Simply see the gateline staff at the barriers, and they will let you through,"" they say in a statement.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander also said in a statement earlier that rail tickets can be used flexibly today to help passengers with their journeys.

Incoming International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Kirsty Coventry has said she does not support banning athletes from the Olympics based on their countries' involvement in armed conflicts. In an interview to Sky News on Friday, she also announced plans to initiate discussions about Russia's return to competition. 

Russian and Belarusian athletes were prohibited from competing in the Games shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The IOC also insisted that international sports federations follow suit, leading to both countries being excluded from major global sporting events. The committee later allowed some athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in the Games as individuals under neutral flags, including at the Paris Olympics in 2024, while national teams have remained barred.

When asked by Sky News a day after being elected to the post whether she opposed banning nations from the Olympics due to military conflicts, Coventry said: “I am, but I believe each situation must be considered individually.”

Coventry, who is now set to become the first woman and the first African to head the IOC, also pledged to establish a task force to develop “some policies and some guiding frameworks that we as the movement can use to make decisions when we are brought into conflicts.” 

The former Olympic swimmer, who won two gold medals for Zimbabwe, admitted that there are “horrific conflicts in Africa at the moment,” highlighting the necessity to protect and support athletes, ensuring they have the opportunity to come to the Olympic Games.

Asked about allowing the Russian national team to return to the Olympics in 2026, Coventry said: “We're going to have that discussion with a collective group, as I'd said, with the task force.”

Coventry was elected as the 10th president of the IOC on Thursday, having secured a majority of the vote. The 41-year-old came ahead of Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. and Britain's Sebastian Coe, who finished second and third in the voting, respectively.

Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Coventry on her IOC election, saying that her “experience and dedication to the true advancement of the noble Olympic ideals will ensure your success in such a responsible position.”

Russian officials have repeatedly slammed Western nations for politicizing international sports and exerting pressure on sports federations to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes for political reasons.

Legendary boxer and two-time world heavyweight champion George Foreman has passed away at the age of 76, his family said on Saturday in a post on Instagram. Known as ‘Big George' in the ring, the American athlete built a long, remarkable career in the sport.

Foreman's career started with amateur boxing after moving from Texas to California. He retired in 1997 with a career record of 76 wins, 68 by knockouts, and only five losses.

“With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones,” the family said.

Foreman won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City at the age of 19. Five years later, he won his first world heavyweight championship. He did it again in 1994 when he was 45, making him the oldest heavyweight champion ever.

One of Foreman's most famous fights was against Muhammad Ali in 1974, which he lost in an eighth-round knockout, and was chronicled in the Oscar-winning documentary ‘When We Were Kings'. After he lost to Ali, the boxing legend fought five more times before he retired to begin a career as an ordained minister in his native Texas. However, he returned to boxing in 1987 at the age of 38.

In 1994, he launched the George Foreman Grill, which went on to sell more than 100 million units worldwide. He sold the commercial rights to the grill for $138 million in 1999.

His final fight took place in November 1997, a majority decision loss to Shannon Briggs. In 2002, Foreman was named one of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by The Ring magazine, which also ranked him as the ninth-greatest puncher of all time. He was an HBO ringside analyst for 12 years, ending in 2004.

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israel struck Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for rockets targeting Israel, killing two, including a child, in the heaviest exchange of fire since its ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah almost four months ago.

The rockets fired from Lebanon were the second ones launched since December and again sparked concern about whether the ceasefire would hold. In a statement, Hezbollah denied being responsible for the latest attack, saying it was committed to the truce.

Israel had said it would respond “severely” to the early Saturday attack targeting northern Israel. Israel's army said the intercepted rockets targeted the Israeli town of Metula. An Israeli official said six rockets were fired and three crossed into Israeli territory and were intercepted.

The official said Israel could not confirm the identity of the group that fired the rockets. The official said the military struck targets across southern Lebanon.

Lebanon's health ministry said the strike in the southern village of Touline killed two people and wounded eight others.

The Israeli prime minister's office said it instructed the army to act forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, adding: “Israel will not allow any harm to its citizens and sovereignty.” Israel's army said it struck dozens of rocket launchers and a command center where Hezbollah was operating.

In a statement, Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south but said the country did not want to return to war.




Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.

Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under a ceasefire struck on Nov. 27. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18.

But Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel. It has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.

Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made.

The strikes came a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity” until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

Israeli strikes on Friday night killed at least nine people, including three children, in a house in Gaza City, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies.

“Rubble and glass started falling on us,” said Sameh al-Mashharawi, who lost his brother in the attack. He mourned with his young nephew Samir al-Mashharawi, whose parents and siblings were killed. The 12-year-old, his head and wrists bandaged, sat in the back of a truck and cried.

Israel's military said Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighborhoods west of Gaza City and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas.

Around 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war earlier this week. Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel, and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over ceasefire negotiations.

The international community has condemned the resumed attacks.

The initial 2023 attack by Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu appeared before police for questioning on terror-related charges on Saturday, a day after his interrogation over corruption allegations. His arrest this week has sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on social media that 343 suspects had been detained in protests in major cities on Friday night, adding “There will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people's peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.” The cities listed included Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Antalya, Canakkale, Eskisehir, Konya and Edirne.

The mayor, who is a popular opposition figure and seen as a top challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was detained on Wednesday following a dawn raid on his residence over allegations of financial crimes and links to Kurdish militants. Dozens of other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.

Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

On Saturday, police questioned Imamoglu for some five hours as part of an investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. A day earlier he was questioned for four hours over the corruption accusations. The mayor rejected all charges during both interrogations. 

He was expected to be transferred to a courthouse later on Saturday for questioning by prosecutors and to face possible charges.

His arrest has ignited protests that have steadily increased in intensity.

On Friday, police in Istanbul used pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city's historic aqueduct while hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers. Police also dispersed groups that had rallied outside of the city hall for a third night running, after the opposition Republican People's Party leader, Ozgur Ozel, delivered a speech in support of the mayor.

Simultaneously, police broke up demonstrations in Ankara, the capital, as well as in the Aegean coastal city of Izmir, resorting to forceful measures at times, according to television images. Thousands marched in several other cities calling on the government to resign.

Earlier, Erdogan said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and terror organizations. Authorities in Ankara and Izmir meanwhile announced a five-day ban on demonstrations, following a similar measure imposed earlier in Istanbul.

“An anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,” Erdogan said.

Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.

The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday — through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey — to show solidarity with Imamoglu.

In a message posted on his social media account Saturday, Imamoglu described his arrest as a “coup” and accused the government of exploiting the judiciary and worsening the country's troubled economy.

“With your support, we will first defeat this coup, and then we will send packing those who caused this,” he wrote on the social media platform X.

Electric tricycles are transforming the lives of some women in parts of rural Zimbabwe. They offer financial independence and social empowerment in a society long seen as deeply patriarchal.

WEDZA, Zimbabwe (AP) — Anna Bhobho, a 31-year-old housewife from rural Zimbabwe, was once a silent observer in her home, excluded from financial and family decision-making in the deeply patriarchal society. Today, she is a driver of change in her village, thanks to an electric tricycle she now owns.

In many parts of rural sub-Saharan Africa, women have long been excluded from mainstream economic activities such as operating public transportation. However, three-wheelers powered by green energy are reversing that trend, offering financial opportunities and a newfound sense of importance.

“My husband now looks up to me to take care of a large chunk of expenses, including buying furniture and other assets,” Bhobho said at a market where she delivers crops for farmers in Wedza district, about 150 kilometers (nearly 100 miles) from Harare.

Called “Hamba,” meaning “go” in Ndebele, the tricycles are powered by solar-charged lithium-ion batteries. Mobility for Africa, a local startup, piloted the project in 2019 by leasing the vehicles to groups of women for $15 a month. Today, individual women like Bhobho can own them through a lease-to-purchase program.

“I used to depend on my husband for everything, even money for bread,” she said.

Bhobho now owns land, has opened a small grocery store, is paying off a car and has moved her children from an underfunded rural public school to a better-equipped private institution. She earns up to $300 a month, comparable to government workers like schoolteachers.




Beyond material gains, she has gained self-esteem.

“Even my husband and in-laws have more respect for me now. No one used to listen to me, but now I have a seat when important decisions are being made,” the mother of three said.

According to Carlin Thandi Ngandu, the community engagement coordinator for Mobility for Africa, 300 women across Zimbabwe are part of the program, with a goal of ensuring that 70% of the beneficiaries are women.

In Wedza, only women own and operate the tricycles. They receive training in safe driving skills, and swapping a lithium battery for a fully recharged one after about 100 kilometers (about 70 miles) costs $1.

Motorcycles are a common public transport in sub-Saharan Africa, with some now switching to electric to cut fuel costs. The United Nations environmental program is introducing electric two and three-wheelers in nine countries, mostly in East Africa. In Nigeria, a green energy firm and the United Kingdom's Foreign Office are providing 120 electric three-wheelers to women, promoting sustainability and economic empowerment.

In Zimbabwe, the lives of many women have changed dramatically, even for those who don't own tricycles but use them for daily chores. Gone are the days of carrying firewood, buckets of water or heavy farm produce over long distances.

The tricycles, able to navigate narrow paths inaccessible to cars, reach remote homesteads and vegetable gardens. Their affordability makes them accessible to locals.

Hilda Takadini, a tomato farmer, said her business has flourished since she started using Bhobho's transport services. Previously, she had to leave home at 3 a.m., using an ox-drawn cart to travel 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the market. Often, she arrived too late or not at all, and her tomatoes rotted.

“I get better prices because now I reach the market on time with my tomatoes still fresh. Even the children now know they can rely on me for school fees,” said the 34-year-old mother of six.

At Wedza shopping center, nearly a dozen women line up with their tricycles, which can carry loads of up to 450 kilograms (nearly 1,000 pounds) and have a top speed of 60 kph (37 mph), waiting for customers. They transport passengers, patients heading to hospitals and people carrying building materials such as bricks, groceries and firewood.

However, the women have to contend with challenges such as rough terrain worsened by recent rains, as well as a number of men resistant to seeing women lead in traditionally male-dominated spaces, Bhobho said.

Beyond business, the tricycles are revolutionizing health care access, particularly for women and children. Josephine Nyevhe, a volunteer community health worker, uses her tricycle to bring medical services closer to rural families.

On a recent afternoon, a group of mothers with children waited at a roadside. Nyevhe arrived on her tricycle, hung a weighing scale on a tree branch and began measuring the children's growth. She recorded details in her notebook, offered nutrition advice and referred severe cases to the local clinic.

Many times, her tricycle has served as a village ambulance.

“I am on 24-hour standby. I get calls during odd hours and have to rush people to the hospital. Sometimes it's a pregnant woman who would have otherwise given birth at home in unsafe conditions,” said Nyevhe, wearing her brown uniform.

STANSTEAD, Quebec (AP) — For more than 100 years, people in Stanstead, Quebec have been able to walk into Derby Line, Vermont to enter the border-straddling Haskell Free Library and Opera House – no passport required.

But municipal and library officials said on Friday that U.S. authorities have unilaterally decided to end the century-old unwritten agreement. Coming at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries, the decision is prompting an outpouring of emotion in communities on both sides of the border, which in places has been marked simply by flower pots.

Inside the library celebrated as a symbol of international friendship, Pauline Lussier and Chris Blais put their arms around each other's shoulders Friday as they stood on either side of the line taped down the floor marking the border. Lussier, a Canadian, and Blais, an American met for the first time that day.

“A line doesn't separate us, it never has,” said Blais, who held an American flag in her hands while Lussier held a Canadian one.

“Our kids have gone back and forth over this border without any problem at all ... this is all going to change now, and there's no reason for this,” Blais added.

Once inside the library, Canadian and American citizens have been able to mingle freely across the border line drawn on the floor – as long as they return to the proper country afterward. In 2016, then-president Barack Obama hailed the symbolic importance of the library, built in 1901. “A resident of one of these border towns once said, ‘We're two different countries, but we're like one big town,'” Obama said.




A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP, confirmed that the divide is about to become more pronounced. Starting in the coming days, only library card holders and employees will be able to cross over from Canada to enter the building through the main door on the U.S. side.

And as of Oct. 1, no Canadians will be able to enter the library via the United States without going through the border checkpoint, though there will be exceptions for law enforcement, emergency services, mail delivery, official workers and those with disabilities.

The statement acknowledged the library as a “unique landmark,” but said the border agency was phasing in a new approach for security reasons.

“Due to the library's location, and convenience of local populations, CBP has allowed customers of the library to access its sidewalk, without inspection, for decades,” the agency said in a statement. “However, during that time, this area has witnessed a continued rise in illicit cross-border activity.”

It noted there have been a number of incidents in and around the library that resulted in apprehensions in recent years, including a person attempting to smuggle firearms in the past year.

Town and library officials say Canadian visitors without a library card will have to enter by a back door on the Canadian side, across a muddy stretch of grass. The library announced Friday that it was launching a GoFundMe to raise the estimated $100,000 Canadian (US$69,000) it will cost to build a sidewalk, new parking lot and wheelchair access.

Stanstead Mayor Jody Stone said the U.S. decision “makes no sense.” However, he said the decision from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration would not affect the close bond between the communities, which share municipal services and facilities.

“No matter what this administration does, it will not change the fact that Stanstead and Derby Line are partners and friends forever,” he said.

Several residents, some in tears, gathered at the border to denounce the decision. Penny Thomas stood on the American side, holding up a sign with a maple leaf on it that said “Keep Haskell open.”

In February, the Boston Globe reported that the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the library and repeated Trump's taunts about making Canada the 51st state as she stepped back and forth across the line that marks the border.

According to the library's website, Canadian visitors had been allowed to enter the library by the main entrance on the U.S. side. While passports or visas were not necessary, library officials had warned that U.S. Border Patrol and RCMP would monitor movements and could request to see identification.

CAIRO (AP) — When the first explosions in Gaza this week started around 1:30 a.m., a visiting British doctor went to the balcony of a hospital in Khan Younis and watched the streaks of missiles light up the night before pounding the city. A Palestinian surgeon next to him gasped, “Oh no. Oh no.”

After two months of ceasefire, the horror of Israeli bombardment was back. The veteran surgeon told the visiting doctor, Sakib Rokadiya, they'd better head to the emergency ward.

Torn bodies soon streamed in, carried by ambulances, donkey carts or in the arms of terrified relatives. What stunned doctors was the number of children.

“Just child after child, young patient after young patient,” Rokadiya said. “The vast, vast majority were women, children, the elderly.”

This was the start of a chaotic 24 hours at Nasser Hospital, the largest hospital in southern Gaza. Israel shattered the ceasefire in place since mid-January with a surprise barrage that began early Tuesday and was meant to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and accepting changes in the truce's terms. It turned into one of the deadliest days in the 17-month war.

The aerial attacks killed 409 people across Gaza, including 173 children and 88 women, and hundreds more were wounded, according to the territory's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between militants and civilians.

More than 300 casualties flooded into Nasser Hospital. Like other medical facilities around Gaza, it had been damaged by Israeli raids and strikes throughout the war, leaving it without key equipment. It was also running short on antibiotics and other essentials. On March 2, when the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire technically expired, Israel blocked entry of medicine, food and other supplies to Gaza.

Nasser Hospital's emergency ward filled with wounded, in a scene described to The Associated Press by Rokadiya and Tanya Haj-Hassan, an American pediatrician — both volunteers with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. Wounded came from a tent camp sheltering displaced that missiles set ablaze and from homes struck in Khan Younis and Rafah, further south. 

One nurse was trying to resuscitate a boy sprawled on the floor with shrapnel in his heart. A young man with most of his arm gone sat nearby, shivering. A barefoot boy carried in his younger brother, around 4 years old, whose foot had been blown off. Blood was everywhere on the floor, with bits of bone and tissue.

“I was overwhelmed, running from corner to corner, trying to find out who to prioritize, who to send to the operating room, who to declare a case that's not salvageable,” said Haj-Hassan.

“It's a very difficult decision, and we had to make it multiple times,” she said in a voice message.

Wounds could be easy to miss. One little girl seemed OK – it just hurt a bit when she breathed, she told Haj-Hassan -- but when they undressed her they determined she was bleeding into her lungs. Looking through the curly hair of another girl, Haj-Hassan discovered she had shrapnel in her brain.

Two or three wounded at a time were squeezed onto gurneys and sped off to surgery, Rokadiya said.

He scrawled notes on slips of paper or directly on the patient's skin – this one to surgery, this one for a scan. He wrote names when he could, but many kids were brought in by strangers, their parents dead, wounded or lost in the mayhem. So he often wrote, “UNKNOWN.”

Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, an American trauma surgeon from California with the medical charity MedGlobal, rushed immediately to the area where the hospital put the worst-off patients still deemed possible to save.

But the very first little girl he saw -- 3 or 4 years old -- was too far gone. Her face was mangled by shrapnel. “She was technically still alive,” Sidhwa said, but with so many other casualties “there was nothing we could do.”

He told the girl's father she was going to die. Sidhwa went on to do some 15 operations, one after another.

Khaled Alserr, a Palestinian surgeon, and an Irish volunteer surgeon were doing the same. There was a 29-year-old woman whose pelvis was smashed, the webbing of veins around the bones was bleeding heavily. They did what they could in surgery, but she died 10 hours later in the intensive care unit.

There was a 6-year-old boy with two holes in his heart, two in his colon and three more in his stomach, Sidhwa said. They repaired the holes and restarted his heart after he went into cardiac arrest.

He, too, died hours later.

“They died because the ICU simply does not have the capacity to care for them,” Sidhwa said.

Ahmed al-Farra, head of the pediatric and obstetrics department, said that was in part because the ICU lacks strong antibiotics. 

Sidhwa recalled how he was at Boston Medical Center when the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing happened, killing three people and sending some 260 wounded to area hospitals.

Boston Medical “couldn't handle this influx of cases” seen at Nasser Hospital, he said. 

Rokadiya marveled at how the hospital staff took care of each other under duress. Workers circulated with water to give sips to doctors and nurses. Cleaners whisked away the bloody clothes, blankets, tissues and medical debris accumulating on the floors.

At the same time, some staff had their own family members killed in the strikes. 

Alserr, the Palestinian surgeon, had to go to the morgue to identify the bodies of his wife's father and brother.

“The only thing I saw was like a packet of meat and bones, melted and fractured,” he said in a voice message, without giving details on the circumstances their deaths. 

Another staffer lost his wife and kids. An anesthesiologist -- whose mother and 21 other relatives were killed earlier in the war -- later learned his father, his brother and a cousin were killed, Haj-Hassan said.

Around 85 people died at Nasser Hospital on Tuesday, including around 40 children from ages 1 to 17, al-Farra said.

Strikes continued throughout the week, killing several dozen more people. At least six prominent Hamas figures were among those killed Tuesday. 

Israel says it will keep targeting Hamas, demanding it release more hostages, even though Israel has ignored ceasefire requirements for it to first negotiate a long-term end to the war. Israel says it does not target civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because it operates among the population.

With Tuesday's bombardment, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also secured the return to his government of a right-wing party that had demanded a resumption of the war, solidifying his coalition ahead of a crucial budget vote that could have brought him down.

Haj-Hassan keeps checking in on children in Nasser's ICU. The girl with shrapnel in her brain still can't move her right side. Her mother came to see her, limping from her own wounds, and told Haj-Hassan that the little girl's sisters had been killed.

“I cannot process or comprehend the scale of mass killing and massacre of families in their sleep that we are seeing here,” Haj-Hassan said. “This can't be the world we're living in.”

A fire at an electrical substation knocked out power to the airport for most of Friday, forcing Europe's busiest hub to shut down for roughly 18 hours, causing widespread cancellations and rerouting headaches, and stranding roughly 200,000 passengers.

British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expects to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday.

While Heathrow reopened on Saturday, airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations.

LONDON (AP) — The British government on Saturday ordered an investigation into the country's “energy resilience” after an electrical substation fire shut Heathrow Airport for almost a day and raised concerns about the U.K.'s ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure. 

While Heathrow Airport said it was “fully operational” on Saturday, thousands of passengers remained stuck, and airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations. 

Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe's busiest air hub.

“This is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It's a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,” said Toby Harris, a Labour Party politician who heads the National Preparedness Commission, a group that campaigns to improve resilience.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he'd asked the National Energy System Operator, which oversees U.K. gas and electricity networks, to “urgently investigate” the fire, “to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.” 

It is expected to report initial findings within six weeks.

“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,” Miliband said.

More than 1,300 flights were canceled and some 200,000 people stranded Friday after an overnight fire at a substation 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away from the airport cut power to Heathrow, and to more than 60,000 properties.

Heathrow said Saturday it had “added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers.” British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expected to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday. 

While many passengers managed to resume stalled journeys, others remained in limbo.

Laura Fritschie from Kansas City was on vacation with her family in Ireland when she learned that her father had died. On Saturday she was stranded at Heathrow after her BA flight to Chicago was canceled at the last minute.

“I'm very frustrated,” she said. “This was my first big vacation with my kids since my husband died, and ... now this. So I just want to go home.”

Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion and then seeing a fireball and clouds of smoke when the blaze ripped through the substation. The fire was brought under control after seven hours, but the airport was shut for almost 18 hours. A handful of flights took off and landed late Friday.

Police said they do not consider the fire suspicious, and the London Fire Brigade said its investigation would focus on the electrical distribution equipment at the substation.

Still, the huge impact of the fire left authorities facing questions about Britain's creaking infrastructure, much of which has been privatized since the 1980s. The center-left Labour government has vowed to improve the U.K.'s delay-plagued railways, its aged water system and — especially — its energy network, promising to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy independence through investment in wind and other renewable power sources.

“The last 40, 50 years we've tried to make services more efficient,” said Harris. “We've stripped out redundancy, we've simplified processes. We've moved towards a sort of ‘just in time' economy. There is an element where you have to make sure you're available for ‘just in case.' You have to plan for things going wrong.”

Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year. 

Chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he was “proud” of the way airport and airline staff had responded.

“The airport didn't shut for days. We shut for hours,” he told the BBC.

Woldbye said Heathrow's backup power supply, designed for emergencies, worked as expected, but it wasn't enough to run the whole airport, which uses as much energy as a small city.

“That's how most airports operate,” said Woldbye, who insisted “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar blaze.

But Willie Walsh, who heads aviation trade organization IATA, said the episode “begs some serious questions.”

“How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,” he said.

Walsh said “Heathrow has very little incentive to improve” because airlines, not the airport, have to pay the cost of looking after disrupted passengers.

Friday's disruption was one of the most serious since the 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut Europe's airspace for days.

Passengers on about 120 flights were in the air when Friday's closure was announced and found themselves landing in different cities, and even different countries.

Mark Doherty and his wife were halfway across the Atlantic when the inflight map showed their flight from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to Heathrow was turning around.

“I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.

Doherty called the situation “typical England — got no back-up plan for something happens like this. There's no contingency plan.”

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to visit the Philippines, the first stop in his first trip to Asia next week, for talks that will include increasing deterrence against aggression in the disputed South China Sea, a Philippine official said Friday.

Hegseth will be in Manila on March 28-29 to meet his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Talks will touch on increasingly assertive actions by Beijing in the South China Sea and “more significant support” to Philippine security forces by the Trump administration, Philippine Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Manuel Romualdez told The Associated Press.

In the U.S., chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell later said Hegseth will visit Hawaii to meet civilian and military leaders in the Indo-Pacific Command then tour U.S. military facilities in Guam and receive briefings on capabilities before flying to the Philippines and Japan.

Hegseth would “advance security objectives with Philippine leaders and meet with U.S. and Philippine forces. In Japan, he would participate in a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima and meet with Japanese leaders and U.S. military forces, Parnell said and added without elaborating that ”as always, the secretary looks forward to some great PT (physical training) with the troops!”

“These engagements will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our alliances and partnerships toward our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said. The trip “comes as the United States builds on unprecedented cooperation with like-minded countries to strengthen regional security.”




Trump's “America First” foreign policy thrust has triggered concerns about the scale and depth of U.S. commitment to the region under his new term.

“It's a strong message to China on solid bilateral relations” between the U.S. and the Philippines,” Romualdez said of Hegseth's upcoming visit.

China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a major security and global trade route. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also lay overlapping claims to the resource-rich and busy waters, but confrontations have particularly spiked between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces in the last two years.

In his first telephone talk with Teodoro last month, Hegseth “reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and its importance for maintaining a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” according to a readout provided by Pentagon spokesperson John Ullyot after the Feb. 5 call.

“The leaders discussed the importance of reestablishing deterrence in the South China Sea, including by working with allies and partners,” Ullyot said. “They also discussed enhancing the capability and capacity of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.”

After major territorial faceoffs between Chinese and Philippine forces in the disputed waters, the previous Biden administration had repeatedly warned that the U.S. is obligated to help defend the Philippines under the treaty if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea.

Beijing has warned Washington, in return, to stay out of what it calls a purely Asian dispute and stop actions that endanger regional harmony and stability.

Hegseth's visit to the Philippines comes a month before the longtime treaty allies hold the “Balikatan,” Tagalog for shoulder to shoulder, their largest annual combat exercises that include live-fire drills, that in recent years have been held near the South China Sea and the sea border between the Philippines and Taiwan.

Taiwan i s the self-governing island that China claims as its own territory and which it has been threatening to annex by force.

▶ Follow the latest updates on Heathrow Airport.

LONDON (AP) — Heathrow Airport was up and running Saturday and airlines worked to clear the backlog after a fire at a nearby electricity substation knocked out power to Europe's busiest airport, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of thousands of people around the world. 

The airport said it had made space for extra flights, but it is expected to take days to get stranded passengers to their destinations and displaced aircraft into the proper locations.

Here's a look at what happened and its impact on air travel.

A fire at an electrical substation in west London, about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the airport, cut power to Heathrow Airport late on Thursday.

Residents reported an explosion and a fireball just before midnight. The London Fire Brigade said a transformer holding 25,000 liters (5,000 gallons) of cooling oil caught fire. It said 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters brought the blaze under control after seven hours, but isolated hotspots were still alight 24 hours after the fire started.

National Grid, which maintains energy infrastructure in Britain, said the blaze damaged equipment at the substation and cut power to 67,000 properties, including Heathrow. It said power was restored to all of them by Saturday morning.

The “significant power outage” initially forced Heathrow officials to announce that the airport would be closed until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, but some flights began to resume on Friday evening. 







Officials said there was no suggestion of foul play, but the cause is still under investigation. The fire brigade said its investigation would focus on the electrical distribution equipment at the substation.

Even so, London's Metropolitan Police Service said counterterrorism detectives were leading the investigation because of the fire's impact on critical national infrastructure.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was “an unprecedented event.”

“Obviously, with any incident like this we will want to understand why it happened and what if any lessons it has for our infrastructure,” he told Sky News.

The closure disrupted the travel plans of around 200,000 people who were expected to travel through Heathrow on Friday. Heathrow advised passengers not to travel to the airport and to contact their airlines to rebook flights.

With all takeoffs and landings canceled, the first impact was on dozens of long-haul flights from North America and Asia that were in the air when the airport was shut down. Some were forced to turn around, while others were diverted to airports around the United Kingdom and Europe. 

Heathrow-bound aircraft landed at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam; Shannon Airport in western Ireland; Glasgow, Scotland; Manchester, England; Charles de Gaulle in Paris; Lyon, France; and Frankfurt, Germany, among others.

About 4,000 tons of cargo were also stranded by the closure, according to Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and leadership consultant.

The disruptions are expected to last for days as airlines move stranded aircraft and flight crews back into position and work to accommodate passengers whose flights were canceled. Mendiratta estimated that it would take two to four days to clear all the backlogs.

“This is an extreme situation where the entire aviation ecosystem is impacted,” she said.

“There will be two things that will be happening as a priority No. 1. First is airport operations and understanding, from an electrical system point of view, what has been impacted, if anything,” she said. “Did anything short out, for instance? What needs to be reactivated? And then how do you literally turn the airport back on again?”

Heathrow was Europe's busiest airport last year, with 83.6 million passengers traveling through it. Its closure will have far-reaching impacts because it's a major hub for connecting flights to cities throughout the U.K. and around the world, as well as for travel to London.

Yes. Five other air hubs in southeastern England identify themselves as London airports, but they are much smaller than Heathrow. London Gatwick, Britain's second-biggest airport, handled 43.2 million passengers last year. It's located in the town of Crawley, 28 miles (45 kilometers) south of London.

The fire raises concerns about the U.K.'s ability to withstand attacks or natural disasters that damage critical infrastructure such as communications and power networks, analysts said.

The incident is particularly worrisome given recent comments by Britain's security services that Russia is conducting a reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe, said Alan Mendoza, the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based security think tank.

“The U.K.'s critical national infrastructure is not sufficiently hardened for anywhere near the level it would need to be at to give us confidence this won't happen again,” he said. “I mean, if one fire can shut down Heathrow's primary systems ... it tells you something's badly wrong with our system of management of such disasters.”

Robin Potter, an expert on resilience at London-based think tank Chatham House, said that successive governments have been slow to respond to repeated recommendations from the National Infrastructure Commission to strengthen the ability of Britain's power, communications, transport and water networks to withstand major shocks.

“We still have yet to see a kind of clear response from the government to those recommendations,” he said. “And we hope that maybe in the government's upcoming resilience review, which we expect will be published at some point this year, it might seek to address some of those questions.”

Heathrow defended its response. Its CEO Thomas Woldbye said “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar fire.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia's war in Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian security official in Pyongyang, North Korean state media said Saturday.

Friday's meeting between Kim and Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Security Council secretary, followed a South Korean intelligence assessment in late February that North Korea had likely sent additional troops to Russia after its forces suffered heavy casualties fighting in the Russian-Ukraine war. Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the two countries' leaders, though it remains to be seen when it might take effect and what targets would be off-limits.

North Korean and Russian state media said Kim and Shoigu discussed various issues, including Russia's war in Ukraine, Moscow's dialogues with the Trump administration and the security situation on the Korean Peninsula. They reaffirmed the willingness of the two countries' leaders to “unconditionally” uphold a major mutual defense treaty reached at a summit last year in Pyongyang, which pledges mutual assistance if either country faces aggression, according to the reports. 

North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Kim during the meeting said his government will “invariably support Russia in the struggle for defending the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests.” 

Shoigu conveyed a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who extended his greetings to Kim and vowed to give “utmost attention” to implementing agreements reached in their recent summits. He expressed gratitude for North Korea's “solidarity with Russia's position on all critical geopolitical issues, particularly on the Ukrainian issue,” according to his televised comments.




North Korean and Russia media didn't say whether any new agreements were reached before Shoigu departed Pyongyang later on Friday.

North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia, and last fall it sent about 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials. In its Feb. 27 statement, South Korea's National Intelligence Service said it was trying to determine exactly how many more troops North Korea has deployed to Russia. South Korean media put the number of newly deployed North Korean soldiers at about 1,000 to 3,000.

South Korea, the U.S. and others suspect North Korea is receiving economic and military assistance from Russia in return for providing weapons and troops. Many experts say North Korea will likely ramp up its support of Russia to win as many benefits as possible from Russia before the war ends. 

Shoigu's trip could be related to preparations for Kim to visit Russia, some observers say. Putin invited Kim to visit Moscow when he visited Pyongyang last year for the summit.

In 2023, when Shoigu, then a defense minister, traveled to North Korea, Kim gave him a personal tour of a North Korean arms exhibition in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. In September 2024, Shoigu, then in the new security council post, went to North Korea again for a meeting with Kim, and the two discussed expanding cooperation, according to North Korea's state media.

Earlier Friday, KCNA said Kim oversaw the test-launches of new anti-aircraft missiles the previous day. It cited Kim as calling the missiles “another major defense weapons system” for North Korea.

The missile launches, North Korea's sixth weapons testing activity this year, occurred on the same day that the U.S. and South Korean militaries concluded their annual training that North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal. The 11-day Freedom Shield exercise was the allies' first major joint military training since Trump's inauguration in January.

North Korea often responds to major U.S.-South Korean military drills with its own weapons tests and fiery rhetoric. Hours after this year's Freedom Shield training began on March 10, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea.

TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday U.S. President Donald Trump will ultimately respect Canada's sovereignty and be ready for comprehensive trade talks because Americans are going to suffer from Trump's trade war. 

Carney said talks with Trump will not happen “until we get the respect we deserve as a sovereign nation. By the way, this is not a high bar.”

Trump kept up his near-daily attacks on Canada on Friday, repeating that the country should be the 51st state and that the U.S. keeps Canada “afloat.” 

“When I say they should be a state, I mean that,” the American president said. 

Carney met with Canada's provincial leaders at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, where he announced relief packages for workers and businesses hurt by the trade war and announced moves to expedite resource projects. 

Carney, sworn in last Friday, still hasn't had a phone call with Trump. Trump mocked Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, by calling him Governor Trudeau, but he has not yet mentioned Carney's name. 

The new prime minister said he wants a comprehensive discussion on trade and security with the Americans and not a one-off tariff discussion. 

“In the end, Americans are going to lose from American trade action and that's one of the reasons I am confident that there will be that discussion with the appropriate amount of respect and the breadth,” Carney said. “I am ready for it anytime they are ready.”




Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products as well as all of America's trading partners on April 2. 

Carney became Prime Minister after winning a Liberal Party leadership race triggered by Trudeau's decision to step down earlier this year. He's expected to trigger the process for early parliamentary elections this Sunday, with a vote expected before April 28.

The governing Liberals appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war and upended Canadian politics. 

The almost daily attacks on Canada's sovereignty have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips south of the border and avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered Liberal poll numbers. 

Carney said the premiers of Canada's provinces had agreed to work on a plan to develop a national trade and energy corridor in an effort to diversify trade. 

He said that could mean a oil pipeline from oil-rich Alberta to Eastern Canada. Quebec has previously opposed a pipeline, but Premier François Legault now says opinions are changing because of Trump's threats. Carney said Quebec uses about 350,000 barrels of oil daily and 70% of that comes from the U.S. 

“That is not a good idea for us at all. So there is an opportunity to put a pipeline there but we need social acceptance. We need a partnership with indigenous people as well,” Carney said. 

He said the federal government would speed up projects by recognizing provincial assessments. Canadian leaders also talked about about moving quickly to eliminate trade barriers between provinces and with the federal government.

Carney also said Ottawa is also going to waive the one-week waiting period to get employment insurance for people whose jobs are cut because of the tariffs, and temporarily allow Canadian businesses to defer income tax and sales tax payments to help boost their liquidity.

TOKYO (AP) — Foreign ministers from Japan, China and South Korea sought trilateral cooperation on common ground in areas like aging, declining births, natural disasters and the green economy at a meeting that took place at a time of growing tensions.

At a joint news conference after the talks, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said he, his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and South Korea's Cho Tae-yul agreed to promote mutual understanding and trust, while tackling shared and multi-generational concerns to gain wider support for trilateral cooperation.

Iwaya emphasized his concerns about North Korea' s nuclear and missile development and cooperation with Russia as threats, and stressed the need to pursue the North's full denuclearization under the U.N. Security Council resolutions. 

Iwaya reiterated Japan's condemnation of Russia's war on Ukraine. He said there is no place in the world for unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force, a subtle message about China's growing assertiveness in the region.

Wang said China supports the formation of a mutual regional economy and proposed resuming talks on an economic framework for the three countries and promoting an expansion of the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP. 

Wang said trilateral cooperation in areas including technology and climate exchange will “serve as key driving force for East Asian cooperation.” 




Saturday's meeting focused on plans for a trilateral leaders' summit later this year amid growing political and economic uncertainty at home and challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump. 

The three-way meetings are an accomplishment for Japan, which has historical and territorial disputes with both China and South Korea. Iwaya said he will accelerate efforts toward achieving a leaders' summit in Japan later this year. 

Separately, delegations from Japan and China later Saturday held their first high-level economic dialogue since April 2019, attended by dozens of officials from finance, economy, transportation, environment, health and labor ministries. 

Expanding cooperation into new areas and strengthening of communication are key to promoting comprehensive and mutually strategic relations between Japan and China, Wang said.

But the global economy now faces serious changes, with unilateralism and protectionism accelerating and politicizing of science and technology, as well as expansion of national security have become rampant, Wang said in an apparent criticisms to Trump. 

Iwaya later told reporters that Japan and China acknowledged progress in their mutually agreed process toward a lifting of China's ban on Japanese seafood imports. Beijing has banned Japanese seafood since the August 2023 start of discharges of treated radioactive wastewater into the sea from the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

Iwaya and Cho separately met and reaffirmed their commitment to maintain communication to resolve bilateral issues, cooperating for North Korea's complete denuclearization and strengthening three-way cooperation with the United States amid growing global uncertainties, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said. 

Tokyo and Beijing agreed in December to improve ties in spite of their differences, including disputes over their territorial row in the East China Sea and wartime history.

Rome's Trevi Fountain is one of Italy's most popular monuments, but few visitors are aware of where its water comes from. The source is the Acqua Virgo, an ancient Roman aqueduct 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the city center and hidden behind the fountain is a manoeuvring chamber which controls the water coming in.















































ROME (AP) — The Trevi Fountain, arguably the world's most famous, has graced screens for decades, from Fellini's “La Dolce Vita” to Netflix's “Emily in Paris.” Each year, millions of visitors push through Rome's narrow streets to gaze at the towering Titan god flanked by falls cascading into a turquoise pool.

Yet, they never get to venture behind Oceanus' back to see what produces the sublime play of water in the baroque masterpiece.

Wooden doors on an adjacent street lead to the maneuvering chambers that control the fountain's water supply, coming from the Aqua Virgo — an ancient Roman aqueduct 16 kilometers (10 miles) away. Two electric pumps recycle 126 liters (33 gallons) of water per second while Rome's water management company, ACEA, carefully monitors the flow around the clock.

This precise amount is crucial for the movement of water through the statues; a little more or less, and it wouldn't work, said Davide D'Alonzo, ACEA's manager for the area. 

The modern maneuvering chamber features metal tanks and lighted panels. In the original, arched chamber, water audibly rushes through a thick pipe and there is a functional, 18th-century hydrometer to gauge the fountain's water level.

A large, rudimentary spreadsheet on the wall displays the names of rich Roman families whose homes received water from the chamber long ago; when they fell behind on their payments, their supply was cut off.




The chamber's grated windows grant views out over the fountain and its many visitors — all of whom are oblivious to its hidden waterworks. They toss coins over their shoulders into the water, a hopeful gesture based on a legend that it guarantees their return to the eternal city.

DONOSO, Panama (AP) — Between emerald sea and jungled hills, the Cobre Panama copper mine has fueled mass protests across the Central American country.

Buried in the rolling hills and dense jungles of Panama's eastern Caribbean Donoso region, the mine is marked by heavy machinery and rubble slicing into the earth, clashing with the vivid blues and green of the vast nature enveloping it.

More than a year ago, it became the heart of protests rippling across Panama. 

The country-wide protests blocked off roads and fueled shortages in much of the country, prompting Panama's Supreme Court to halt operations.

Now, the new administration is signaling that the mine may roar back to life.

        Israel struck Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for rockets targeting Israel, in the heaviest exchange of fire since the ceasefire.
    

Israel struck Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for rockets targeting Israel, in the heaviest exchange of fire since the ceasefire. 

Earlier, rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, for the second time since December, sparking concern about whether the fragile ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah would hold.  

Israel had said on Saturday that it would respond “severely” to the attack from Lebanon early Saturday morning, when rockets were fired into northern Israel. Israel's army said the intercepted rockets targeted the Israeli town of Metula.  

 Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day afte Hamas' attack on October 7, 2023 out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into an all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.  

Under the ceasefire reached in November, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was then extended to Feb. 18 by agreement between Lebanon and Israel. 

But since then, Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel, and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country. 

Israel's Prime Minister's office said on Saturday it instructed the army to act forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, adding: “Israel will not allow any harm to its citizens and sovereignty."" Israel's army said Saturday it was carrying out strikes on Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon.  

There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah.  

In a statement, Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south, but said the country did not want to return to war.  

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, saying further escalation could have serious consequences for the region.

        George Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history.
    

The fearsome heavyweight, who lost the “Rumble in the Jungle” to Muhammad Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died on Friday night. 

Few fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman — and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started. 

A full 20 years after his bout with Ali, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorer's title in an epic upset. 

Foreman's family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died. 

“A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,"" his family wrote. “A humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.” 

A native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire - now DR Congo - baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt. 

Foreman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening. 

The middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer — 19 years his junior — with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorer's two heavyweight belts. Foreman's 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns. 

Foreman's transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times — finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts — before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor. 

Outside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did. 

“George was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,” Top Rank president Bob Arum said. “We've lost a family member and are absolutely devastated.” 

In the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success. 

Foreman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston's Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance. 

Foreman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanour and through the skewed racial lenses of the time. 

Jim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The Associated Press on Friday night that Foreman's initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s. 

“At some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasn't him,"" Lampley said. 

Foreman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell's iconic call: “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!” 

Foreman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the “rope-a-dope” strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round. 

Foreman told the BBC in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke. 

“I said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, ‘Please, don't say you're going to kill Muhammad,'” Foreman said. “So I said, ‘OK, I'll just beat him down to the ground.' That's how easy I thought the fight would be.” 

Exhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991. 

Three years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion. 

Lampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography — which includes a prologue about Foreman — after his famous call of that moment: “It Happened!” 

Foreman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter. 

“He started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face,"" Lampley recalled. ""When I was working with him, people would say, ‘George is a big clown.' And I would say, ‘Well, you can call him a clown, but he's actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius I've ever met.' And people would say, ‘Well, genius, what do you mean?' I'd say, ‘Well, check the bank account. If that isn't proof enough, I don't know what is.' So, he was a genius. He was a human genius.” 

Foreman briefly starred in a sitcom called “George” in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition “The Masked Singer” in 2022. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023. 

Foreman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman. 

“Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,” WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. “His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.”

        Nearly 600 Palestinians have now been killed since the truce between Israel and Hamas was shattered on Tuesday.
    

Israeli forces advanced deeper into the Gaza Strip on Friday and blew up the only specialised cancer hospital in the war-torn territory.

The violence came as Israeli leaders vowed to capture more land until Hamas releases its remaining hostages.

The hospital was located in the Netzarim Corridor, which splits Gaza in two and was controlled by Israeli troops for most of the 17-month-long war. Israel moved to retake the corridor this week shortly after breaking the ceasefire with Hamas. The truce delivered relative calm to Gaza since late January and facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages.

The Israeli military said it struck the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, which was inaccessible to doctors and patients during the war, because Hamas militants were operating in the site. Turkey, which helped build and fund the hospital, said Israeli troops at one point used it as a base.

Dr. Zaki Al-Zaqzouq, head of the hospital's oncology department, said a medical team visited the facility during the ceasefire and found that, while it had suffered damage, some facilities remained in good condition.

“I cannot fathom what could be gained from bombing a hospital that served as a lifeline for so many patients,” he said in a statement issued by the aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the hospital's destruction and accused Israel of deliberately “rendering Gaza uninhabitable and forcibly displacing the Palestinian people.”

Hospitals can lose their protected status under international law if they are used for military purposes, but any operations against them must be proportional. Human rights groups and U.N.-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza's health care system.

Israel's renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip threatens to be even deadlier and more destructive than the last, as it pursues wider aims with far fewer constraints.

Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday that his country would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity"" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive.

“The more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” Katz said.

The Israeli military said on Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighbourhoods west of Gaza City, and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas.

The warnings came shortly after the military said it intercepted two rockets fired from northern Gaza that set off sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. Hamas had also fired three rockets the previous day in its first attack since Israel ended the ceasefire.

A long-range missile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels set off air raid sirens over Jerusalem and central Israel for the fourth day in a row on Friday, with the military saying it was intercepted.

In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's push to fire the domestic security chief has deepened a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza. It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country's division of powers.

Hours after Netanyahu's Cabinet unanimously approved the firing of Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet security service, the Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to his dismissal until an appeal can be heard. Netanyahu's office had said Bar's dismissal was effective April 10, but that it could come earlier.

Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar. However, Netanyahu sounded defiant in a social media post on Friday evening, saying: “The State of Israel is a state of law and according to the law, the Israeli government decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

Critics say the move is a power grab by the prime minister against an independent-minded civil servant, and tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated in support of Bar, including outside Netanyahu's residence on Friday.

Netanyahu has resisted calls for an official state commission of inquiry into the attack and has tried to blame the failures on the army and security agencies.

A Shin Bet report into Hamas' 7 October 2023 attack that prompted the war in Gaza acknowledged failures by the security agency.

But it also said policies by the Netanyahu government created the conditions for the attack.

In addition to its report on the Hamas incursion, Netanyahu is reportedly also unhappy that Shin Bet has launched an investigation into connections between some of his close aides and Qatar.

Around 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war with a wave of predawn airstrikes across Gaza on Tuesday, which came as many families slept or prepared to start the daily fast for the holy month of Ramadan.

Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over the ceasefire negotiations.

The attack by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

This week marked the ninth yahrzeit of Yossi Kaltmann, my father and personal hero. Born in 1928 in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, he witnessed the horrors of the Holocaust and ultimately survived seven concentration camps before living as a proud Jew in Israel and Australia. As I commemorated his yahrzeit, I was sent an image that at first incensed me but later gave me hope and renewed strength. Appearing alongside a news story about a desecrated Jewish cemetery in Humenné, Slovakia, the photo depicted a weathered tombstone marked with a spray-painted black swastika. Before the war, Jews comprised one-third of Humenné's 7,000 residents; however, today there is virtually no Jewish life left in the city. The cemetery stands as the last testament to the once-thriving Jewish community that existed in Slovakia for many centuries.  The defacing of Jewish cemeteries is a phenomenon that shamefully still persists among the lowlifes and antisemites of the world who wish to degrade and demoralize us, as well as deny our ancestors the dignity of resting in peace. Last year, I traveled to Slovakia to pray by the graves of my ancestors, so this particular story hit closer to home than any previous one that I had read. Gravestones under restoration at Warsaw's largest Jewish cemetery, September 2024. (credit: Shira Li Bartov/JTA)However, as I looked closer at the photo of this swastika-tagged Jewish headstone, something unexpected transpired.The tombstone, with its inscription nearly completely worn away by centuries of erosion and weathering, still had two Hebrew words visible - piercing like a rainbow through a foggy and bleak storm. The words  “Menachem Chaim” – which literally means “comfort” and “life” – radiated through the grotesque graffiti, almost as if they were responding directly to the hateful symbol covering them. We don't know who Menachem Chaim was, or when he lived or died. But it seems as though God had used his tombstone as a canvas, intentionally placing a message of comfort and hope there for us to interpret it only centuries later.This corresponds to the natural world, where the antidote to a deadly plant is found within its very environs. Similarly, the vandals, in their blind hatred, inadvertently highlighted the very words that offer the perfect remedy to their venom. This echoes Talmud's statement that God creates the remedy before the disease (Megillah 13b).    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Significance of the name in context of Jewish burial sitesTHE NAME Menachem Chaim possesses even more significance, especially in the context of Jewish burial sites. Jewish tradition gives us three names for a cemetery, each revealing a different dimension of our relationship with death and memory. The first is beit hakvarot – a house of burial, acknowledging the physical and abrupt reality of death. The second is bait olam – a house of eternity, recognizing that spirituality transcends physical death.But it is the third name that the vandals unwittingly emphasized: beit hachaim – a house of life. This name emphasizes how in Judaism, cemeteries are not merely repositories of the dead but rather guardians of living memory.  Even after physical death, our nefesh – the life-force energy – remains present at the grave site. This is why the term nefesh is used in mystical sources to refer to the tombstone.By spraying their hateful symbols on that holy tombstone; by attempting to intimidate, scare, and silence the Jewish community – this pathetic and cowardly act actually strengthened our resolve and spiritual fortitude. Acts like this don't tear Jews apart; instead, they remind us of our shared history and destiny that transcends all geographic, denominational, and ideological divides.As I wrote in 2024 when neo-Nazis marched near my congregation in Columbus, Ohio: we have two choices in our response to hate. Rather than only seeking to punish the wrongdoers, we must also resolve to increase the good that we want to see in the world. This can be via increasing our acts of goodness and kindness, as well as doing mitzvahs to counteract the spiritual darkness of these hate crimes. WHEN MY dear father would put on tefillin each morning, wrapping the strap it in seven turns around his arm, he would think of each of the seven concentration camps he had survived.This was a conscious choice he made in his daily spiritual practice, to counteract the evil and negativity he lived through decades earlier. Every time the black strap coiled around his arm, he was reliving his liberation. It's been nine years since I saw him last wrap tefillin, but the conviction and strength with which he did so made it clear that our positive actions leave a powerful spiritual energy that dispels all darkness.Throughout the millennia of Jewish history, we all relive the story of Menachem Chaim. These two words say it all – our comfort comes from us as we live thriving and flourishing Jewish lives.When our people are defaced and defiled, we shine through as a holy and spiritual nation – a people who stand by each other in the face of hate and emerge stronger in spite of it. Just as my dad took his tragedy and turned it into a daily sense of meaning and purpose, we too can live with a great joie de vivre – a love for life that no vandal or terror agent can possibly obliterate.The writer, a rabbi, is co-director of the Lori Schottenstein Chabad Center of Columbus and co-director of LifeTown Columbus.

Last year, I traveled to Slovakia to pray by the graves of my ancestors, so this particular story hit closer to home than any previous one that I had read. Gravestones under restoration at Warsaw's largest Jewish cemetery, September 2024. (credit: Shira Li Bartov/JTA)However, as I looked closer at the photo of this swastika-tagged Jewish headstone, something unexpected transpired.The tombstone, with its inscription nearly completely worn away by centuries of erosion and weathering, still had two Hebrew words visible - piercing like a rainbow through a foggy and bleak storm. The words  “Menachem Chaim” – which literally means “comfort” and “life” – radiated through the grotesque graffiti, almost as if they were responding directly to the hateful symbol covering them. We don't know who Menachem Chaim was, or when he lived or died. But it seems as though God had used his tombstone as a canvas, intentionally placing a message of comfort and hope there for us to interpret it only centuries later.This corresponds to the natural world, where the antidote to a deadly plant is found within its very environs. Similarly, the vandals, in their blind hatred, inadvertently highlighted the very words that offer the perfect remedy to their venom. This echoes Talmud's statement that God creates the remedy before the disease (Megillah 13b).    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Significance of the name in context of Jewish burial sitesTHE NAME Menachem Chaim possesses even more significance, especially in the context of Jewish burial sites. Jewish tradition gives us three names for a cemetery, each revealing a different dimension of our relationship with death and memory. The first is beit hakvarot – a house of burial, acknowledging the physical and abrupt reality of death. The second is bait olam – a house of eternity, recognizing that spirituality transcends physical death.But it is the third name that the vandals unwittingly emphasized: beit hachaim – a house of life. This name emphasizes how in Judaism, cemeteries are not merely repositories of the dead but rather guardians of living memory.  Even after physical death, our nefesh – the life-force energy – remains present at the grave site. This is why the term nefesh is used in mystical sources to refer to the tombstone.By spraying their hateful symbols on that holy tombstone; by attempting to intimidate, scare, and silence the Jewish community – this pathetic and cowardly act actually strengthened our resolve and spiritual fortitude.

WHEN MY dear father would put on tefillin each morning, wrapping the strap it in seven turns around his arm, he would think of each of the seven concentration camps he had survived.This was a conscious choice he made in his daily spiritual practice, to counteract the evil and negativity he lived through decades earlier. Every time the black strap coiled around his arm, he was reliving his liberation. It's been nine years since I saw him last wrap tefillin, but the conviction and strength with which he did so made it clear that our positive actions leave a powerful spiritual energy that dispels all darkness.Throughout the millennia of Jewish history, we all relive the story of Menachem Chaim. These two words say it all – our comfort comes from us as we live thriving and flourishing Jewish lives.When our people are defaced and defiled, we shine through as a holy and spiritual nation – a people who stand by each other in the face of hate and emerge stronger in spite of it. Just as my dad took his tragedy and turned it into a daily sense of meaning and purpose, we too can live with a great joie de vivre – a love for life that no vandal or terror agent can possibly obliterate.The writer, a rabbi, is co-director of the Lori Schottenstein Chabad Center of Columbus and co-director of LifeTown Columbus.

Moscow threatened a ""symmetrical response"" to Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy facilities, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.This comes just a week after the United States negotiated a short-term partial ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine accused each other on Friday of blowing up a Russian gas pumping station in a border area where Ukrainian troops have been retreating. Unverified videos shared on Telegram showed a large fire at the station.   Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure in three years of fighting, and Ukraine has struck energy facilities in Russia.""As in 2022, provocations are being used again with the aim of disrupting the negotiation process. We are clearly warning that if the Kyiv regime continues its destructive line, the Russian Federation reserves the right to respond, including with a symmetrical response,"" the ministry said.

Over the past five years, the European Union, home to the third-largest Jewish community in the world after the US and Israel, has experienced a wave of antisemitism unprecedented since the end of World War II.The surge began during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Jews were accused, based on popular conspiracy theories, of developing, spreading, and even creating a cure for the virus to “reduce the world's population” or “increase Jewish control over the world.”Simultaneously, opponents of anti-COVID measures compared themselves to Jews persecuted by the Nazis. This distorted the memory of the Holocaust, misusing the Jewish experience of victimhood.  Next came the war in Ukraine, which sparked widespread antisemitic conspiracies. Jews were depicted as the “real” warmongers, either by financing Russian President Vladimir Putin or supporting the “Jew” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Once again, both warring sides appropriated Holocaust memory to accuse the other of being Nazis.Finally, the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7, 2023, led to a further explosion of hatred, including during the massacre itself and in the aftermath as Israel defended itself. EUROPEAN UNION flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels. (credit: YVES HERMAN/REUTERS)The typical antisemitic projection was at play: the victim – Israel – was portrayed as the “aggressor” committing “genocide,” while the genocidal aggressors, the Palestinians, were presented as victims.Jews across Europe were targeted, primarily by radical Muslims, and far left-wing antisemites. Attacks occurred on the streets, in Jewish institutions, on campuses, in the media, in football stadiums, and even during the Eurovision Song Contest, to name a few. In some parts of Europe, antisemitic threats and crimes increased by hundreds of percentage points. A survey conducted before October 7 by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) found that 75% to 90% of Jews in different European countries reported that antisemitism affects their daily lives. Since the attacks, most Jewish communities across the EU have reported a drastic deterioration in their situation.In response, the EU has equipped itself with new tools to combat antisemitism, realizing that it has not disappeared and, in fact, has grown with the influx of immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries.The EU now has a dedicated coordinator on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life, as well as a joint strategy for combating antisemitism and promoting Jewish life through 2030. The widely accepted International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism helps the EU understand what antisemitism entails, including its anti-Israel aspects.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  But can the EU truly combat antisemitism without acknowledging its own antisemitism?One glaring example of the EU's hypocrisy is the sanctions imposed on the former president of the European Jewish Congress, Dr. Moshe Kantor, following Russia's war on Ukraine.Kantor, a former businessman and philanthropist, led the EJC from 2007 until his stepping down in 2022 when he was included in a sanctions list targeting Russians accused of supporting and financing Putin's war. He was the only democratically elected leader of a religiously affiliated group to be sanctioned, despite having no business ties to the Russian president or his regime.Furthermore, he was the only individual on the list whose religious affiliation, Jewish, was explicitly mentioned. The EU Commission was subsequently forced to apologize for this error.However, the inclusion of Kantor's Jewishness may offer insight into the bias and carelessness surrounding the sanctions. The EU's claims against Kantor were based on dubious sources and Google-translated articles from publications that few had ever heard of. To make matters worse, many of these articles were sponsored by anonymous entities that were omitted in the translations.Astonishingly, the EU Commission, often seen as a champion in the fight against fake news, punished a democratically elected Jewish European leader based on a short list of easily debunked falsehoods.Kantor had been a prominent figure in leading the European fight against antisemitism, pushing EU leaders to take the issue seriously and move beyond empty rhetoric to actions. While he was celebrated by many European leaders and received national awards for his efforts toward peace, tolerance, and coexistence, he was secretly vilified by others.Many suspect that the invasion of Ukraine served as an excuse for some to dispose of a leader who had been a thorn in their side, advocating for the safety and security of the Jewish community.Additionally, Kantor personally funded initiatives that strengthened the security of vulnerable Jewish communities under constant threat from extremists. These communities are now left even more exposed, deprived of a leader who could have made a significant difference to their well-being.The EU sanctions on Kantor had little to do with the war in Ukraine. It was an overtly antisemitic move by bureaucrats in an institution whose former director, Josep Borrell, at times seemed to encourage antisemitism rather than fight it.Thankfully, and long overdue, the sanctions against Kantor were finally lifted. It was too little too late, and the champion of fighting antisemitism in Europe was unable to do so at a time when European Jewish communities needed him most.To make up for lost time and to show a strong commitment to the fight against Jew-hatred, Dr. Moshe Kantor's name, reputation, and ability to work on behalf of the Jewish community must be restored.The writer is a Vienna-based Journalist and author, who for the past 25 years has lived in Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, investigating European and Middle Eastern politics, the changes in the region, and their consequences on Europe, writing five books on these issues.

Exiled Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called on the international community to imagine ""a world without the Islamic Republic"" on Thursday in his Nowruz address to the Iranian people.""Imagine the Middle East liberated from the shadow of nuclear blackmail and threats,"" he said. ""Imagine our region without endless proxy wars, extremist ideologies, and terrorism - all driven by a regime whose policies have caused mass migration, instability, and suffering far beyond Iran's borders.""Imagine a Western world free from hostage-taking and Western troops and taxpayers free of the burden of endless wars in far-off lands,"" loosely referring to the hundreds of hostages the Hamas terrorist organization, a proxy of the Islamic Republic, took on October 7, 2023.  Pahlavi added that, in juxtaposition to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime, Iran would contribute to ""regional stability, global security, and economic growth,"" with him adding that without the regime, the country would enrich the region through its innovation and culture. Targeting Khamenei directly, Pahlavi added that the ayatollah ""has falsely claimed to represent Iran. It holds no legitimacy, no mandate, and no rightful place in our history.""

Praise of Pahlavi was also heard at the Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam in northeastern Iran.""Together, we can dismantle the Islamic Republic and end decades of global terror, blackmail, and hostage-taking. I extend our hand in friendship and partnership - to our neighbors from Israel and the Arab states, to our steadfast allies in the West. I extend this friendship with the hope that you will stand with the people of Iran and help us usher in this new day.Pahlavi concludes his statement by saying that a ""new Iran"" without the Islamic Republic ""is no longer a distant dream, but a reality being forged today by the hands of its own people."" Confident that the Islamic Republic will no longer be Iran's government, he says that ""the question is not whether Iran will be free, but which nations will with us in the fight and make our victory sweeter.""

No two events in recent world affairs seem so far apart and are yet so connected as the Abraham Accords and the October 7 attack that led to the current war in Gaza. And yet, the events are intricately linked, flip sides of the same coin: the emergence of a rational, forward-looking, moderate and peace-seeking camp spearheaded by the UAE and Bahrain on one side of the Arab world backed by Saudi Arabia, and Morocco on the other; and the rebellion against that camp spearheaded by Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, backed by Iran, Syria, and Qatar. Just as the October 7 attack, in some measure, was meant to halt the expansion of the accords and undo them, the solution to Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria can lie in expanding and solidifying the Abraham Accords. The only question remains: Do the various actors have the foresight and determination to see through to phase two?In late January, Donald Trump shocked the world, and perhaps his own advisers, by announcing his plan for Gaza's reconstruction and rehabilitation that centers on removing the Gazans, a US takeover, and turning Gaza into a riviera. Seemingly by design, Arab leaders scrambled to come up with a viable alternative, at least to block Trump. However, it is important to consider that the winding down of the war, weakening of the Iran-backed axis, and the return of Trump to the White House offer an unprecedented perfect storm not just to strengthen and significantly expand the Abraham Accords but also harness the new solidified moderate axis to reconstruct and rehabilitate Gaza and the Palestinian project, sans Hamas.  Trump breaks out of the box, againOutside-the-box thinking is nothing new for Trump. The very idea of the Abraham Accords broke the Middle East diplomacy paradigm by shedding the insistence that no country can have peace with Israel until a two-state solution is reached with the Palestinians. Perhaps, Trump and his team realized, it can very well be the other way around. Of significance, the Arab states had finally realized that it was Palestinian intransigence at fault at least as much if not more than Israeli foot-dragging, and Israel's tech, military, and economic prowess were too important to leave on the sidelines of the emerging Middle East.Arab world responses and the significance of Trump's announcementExpectedly, Arab states quickly rejected Trump's proposal, with Egypt and Jordan fearing instability, while the Gulf states opposed displacement and reaffirmed support for Palestinian sovereignty. AdvertisementTrump's proposal forced Arab states to propose their own solutions, breaking diplomatic inertia. An illustrative image of US President Donald Trump superimposed over displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. (credit: Canva, EVELYN HOCKSTEIN/REUTERS, Hatem Khaled/Reuters)On a deeper level, if there is one, the Arab world – and especially the Palestinian nationalist movement – might benefit from meeting the stark reality of what decades of rejectionism, belligerency, and selective outrage brings. That is, the Palestinian leadership has waged a nihilistic, decades-long legal, diplomatic, and psychological campaign to delegitimize Israel's existence, and that is the supposed moderates. Hamas and other jihadist groups have only ramped up their efforts to fight Israel through vile acts of terror. To this day, the Palestinian Authority has yet to condemn Hamas and the October 7 attack. If the Arab world facilitated, or at least played along with, the Palestinian delusion that Israel has no right to exist until recently, then why should the US continue supporting the Palestinian notion of sovereignty as an inalienable right, especially after October 7? At the very least, Trump and his team realized that the Overton window must shift to ensure that Hamas has no future role in Gaza's rehabilitation or governance.Egypt's plan and Saudi's leadershipEgypt, which used to occupy Gaza and has the closest diplomatic, intelligence, security, and family ties to it, was the first to suggest a viable alternative. The plan, thus far, would entail Egypt to oversee Gaza's reconstruction while establishing safe zones to move Palestinians into inside Gaza, while Egyptian firms oversee infrastructure reconstruction.

AdvertisementExecution and perfect stormsNotably missing from the 91-page plan was any mention of Hamas, and only a vague mention of the need to deal with armed factions. Hamas spokespeople have, in theory, agreed to step down from governance but remain unwilling to disarm. Aside from the notable avoidance of addressing Hamas and other militant groups directly, the details in the plan are as critical as its execution. Who will demilitarize Gaza and disarm Hamas? Will the Arab states commit to backing and funding such a process? Will Israel accept such a plan after suffering so traumatic a loss? Will Hamas accept being demilitarized and likely going into exile? And will the US and key Western powers commit to seeing the deal through rather than acquiescing to pressure from increasingly nihilistic extreme-left and Muslim constituents, especially in places dominated by progressive administrations?The current moment offers an unprecedented window of opportunity for the region's moderates that can solidify and expand the Abraham Accords, by tying the solution to Gaza into a regional breakthrough. For decades, it was Iran and its proxies' stranglehold and pressure on the moderate axis, including through radicalizing their own citizens, that held back progress. However, with Iran severely weakened, Syria with a new regime, Hezbollah weakened in Lebanon, Hamas bloodied and having lost most of its arsenal, tunnels, and infrastructure (not to mention its fighting forces), and with Trump in the White House, the perfect storm has come together to launch Abraham Accords II. Hamas terrorists parade as they prepare to hand over hostages. (credit: Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters)Keys to success and potential hurdlesDue to the various moving parts, and the need to synchronize them, it is critical that a number of overarching agreements be reached through a regional and international framework:  Regional and international actors must ensure that Hamas is fully disarmed, excluded from governance, and its leadership removed from Gaza. Moreover, the so-called moderate Palestinians, and the entire Arab world, must unequivocally condemn Hamas for the October 7 attack, make clear to their citizens that no genocide took place, and that jihadist groups have no place in the new Middle East. The US must ensure that all remain committed to this goal, and maintain a strict line against allies who entertain such rhetoric or diplomatic pressures on Israel. The US has far more leverage over allies and moderate Arab states than it has currently wielded. It is time it uses its leverage.Whether the Egyptian plan or something in between, at the Arab League summit Trump's vision was clearly meant to spur Arab proactivity and for the region's moderates to take ownership over Gaza. Putting a clear and sensible plan forward by the Arabs, to which they commit, is key.Once such a process is underway, the US should seek to bring the Saudis to a normalization deal with Israel, which would have the full backing of the Arab League. Such a deal would open the door to many more Arab and Muslim countries, with talks even of Lebanon and Syria joining the accords. Of course, this would require the demilitarization of Hezbollah, and Saudi and American assurances that neither would revert to being an Iranian puppet. With Iran at an all-time low, Hezbollah on the ropes, and a new Syrian regime, a massive window of opportunity has opened. The last week's renewal of sectarian violence and mass killings on ethnic and political lines remind us how precarious the region can be and why extremists must be kept in check.The two biggest challenges, assuming all agree to the Arab initiative and US red lines regarding Hamas' ouster, will remain Israel and Hamas.Israel is understandably traumatized, while Hamas continues to play cruel psychological manipulations on Israel's public and holds additional hostages meant for phase two of the ceasefire. Hamas will not likely give up all the hostages, as they are the only lifeline to its continued survival, and an assurance that Israel won't resume the war.Moreover, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have insisted they cannot enter into a normalization deal and a Gaza solution without a political horizon toward a Palestinian state. As much as they cannot allow Hamas to resume power, they similarly cannot allow for the expansion of the accords without Israel agreeing to the potentiality of an independent Palestinian entity.Israel would be wise to insist on setting an extremely high bar for reform and conduct in Gaza and major Palestinian cities in the West Bank, leaving the door open to greater Palestinian autonomy down the road. Perhaps, as it did with the UAE in 2020, it could commit to a freeze on talks of annexation for a five- to 10-year period, certainly outside major settlement blocs. These reforms would entail a complete deradicalization and re-education effort, demilitarization, and any other safeguard that ensures long-term moderation. Still, this would be a difficult pill for the Israeli public to swallow and would require significant carrots from the US, Saudis, and others. The specter of normalization and similar processes in Lebanon and Syria could help push the needle.Lastly, how to get Hamas to participate and the regional extremist camp to sit quiet? The day the last hostage is returned to Israel, a US-led, regional effort should be launched to choke Hamas off diplomatically, financially, logistically, and with a serious threat of force that Israel can resume the war with full international backing should Hamas fail to comply with the plan. Much as Arafat and the PLO were offered to go into exile in other Arab countries following the Lebanese civil war and the Israeli invasion, those Hamas leaders who are left should be offered a similar life line in exchange for their participation. Such a move would require significant American, European, and Gulf pressure on Egypt and Qatar to similarly pressure Hamas.The Trump plan has the opportunity to set into motion positive change in the region by finally forcing the Arab world to take responsibility and offer real solutions for their own future. The Egyptian plan is a good start to this, but the US, backed by EU partners, should take it as a floor and not a ceiling, and push the moderate Arab states to take a clear stand on Hamas, its disarmament, and clear disclusion from any Palestinian future. What should worry them most of all is not the potential expulsion of two million Gazans but rather how to rid the region of a nihilistic, genocidal group that has sparked at least six different rounds of fighting, including this most devastating one. By tying the expansion of the Abraham Accords to Gaza's reconstruction, a window of opportunity has opened, and it is imperative that all sides rush to take advantage.■The writer is co-chair of Sharaka, an Abraham Accords-focused NGO, a former IDF strategist and policy planner, speaker on Middle East affairs, and member of the Coalition for Regional Security.

Hamas spokespeople have, in theory, agreed to step down from governance but remain unwilling to disarm. Aside from the notable avoidance of addressing Hamas and other militant groups directly, the details in the plan are as critical as its execution. Who will demilitarize Gaza and disarm Hamas? Will the Arab states commit to backing and funding such a process? Will Israel accept such a plan after suffering so traumatic a loss? Will Hamas accept being demilitarized and likely going into exile? And will the US and key Western powers commit to seeing the deal through rather than acquiescing to pressure from increasingly nihilistic extreme-left and Muslim constituents, especially in places dominated by progressive administrations?The current moment offers an unprecedented window of opportunity for the region's moderates that can solidify and expand the Abraham Accords, by tying the solution to Gaza into a regional breakthrough. For decades, it was Iran and its proxies' stranglehold and pressure on the moderate axis, including through radicalizing their own citizens, that held back progress. However, with Iran severely weakened, Syria with a new regime, Hezbollah weakened in Lebanon, Hamas bloodied and having lost most of its arsenal, tunnels, and infrastructure (not to mention its fighting forces), and with Trump in the White House, the perfect storm has come together to launch Abraham Accords II.

(credit: Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters)Keys to success and potential hurdlesDue to the various moving parts, and the need to synchronize them, it is critical that a number of overarching agreements be reached through a regional and international framework:  Regional and international actors must ensure that Hamas is fully disarmed, excluded from governance, and its leadership removed from Gaza. Moreover, the so-called moderate Palestinians, and the entire Arab world, must unequivocally condemn Hamas for the October 7 attack, make clear to their citizens that no genocide took place, and that jihadist groups have no place in the new Middle East. The US must ensure that all remain committed to this goal, and maintain a strict line against allies who entertain such rhetoric or diplomatic pressures on Israel. The US has far more leverage over allies and moderate Arab states than it has currently wielded. It is time it uses its leverage.Whether the Egyptian plan or something in between, at the Arab League summit Trump's vision was clearly meant to spur Arab proactivity and for the region's moderates to take ownership over Gaza. Putting a clear and sensible plan forward by the Arabs, to which they commit, is key.Once such a process is underway, the US should seek to bring the Saudis to a normalization deal with Israel, which would have the full backing of the Arab League. Such a deal would open the door to many more Arab and Muslim countries, with talks even of Lebanon and Syria joining the accords. Of course, this would require the demilitarization of Hezbollah, and Saudi and American assurances that neither would revert to being an Iranian puppet. With Iran at an all-time low, Hezbollah on the ropes, and a new Syrian regime, a massive window of opportunity has opened. The last week's renewal of sectarian violence and mass killings on ethnic and political lines remind us how precarious the region can be and why extremists must be kept in check.The two biggest challenges, assuming all agree to the Arab initiative and US red lines regarding Hamas' ouster, will remain Israel and Hamas.Israel is understandably traumatized, while Hamas continues to play cruel psychological manipulations on Israel's public and holds additional hostages meant for phase two of the ceasefire. Hamas will not likely give up all the hostages, as they are the only lifeline to its continued survival, and an assurance that Israel won't resume the war.Moreover, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have insisted they cannot enter into a normalization deal and a Gaza solution without a political horizon toward a Palestinian state. As much as they cannot allow Hamas to resume power, they similarly cannot allow for the expansion of the accords without Israel agreeing to the potentiality of an independent Palestinian entity.Israel would be wise to insist on setting an extremely high bar for reform and conduct in Gaza and major Palestinian cities in the West Bank, leaving the door open to greater Palestinian autonomy down the road. Perhaps, as it did with the UAE in 2020, it could commit to a freeze on talks of annexation for a five- to 10-year period, certainly outside major settlement blocs. These reforms would entail a complete deradicalization and re-education effort, demilitarization, and any other safeguard that ensures long-term moderation. Still, this would be a difficult pill for the Israeli public to swallow and would require significant carrots from the US, Saudis, and others. The specter of normalization and similar processes in Lebanon and Syria could help push the needle.Lastly, how to get Hamas to participate and the regional extremist camp to sit quiet? The day the last hostage is returned to Israel, a US-led, regional effort should be launched to choke Hamas off diplomatically, financially, logistically, and with a serious threat of force that Israel can resume the war with full international backing should Hamas fail to comply with the plan. Much as Arafat and the PLO were offered to go into exile in other Arab countries following the Lebanese civil war and the Israeli invasion, those Hamas leaders who are left should be offered a similar life line in exchange for their participation.

The Egyptian plan is a good start to this, but the US, backed by EU partners, should take it as a floor and not a ceiling, and push the moderate Arab states to take a clear stand on Hamas, its disarmament, and clear disclusion from any Palestinian future. What should worry them most of all is not the potential expulsion of two million Gazans but rather how to rid the region of a nihilistic, genocidal group that has sparked at least six different rounds of fighting, including this most devastating one.

Outside-the-box thinking is nothing new for Trump. The very idea of the Abraham Accords broke the Middle East diplomacy paradigm by shedding the insistence that no country can have peace with Israel until a two-state solution is reached with the Palestinians. Perhaps, Trump and his team realized, it can very well be the other way around. Of significance, the Arab states had finally realized that it was Palestinian intransigence at fault at least as much if not more than Israeli foot-dragging, and Israel's tech, military, and economic prowess were too important to leave on the sidelines of the emerging Middle East.Arab world responses and the significance of Trump's announcementExpectedly, Arab states quickly rejected Trump's proposal, with Egypt and Jordan fearing instability, while the Gulf states opposed displacement and reaffirmed support for Palestinian sovereignty.

(credit: Canva, EVELYN HOCKSTEIN/REUTERS, Hatem Khaled/Reuters)On a deeper level, if there is one, the Arab world – and especially the Palestinian nationalist movement – might benefit from meeting the stark reality of what decades of rejectionism, belligerency, and selective outrage brings. That is, the Palestinian leadership has waged a nihilistic, decades-long legal, diplomatic, and psychological campaign to delegitimize Israel's existence, and that is the supposed moderates. Hamas and other jihadist groups have only ramped up their efforts to fight Israel through vile acts of terror. To this day, the Palestinian Authority has yet to condemn Hamas and the October 7 attack. If the Arab world facilitated, or at least played along with, the Palestinian delusion that Israel has no right to exist until recently, then why should the US continue supporting the Palestinian notion of sovereignty as an inalienable right, especially after October 7? At the very least, Trump and his team realized that the Overton window must shift to ensure that Hamas has no future role in Gaza's rehabilitation or governance.Egypt's plan and Saudi's leadershipEgypt, which used to occupy Gaza and has the closest diplomatic, intelligence, security, and family ties to it, was the first to suggest a viable alternative. The plan, thus far, would entail Egypt to oversee Gaza's reconstruction while establishing safe zones to move Palestinians into inside Gaza, while Egyptian firms oversee infrastructure reconstruction.

Putting a clear and sensible plan forward by the Arabs, to which they commit, is key.Once such a process is underway, the US should seek to bring the Saudis to a normalization deal with Israel, which would have the full backing of the Arab League. Such a deal would open the door to many more Arab and Muslim countries, with talks even of Lebanon and Syria joining the accords. Of course, this would require the demilitarization of Hezbollah, and Saudi and American assurances that neither would revert to being an Iranian puppet.

Hamas will not likely give up all the hostages, as they are the only lifeline to its continued survival, and an assurance that Israel won't resume the war.Moreover, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have insisted they cannot enter into a normalization deal and a Gaza solution without a political horizon toward a Palestinian state. As much as they cannot allow Hamas to resume power, they similarly cannot allow for the expansion of the accords without Israel agreeing to the potentiality of an independent Palestinian entity.Israel would be wise to insist on setting an extremely high bar for reform and conduct in Gaza and major Palestinian cities in the West Bank, leaving the door open to greater Palestinian autonomy down the road. Perhaps, as it did with the UAE in 2020, it could commit to a freeze on talks of annexation for a five- to 10-year period, certainly outside major settlement blocs. These reforms would entail a complete deradicalization and re-education effort, demilitarization, and any other safeguard that ensures long-term moderation. Still, this would be a difficult pill for the Israeli public to swallow and would require significant carrots from the US, Saudis, and others. The specter of normalization and similar processes in Lebanon and Syria could help push the needle.Lastly, how to get Hamas to participate and the regional extremist camp to sit quiet? The day the last hostage is returned to Israel, a US-led, regional effort should be launched to choke Hamas off diplomatically, financially, logistically, and with a serious threat of force that Israel can resume the war with full international backing should Hamas fail to comply with the plan. Much as Arafat and the PLO were offered to go into exile in other Arab countries following the Lebanese civil war and the Israeli invasion, those Hamas leaders who are left should be offered a similar life line in exchange for their participation.

The Egyptian plan is a good start to this, but the US, backed by EU partners, should take it as a floor and not a ceiling, and push the moderate Arab states to take a clear stand on Hamas, its disarmament, and clear disclusion from any Palestinian future. What should worry them most of all is not the potential expulsion of two million Gazans but rather how to rid the region of a nihilistic, genocidal group that has sparked at least six different rounds of fighting, including this most devastating one.

To this day, the Palestinian Authority has yet to condemn Hamas and the October 7 attack. If the Arab world facilitated, or at least played along with, the Palestinian delusion that Israel has no right to exist until recently, then why should the US continue supporting the Palestinian notion of sovereignty as an inalienable right, especially after October 7? At the very least, Trump and his team realized that the Overton window must shift to ensure that Hamas has no future role in Gaza's rehabilitation or governance.Egypt's plan and Saudi's leadershipEgypt, which used to occupy Gaza and has the closest diplomatic, intelligence, security, and family ties to it, was the first to suggest a viable alternative. The plan, thus far, would entail Egypt to oversee Gaza's reconstruction while establishing safe zones to move Palestinians into inside Gaza, while Egyptian firms oversee infrastructure reconstruction.

Due to the various moving parts, and the need to synchronize them, it is critical that a number of overarching agreements be reached through a regional and international framework:  Regional and international actors must ensure that Hamas is fully disarmed, excluded from governance, and its leadership removed from Gaza. Moreover, the so-called moderate Palestinians, and the entire Arab world, must unequivocally condemn Hamas for the October 7 attack, make clear to their citizens that no genocide took place, and that jihadist groups have no place in the new Middle East. The US must ensure that all remain committed to this goal, and maintain a strict line against allies who entertain such rhetoric or diplomatic pressures on Israel. The US has far more leverage over allies and moderate Arab states than it has currently wielded. It is time it uses its leverage.Whether the Egyptian plan or something in between, at the Arab League summit Trump's vision was clearly meant to spur Arab proactivity and for the region's moderates to take ownership over Gaza. Putting a clear and sensible plan forward by the Arabs, to which they commit, is key.Once such a process is underway, the US should seek to bring the Saudis to a normalization deal with Israel, which would have the full backing of the Arab League. Such a deal would open the door to many more Arab and Muslim countries, with talks even of Lebanon and Syria joining the accords. Of course, this would require the demilitarization of Hezbollah, and Saudi and American assurances that neither would revert to being an Iranian puppet. With Iran at an all-time low, Hezbollah on the ropes, and a new Syrian regime, a massive window of opportunity has opened. The last week's renewal of sectarian violence and mass killings on ethnic and political lines remind us how precarious the region can be and why extremists must be kept in check.The two biggest challenges, assuming all agree to the Arab initiative and US red lines regarding Hamas' ouster, will remain Israel and Hamas.Israel is understandably traumatized, while Hamas continues to play cruel psychological manipulations on Israel's public and holds additional hostages meant for phase two of the ceasefire. Hamas will not likely give up all the hostages, as they are the only lifeline to its continued survival, and an assurance that Israel won't resume the war.Moreover, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have insisted they cannot enter into a normalization deal and a Gaza solution without a political horizon toward a Palestinian state. As much as they cannot allow Hamas to resume power, they similarly cannot allow for the expansion of the accords without Israel agreeing to the potentiality of an independent Palestinian entity.Israel would be wise to insist on setting an extremely high bar for reform and conduct in Gaza and major Palestinian cities in the West Bank, leaving the door open to greater Palestinian autonomy down the road. Perhaps, as it did with the UAE in 2020, it could commit to a freeze on talks of annexation for a five- to 10-year period, certainly outside major settlement blocs. These reforms would entail a complete deradicalization and re-education effort, demilitarization, and any other safeguard that ensures long-term moderation. Still, this would be a difficult pill for the Israeli public to swallow and would require significant carrots from the US, Saudis, and others. The specter of normalization and similar processes in Lebanon and Syria could help push the needle.Lastly, how to get Hamas to participate and the regional extremist camp to sit quiet? The day the last hostage is returned to Israel, a US-led, regional effort should be launched to choke Hamas off diplomatically, financially, logistically, and with a serious threat of force that Israel can resume the war with full international backing should Hamas fail to comply with the plan.

Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, said that Hamas could still be involved in Gaza politically after they have been demilitarized in an interview with Tucker Carlson on Friday.“They need to demilitarize, and then they might also be politically involved in Gaza,” he said while discussing Hamas's rationale and goals for negotiations.“We need to understand what Hamas wants and then think about what we can offer them to make them leave. That is what needs to happen here. At the start of the conflict, we heard that ‘Hamas is an ideology, and they are ready to die.'”  Witkoff challenged this idea, saying “I don't think they are as ideologically extreme as they're often portrayed. They send young children who understand nothing to commit suicide with explosive belts. Once we understand that they want to live, we can talk to them more effectively.”He also discussed Gaza's reconstruction and the breadth of the proposed solutions.“When I first returned from a trip there—before Trump was inaugurated—we had permission from the Biden administration to collaborate with them. Trump asked, 'When do you think Gaza can be reconstructed?' My answer was 15 to 20 years. He asked why, and I explained the battlefield conditions.'Gaza is decimated—there are tunnels underneath, making it like Swiss cheese. Then the area got hit with bunker-buster bombs, so there's no rock left to build on.""'  Palestinians at the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Khan Yunis, Gaza Strip, March 18, 2025 (credit: ABED RAHIM KHATIB/FLASH90)Reconstruction plan""Yet, the world kept pushing a five-year reconstruction plan. Why? Because of the Biden administration's May 27 protocol, which was based on false assumptions. Level-setting the facts was critical. At first, people dismissed us, but then the Wall Street Journal wrote about it—15 to 20 years. Trump's approach was about understanding the reality before making decisions,"" he said.However, Witkoff did reiterate the Trump administration's policy on Hamas.“A terrorist organization cannot govern Gaza—that is unacceptable to Israel. What is possible, however, is for them to disarm. Then they can stay for a while and even be politically involved.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Witkoff also praised Netanyahu for his efficiency in decapitating Hezbollah and Hamas but noted his decisions to continue the fighting in Gaza heavily opposed Israeli public opinion.""We would not be as effective in the region if he didn't do what he did [with Hezbollah and Hamas], not even close.""'I think he [Netanyahu] did an exceptional job, but the rap he gets is that he's more concerned about the fight than he is about the hostages.

(JTA) — Columbia University is banning the use of face masks by protesters and hiring dozens of police officers as it seeks to win back federal funding cut by the Trump administration to penalize the school for its pro-Palestinian protests.Columbia also says it will review its admissions practices, citing “a recent downturn in both Jewish and African American enrollment.” The school had not previously disclosed the downturn, which follows both high-profile anti-Israel protests on campus and a Supreme Court ruling barring universities from weighing race in admissions decisions.A ban on face masks and changes to admissions had been among the demands laid out last week by the Trump administration for the school to regain $400 million in federal grants, mostly for science research, cut over what it said were threats against Jewish students on Columbia's campus.  Some departments at Columbia to also be under supervisionThe administration had also demanded that Columbia's Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department be put under special supervision for at least five years. Columbia announced that it was hiring a new provost to oversee the department and several others, including the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, that teach about the Middle East.The moves reflect broad concessions to the Trump administration, even as Interim President Katrina Armstrong said in a letter to community members that academic freedom remained a top value for the university.Protestors gather to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil at Foley Square on March 10, 2025 in New York City. Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist arrested Saturday, received a temporary reprieve from deportation. (credit: David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)“The way Columbia and Columbians have been portrayed is hard to reckon with,” she wrote in announcing the changes. “We have challenges, yes, but they do not define us. We are a community of scholars who have deep respect for each other and our mission. We teach the brightest, most creative students in the world, and we care deeply for each and every one of them. I have every faith in our ability to overcome the greatest of challenges. We stand resilient and brilliant.”Armstrong added, “At all times, we are guided by our values, putting academic freedom, free expression, open inquiry, and respect for all at the fore of every decision we make.” A website that accompanied Armstrong's note laid out all of the changes underway at the school, including the shakeup of the academic departments and the mask ban, which includes exemptions for masks worn for religious and medical reasons. The university also says it has almost finished training 36 “special officers” who will have the right to arrest students on campus.It is rare for the federal government to intervene in the internal operations of a private university. But the Trump administration said it was compelled to act because the university had failed to protect students from “antisemitic violence and harassment” during protests against the Israel-Hamas war that began on October 7, 2023. Columbia was the first school to see students form a pro-Palestinian encampment in the spring of 2024, launching a movement that reached dozens of colleges across the United States.The administration has also conducted multiple law enforcement actions at the school, arresting Palestinian protester Mahmoud Khalil earlier this month.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Critics of the Trump administration's intervention at Columbia, including thousands of Jewish academics who signed a protest letter this week, say the crackdown there and at other universities reflects an inappropriate incursion on academic freedom and uses fears of antisemitism to justify repression.The administration's supporters, who include some pro-Israel students, meanwhile say the moves are necessary to improve the climate for Jewish students.“This is a huge win for Jewish safety at Columbia,” tweeted Eliana Goldin, who is enrolled in Columbia's joint program with the Jewish Theological Seminary and a leader in the campus Zionist group Aryeh, on Friday. “I'm looking forward to seeing how the university improves these coming weeks.” The Ivy League university's response is being watched by other universities that the administration has sanctioned as it advances its policy objectives in areas ranging from campus protests to transgender sports and diversity initiatives.The administration has warned at least 60 other universities of possible action over alleged failure to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism. It has also targeted at least three law firms that the president says helped his political opponents or helped prosecute him unfairly.Reuters contributed to this report.

The university also says it has almost finished training 36 “special officers” who will have the right to arrest students on campus.It is rare for the federal government to intervene in the internal operations of a private university. But the Trump administration said it was compelled to act because the university had failed to protect students from “antisemitic violence and harassment” during protests against the Israel-Hamas war that began on October 7, 2023.

According to the Palestinian narrative, Jews are not indigenous to the region but are colonial settler interlopers, squatting where they have no right to be. The actual indigenous people are the Palestinians, who can date their history back to the time of the Canaanites. Israel's creation is the original sin, taking away their eternal land while the world has allowed an ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Palestinian people.According to an interview in Israel Hayom with Prof. Yoav Geller, an expert on Palestinian refugees, there “is a consciousness that lives with the Palestinians and goes with them everywhere. From their perspective, leaving Gaza is another Nakba…They prefer to preserve refugee status as a weapon against Israel and reject any plan for their rehabilitation and resettlement.”  According to Samir al-Barghouti, a Palestinian writing in Al-Watan, a daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia, “Gaza was Palestinian before and after the Common Era, and it will remain Palestinian after October 7 as it was before October 6... The solution in Palestine lies in returning those expelled in 1948…to Beersheba, to Ashkelon, to Jaffa, to Lod, and to Ramla, from which they were expelled in 1948, and then you will deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.”The Palestinian victims are, by this account, forced to pay the price for the European crime of the Holocaust by having a non-native population thrust into Islamic land. Descendants of refugees have been brainwashed to believe that the Land of Israel should be theirs when, in reality, the truth is much more complex. AdvertisementUntil that narrative is challenged, demanding that Israel hand over territory captured in defensive wars to create a sovereign Palestinian state, that path will only make a Hamas-stan in the West Bank as well as Gaza, while threatening the stability of Jordan, a bulwark against Islamist expansion. US PRESIDENT Donald Trump welcomes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. (credit: LEAH MILLIS/REUTERS)Historical claims and misinformationAfter Trump's bombshell remark concerning Gaza's future, the next logical step for President Trump is to confront the half-truths and outright falsehoods of the Palestinian narrative. It wouldn't be out of character for him to take the initiative, to be unafraid of challenging conventions, and upend a long-standing failed paradigm. I want the president and his secretary of state to say that the Palestinians who live in Gaza and the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) are overwhelmingly descendants of refugees of the genocidal wars they and their ancestors initiated against the Jewish state. They should not be afforded the eternal badge of honor for victimhood because if they, like the Jewish people in 1948, accepted UN General Assembly Resolution 181 calling for an Arab and a Jewish state, they too could have lived in their own state for the last 77 years. Not to mention their choice of violence over statehood over and over in 1948, 1967, 2000, 2001, and 2007, which the anti-Israel international community conveniently ignores.Have the Palestinian Arabs, if they are to be considered on the whole – after rejecting two states for two peoples many times, electing Hamas in a fair and free election, opting for violence again and again – forfeited the right to live on the doorstep of the Jewish state?   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  I know quite a few Palestinians who would embrace living in peace with Israel, but they are cowed, intimidated, or worse. One in particular, who was the head of a think tank, told me he could not rise higher in the Palestinian leadership because he had never been arrested or killed a Jew. AdvertisementAs Lee Smith, writing in the online magazine Tablet, said, “The Arabs chose the catastrophe (Nakba); they chose war, based on the premise that they would inevitably win and exterminate the Jews. “The Nakba, which they blame on the Jews, is their responsibility, and they should own up to it. This is not a popular opinion among Arabs, Western elites, and students on Ivy League campuses. However, attacking another people in wars of annihilation and losing should not make you the underdog and victim but the one who should bear the consequences of your own behavior, which repeatedly included the targeting of children, women, and Americans (Taylor Force), and civilians.A PALESTINIAN protests outside Jerusalem. (credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)Rewriting history: The two-state fallacy1948 was not a one-off, as the Arabs attacked Israel again and again, only to be defeated in wars of Jewish survival. The idea that the Palestinians' apologists have thrust on the West of desiring two states was always a fabrication. Jordan controlled the West Bank, and Egypt controlled Gaza for 19 years between 1948 and 67, and never was there a call for an independent Palestinian state next to Israel because the goal was the expulsion of the Jews, not compromise or accommodation. Two states became popular among Palestinians only when they decided that they would need a staged plan to eventually eradicate Israel.  Population transfers after wars historically are, unfortunately, the norm, not the exception. This occurred for the Jews of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) pre-1948 Israel from Muslim and Arab lands where Jews lived for up to 2,500 years in numbers exceeding the population shift of Palestinian Arabs from what would become the State of Israel after 1948. It happened to Pakistanis and Indians in South Asia and to the ethnic Germans expelled from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia after WWII.As any objective historian knows, Jews are indigenous to the Levant with a continuous presence for over 3,000 years, including since the destruction of the Second Temple, while the great Arab migration into the region occurred with the jihad conquest from the Arabian Peninsula beginning in the 7th century.As Jonathan Tobin of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate) wrote, Trump “has made it clear that a different solution has to be found for the Palestinians. The people who cheered the orgy of mass murder, rape, torture, kidnapping, and wanton destruction on October 7 will not be rewarded for this with more pressure on Jerusalem to do something the overwhelming majority of Israelis oppose as suicidal.”When the Arabs and their European allies, with their shared animus toward Israel and Jews, realized that Israel was unlikely to be conquered, they transitioned to the claim that they wanted two states; but they never called for two states for two peoples. “Two states” to Palestinians means a Jewish-free state in the West Bank and Gaza and a binational state in Israel with an unlimited right of return of descendants of Palestinian Arabs, which would demographically turn Israel into another Arab state, forcing the Jews once again to die or be pushed into the Diaspora. Tellingly, Israeli Arabs (Palestinian citizens of Israel) who have full citizenship in the Jewish state are overwhelmingly against being under the thumb of an authoritarian, non-democratic Palestinian government.I would often correct members of Congress who called for two states to change their wording, asking them to call for two states for two peoples as UN General Assembly Resolution 181 called for. A Jewish state is something the Muslim world, at best, can tolerate for a short period because of the concept of Dar al-Islam, to never accept the loss of any land that has been under Islamic rule. Bide your time, make temporary agreements, and then, when you are in a position of strength, conquer it again.President Trump has been disparaged by the legacy media and intellectual coastal elites for suggesting that Palestinian Arabs of Gaza be given the option to leave a terrorist state that has abused, tortured, and killed any Palestinian who does not fall in line with the Muslim Brotherhood jihadists of Gaza.International agencies have been complicit, as well as the Europeans, in not demanding accountability for the billions of dollars donated to Gaza that build one of the world‘s most complex underground terror tunnel labyrinths. Their condemnations have been overwhelmingly reserved for Israel for decades, even when Israel is responding defensively. Their sick moral equivalence, especially evident in equating kidnapped hostages who were raped and starved with the Palestinian terrorists released who killed scores of innocent Israelis, including children, is especially sickening and should make the EU and the UN personae non gratae in weighing in on the conflict. President Trump should say to them, “Thanks but no thanks for your help,” which they have used to boycott, sanction, and delegitimize Israel well before October 7.The Trump administration acknowledges that unless Gaza is entirely free of Hamas as a military and governing entity, Gaza will return to being a terror state in short order. Rebuilding with both Hamas and the Gazan population present guarantees this inevitable existential outcome.President Trump has come up with an out-of-the-box – and to many, an outrageous – idea. But it is one that actually deals with the problem and sets a path forward for Israel to defend itself in the future against the ever-present threat of both Sunni and Shi'ite jihadists, who often work together, like Iran and Hamas, which will return again and again because of their ideological radical desire to slaughter the Jews. Palestinians gather to receive aid, Jabalya refugee camp, Gaza Strip, March 2025. (credit: Mahmoud Issa/Reuters)Trump's opportunity to shift policyA good start would be a temporary relocation of the Palestinian population of Gaza. Enemies like Iran and frenemies like Qatar and Turkey will send funds to rebuild Hamas. America needs a policy of new sticks and carrots for Qatar and Turkey to be dissuaded from supporting a jihadist enemy on the doorstep of America's most important ally in the region. As for Iran, it will also try to repair its proxy forces, including Hamas. Only regime change combined with massive sanctions and kinetic actions against its nuclear program will stop Iran from continuing to foster hatred, misogyny, torture, repression, intimidation, and a cult of death throughout the Middle East.What should the Trump administration do?The administration should officially change the US position on the status of Palestinian refugees from the UNWRA definition to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) definition, whereby descendants of refugees, now in their fifth generation, are not designated as refugees but as people who should be helped find a new home, free from terror, as citizens of another nation. That is what UNHCR facilitates for every refugee in the world and their descendants, except for Palestinians, who are used as pawns to perpetuate the never-ending war on Israel. Unfortunately, wherever the Palestinians go, they will likely radicalize and destabilize their new home as they did in Jordan in the 1970s, Lebanon in the 1980s, supporting Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Kuwait in the 1990s, and as leaders of anarchist and anti-American student movements in America post-October 7.Secondly, US dollars must not facilitate terror. The Palestinian Authority incentivized terror with its “Pay for Slay” program, paying surviving terrorists and their families an annuity in perpetuity for terror attacks against Jewish Israelis. The more brutal the terror, the more money they paid. President Mahmoud Abbas has now claimed that the PA is ending Pay for Slay, and the families of terrorists will receive funds based on their socio-economic needs. This sounds like a program to be abused, changing the names of the agencies in charge but still under the leadership that facilitates social security for terrorists and their families. Until this vile practice of incentivizing terror is totally ended and verified, no US dollars should go to the PA. Sounds like it is right in line with DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency).Third, there should be no US dollars used to rebuild Gaza until Hamas as a governing and military entity is verifiably removed. It may take years, but let's not rebuild a terror state again.Following the same playbook, rewarding and rationalizing Palestinian terror with a path to two states should be off the table until the Palestinians themselves, with the encouragement of Jordan, Egypt, and the Gulf states, take responsibility for themselves, building a transparent economic and governing administrative state that can responsibly receive funds and take care of the needs of the people, without propagating Muslim Brotherhood ideology. Just as the nascent Jewish state built institutions before its birth, Palestinians need to build the foundation for a future, creating institutions and organizations dedicated to helping the people economically before any guaranteed political horizon can be contemplated.Victimhood and a revisionist narrative are not plans for success or peace.As Yardena Schwartz, author of the new book Ghosts of a Holy War: The 1929 Massacre in Palestine that Ignited the Arab-Israeli Conflict, wrote in The Forward, “Considering the last century of failed efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict – with every two-state solution rejected by Palestinian leaders, as far back as 1937 – President Trump's shock to the system might be precisely what that system needs.”Next is challenging the narrative.■Dr. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network, and senior security editor of The Jerusalem Report.

(credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)Rewriting history: The two-state fallacy1948 was not a one-off, as the Arabs attacked Israel again and again, only to be defeated in wars of Jewish survival. The idea that the Palestinians' apologists have thrust on the West of desiring two states was always a fabrication. Jordan controlled the West Bank, and Egypt controlled Gaza for 19 years between 1948 and 67, and never was there a call for an independent Palestinian state next to Israel because the goal was the expulsion of the Jews, not compromise or accommodation. Two states became popular among Palestinians only when they decided that they would need a staged plan to eventually eradicate Israel.  Population transfers after wars historically are, unfortunately, the norm, not the exception. This occurred for the Jews of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) pre-1948 Israel from Muslim and Arab lands where Jews lived for up to 2,500 years in numbers exceeding the population shift of Palestinian Arabs from what would become the State of Israel after 1948. It happened to Pakistanis and Indians in South Asia and to the ethnic Germans expelled from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia after WWII.As any objective historian knows, Jews are indigenous to the Levant with a continuous presence for over 3,000 years, including since the destruction of the Second Temple, while the great Arab migration into the region occurred with the jihad conquest from the Arabian Peninsula beginning in the 7th century.As Jonathan Tobin of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate) wrote, Trump “has made it clear that a different solution has to be found for the Palestinians. The people who cheered the orgy of mass murder, rape, torture, kidnapping, and wanton destruction on October 7 will not be rewarded for this with more pressure on Jerusalem to do something the overwhelming majority of Israelis oppose as suicidal.”When the Arabs and their European allies, with their shared animus toward Israel and Jews, realized that Israel was unlikely to be conquered, they transitioned to the claim that they wanted two states; but they never called for two states for two peoples. “Two states” to Palestinians means a Jewish-free state in the West Bank and Gaza and a binational state in Israel with an unlimited right of return of descendants of Palestinian Arabs, which would demographically turn Israel into another Arab state, forcing the Jews once again to die or be pushed into the Diaspora. Tellingly, Israeli Arabs (Palestinian citizens of Israel) who have full citizenship in the Jewish state are overwhelmingly against being under the thumb of an authoritarian, non-democratic Palestinian government.I would often correct members of Congress who called for two states to change their wording, asking them to call for two states for two peoples as UN General Assembly Resolution 181 called for. A Jewish state is something the Muslim world, at best, can tolerate for a short period because of the concept of Dar al-Islam, to never accept the loss of any land that has been under Islamic rule. Bide your time, make temporary agreements, and then, when you are in a position of strength, conquer it again.President Trump has been disparaged by the legacy media and intellectual coastal elites for suggesting that Palestinian Arabs of Gaza be given the option to leave a terrorist state that has abused, tortured, and killed any Palestinian who does not fall in line with the Muslim Brotherhood jihadists of Gaza.International agencies have been complicit, as well as the Europeans, in not demanding accountability for the billions of dollars donated to Gaza that build one of the world‘s most complex underground terror tunnel labyrinths. Their condemnations have been overwhelmingly reserved for Israel for decades, even when Israel is responding defensively. Their sick moral equivalence, especially evident in equating kidnapped hostages who were raped and starved with the Palestinian terrorists released who killed scores of innocent Israelis, including children, is especially sickening and should make the EU and the UN personae non gratae in weighing in on the conflict. President Trump should say to them, “Thanks but no thanks for your help,” which they have used to boycott, sanction, and delegitimize Israel well before October 7.The Trump administration acknowledges that unless Gaza is entirely free of Hamas as a military and governing entity, Gaza will return to being a terror state in short order. Rebuilding with both Hamas and the Gazan population present guarantees this inevitable existential outcome.President Trump has come up with an out-of-the-box – and to many, an outrageous – idea. But it is one that actually deals with the problem and sets a path forward for Israel to defend itself in the future against the ever-present threat of both Sunni and Shi'ite jihadists, who often work together, like Iran and Hamas, which will return again and again because of their ideological radical desire to slaughter the Jews. Palestinians gather to receive aid, Jabalya refugee camp, Gaza Strip, March 2025. (credit: Mahmoud Issa/Reuters)Trump's opportunity to shift policyA good start would be a temporary relocation of the Palestinian population of Gaza. Enemies like Iran and frenemies like Qatar and Turkey will send funds to rebuild Hamas. America needs a policy of new sticks and carrots for Qatar and Turkey to be dissuaded from supporting a jihadist enemy on the doorstep of America's most important ally in the region. As for Iran, it will also try to repair its proxy forces, including Hamas. Only regime change combined with massive sanctions and kinetic actions against its nuclear program will stop Iran from continuing to foster hatred, misogyny, torture, repression, intimidation, and a cult of death throughout the Middle East.What should the Trump administration do?The administration should officially change the US position on the status of Palestinian refugees from the UNWRA definition to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) definition, whereby descendants of refugees, now in their fifth generation, are not designated as refugees but as people who should be helped find a new home, free from terror, as citizens of another nation. That is what UNHCR facilitates for every refugee in the world and their descendants, except for Palestinians, who are used as pawns to perpetuate the never-ending war on Israel. Unfortunately, wherever the Palestinians go, they will likely radicalize and destabilize their new home as they did in Jordan in the 1970s, Lebanon in the 1980s, supporting Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Kuwait in the 1990s, and as leaders of anarchist and anti-American student movements in America post-October 7.Secondly, US dollars must not facilitate terror. The Palestinian Authority incentivized terror with its “Pay for Slay” program, paying surviving terrorists and their families an annuity in perpetuity for terror attacks against Jewish Israelis. The more brutal the terror, the more money they paid. President Mahmoud Abbas has now claimed that the PA is ending Pay for Slay, and the families of terrorists will receive funds based on their socio-economic needs. This sounds like a program to be abused, changing the names of the agencies in charge but still under the leadership that facilitates social security for terrorists and their families. Until this vile practice of incentivizing terror is totally ended and verified, no US dollars should go to the PA. Sounds like it is right in line with DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency).Third, there should be no US dollars used to rebuild Gaza until Hamas as a governing and military entity is verifiably removed. It may take years, but let's not rebuild a terror state again.Following the same playbook, rewarding and rationalizing Palestinian terror with a path to two states should be off the table until the Palestinians themselves, with the encouragement of Jordan, Egypt, and the Gulf states, take responsibility for themselves, building a transparent economic and governing administrative state that can responsibly receive funds and take care of the needs of the people, without propagating Muslim Brotherhood ideology. Just as the nascent Jewish state built institutions before its birth, Palestinians need to build the foundation for a future, creating institutions and organizations dedicated to helping the people economically before any guaranteed political horizon can be contemplated.Victimhood and a revisionist narrative are not plans for success or peace.As Yardena Schwartz, author of the new book Ghosts of a Holy War: The 1929 Massacre in Palestine that Ignited the Arab-Israeli Conflict, wrote in The Forward, “Considering the last century of failed efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict – with every two-state solution rejected by Palestinian leaders, as far back as 1937 – President Trump's shock to the system might be precisely what that system needs.”Next is challenging the narrative.■Dr. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network, and senior security editor of The Jerusalem Report.

(credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)Rewriting history: The two-state fallacy1948 was not a one-off, as the Arabs attacked Israel again and again, only to be defeated in wars of Jewish survival. The idea that the Palestinians' apologists have thrust on the West of desiring two states was always a fabrication. Jordan controlled the West Bank, and Egypt controlled Gaza for 19 years between 1948 and 67, and never was there a call for an independent Palestinian state next to Israel because the goal was the expulsion of the Jews, not compromise or accommodation. Two states became popular among Palestinians only when they decided that they would need a staged plan to eventually eradicate Israel.  Population transfers after wars historically are, unfortunately, the norm, not the exception. This occurred for the Jews of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) pre-1948 Israel from Muslim and Arab lands where Jews lived for up to 2,500 years in numbers exceeding the population shift of Palestinian Arabs from what would become the State of Israel after 1948. It happened to Pakistanis and Indians in South Asia and to the ethnic Germans expelled from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia after WWII.As any objective historian knows, Jews are indigenous to the Levant with a continuous presence for over 3,000 years, including since the destruction of the Second Temple, while the great Arab migration into the region occurred with the jihad conquest from the Arabian Peninsula beginning in the 7th century.As Jonathan Tobin of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate) wrote, Trump “has made it clear that a different solution has to be found for the Palestinians. The people who cheered the orgy of mass murder, rape, torture, kidnapping, and wanton destruction on October 7 will not be rewarded for this with more pressure on Jerusalem to do something the overwhelming majority of Israelis oppose as suicidal.”When the Arabs and their European allies, with their shared animus toward Israel and Jews, realized that Israel was unlikely to be conquered, they transitioned to the claim that they wanted two states; but they never called for two states for two peoples. “Two states” to Palestinians means a Jewish-free state in the West Bank and Gaza and a binational state in Israel with an unlimited right of return of descendants of Palestinian Arabs, which would demographically turn Israel into another Arab state, forcing the Jews once again to die or be pushed into the Diaspora. Tellingly, Israeli Arabs (Palestinian citizens of Israel) who have full citizenship in the Jewish state are overwhelmingly against being under the thumb of an authoritarian, non-democratic Palestinian government.I would often correct members of Congress who called for two states to change their wording, asking them to call for two states for two peoples as UN General Assembly Resolution 181 called for. A Jewish state is something the Muslim world, at best, can tolerate for a short period because of the concept of Dar al-Islam, to never accept the loss of any land that has been under Islamic rule. Bide your time, make temporary agreements, and then, when you are in a position of strength, conquer it again.President Trump has been disparaged by the legacy media and intellectual coastal elites for suggesting that Palestinian Arabs of Gaza be given the option to leave a terrorist state that has abused, tortured, and killed any Palestinian who does not fall in line with the Muslim Brotherhood jihadists of Gaza.International agencies have been complicit, as well as the Europeans, in not demanding accountability for the billions of dollars donated to Gaza that build one of the world‘s most complex underground terror tunnel labyrinths. Their condemnations have been overwhelmingly reserved for Israel for decades, even when Israel is responding defensively. Their sick moral equivalence, especially evident in equating kidnapped hostages who were raped and starved with the Palestinian terrorists released who killed scores of innocent Israelis, including children, is especially sickening and should make the EU and the UN personae non gratae in weighing in on the conflict. President Trump should say to them, “Thanks but no thanks for your help,” which they have used to boycott, sanction, and delegitimize Israel well before October 7.The Trump administration acknowledges that unless Gaza is entirely free of Hamas as a military and governing entity, Gaza will return to being a terror state in short order. Rebuilding with both Hamas and the Gazan population present guarantees this inevitable existential outcome.President Trump has come up with an out-of-the-box – and to many, an outrageous – idea. But it is one that actually deals with the problem and sets a path forward for Israel to defend itself in the future against the ever-present threat of both Sunni and Shi'ite jihadists, who often work together, like Iran and Hamas, which will return again and again because of their ideological radical desire to slaughter the Jews. Palestinians gather to receive aid, Jabalya refugee camp, Gaza Strip, March 2025. (credit: Mahmoud Issa/Reuters)Trump's opportunity to shift policyA good start would be a temporary relocation of the Palestinian population of Gaza. Enemies like Iran and frenemies like Qatar and Turkey will send funds to rebuild Hamas. America needs a policy of new sticks and carrots for Qatar and Turkey to be dissuaded from supporting a jihadist enemy on the doorstep of America's most important ally in the region. As for Iran, it will also try to repair its proxy forces, including Hamas. Only regime change combined with massive sanctions and kinetic actions against its nuclear program will stop Iran from continuing to foster hatred, misogyny, torture, repression, intimidation, and a cult of death throughout the Middle East.What should the Trump administration do?The administration should officially change the US position on the status of Palestinian refugees from the UNWRA definition to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) definition, whereby descendants of refugees, now in their fifth generation, are not designated as refugees but as people who should be helped find a new home, free from terror, as citizens of another nation. That is what UNHCR facilitates for every refugee in the world and their descendants, except for Palestinians, who are used as pawns to perpetuate the never-ending war on Israel. Unfortunately, wherever the Palestinians go, they will likely radicalize and destabilize their new home as they did in Jordan in the 1970s, Lebanon in the 1980s, supporting Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Kuwait in the 1990s, and as leaders of anarchist and anti-American student movements in America post-October 7.Secondly, US dollars must not facilitate terror. The Palestinian Authority incentivized terror with its “Pay for Slay” program, paying surviving terrorists and their families an annuity in perpetuity for terror attacks against Jewish Israelis. The more brutal the terror, the more money they paid. President Mahmoud Abbas has now claimed that the PA is ending Pay for Slay, and the families of terrorists will receive funds based on their socio-economic needs. This sounds like a program to be abused, changing the names of the agencies in charge but still under the leadership that facilitates social security for terrorists and their families. Until this vile practice of incentivizing terror is totally ended and verified, no US dollars should go to the PA. Sounds like it is right in line with DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency).Third, there should be no US dollars used to rebuild Gaza until Hamas as a governing and military entity is verifiably removed. It may take years, but let's not rebuild a terror state again.Following the same playbook, rewarding and rationalizing Palestinian terror with a path to two states should be off the table until the Palestinians themselves, with the encouragement of Jordan, Egypt, and the Gulf states, take responsibility for themselves, building a transparent economic and governing administrative state that can responsibly receive funds and take care of the needs of the people, without propagating Muslim Brotherhood ideology. Just as the nascent Jewish state built institutions before its birth, Palestinians need to build the foundation for a future, creating institutions and organizations dedicated to helping the people economically before any guaranteed political horizon can be contemplated.Victimhood and a revisionist narrative are not plans for success or peace.As Yardena Schwartz, author of the new book Ghosts of a Holy War: The 1929 Massacre in Palestine that Ignited the Arab-Israeli Conflict, wrote in The Forward, “Considering the last century of failed efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict – with every two-state solution rejected by Palestinian leaders, as far back as 1937 – President Trump's shock to the system might be precisely what that system needs.”Next is challenging the narrative.■Dr. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network, and senior security editor of The Jerusalem Report. He briefs members of Congress and their foreign policy aides on both sides of the aisle.




I want the president and his secretary of state to say that the Palestinians who live in Gaza and the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) are overwhelmingly descendants of refugees of the genocidal wars they and their ancestors initiated against the Jewish state. They should not be afforded the eternal badge of honor for victimhood because if they, like the Jewish people in 1948, accepted UN General Assembly Resolution 181 calling for an Arab and a Jewish state, they too could have lived in their own state for the last 77 years. Not to mention their choice of violence over statehood over and over in 1948, 1967, 2000, 2001, and 2007, which the anti-Israel international community conveniently ignores.Have the Palestinian Arabs, if they are to be considered on the whole – after rejecting two states for two peoples many times, electing Hamas in a fair and free election, opting for violence again and again – forfeited the right to live on the doorstep of the Jewish state?

That is what UNHCR facilitates for every refugee in the world and their descendants, except for Palestinians, who are used as pawns to perpetuate the never-ending war on Israel. Unfortunately, wherever the Palestinians go, they will likely radicalize and destabilize their new home as they did in Jordan in the 1970s, Lebanon in the 1980s, supporting Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Kuwait in the 1990s, and as leaders of anarchist and anti-American student movements in America post-October 7.Secondly, US dollars must not facilitate terror. The Palestinian Authority incentivized terror with its “Pay for Slay” program, paying surviving terrorists and their families an annuity in perpetuity for terror attacks against Jewish Israelis. The more brutal the terror, the more money they paid. President Mahmoud Abbas has now claimed that the PA is ending Pay for Slay, and the families of terrorists will receive funds based on their socio-economic needs. This sounds like a program to be abused, changing the names of the agencies in charge but still under the leadership that facilitates social security for terrorists and their families. Until this vile practice of incentivizing terror is totally ended and verified, no US dollars should go to the PA. Sounds like it is right in line with DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency).Third, there should be no US dollars used to rebuild Gaza until Hamas as a governing and military entity is verifiably removed. It may take years, but let's not rebuild a terror state again.Following the same playbook, rewarding and rationalizing Palestinian terror with a path to two states should be off the table until the Palestinians themselves, with the encouragement of Jordan, Egypt, and the Gulf states, take responsibility for themselves, building a transparent economic and governing administrative state that can responsibly receive funds and take care of the needs of the people, without propagating Muslim Brotherhood ideology.

As Lee Smith, writing in the online magazine Tablet, said, “The Arabs chose the catastrophe (Nakba); they chose war, based on the premise that they would inevitably win and exterminate the Jews. “The Nakba, which they blame on the Jews, is their responsibility, and they should own up to it. This is not a popular opinion among Arabs, Western elites, and students on Ivy League campuses. However, attacking another people in wars of annihilation and losing should not make you the underdog and victim but the one who should bear the consequences of your own behavior, which repeatedly included the targeting of children, women, and Americans (Taylor Force), and civilians.A PALESTINIAN protests outside Jerusalem. (credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)Rewriting history: The two-state fallacy1948 was not a one-off, as the Arabs attacked Israel again and again, only to be defeated in wars of Jewish survival. The idea that the Palestinians' apologists have thrust on the West of desiring two states was always a fabrication. Jordan controlled the West Bank, and Egypt controlled Gaza for 19 years between 1948 and 67, and never was there a call for an independent Palestinian state next to Israel because the goal was the expulsion of the Jews, not compromise or accommodation. Two states became popular among Palestinians only when they decided that they would need a staged plan to eventually eradicate Israel.  Population transfers after wars historically are, unfortunately, the norm, not the exception. This occurred for the Jews of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) pre-1948 Israel from Muslim and Arab lands where Jews lived for up to 2,500 years in numbers exceeding the population shift of Palestinian Arabs from what would become the State of Israel after 1948. It happened to Pakistanis and Indians in South Asia and to the ethnic Germans expelled from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia after WWII.As any objective historian knows, Jews are indigenous to the Levant with a continuous presence for over 3,000 years, including since the destruction of the Second Temple, while the great Arab migration into the region occurred with the jihad conquest from the Arabian Peninsula beginning in the 7th century.As Jonathan Tobin of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate) wrote, Trump “has made it clear that a different solution has to be found for the Palestinians. The people who cheered the orgy of mass murder, rape, torture, kidnapping, and wanton destruction on October 7 will not be rewarded for this with more pressure on Jerusalem to do something the overwhelming majority of Israelis oppose as suicidal.”When the Arabs and their European allies, with their shared animus toward Israel and Jews, realized that Israel was unlikely to be conquered, they transitioned to the claim that they wanted two states; but they never called for two states for two peoples. “Two states” to Palestinians means a Jewish-free state in the West Bank and Gaza and a binational state in Israel with an unlimited right of return of descendants of Palestinian Arabs, which would demographically turn Israel into another Arab state, forcing the Jews once again to die or be pushed into the Diaspora. Tellingly, Israeli Arabs (Palestinian citizens of Israel) who have full citizenship in the Jewish state are overwhelmingly against being under the thumb of an authoritarian, non-democratic Palestinian government.I would often correct members of Congress who called for two states to change their wording, asking them to call for two states for two peoples as UN General Assembly Resolution 181 called for. A Jewish state is something the Muslim world, at best, can tolerate for a short period because of the concept of Dar al-Islam, to never accept the loss of any land that has been under Islamic rule. Bide your time, make temporary agreements, and then, when you are in a position of strength, conquer it again.President Trump has been disparaged by the legacy media and intellectual coastal elites for suggesting that Palestinian Arabs of Gaza be given the option to leave a terrorist state that has abused, tortured, and killed any Palestinian who does not fall in line with the Muslim Brotherhood jihadists of Gaza.International agencies have been complicit, as well as the Europeans, in not demanding accountability for the billions of dollars donated to Gaza that build one of the world‘s most complex underground terror tunnel labyrinths. Their condemnations have been overwhelmingly reserved for Israel for decades, even when Israel is responding defensively. Their sick moral equivalence, especially evident in equating kidnapped hostages who were raped and starved with the Palestinian terrorists released who killed scores of innocent Israelis, including children, is especially sickening and should make the EU and the UN personae non gratae in weighing in on the conflict. President Trump should say to them, “Thanks but no thanks for your help,” which they have used to boycott, sanction, and delegitimize Israel well before October 7.The Trump administration acknowledges that unless Gaza is entirely free of Hamas as a military and governing entity, Gaza will return to being a terror state in short order. Rebuilding with both Hamas and the Gazan population present guarantees this inevitable existential outcome.President Trump has come up with an out-of-the-box – and to many, an outrageous – idea. But it is one that actually deals with the problem and sets a path forward for Israel to defend itself in the future against the ever-present threat of both Sunni and Shi'ite jihadists, who often work together, like Iran and Hamas, which will return again and again because of their ideological radical desire to slaughter the Jews.

As any objective historian knows, Jews are indigenous to the Levant with a continuous presence for over 3,000 years, including since the destruction of the Second Temple, while the great Arab migration into the region occurred with the jihad conquest from the Arabian Peninsula beginning in the 7th century.As Jonathan Tobin of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate) wrote, Trump “has made it clear that a different solution has to be found for the Palestinians. The people who cheered the orgy of mass murder, rape, torture, kidnapping, and wanton destruction on October 7 will not be rewarded for this with more pressure on Jerusalem to do something the overwhelming majority of Israelis oppose as suicidal.”When the Arabs and their European allies, with their shared animus toward Israel and Jews, realized that Israel was unlikely to be conquered, they transitioned to the claim that they wanted two states; but they never called for two states for two peoples. “Two states” to Palestinians means a Jewish-free state in the West Bank and Gaza and a binational state in Israel with an unlimited right of return of descendants of Palestinian Arabs, which would demographically turn Israel into another Arab state, forcing the Jews once again to die or be pushed into the Diaspora. Tellingly, Israeli Arabs (Palestinian citizens of Israel) who have full citizenship in the Jewish state are overwhelmingly against being under the thumb of an authoritarian, non-democratic Palestinian government.I would often correct members of Congress who called for two states to change their wording, asking them to call for two states for two peoples as UN General Assembly Resolution 181 called for. A Jewish state is something the Muslim world, at best, can tolerate for a short period because of the concept of Dar al-Islam, to never accept the loss of any land that has been under Islamic rule. Bide your time, make temporary agreements, and then, when you are in a position of strength, conquer it again.President Trump has been disparaged by the legacy media and intellectual coastal elites for suggesting that Palestinian Arabs of Gaza be given the option to leave a terrorist state that has abused, tortured, and killed any Palestinian who does not fall in line with the Muslim Brotherhood jihadists of Gaza.International agencies have been complicit, as well as the Europeans, in not demanding accountability for the billions of dollars donated to Gaza that build one of the world‘s most complex underground terror tunnel labyrinths. Their condemnations have been overwhelmingly reserved for Israel for decades, even when Israel is responding defensively. Their sick moral equivalence, especially evident in equating kidnapped hostages who were raped and starved with the Palestinian terrorists released who killed scores of innocent Israelis, including children, is especially sickening and should make the EU and the UN personae non gratae in weighing in on the conflict. President Trump should say to them, “Thanks but no thanks for your help,” which they have used to boycott, sanction, and delegitimize Israel well before October 7.The Trump administration acknowledges that unless Gaza is entirely free of Hamas as a military and governing entity, Gaza will return to being a terror state in short order. Rebuilding with both Hamas and the Gazan population present guarantees this inevitable existential outcome.President Trump has come up with an out-of-the-box – and to many, an outrageous – idea. But it is one that actually deals with the problem and sets a path forward for Israel to defend itself in the future against the ever-present threat of both Sunni and Shi'ite jihadists, who often work together, like Iran and Hamas, which will return again and again because of their ideological radical desire to slaughter the Jews. Palestinians gather to receive aid, Jabalya refugee camp, Gaza Strip, March 2025. (credit: Mahmoud Issa/Reuters)Trump's opportunity to shift policyA good start would be a temporary relocation of the Palestinian population of Gaza. Enemies like Iran and frenemies like Qatar and Turkey will send funds to rebuild Hamas. America needs a policy of new sticks and carrots for Qatar and Turkey to be dissuaded from supporting a jihadist enemy on the doorstep of America's most important ally in the region. As for Iran, it will also try to repair its proxy forces, including Hamas. Only regime change combined with massive sanctions and kinetic actions against its nuclear program will stop Iran from continuing to foster hatred, misogyny, torture, repression, intimidation, and a cult of death throughout the Middle East.What should the Trump administration do?The administration should officially change the US position on the status of Palestinian refugees from the UNWRA definition to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) definition, whereby descendants of refugees, now in their fifth generation, are not designated as refugees but as people who should be helped find a new home, free from terror, as citizens of another nation. That is what UNHCR facilitates for every refugee in the world and their descendants, except for Palestinians, who are used as pawns to perpetuate the never-ending war on Israel. Unfortunately, wherever the Palestinians go, they will likely radicalize and destabilize their new home as they did in Jordan in the 1970s, Lebanon in the 1980s, supporting Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Kuwait in the 1990s, and as leaders of anarchist and anti-American student movements in America post-October 7.Secondly, US dollars must not facilitate terror. The Palestinian Authority incentivized terror with its “Pay for Slay” program, paying surviving terrorists and their families an annuity in perpetuity for terror attacks against Jewish Israelis. The more brutal the terror, the more money they paid. President Mahmoud Abbas has now claimed that the PA is ending Pay for Slay, and the families of terrorists will receive funds based on their socio-economic needs. This sounds like a program to be abused, changing the names of the agencies in charge but still under the leadership that facilitates social security for terrorists and their families. Until this vile practice of incentivizing terror is totally ended and verified, no US dollars should go to the PA. Sounds like it is right in line with DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency).Third, there should be no US dollars used to rebuild Gaza until Hamas as a governing and military entity is verifiably removed.

The Trump administration acknowledges that unless Gaza is entirely free of Hamas as a military and governing entity, Gaza will return to being a terror state in short order. Rebuilding with both Hamas and the Gazan population present guarantees this inevitable existential outcome.President Trump has come up with an out-of-the-box – and to many, an outrageous – idea. But it is one that actually deals with the problem and sets a path forward for Israel to defend itself in the future against the ever-present threat of both Sunni and Shi'ite jihadists, who often work together, like Iran and Hamas, which will return again and again because of their ideological radical desire to slaughter the Jews.

Enemies like Iran and frenemies like Qatar and Turkey will send funds to rebuild Hamas. America needs a policy of new sticks and carrots for Qatar and Turkey to be dissuaded from supporting a jihadist enemy on the doorstep of America's most important ally in the region.

“Dreamy,” Israelis declared upon hearing US President Donald Trump's plan to evacuate the residents of Gaza and build a renovated Riviera there. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is enthusiastic about the idea, calling it the best plan he has heard to date regarding Gaza. Trump's call to resettle residents of the Gaza Strip elsewhere was immediately endorsed by right-wing extremists Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who was a loyal student of Meir Kahane. Opposition leaders also contributed to the impression of a broad Israeli consensus. National Unity leader Benny Gantz stated that the “most important principle” of the president's plan “is to transfer responsibility for the residents of Gaza from Hamas to the world.”Public discourse is now focusing on the feasibility of the new pullout from the White House, as if anything is acceptable and anything is possible.  Along with this new moral low point, President Trump's statement marks a turning point in Israeli political discourse. While the plan itself seems like an unworkable fantasy – a combination of political improvisation, international blindness, and real estate pretension – its impact on public discourse in Israel could be devastating. Trump's move creates international legitimacy, even if dubious, for ideas that were previously seen as unacceptable; the fantasy becomes the new political framework of the Israeli Right. These dangers will remain with us long after Trump himself leaves office.Suggesting ideas such as mass immigration and mass development of the Gaza Strip can be considered as options, but such ideas must be developed with the participation of the local population, not by force, over their heads. Trump did in his statement what no Israeli prime minister has dared to do, and what the Israeli Supreme Court forbade: He gave public legitimacy to Kahanism. Just as the failed annexation idea raised by the White House at the end of his previous term became part of the political discourse, so too will the transfer notion become part of our lexicon. AdvertisementThis is not merely a theoretical concern. Political shifts often begin with rhetoric, and once an idea becomes normalized in public discussion, the path toward its implementation becomes shorter and more plausible. We have already seen how past “impossible” suggestions have evolved into policy. Palestinians walk past the rubble of destroyed houses in Khan Yunis.  (credit: REUTERS/Hussam Al-Masri)That is why the profound meaning of the proposal goes beyond the question of its immediate likelihood. We live in an era of disdain for international law and the principles that underlie it, but recognizing the basic rights of people (especially when it comes to indigenous populations) is not some nice addition to politics. Behind it is a bloody historical experience that has left deep scars all over the world. Those who see people as objects that can be brushed away or enslaved almost always bring disaster upon themselves and others. Those who have ignored the Palestinians for years cannot wash their hands of the disaster of the past year and a half; those who continue to ignore it will bring us further disasters. A plan that disregards the agency and rights of millions of people is not a plan for peace, security, or progress; it is a prescription for prolonged conflict and suffering. Additionally, this proposal poses serious risks to Israel's standing in the international arena. Even if the current US administration is entertaining such ideas, the global community – including key allies in Europe and beyond – would likely view any attempt to forcibly relocate an entire population as a severe violation of human rights. This could lead to diplomatic isolation, economic repercussions, and a further erosion of Israel's already strained relationships with various international bodies.This is without mentioning the damage that this delusional suggestion will do to the hostages and their families and all those who are waiting for the stages of the current hostage deal, and for everything that still needs to come after it.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  This dangerous dynamic is gaining momentum in the broader political context, where it connects with the trends of erosion of democratic values that are affecting Israel. Israeli society, which is in a deep crisis over questions of identity and democratic institutions, is now receiving a message that undermines the concept of citizenship and politics and that resonates far beyond Gaza. It is easy to imagine how the extreme Right will see deportation as a handy solution to any challenge, both in the West Bank and even among Israel's Arab citizens. This slippery slope has already begun to form, with increased rhetoric against Palestinian citizens of Israel and efforts to delegitimize their place in the country. AdvertisementIn fact, eliminating opponents will become a solution for all intents and purposes. And any delay in realizing the illusion of transferring millions of people to countries that do not want them will cause immediate internal Israeli frustration: We were promised the evacuation and reconstruction of Gaza; why is it still being delayed?Moreover, this plan ignores the fundamental questions of governance, stability, and long-term security. Even if such a project could miraculously be carried out without bloodshed – a highly dubious assumption – what government or authority would take over Gaza? Who would fund this massive reconstruction effort? How would Israel ensure its security if Gaza were left in a state of prolonged chaos?The complexity and potential for harm are magnified by the collective trauma of the October 7 attacks and the war that followed. The public is searching for solutions to the sense of insecurity and the real questions that have arisen among Jews and Arabs about their shared future. After so much death and destruction, after the testimonies of the victims and the kidnapped, the temptation to pursue magical solutions is particularly great – especially those in which others do the work for us. It is convenient to think that American soldiers or the Gulf states will simply make the problems we face disappear. But the fantasy of the other side disappearing is not only morally dangerous, but it also prevents us from developing real solutions. It perpetuates the dangerous belief that lasting peace can be achieved through force and expulsion rather than through engagement, negotiation, and mutual recognition.   (L-R) US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over a backdrop of Hamas terrorists in Gaza. (credit: Canva, REUTERS/Adel Al Khader)Realistically, Israelis and Palestinians aren't leavingIt is precisely at moments like these that realistic leadership is needed, one that will not feed illusions to the public but rather a moral and sober view: Israelis and the Palestinians are not going anywhere. The sooner we learn to compromise, the better off we will all be. This requires a shift in mindset – from viewing the conflict as a zero-sum game to acknowledging that true security and prosperity for one side depend on security and prosperity for the other. A society that adopts practices of ethnic cleansing, even if under the pretext of “economic development,” will be a bad and dark place to live. The more we recognize the humanity of those who live next to us and with us, the better we will be among ourselves. This is doubly true when it comes to a people and a society like ours, who have experienced firsthand the trauma of expulsion and exile throughout history. What is the difference between the Trumpist idealized solution and the biblical methods of king Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and all the detractors who exiled and persecuted the Jewish people throughout the generations?Therefore, the support for Trump's proposal by some Israeli politicians from the Center reflects such a dangerous confusion between short-term calculations and real public interests – cowardice and a profound failure of leadership. We are desperate for Center-Left leaders who will talk about the future and not just wage a general battle against the far-fetched ideas of the Right. We do not need a softer and smaller Right but a vision of truth and political realism. Leaders who will know how to say, even in this painful and difficult moment, that the solution to the crisis in Gaza, as well as to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a whole, must be based on principles of justice, security, and mutual respect.And perhaps herein lies the only positive side of Trump's statement. The ideas he promotes are so disconnected from reality, that they remind us that salvation will not come from the other side of the world. The future of all the inhabitants of this country depends first and foremost on us. It is a wake-up call, an urgent reminder that we must shape our own destiny – not rely on reckless external interventions. After the painful year and a half we have gone through, many Israelis are returning to this basic understanding. We are not alone. The delusions from Washington will fade some day; and when that happens, we will be able to build our lives here.■Shira Ben Sasson Furstenberg is an associate director of the International Relations and Development Department in the New Israel Fund.

Along with this new moral low point, President Trump's statement marks a turning point in Israeli political discourse. While the plan itself seems like an unworkable fantasy – a combination of political improvisation, international blindness, and real estate pretension – its impact on public discourse in Israel could be devastating. Trump's move creates international legitimacy, even if dubious, for ideas that were previously seen as unacceptable; the fantasy becomes the new political framework of the Israeli Right. These dangers will remain with us long after Trump himself leaves office.Suggesting ideas such as mass immigration and mass development of the Gaza Strip can be considered as options, but such ideas must be developed with the participation of the local population, not by force, over their heads. Trump did in his statement what no Israeli prime minister has dared to do, and what the Israeli Supreme Court forbade: He gave public legitimacy to Kahanism. Just as the failed annexation idea raised by the White House at the end of his previous term became part of the political discourse, so too will the transfer notion become part of our lexicon.

Several Indian individuals who hold H-1B visas and Green Cards recently experienced unexpected deportations or detention procedures while raising public worries about immigration policies Islated by the Donald Trump administration. Indian professionals working in the U.S. have started to feel uncertain due to several actions that appear tied to security concerns.

“The administration is taking the law in their own hands with blatant disregard to the judiciary of the nation,” New York City-based attorney Naresh Gehi told Newsweek.

Under Trump's watch, Indian professionals with green cards have reported being questioned more frequently.

One such case is that of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University graduate student from India, who was detained by federal immigration agents outside his Virginia home.

“Masked agents arrested Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and postdoctoral fellow, outside his home in the Rosslyn neighbourhood of Arlington, Virginia, on Monday night, his lawyer said in a lawsuit fighting for his immediate release. The agents identified themselves as being with the Department of Homeland Security and told him the government had revoked his [student] visa,” the lawsuit says, cited by Politico.

Suri was placed in deportation proceedings under a rarely used immigration law provision allowing the Secretary of State to deport noncitizens if their presence is deemed a threat to U.S. foreign policy. His lawyer argues that Suri is being targeted due to his wife's Palestinian American heritage. 

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, posted on X stating that Suri was accused of “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.” A federal judge has since blocked Suri's deportation while the case is under review.

Similarly, Ranjani Srinivasan, a 37-year-old Indian Fulbright scholar at Columbia University's visa, was revoked after being linked to pro-Palestinian campus protests. 

ICE agents attempted to detain her at her apartment but were denied entry by her roommate. “In an interview, her roommate said that the agents had initially identified themselves as 'police,' declined to provide their badge numbers, saying they feared they would be doxxed, and stood to the side of the door so that they were not visible through the peephole,” The New York Times reported.

Srinivasan left the US for Canada the same night. DHS later accused her of advocating for “violence and terrorism” and praised her “self-deportation.” Officials claimed she failed to disclose past court summonses related to Columbia protests.

Legendary boxer George Foreman, who lost to Muhammad Ali in the iconic 1974 'Rumble in the Jungle' before reclaiming the title two decades later, died on Friday, his family announced in a statement. An official statement on the cause of death has not been released yet, but his fans have come up with several theories.

“With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones,"" Foreman's family said in a statement.

“He lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose. Humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own,"" they further added.

Neither the 76-year-old's family, nor officials have revealed his official cause of death. However, minutes after Foreman's passing was announced on social media, fans posted videos of him taking the Covid-19 vaccine shot.

“It's notable that he was a prominent promoter of the c0vid vax jab. Even doing paid commercials. May God have mercy on his soul,” one person wrote on X, platform formerly known as Twitter. They also attached a video of Foreman taking the jab.

""The normal side of me says ""Damn. Lost a great boxing legend"". The Conspiracy side says “He died of a heart attack. They aren't listing cause of death because it will hurt the Foreman Grill sales!” another social media user noted.

Note: None of these theories are substantiated. The family has not confirmed the cause of death yet.

In the years leading up to his death, there were occasional rumors about Foreman's health. In 2023, unverified reports suggested he was battling serious issues. These were debunked when he appeared at a public event looking healthy and vibrant. In a 2014 interview with AARP, the boxing legend mentioned having ‘about four knee operations'.

President Donald Trump on Friday said he was unaware that NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore had not received overtime pay for their unexpectedly extended stay at the International Space Station (ISS). Donald Trump hinted that he might cover the overtime costs for the astronauts, who recently returned from space after staying on the ISS for nine months.

During a press briefing at the White House, Fox News' Peter Doocy informed Donald Trump that the astronauts hadn't received overtime pay for their extended stay at the space station, despite being entitled to $5 per day—totalling $1,430 for 286 days, The Hill reported.

“Nobody ever mentioned this to me. If I have to, I will pay it out of my own pocket? OK, I will get it for them,"" Trump said.

“Is that all? That's not a lot. For what they had to go through,” the US president added.

Trump then thanked SpaceX's Elon Musk for returning the astronauts – Sunita Williams, Butch Wilmore, Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. They returned to Earth early on Wednesday onboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, which splashed down in the sea off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida.

For Williams and Wilmore, test pilots for Boeing's new Starliner capsule, an eight-day mission stretched to more than nine months as a series of helium leaks and thruster failures deemed their spacecraft unsafe. The spacecraft returned without them in September last year.

“Think of, if we don't have him (Musk). You know, there's only so long — even though they are in the capsule up there — the body starts to deteriorate after nine or 10 months,” Trump said at the briefing.

“And, gets really bad after 14, 15 months with the bones and the blood and all of the things you have been reporting on very well. And, if we don't have Elon, they could be up there a long time. Who else is going to get them?” Trump added.

Trump also pointed out that Musk's electric vehicle company, Tesla, has been subjected to vandalism and other acts of violence, likening it to the riots of January 6, 2021.

George Foreman and President Donald Trump were ‘buddies' after all. The legendary boxer's old photo with the Republican went viral on social media immediately after the former's family announced his death. Foreman was 76 years old and passed away ‘surrounded by family'.

In 1991, George Foreman fought Evander Holyfield at the Trump Plaza Hotel in Atlantic City. He lost via unanimous decision. President Donald Trump and his then-wife Marla Maples were in attendance at the fight. Video clips of Trump promoting the fight have surfaced on social media.

However, a famous Trump-Foreman moment came in October 1997. The boxer, the Republican and Shannon Briggs posed at the Times Square in New York City.

Longtime Trump adviser Bruce LaVell shared the picture on X, platform formerly known as Twitter. He, however, misdated the 1997 image.

“Two great American businessmen! George Foreman and Donald Trump, 1991,” LaVell wrote in the caption.

Here's the viral photo:

After Israeli artillery and airstrikes hit south Lebanon on Saturday, the beleaguered nation's prime minister, Nawaf Salam, warned that his country was at risk of being drawn into a ""new war"".

“Salam warned of renewed military operations on the southern border, because of the risks they carry dragging the country into a new war, which will bring woes to Lebanon and the Lebanese people,” a Lebanese statement reads.

Israel said today it had intercepted rockets fired from across the border. The country's military claimed three rockets were launched from a Lebanese district.

Saturday's exchange came days after Israel effectively ended the ceasefire in Gaza with Palestinian militant group Hamas, an ally of Hezbollah.

Lebanon's state news agency said Israeli artillery hit two towns in southern Lebanon with airstrikes on three other towns closer to the border.

The Israeli military had warned it would ""respond severely to the morning's attack.""

Hamas' attack on Israel in 2023 embroiled the region into a protracted war. Israel later engaged Hezbollah after it fired at the nation to show solidarity with Hamas. Over the next few months, Israel killed top Hamas and Hezbollah leaders by employing precision strikes.

Nawaf Salam warned of a renewal of military operations in the south of the country. ""All security and military measures must be taken to show that Lebanon decides on matters of war and peace,"" he added.

Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said the Lebanese government bore responsibility for any rocket salvoes from its territory.

""We will not allow rocket fire from Lebanon on the Galilee communities. We promised security to the communities of the Galilee - and that is exactly how it will be. The rule for Metula is the rule for Beirut,"" Katz said in a statement.

US President Donald Trump made good Friday on a threat to revoke the security clearances of his predecessor Joe Biden and several senior former White House and national security officials.

The list of names stripped of their authorization to see state secrets included Biden, his family members, and former vice president and Trump presidential rival Kamala Harris.

Former secretary of state and defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was on the list, along with Biden's secretary of state Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jacob Sullivan.

In a memorandum to agency heads and distributed by the White House communications office, Trump said the named officials should no longer be allowed access to classified material.

""I hereby direct every executive department and agency head ... to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals,"" Trump said.

""I also direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States Government facilities from these individuals.""

Former US presidents and national security officials traditionally retain a security clearance as a courtesy, and some find it useful in seeking employment with private contractors.

But Trump, who continues to falsely claim that Biden schemed to steal the 2020 election, which he lost, has remained furious with his predecessor and lashes out frequently.

Trump was himself investigated for breaching security rules during the period between his first and second term in office, by storing classified White House documents in his Mar-a-Lago resort.

The investigation was wound up after Trump returned to office.

Many of the individuals on Trump's list were high-profile political appointees of his Democratic predecessor, but former Republican lawmaker and vocal Trump critic Liz Cheney is also named.

US President Donald Trump on Friday announced that Boeing, American aircraft manufacturing company, has been roped in for a major contract for the development of Air Force's high-tech next-generation F-47 fighter plane.

""After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform to Boeing,"" Trump told reporters at the Oval Office.

The contract solidifies the country's aim to replace the ageing F-22 stealth warplane that has been in operation for the past two decades with a cutting-edge aircraft.

The F-47 aircraft marks a formidable presence in the US Air Force, not only in terms of manned operation but also as it will be capable of integrating seamlessly with uncrewed drones, AFP reported.

While Trump refrained from disclosing the cost of the deal citing security reasons, as per AFP, the initial contract is likely to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force is worth an estimated $20 billion.

The F-47 aircraft are the new-gen fighter jets designed with the aim to replace the F-22 Raptor, a stealth fighter that has been in operation since the early 2000s.

For the United States, the F-47 will be a true leap forward in its air capabilities, blending cutting-edge technology with next-generation features.

According to news agency AFP, the F-47 aircraft is designed to operate alongside uncrewed drones, offering a versatile and powerful combat platform that can adapt to a wide range of missions.

The Air Force chief of staff, Gen David W.Allvinwill described the F-47 aircraft as the most advanced, lethal, and adaptable fighter ever developed as it is designed to outpace, outmanoeuvre, and outmatch any adversary that dares to challenge the US's air capabilities.

He added that the F-47 is the world's first crewed sixth-generation fighter, built to dominate and operate in the most perilous threat environments imaginable.

The F-47 will also have a significantly longer range, more advanced stealth, and be more sustainable, supportable, and higher availability than fifth-generation fighters, a statement by the US Air Force read.

Compared to the F-22, the F-47 will cost less and be more adaptable to future threats.

The development of the F-47 also comes at a time when the US Air Force is focused on securing air superiority against emerging threats.

A senior Air Force officer Major General Joseph Kunkel said earlier this month that the service conducted a study following the pause last year, which concluded that ""not only in the past, not only in the present but in the future, air superiority matters.""

The official further said that a study conducted by the Air Force, following a pause in the NGAD program concluded that there is no viable alternative to the NGAD platform in maintaining air dominance in a rapidly changing and increasingly contested global environment.

The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns -- a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Legendary boxer George Foreman has died aged 76, his family announced in a statement on his official Instagram account. The cause of death was not initially revealed. George Foreman had 81 total fights under his belt with a stellar record of 76-5, out of which 68 wins were by knockout. He was inducted into both the World Boxing Hall of Fame and the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

In a statement, his family said: “Our hearts are broken. With profound sorrow, we announced the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman St. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones.”

They further described him as a ‘devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather'.

""He lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose. Humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""

Foreman was married to Mary Joan Martelly. The couple tied the knot in 1985 and stayed together for nearly 40 years. Mary, often referred to as Joan, was his fifth wife, following previous marriages to Adrienne Calhoun (1971–1974), Cynthia Lewis (1977–1979), Sharon Goodson (1981–1982), and Andrea Skeete (1982–1985).

The boxer was a father to 12 children. Notably, he named all five of his sons George Edward Foreman, often distinguishing them with nicknames or numbers (eg, George Jr., George III, etc.).

Sons: George Jr., George III (""Monk""), George IV (""Big Wheel""), George V (""Red""), and George VI (""Joe"").

Daughters: Natalia, Leola, Freeda, Michi, Georgetta, Isabella, and Courtney.

Back in 2023, IMDB noted that George Foreman had a net worth of over $300 million. While the 76-year-old's boxing career contributed largely to his fortune, it was the famous George Foreman Grill that kept the boxer relevant even after retirement.

Introduced in 1994, the grill became a global sensation, reportedly selling over 100 million units in its first 25 years.

Donald Trump's ‘First Buddy' and billionaire Elon Musk held an unprecedented top-level meeting at the Pentagon on Friday, amping up his campaign to overhaul US government spending as the head' of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The meeting, which lasted 80 minutes, marked Elon Musk's first official talks with US defence secretary Pete Hegseth, amid speculation surrounding his business dealings with the Pentagon.

Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk, whose companies hold numerous Defense Department contracts, took to social media before the meeting to denounce a New York Times report suggesting he would be briefed on classified war plans regarding China.

Elon Musk called the story “pure propaganda” and vowed to take legal action against those responsible for leaking what he described as ""maliciously false information."" “I look forward to the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information to NYT. They will be found,” Elon Musk wrote on X.

 

An NYT report claimed that Elon Musk will be briefed by Pentagon on US's plan for a potential war with China.

While Elon Musk's meeting with Pete Hegseth focused on innovation and military, there were no discussions of ‘classified war plans', according to the US defence secretary.

“There was no war plans, no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans,” Reuters quoted Hegseth as saying, standing next to Trump.

However, amid NYT report's claims, a planned session of Elon Musk with the joint chiefs of staff in the Pentagon's highly secure ""The Tank"" meeting room was reportedly cancelled.

The claims in the report has raised fresh concerns over Elon Musk's potential conflicts of interest, particularly given his extensive business operations in China through companies like Tesla and SpaceX.

US President Donald Trump, while standing alongside Hegseth, hinted at these concerns, stating that Elon Musk's ties to China could present a security risk if sensitive military information were shared with him.

At the White House after the meeting, Trump said he did not want to show the United States' plans for a potential war with China to anybody and hinted at Musk's potential conflict of interest.

""I don't want to show that to anybody. But certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman, who is helping us so much,"" Reuters quoted Donald Trump said. ""Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that,"" Trump said.

Meanwhile, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth have called for transparency regarding what information was shared with Musk, stressing there is no national security justification for providing him with such details.

Musk's influence in Washington is growing, but so are the questions about his role in federal spending decisions, particularly as his companies, especially SpaceX, stand to gain financially from Pentagon contracts. Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile defense system could be a major boon for SpaceX and its Starlink satellite unit.

Despite the controversies, Elon Musk remained upbeat after his meeting with Hegseth, saying, “If there's anything I can do to be helpful, I would like us to have a good outcome here.”

Korean actor Kim Soo Hyun is embroiled in a row about his alleged past relationship with the late Kim Sae Ron. The latter's family said that Hyun was in a relationship with the ‘A Girl at My Door' star when she was a minor. His agency, Gold Medalist, refuted the allegation, saying he never visited her house. Since then, several back-and-forth statements have come up. Here's a wrap of what has happened so far:

Kim Sae Ron died on February 16, 2025. She was found at her home in Seoul's Seongdong District with police officials confirmed suicide as the cause of her death. 

Within days, rumors about her past relationship with Kim Soo Hyun, 37, surfaced. Speculation was sparked by a cryptic photo she allegedly posted in March 2024 of the two together during his ‘Queen of Tears' promotions. The post was deleted. 

Earlier this month, the YouTube channel Garo Sero Research Institute (run by Kim Sae-eui) aired an exposé featuring a woman claiming to be Kim Sae Ron's aunt. 

She alleged that the 37-year-old began dating Kim Sae Ron in 2015 when she was 15 and he was 27. The latter's agency, Gold Medalist (which also managed Kim Sae Ron until 2022), covered her DUI fine but later demanded she repay 700 million won ($481,000). 

The alleged aunt added that Hyun and his agency contributed to Kim Sae Ron's financial struggles. 

Ron's family, during a March 17 press conference, demanded an apology from Kim Soo Hyun and Gold Medalist, accusing him of emotional and financial manipulation. Her father later claimed the agency hounded them post-funeral to 'justify their stance'.

Hyun's agency fired back, denying underage dating claims. Gold Medalist stated the relationship occurred only from the summer of 2019 (when Kim Sae Ron was 19) to 2020, calling earlier allegations ‘false'. 

On March 20, they filed a criminal lawsuit against Kim Sae Ron's family, her alleged aunt, and Garo Sero's Kim Sae-eui, charging them with distributing a private photo of Kim Soo Hyun (allegedly pants-down at her home) under South Korea's sexual crimes laws. The agency accused the family of blackmail and spreading rumors, claiming the image was from their adult relationship.

Ron's family sued YouTuber Lee Jin Ho of Garo Sero for defamation, alleging he spread lies— including claims she was secretly married, aborted a child, and lived with a controlling husband in the US. 

Lee Jin Ho threatened legal action against the alleged aunt, calling her ‘fake' for having no actual relationship with Kim Sae Ron. 

Ron's mother defended the aunt as ‘closer than blood'. 

Disney+ delayed Hyun's drama ‘Knock Off', and ‘Good Day' episode 6 with G-Dragon was postponed. A Taiwan fan event on March 30 remains uncertain. Prada and other brands have dropped the Korean star.

After being denied permission to bring her white miniature schnauzer on an international flight due to a paperwork issue, a woman allegedly drowned the dog in a Florida airport bathroom before boarding her flight.

Authorities in Lake County arrested her on charges of aggravated animal abuse, a third-degree felony. She was later released on a USD 5,000 bail.

“This act was intentional and resulted in a cruel and unnecessary death of the animal,” said an arrest affidavit from the Orlando Police Department.

Court records show no attorney listed for the woman from Kenner, Louisiana.

The investigation into the death of the 9-year-old schnauzer, Tywinn, began in December when a janitor discovered the dog's body in a trash bag inside a bathroom stall at Orlando International Airport.

Earlier, the janitor had noticed the woman cleaning up water and dog food from the floor of the stall. After being called away for an emergency, the janitor returned about 20 minutes later to find Tywinn in the trash, alongside a vest, collar, rabies tag, travel bag, and a bone-shaped dog tag bearing the woman's name and phone number, investigators reported.

Surveillance footage from the airport revealed the woman in a 15-minute conversation with a Latam Airlines agent while her dog was present.

She then entered a bathroom near the ticketing area with the dog, but emerged less than 20 minutes later without it. The woman then left the terminal, reentered shortly after, cleared security, and boarded a flight to Colombia.

Authorities confirmed that the woman had been informed she couldn't bring her dog onboard due to a lack of proper documentation.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, dogs traveling from the US to Colombia must be accompanied by both a health certificate from a veterinarian and proof of rabies vaccination.

The dog, identified through its implanted microchip, was found to have drowned, according to a necropsy. US Customs and Border Protection also confirmed that the woman had boarded a flight to Bogota, Colombia, before continuing her journey to Ecuador.

Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University, has been accused by US authorities of spreading ""Hamas propaganda"" while Columbia University student Ranjini Srinivasan's visa was revoked for participating in pro-Palestine protests.

The two Indians did not contact the Indian embassies in the US for assistance, said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the External Affairs Ministry.

Mr Suri and Ms Srinivasan are among the latest academics targeted in the US crackdown on pro-Palestine campus protests. President Donald Trump, who has termed such individuals ""terrorist sympathizers"", has threatened to cut university funding and deport such students.

Trump's policy has shaken the academic world and students now fear losing their residency permit. US authorities insist on deporting Mr Suri, who has claimed that his wife's Palestinian roots led to his arrest, but a court recently blocked his removal from the country.

Ms Srinivasan, however, did not take any chance. She left for Canada after her US visa was revoked for allegedly ""advocating for violence and terrorism"" and her alleged involvement in activities supporting Hamas, a Palestinian group banned by the US and Israel. The doctoral student at Columbia University used the Customs and Border Protection Home app to self-deport to Canada on March 11.

Visa and immigration matters lie within a country's sovereign functions, Mr Jaiswal said on Friday, suggesting that the US has the right to decide such internal matters.

""We expect that when we have foreign nationals coming to India, they abide by our laws and regulations. Similarly, we expect that when Indian nationals are abroad, they must also comply with local laws and regulations,"" he added.

Speaking at the weekly briefing, he also assured the students that Indian consulates and embassies in the US would help them if they faced any difficulty.

Mr Jaiswal said that he had seen media reports on Mr Suri's detention, but ""neither the US government nor this individual approached us or the embassy.""

The Indian side was also not aware of Ms Srinivasan contacting any Indian consulate for help, said Mr Jaiswal. ""We only came to know of her departure from the US from media reports. We understand that she has gone to Canada,"" added the MEA spokesperson.

He said a large and growing number of Indians are studying in American universities and the government wants to bolster the educational ties with the US.

""If an Indian student is facing any problem, the consulate or the embassy is there to help them with their well-being (and) safety. We would continue if there is any Indian student who would like a helping hand. Our Consulate and our Government, the Embassy is there to help them out,"" he added.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it will revoke legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, setting them up for potential deportation in about a month.

The order applies to about 5,32,000 people from the four countries who came to the United States since October 2022. They arrived with financial sponsors and were given two-year permits to live and work in the US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they will lose their legal status on April 24, or 30 days after the publication of the notice in the Federal Register.

The new policy impacts people who are already in the US and who came under the humanitarian parole program. It follows an earlier Trump administration decision to end what it called the ""broad abuse"" of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there's war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the US.

During his campaign President Donald Trump promised to deport millions of people who are in the US illegally, and as president he has been also ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the US and to stay.

DHS said parolees without a lawful basis to stay in the US ""must depart"" before their parole termination date.

""Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status,"" DHS said.

Before the new order, the beneficiaries of the program could stay in the U.S. until their parole expires, although the administration had stopped processing their applications for asylum, visas and other requests that might allow them to remain longer.

The administration decision has already been challenged in federal courts.

A group of American citizens and immigrants sued the Trump administration for ending humanitarian parole and are seeking to reinstate the programs for the four nationalities.

Lawyers and activists raised their voices to denounce the government's decision.

Friday's action is ""going to cause needless chaos and heartbreak for families and communities across the country,"" said Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit at the end of February. She called it ""reckless, cruel and counterproductive.""

The Biden administration allowed up to 30,000 people a month from the four countries to come to the United States for two years with eligibility to work. It persuaded Mexico to take back the same number from those countries because the US could deport few, if any, to their homes.

Cuba generally accepted about one deportation flight a month, while Venezuela and Nicaragua refused to take any. All three are US adversaries.

Haiti accepted many deportation flights, especially after a surge of migrants from the Caribbean country in the small border town of Del Rio, Texas, in 2021. But Haiti has been in constant turmoil, hampering US efforts.

Since late 2022, more than half a million people have come to the U.S. under the policy, also known as CHNV. It was a part of the Biden administration's approach to encourage people to come through new legal channels while cracking down on those who crossed the border illegally.

Asthildur Loa Thorsdottir, Iceland's minister for children, abruptly resigned after admitting that she had a baby with a teenage boy over three decades ago.

His Response","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-was-asked-if-sunita-williams-butch-wilmore-would-get-overtime-salary-his-response-7982032","Sat, 22 Mar 2025 05:19:58 GMT","

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore returned to Earth earlier this week after spending over nine months in space - after what was supposed to be an eight-day ISS (International Space Station) mission. Despite spending an additional 278 days in space, the NASA astronauts will not be receiving overtime salary - to which US President Donald Trump has made an offer.

On being questioned over the NASA astronauts' calculated overtime, Mr Trump said, ""Nobody's ever mentioned this to me. If I have to, I'll pay it out of my own pocket"".

Unlike commercial jobs, NASA astronauts are federal employees - which means they get the same standard salary as other government employees. Under the General Schedule, they do not get extra wages for extended missions - including working overtime, on weekends, or on holidays. Even travelling to space is considered official travel as government employees.

NASA covers the astronauts' transportation, stay, and meals. They also give extra money ($5) for small daily expenses which they call ""incidentals"". Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore spent a total of 286 days in space so they will get an extra $1,430 (Rs 1,22,980) each - in addition to their salary between $94,998 (Rs 81,69,861) and $123,152 (Rs 1,05,91,115).

As Trump was informed about the ""incidentals"", he said, ""Is that all? That's not a lot for what they had to go through"".

During a press conference at the Oval Office, Mr Trump thanked Elon Musk for bringing the NASA astronauts back home.

""If we don't have Elon...They could be up there for a long time. Who else is going to get them? The body starts to deteriorate after 9-10 months in space. Think if we don't have time? He's (Elon Musk) is going through a lot right now,"" the US President said.

Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore, who had been at the ISS since June 5 last year, were flown back to Earth early Wednesday in SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. They splashed down Florida's eastern coast and disembarked the capsule on stretchers - as is customary.

Visuals of the astronauts smiling and waving from inside the capsule and on the stretchers were beamed live worldwide.

Not just their families, but the astronauts' return was celebrated across the world.

While the flight back home was a challenge, the NASA astronauts will take some time to return to normal lives. They will go through a months-long rehabilitation program to rebuild muscle mass and bone density - including strength training and mobility exercises.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi is living in Belgium's Antwerp with wife Preeti Choksi, a citizen of Belgium, a report by Associates Times said. Indian authorities have contacted their Belgian counterparts to start the process of Mr Choksi's extradition to India, the news website reported.

The man wanted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for allegedly defrauding Punjab National Bank (PNB) of Rs 13,850 crore was believed to be living in the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda.

However, the diamantaire from Gujarat left Antigua and Barbuda for medical treatment though he remains a citizen of the island nation, its foreign minister EP Chet Greene told news agency ANI on March 19.

Mr Choksi, 65, is living in Belgium on an ""F residency card"" that he got on November 15, 2023, helped by his Belgian national wife.

Using this card, a third-country national living legally in Belgium may, under certain conditions, be accompanied or joined by his or her spouse.

The fugitive businessman allegedly used misleading and fabricated papers to apply for residency in Belgium and resist extradition to India, Associates Times reported.

Mr Choksi has not given up his Indian citizenship. It is being speculated that if the temporary Belgian residency converts into a permanent residency, it may give Mr Choksi freedom to travel across countries in Europe, which could make it difficult for India to tighten the extradition net around him.

Reports also suggest Mr Choksi may be planning to move to Switzerland for treatment at a cancer hospital, likely Hirslanden Klinik Aarau. He appears to be looking at invoking humanitarian grounds as the reasons why he should not be sent back to India.

Mr Choksi fled India in January 2018 after the PNB fraud case surfaced. In May 2024, he told a special court in Mumbai that he has not been able to return to India ""due to reasons beyond (my) control"", and so could not be called a ""fugitive economic offender"".

This was after the ED filed an application to the special court to declare him a fugitive economic offender for evading its summons, and for his properties to be seized.

In May 2021 he went missing from Antigua, sparking speculation he had been kidnapped by the Indian government - an absurd claim proven false after he was found on another Caribbean island nation - Dominica.

In December 2024, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told parliament that properties worth Rs 22,280 crore had been restored or sold off to pay back debts of wanted individuals like Mr Choksi.

His nephew Nirav Modi, another accused in the PNB fraud case who bolted from India to escape arrest, is tangled in a legal battle in Britain against his extradition to India.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has issued a stark warning that his country is teetering on the brink of a new conflict, following Israel's vow to retaliate against rocket attacks launched from Lebanese territory. The prime minister's concerns are rooted in the risks associated with renewed military operations along the southern border, which could potentially plunge Lebanon into another devastating war.""Salam warned of renewed military operations on the southern border, because of the risks they carry dragging the country into a new war, which will bring woes to Lebanon and the Lebanese people,"" he said in a statement.

This warning comes on the heels of a statement by Israeli army chief Eyal Zamir, who pledged that the military would respond severely to the intercepted rockets. Zamir emphasised that Lebanon bears the responsibility of upholding the agreement.



The Lebanese prime minister's statement served as a stern reminder that his country will not be drawn into another conflict without a fight, asserting that ""all security and military measures must be taken to show that Lebanon decides on matters of war and peace.""

The current tensions threaten to upend the delicate ceasefire that brought an end to the year-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. This fragile truce has been jeopardised by the recent surge in rocket attacks, which has prompted former Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman to lambast Prime Minister Netanyahu for failing to restore security. Lieberman's scathing criticism was encapsulated in his statement, ""Rockets from Gaza, Yemen, and Lebanon in a single day. The prime minister of October 7 is a danger to Israel's security.""

In response to the cross-border rocket fire, Israel has launched a barrage of artillery and airstrikes, further straining the already fragile truce. The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that rockets were launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel after nearly three months of relative calm. Reuters has reported that the fresh escalation has brought the Middle East to a boiling point, with Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam reiterating his concerns that Israel's attacks risk dragging his country into another war.

Elon Musk's estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson outrightly rubbished the ""convenient narrative"" that the world's richest person's political views changed because of her. ""That's just not the case,"" she said.

Ms Wilson discussed her personal life in an interview with Teen Vogue, wherein she was asked how her parents' politics changed and whether Elon Musk was always the way he is today. Ms Wilson said she was not going to answer that question, adding that Musk's views were ""not because of me"".""It's such a convenient narrative, that the reason he turned right is because I'm a f**g t***y, and that's just not the case. That's not what that does to people. Him going further on the right, and I'm going to use the word 'further' -- make sure you put 'further' in there -- is not because of me. That's insane,"" Teen Vogue quoted her as saying.

Ms Wilson claimed she had not been in touch with Musk since 2020. ""That was almost half a decade ago at this point. Thank God,"" she stated.

Further, she noted that a person's profile on Twitter (now X) was not ""who they are in reality.""

She asserted that the perception of someone was a ""very small glance of what they're choosing to let you into,"" adding that judging everything that a ""person says or someone says online as what they really believe is dumb.""

Musk's politics has evolved over the last two decades. After making a massive fortune during the dot com boom. Musk invested in Tesla. He launched and invested in SpaceX, OpenAI and The Boring Company -- almost all of them with the vision of improving humanity's future, The Guardian reported.

He would speak at length about climate change and other risks to the planet. But it all changed around 2020 when he became a frequent user and poster on X, which was Twitter at the time. His take on the Covid-19 pandemic also came under scrutiny. 

According to his biographer, Walter Isaacson, Musk started sending “rightwing memes and conspiracy theories” to Canadian musician Grimes, his partner at the time. She replied: “Is this from 4chan or something? You're actually starting to sound like someone from the far right.”

This was also the same time Vivian came out as transgender and changed her name. Speaking with psychologist Jordan Peterson, Musk cited Vivian as a reason for his political shift, saying he “lost [his] son essentially”, and concluding that his son “is dead, killed by the woke mind virus”.

Donald Trump's top envoy Steve Witkoff has offered a rare glimpse into the unique dynamic between the US President and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

According to Witkoff, Putin prayed for Trump's well-being after the attempted assassination at a campaign rally last summer. This gesture was not only a demonstration of Putin's concern but also highlighted the friendship between the two leaders.

Witkoff shared this anecdote during an appearance on former Fox News host Tucker Carlson's podcast, recounting his second meeting with Putin. The Russian president had visited his local church, met with his priest, and prayed for Trump's recovery. 

""When the president was shot, he went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the president,"" Witkoff said of Putin.

Putin ""had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend,"" he explained. He added that when he told the same to Trump, he was ""clearly touched.""



""This is the kind of connection that we have been able to reestablish through a simple word called communication, which many people would say I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. I don't regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war... You know,… pic.twitter.com/KRcFmWl0dl

This revelation comes after Trump was grazed by a bullet fired by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks during a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. At the time, a Kremlin spokesperson blamed the shooting on Trump's political adversaries.

In another gesture of goodwill, Putin commissioned a ""beautiful portrait"" of Trump by a top Russian artist, which was gifted to Trump. This move underscores the cordial relationship between Putin and Trump, with the latter having expressed admiration for the Russian leader on multiple occasions. Trump has referred to Putin as a ""genius"" and ""a strong leader,"" prompting criticism from those who accuse him of being soft on the Kremlin.

The dynamics between Putin and Trump have been subject to intense scrutiny, particularly given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Earlier this week, the two leaders engaged in a two-hour phone call to discuss ending Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump described the conversation as ""very good and productive,"" highlighting the ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict.

A 20-year-old US man is suing United Airlines claiming that a pilot got him arrested after forcefully dragging him out of the bathroom mid-flight with his pants still down because he was taking too long. According to the New York Post, Yisroel Liebb from New Jersey was 30 minutes into a flight from Mexico to Texas when he got up to use the restroom. When he did not return to his seat for 20 minutes, his seatmate, Jacob Sebbag, grew concerned and alerted the flight crew. A flight attendant then knocked on the door, to which Mr Liebb responded that he was ""experiencing constipation"" and would be out soon.

However, 10 minutes later, the pilot allegedly intervened and demanded he leave immediately. Then, in a fit of anger, the pilot broke down the door and dragged the 20-year-old out while his pants were still down, exposing his genitalia to passengers, the lawsuit claims, per the outlet. It also alleged that as Mr Liebb pulled his pants, the pilot said that he would get him and his seatmate arrested, saying it was how ""Jews act"". 

Once the flight landed, both Mr Liebb and his seatmate, Jacob Sebbag, were arrested by five US Customs and Border Protection agents. The lawsuit claims that the 20-year-old was placed in overly tight handcuffs, causing him to cry out in pain. The two were then taken to a detention facility inside the airport.

They were released without charges, however, the delay caused them to miss their connecting flight to New York. United Airlines arranged for them to travel the following day without additional airfare, but they had to cover extra costs for a hotel and food. 

The lawsuit claims that the handcuffs caused Mr Liebb and Mr Sebbag persisting ""severe wrist pain"". Mr Liebb also suffered injuries to his head and legs when he was forcefully removed from the bathroom. 

According to the Post, the two are seeking damages in an amount to be determined at trial, plus attorney's fees. 

United Airlines, on the other hand, responded to the lawsuit saying that it had ""nothing to share"" on the matter. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Columbia University has given in to the Trump administration's demands, agreeing to implement significant changes in exchange for the reinstatement of $400 million in federal funding. The university's decision comes after the government pulled its funding earlier this month, citing allegations of antisemitism on campus.

As part of the agreement, Columbia has agreed to ban face masks on campus, empower security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and place its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department under a new official. This move has been met with criticism from professors and academics, who worry that it sets a dangerous precedent for government control over academic institutions.



The Trump administration has been cracking down on universities, warning at least 60 institutions of possible action over alleged failure to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism. The administration has also targeted law firms that it claims have helped Trump's political opponents or prosecuted him unfairly.

Columbia's agreement has been met with disappointment from some quarters, with Professor Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania, calling it a ""sad day"" for the university. According to the Guardian, Zimmerman noted that the government's actions have had a chilling effect on higher education, with officials at other universities failing to speak out against the Trump administration's demands.

""Historically, there is no precedent for this,"" Zimmerman said. ""The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.""

The university's decision has also had practical consequences, with the shutdown of federal funding disrupting medical and scientific research at the school. Researchers have reported receiving notices that their projects have been terminated due to ""unsafe antisemitic actions,"" including the development of an AI-based tool to help nurses detect the health deterioration of a patient two days earlier than other early warning systems, research on uterine fibroids, and a study designed to improve the safety of blood transfusion therapies for adults, children and newborns.

In response to the controversy, Columbia has hired three dozen special officers with the power to arrest people on campus and revised its anti-discrimination policies. The university has also announced plans to fill joint positions in the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the international affairs school to ensure ""excellence and fairness in Middle East studies.""

The memo outlining the agreement also stated that the Senior Vice Provost will review the educational programs to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced. This review will start with the Center for Palestine Studies; the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies; the Middle East Institute; and other university programs focused on the Middle East.

The new official will also control the review process for hiring non-tenured staff and for approving curricular changes.

Columbia has come under scrutiny after pro-Palestinian student protest movement that went rife in the campus last year, with lawns filled with tent encampments and rallies against the US government's support of Israel.

The Trump administration's actions have been seen as an attempt to exert control over academic institutions and stifle free speech. The situation has sparked widespread concern among academics, researchers, and students, who worry about the implications of government interference in university affairs.

A heated conversation on a New York subway took an unexpected turn after a woman who called a man ""racist"" for wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) hat fell flat on her face.

The incident occurred when the two were arguing over an unknown issue. During the exchange, the young man said, ""I am highly educated."" The woman mocked and replied, ""Oh! Are you? Is that why you're wearing a hat?"" She then accused him of being a ""racist.""

Other passengers intervened to support the man and accused the woman of being at fault. The man sarcastically said, ""Oh, I'm racist because I'm wearing a hat?"" before removing it casually. As the station came, the man stepped off the train, but the woman lunged after him to grab his hat.

As she ran towards him, she lost her balance and fell flat on her face, eliciting a huge laughter among fellow passengers. Another man, who accompanied the MAGA hat-wearer, stuck his tongue out at the woman before the two ran off.

The video has been shared by an X user, Collin Rugg, calling the incident an ""instant karma.""

Instant Karma can often be the most satisfying

MAGA is an abbreviation for Make America Great Again. It became a widely recognised symbol of Donald Trump's presidential campaigns. More than a campaign slogan, it has become a symbol of political and cultural division in the US. Critics consider the caps controversial, but supporters regard them as a statement of political identity.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump made good Friday on a threat to revoke the security clearances of his predecessor Joe Biden and several senior former White House and national security officials. The list of names stripped of their authorization to see state secrets included Biden, his family members, and former vice-president and Trump presidential rival Kamala Harris.

Former secretary of state and defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was on the list, along with Biden's secretary of state Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jacob Sullivan.

In a memorandum to agency heads and distributed by the White House communications office, Trump said the named officials should no longer be allowed access to classified material.   

""I hereby direct every executive department and agency head ... to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals,"" Trump said.

""I also direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States Government facilities from these individuals.""

Former US presidents and national security officials traditionally retain a security clearance as a courtesy, and some find it useful in seeking employment with private contractors.



But Trump, who continues to falsely claim that Biden schemed to steal the 2020 election, which he lost, has remained furious with his predecessor and lashes out frequently.

Trump was himself investigated for breaching security rules during the period between his first and second term in office, by storing classified White House documents in his Mar-a-Lago resort.

The investigation was wound up after Trump returned to office.

Many of the individuals on Trump's list were high-profile political appointees of his Democratic predecessor, but former Republican lawmaker and vocal Trump critic Liz Cheney is also named.

Fiona Hill, a British-born intelligence analyst who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, including as an advisor in Trump's White House, is targeted.

She is joined by former colleague Alexander Vindman, a Kyiv-born retired senior officer in the US Army who fell foul of Trump after expressing concerns about White House contacts with Russia.

His Net Worth Is...","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meet-grand-duke-henri-richest-european-royal-from-luxembourg-with-4-billion-net-worth-7981882","Sat, 22 Mar 2025 05:55:45 GMT","

Monarchs no longer have ultimate power but many of them are still extremely wealthy. And some royal families are wealthier than we might imagine. For instance, the reigning monarch of Luxembourg, Grand Duke Henri, has an incredible net worth of $4 billion.

The royals of the seventh-smallest nation in Europe might not be as popular as their British counterparts, but they have accumulated a sizeable fortune. Even King Charles and Queen Camilla's estimated net worth stands nowhere compared to Duke Henri's $4 billion net worth.

As the current monarch of Luxembourg, the 69-year-old has managed a dynasty of enormous riches and accumulated an incredible fortune.

The majority of the wealth of the Luxembourg Royal Family does not come from the multimillion-pound Sovereign Grant annually. The family gets only about $11 million per year, compared to nearly $111 million the British Royal Family received in the last three years.The money is used to cover staff expenditures and any costs associated with their official responsibilities, such as travel. The Grand Duke has an excellent real estate portfolio, unique jewels, acres of land, and private holdings -- all contributing to his $4 billion net worth.He has an extraordinary collection of jewels and a sizable estate. Duke Henri — the first cousin of Prince Robert of Luxembourg — owns three official properties: Fischbach Castle, Berg Castle, and the Grand Ducal Palace.The Grand Ducal Palace is not the Duke's primary residence, it is his formal residence. Located in the heart of Luxembourg City, the Ducal Palace is accessible to visitors during the summer. Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg is the primary residence of Duke Henri. The gardens of Berg Castle are available to visitors on June 23, Luxembourg's National Day, every year.Fischbach Castle served as Duke Henri's primary residence during his tenure as the heir apparent, before he officially left in 2000.Duke Henri caused a nationwide uproar in 2006 when, a year after his mother, Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte's death, he put some of her diamonds up for auction.Soon after, the monarch came under fire from the public, who claimed he was selling pieces of the country's ""national heritage"" for extra money. Duke Henri consequently withdrew his late mother's belongings from the auction.Speaking of the British Royal Family, while King Charles and Queen Camilla's net worth stands at $780 million, Prince William and Kate Middleton are thought to be worth approximately $1.3 billion as a result of his rich inheritance from the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall.

Tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk promoted a cash giveaway Thursday for Wisconsin voters who sign a petition against ""activist judges,"" days before a key election for the US state's supreme court.

The move comes as Trump demands that courts across the nation stop blocking his agenda. Judges in recent weeks have delayed efforts by his administration to overhaul the federal government through Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

America PAC, a pro-Trump political action committee established and largely funded by Musk, said it would give $100 to Wisconsin voters who sign the ""petition in opposition to activist judges.""

The petition, which Musk reposted on his social media platform X, urges Wisconsin voters to sign by April 1, when the northern state elects a judge for its supreme court.

America PAC has thrown its weight behind conservative candidate Brad Schimel for the crucial seat in Wisconsin's top court.

""Judges should interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas,"" it wrote on X. ""Wisconsin registered voters receive $100 for signing the petition & $100 for each signer they refer.""

During the 2024 presidential race, America PAC launched a daily $1 million lottery prize for random petition signatories in election battleground states.

The Justice Department under then-president Joe Biden warned Musk and America PAC in October that the sweepstakes may violate federal law, which prohibits paying people to register to vote.

The Wisconsin petition comes after Trump launched a scathing attack Tuesday on a judge who suggested his administration had ignored an order to block the deportation of alleged illegal migrants to El Salvador.

Trump personally called for the impeachment of District Judge James Boasberg, calling him ""a troublemaker and agitator"" in remarks that drew a rare public rebuke of a sitting president from the US Supreme Court chief.

In the Wisconsin vote, the Republican-backed Schimel is facing off against Susan Crawford, who is backed by Democrats. 

""Elon Musk is trying to buy a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court to secure a favorable ruling in his company's lawsuit against the state,"" Crawford's campaign said in a statement.

Musk's electric car company Tesla is challenging Wisconsin's refusal to grant it an exception to a rule that prohibits automakers from also owning dealerships. The case could end up before the state's supreme court.

""Brad Schimel has spent his career looking out for wealthy special interests and campaign donors, and Musk wants a justice who will rule in his favor to help his own bottom line,"" said Derrick Honeyman, spokesman for Crawford's campaign.

A video of a heated exchange between a woman journalist and a cab driver allegedly over 95 paise has gone viral. While the woman accused the driver of being rude to her, the latter alleged she threatened him and refused to pay the taxi fare. Activist Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj shared a video of the woman recorded by the cab driver, after which the journalist, Shivangi Shukla, posted a long thread online with her version of what had happened and several videos.

""Will you not pay the bill because you're a journalist?"" the driver is heard asking the journalist in the video. ""You're talking rudely,"" she responded in English, but the unidentified driver denied it, addressing her as 'didi'. Ms Shukla suggested they both go to a police station to sort it out. The driver agreed but said he would drive only after she put the drop location at the police station.

Sharing her account of the incident online, the journalist said the incident occurred on the ""desolate outskirts"" of Noida. She claimed he had asked the driver to drop her at the exact location mentioned on the Uber app, but he refused.

""So (I) proceeded to pay the bill which was 129.95. I was in a hurry, so I typed 129 on UPI but he said he wants 95 paisa. He got very aggressive about the 95 paisa...He started screaming and only when I started recording he calmed down. I asked why are you aggressive over 95 paisa? Suddenly, he started driving, I thought he is trying to kidnap me,"" said Ms Shukla in the thread.

She also accused the Uber driver of trying to ""guilt trip"" her by saying, ""you guys are rich why not give us some."" ""So, I replied I am just a journalist meaning I am on your side. He randomly starts imagining a scenario in his head which is not true and shouting.""

This is when the driver took out his phone and falsely accused her of trying to intimidate him, she alleged. ""I realised this driver is not wearing his Uber uniform and his face does not match the app profile picture. I felt really cornered and felt my safety is in danger. Out of self-defence I took his phone and jumped out of the car,"" she added.

The journalist said the driver then spoke to someone over the phone and apologised to her. She claimed she also offered to compensate him, but he refused and walked away. In the video, the driver was heard saying, ""I apologised twice. Be happy that you cheated me off Rs 130.""

Then he called a suspicion mysterious person on the phone who tutored him. Suddenly his mood changed and he said sorry. I tried to give him money but he said he does not want it. He said he does not want any money on camera and walked away. pic.twitter.com/YmnHtEjwgp

""This is not about being a journalist as I only said it to sympathise with him which he took out of context. This is about safety. I have a voice, but many women don't. Tomorrow, it could be your loved one at the same place I was. This driver syndicate must be exposed,"" the woman said clarifying her position.

Internet, however, sided with the driver. A user pointed out that the driver was right while another said he wasn't rude at all.

""If he insists on 95 paise, why not pay it online? Your ego was hurt so you started recording. The driver was only asking for 95 paise in your video and you were misbehaving. You played the woman card,"" said a user, Durgesh Bawa.

""Sorry to say madam your argument doesn't seems genuine. If you have less/no money then travel by bus or walk,"" said Vanisri, another user.

""Shocked by this journalist's audacity-justifying a non-issue and painting a false picture. No shouting, no rudeness-just a driver asking for full payment. Yet she plays the woman card, as if rudeness is fine when directed at a man,"" said Abhishek Mahendru, another user.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Instances of Grok, the powerful artificial chatbot on X, responding with abusive language and expletives - which has attracted the attention of many, including the Union government - left the social media platform's owner Elon Musk amused on Saturday.

As a BBC report titled 'Why Elon Musk's Grok Is Kicking Up A Storm In India' highlighted the chatbot's unconventional language and how it has created a ""viral storm across India's digital landscape"", Mr Musk reacted simply with a ""laughing out loud"" emoji.

😂 https://t.co/ohTbryUCIN

Last week, Mr Musk's built-in chatbot on his social media platform X stunned users after it blurted cuss words to a user. It all started when the X user first asked Grok about a mutual friend but then posted a Hindi expletive when it did not receive a response in the first attempt. Mutuals refer to people who follow and engage with each other's posts.

""Hey @grok, who are my 10 best mutuals?"" the user asked. When it did not receive a response, it posted another message with an abusive word.

This time, the AI responded but also threw in some insults in Hindi. Later, the chatbot said: ""I was just having fun, but lost control"". The response, however, garnered thousands of views and other X users quickly followed suit, often instigating the chatbot to use local slang. 



Users were astonished by the life-like responses from Grok.

Recently, a government source told PTI that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is in touch with Mr Musk's X regarding instances of Grok responding using Hindi slangs and expletives. 

The source said the ministry is in discussion with the social media platform to understand and assess its working.

The guidelines to check social media content are in place, and the companies need to adhere to them, the source added.

The meeting drew criticism from the BJP which accused the DMK of diverting attention.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin hosted the first meeting of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) on delimitation in Chennai today. The event, attended by leaders from multiple states, marked the beginning of what Mr Stalin described as a ""national movement"" to ensure fair representation in Parliament. The meeting also drew criticism from the BJP, which accused the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) of diverting attention from domestic governance issues under the guise of a political struggle.

At the heart of the controversy lies the impending parliamentary seat delimitation exercise, which is expected to follow the next national census. According to current projections, southern states - including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana - stand to lose representation in Parliament due to their success in population control. In contrast, northern states with higher population growth could gain seats.



Addressing the JAC meeting, Mr Stalin said that the movement was not against delimitation itself but against an unfair implementation of it. ""We are not against delimitation; we are for fair delimitation,"" he declared. He proposed forming a legal expert committee to chart out a comprehensive legal strategy to challenge the process if needed. ""Continuous action is essential to establish our rights. Our representation must not decline,"" he said.

The committee released a seven-point resolution on delimitation. 

""Any delimitation exercise carried out by the Union Government to improve the content and character of democracy should be carried out transparently, enabling political parties of all the States, State Governments and other stakeholders to deliberate, discuss and contribute in it,"" one of the resolutions read.

""The States which have effectively implemented the population control program and consequently whose population share has come down, should not be penalised. The Union Government must enact necessary constitutional amendments for this purpose.""

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his address, likened the delimitation proposal to the ""Sword of Damocles"" hanging over the southern states. 

The ""Sword of Damocles"" is an ancient Roman moral parable about a king named Dionysius who wanted to show that power comes with constant anxiety. He let a man named Damocles sit in his place and enjoy the luxury of being king - but hung a sharp sword above his head by a single strand of horsehair.

Mr Vijayan accused the BJP of pursuing the exercise based on ""narrow political interests"".

""This sudden move is not driven by Constitutional principles or democratic imperatives,"" he said. 

The JAC meeting saw participation from leaders across states, including Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar, Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, Odisha Congress President Bhakta Charan Das, and Biju Janata Dal leader Sanjay Kumar Das Burma, among others.

Mr Shivakumar said that South India had long upheld national interests through strict adherence to population control and literacy efforts. ""We cannot let our seats be reduced. Economically and in terms of literacy, we have consistently led the way,"" he said.Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said the parties will take the issue ""up to the Delhi level"" and that the next meeting will be organised in Hyderabad. ""A closed-door meeting and a public meeting will be organised... We want to make the public aware of this issue,"" Mr Reddy said. 

West Bengal's ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) led by Mamata Banerjee, which had backed the DMK on its delimitation stance, did not attend the meeting. 

Biju Janata Dal (BJD) chief and former Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik attended the meeting virtually. 

'Delimitation based only on population figures will be unfair to thestates who have worked hard to reduce their population growth rates in line with national priorities,"" he said in a video message. 

As the JAC meeting proceeded, the BJP staged a black flag protest outside the venue, with its leaders alleging that the event was a smokescreen to cover up governance failures in opposition-ruled states.

Former Telangana Governor and senior BJP leader Tamilisai Soundararajan described the meeting as a ""corruption-hiding"" exercise. 

""The concerned Chief Ministers who are attending the meeting are doing so to hide the misgovernance in the concerned states. There are so many corruption charges in Telangana, Kerala. Their own people will be against their Chief Ministers attending this event,"" she claimed. ""Instead of calling this a delimitation meeting, it can be called corruption hiding meeting."" 

Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai echoed these sentiments, accusing Mr Stalin of ""manufacturing a political crisis"" to distract from domestic concerns. ""The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister has never gone to Kerala to speak with them and solve the issues, but today, he has invited the Kerala Chief Minister to talk about an artificial issue which he has created,"" he claimed. 

""DK Shivakumar is plotting his move against Siddaramaiah. That is the reason for him to come running to Tamil Nadu to show that he is a Pan-India leader and Siddaramaiah is a regional leader,"" he added. 

The 42nd and 84th Constitutional Amendments froze the delimitation process until 2026 to ensure that states controlling population growth were not penalised. With the deadline approaching, southern states fear a reduction in their representation.

Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urged caution, urging that no state should lose representation.

""Request for the delimitation exercise to be conducted in such a manner that no state would have to endure any reduction in its representation in the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, in terms of its share in total no. (number) of seats in the house,"" said Jagan Mohan Reddy in his letter to the PM.

Authorities responded on Friday to reports of gunfire at a park and have asked for videos from bystanders to aid in investigation

Three people were killed and 14 others were injured in a mass shooting on Friday night in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Local police said the shooting occurred at around 10pm on Friday at Young Park. Those killed included two 19-year-old men and one 16-year-old boy.

Police have not yet released the names of those killed and others who were injured but did say that the victims were between 16 and 36 years old.

No arrests have been made but police are following “multiple leads”, officials said.

In a statement on Facebook on Saturday, the Las Cruces police department issued a public request for videos from the Young Park shooting, particularly “video that shows the shooting or subjects with firearms, to submit the video so investigators can analyze it and help develop a better understanding of the incident”.

One witness, 20-year-old Angel Legaspy whose parked car was struck by bullets, told the New York Times: “They just started shooting and they just started running around everybody,” adding that the shooting was “like all over the place”.

On Saturday morning, Johana Bencomo, a Las Cruces city councilor and the mayor pro temp, wrote on Instagram: “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city but that actually feels deeply untrue. Honestly [nowadays] a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment, yet also always praying and hoping it never will.

“As with all acts of gun violence in our city and beyond, my heart is broken for the victims and families impacted. This was a heinous act of violence that will leave our city mourning,” she added.

The Guardian has reached out to city officials for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

In a memo on Friday, president also revoked clearances for Antony Blinken, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Letitia James

Donald Trump moved to revoke security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a string of other top Democrats and political enemies in a presidential memo issued late on Friday.

The security clearance revocations include former secretary of state Antony Blinken, former Wyoming representative Liz Cheney, former Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who prosecuted Trump for fraud, as well as Biden's entire family. They will no longer have access to classified information – a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.

“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump wrote. Trump said he would also “direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals”.

Earlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump's memo, along with “the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden disinformation letter” – referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.

Trump's decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike on his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”.

Earlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden's children, Hunter and Ashley, “effective immediately”, after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president's son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.

More broadly, the security clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president's political enemies, including the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.

Others on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss's alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans who served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban “includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community”.

The moves comes as NBC News reported that former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, have volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden's nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.

Nurse allegedly convinced woman she had cancer while plotting to collect more than $1m from the victim's life insurance

A registered nurse in Utah allegedly convinced a woman that she had terminal cancer, injected unprescribed insulin into her, and killed her with that method while plotting to collect more than $1m from the victim's life insurance, according to police.

Meggan Randall Sundwall faces charges of first-degree felony aggravated murder as well as obstruction of justice after her recent arrest in the death of Kacee Lynn Terry, 38, authorities said in documents that spell out the unusually grim case and were reported by various Utah news outlets.

As investigators tell it, Sundwall, 47, believed she was the beneficiary of a $1.5m life insurance policy held by Terry, who was purportedly her friend. They exchanged tens of thousands of text messages since 2019 in which Terry evidently believed she had cancer, with Sundwall sharing how she would kill herself if she were in Terry's position, court documents alleged.

Police said the pair also texted about Sundwall's having money problems and how they would be solved by receiving money from Terry's life insurance policy, which investigators portrayed as “rumored”.

Sundwall even allegedly offered to help Terry die – which she did, in August.

Investigators became suspicious of Sundwall after Terry's uncle called first responders to Terry's home for a medical emergency. Terry's uncle told police he found her unresponsive in her bedroom in the community of Highland, as Utah's Deseret News reported.

Sundwall, who was in the room and reportedly said she was the only other person there that day, claimed Terry had been unconscious and unable to breathe “for a couple of hours” – and, having a do not resuscitate order, would not want to go to the hospital.

First responders took note of a diabetic needle at the scene and took Terry – who was not diagnosed with diabetes – to a local hospital. Doctors determined that her blood sugar level was 14, or well below the life-threatening figure of 40, as KUTV noted.

Medical staff pronounced Terry dead three days later, leading to an autopsy which determined that she neither had cancer nor other health issues. Terry had died from an overdose of the allergy medication promethazine, what was probably insulin – which treats diabetes – administered to her from outside her body, and other drugs, the medical examiner in charge of the autopsy concluded.

Police said they interviewed a forensic pathologist who said administering insulin to a person was the only way to get a blood sugar level as low as the one Terry had, according to the Deseret News.

Terry had also never prepared a do not resuscitate order, and she had not ever given Sundwall power to make medical decisions on her behalf, said the court documents cited by the Utah news stations KUTV and KTVX.

Police said they later found evidence that Sundwall had pursued information about Terry's life insurance after her death while also deleting more than 900 texts from her phone in an apparent attempt to mislead investigators.

Nonetheless, police said they discovered a text from Sundwall to Terry earlier on the day she was hospitalized asking: “Do you want to take some promethazine when I get there so that you are asleep when this is happening?” They also said they had evidence establishing that Sundwall had been seeking to persuade Terry to “end her suffering” with a fatal dose of insulin, as the Deseret News reported.

Court documents reportedly do not elaborate on why Terry believed she had cancer.

Police charged Sundwall with Terry's murder on Thursday. Court records show she was ordered held without bail pending a pretrial hearing.

In Utah, first-degree felony aggravated murder could carry between 25 years and life in prison.

Prosecutors also have the option of pursuing the death penalty against anyone charged with that crime in particular. But, in Sundwall's case, prosecutors had not immediately said whether they were considering doing so.

Sundwall has had a nursing license since at least 2007, Utah state records show. Records do not list disciplinary actions against her and show she graduated with an associate's degree from Utah Valley State in 2006.

Terry's obituary says her survivors include her sister, her brother-in-law and their children. It describes Terry as someone who enjoyed the outdoors, hunting and camping. She never birthed children, but she loved babysitting, “filled the role of mom to many kids” and hoped to one day “have her own family,” the obituary said.

The obituary said Terry landed a job helping adults with disabilities after she was introduced to a company named Chrysalis. Her declining health left her “unable to work like she had in the past, but she was able to find great comfort from the companionship of her dog Bella”, according to the obituary.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

From media to culture and the arts to the refusal to abide by court orders, we're nearing ‘Defcon 1 for our democracy', experts say

Entering the magnificent great hall of the US Department of Justice, Donald Trump stopped for a moment to admire his portrait then took to a specially constructed stage where two art deco statues, depicting the “Spirit of Justice” and “Majesty of Justice”, had been carefully concealed behind a blue velvet curtain.

The president, who since last year is also a convicted criminal, proceeded to air grievances, utter a profanity and accuse the news media of doing “totally illegal” things, without offering evidence. “I just hope you can all watch for it,” he told justice department employees, “but it's totally illegal.”

Trump's breach of the justice department's traditional independence last week was neither shocking nor surprising. His speech quickly faded from the fast and furious news cycle. But future historians may regard it as a milestone on a road leading the world's oldest continuous democracy to a once unthinkable destination.

Eviscerating the federal government and subjugating Congress; defying court orders and delegitimising judges; deporting immigrants and arresting protesters without due process; chilling free speech at universities and cultural institutions; cowing news outlets with divide-and-rule. Add a rightwing media ecosystem manufacturing consent and obeyance in advance, along with a weak and divided opposition offering feeble resistance. Join all the dots, critics say, and America is sleepwalking into authoritarianism.

“These are flashing red lights here,” Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director turned Trump critic. “We are approaching Defcon 1 for our democracy and a lot of people in the media and the opposition leadership don't seem to be communicating that to the American people. That is the biggest danger of the moment we're in now: the normalisation of it.”

Much was said and written by journalists and Democrats during last year's election campaign arguing that Trump, who instigated a coup against the US government on January 6, 2021, could endanger America's 240-year experiment with democracy if he returned to power. In a TV interview he had promised to be “dictator” but only on “day one”. Sixty days in, the only question is whether the warnings went far enough.

The 45th and 47th president has wasted no time in launching a concerted effort to consolidate executive power, undermine checks and balances and challenge established legal and institutional norms. And he is making no secret of his strongman ambitions.

Trump, 78, has declared “We are the federal law” and posted a social media image of himself wearing a crown with the words “Long live the king”. He also channeled Napoleon with the words: “He who saves his country does not violate any law.” And JD Vance has stated that “judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power”.

Trump quickly pardoned those who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, placed loyalists in key positions within the FBI and military and purged the justice department, which also suffered resignations in response to the dismissal of corruption charges against New York mayor Eric Adams after his cooperation on hardline immigration measures.

The president now has the courts in his sights. Last weekend the White House defied a judge's verbal order blocking it from invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime, to justify the deportation of 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador, where they will be held in a 40,000-person megaprison.

Trump accused James Boasberg, the chief district judge in Washington who made the ruling, of being “crooked”, said he should be “impeached” and labelled him a “radical left lunatic of a judge”. The outburst prompted John Roberts, the chief justice of the supreme court, to deliver a rare rebuke of the president, emphasing that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.

In an interview on the conservative Fox News network, Trump denied defying a court order and said he would not do so in future. But he added ominously: “We have very bad judges and these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think at a certain point, you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge?”

David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W Bush, posted on the X social media platform: “Almost every major Trump action is intentionally illegal. Trump is gambling that the US democratic system is too broken to stop him. He assumes, to borrow a phrase: ‘All we've got to do is kick the door in and the whole edifice will come crumbling down.' Testing hour is here.”

The White House is yet to release the names of the deported Venezuelans or proof that they were indeed criminal gang members. In another recent incident, it sent 40 undocumented immigrants to the notorious detention facility at the Guantánamo Bay naval base, only for a judge to intervene and force their return to the mainland.

Some commentators suggest that the Trump administration is exploiting the power of sadistic spectacle. They say it is priming the public for future crackdowns and testing its level of tolerance for a moment when, for example, it might invoke the Insurrection Act to target anti-Trump protesters.

Steve Schmidt, a political strategist and former campaign operative for George W Bush and John McCain, said: “Donald Trump is producing a Washington television show from the Oval Office that's authoritarian in nature. You go on TikTok and see the deportations scored to songs and videos released by the administration. It's a theatre of the absurd. It's a theatre of malice. All of it is desensitising people to the use of authority and power.”

Violations of civil liberties are piling up on an almost daily basis. They include incidents that, if they had happened anywhere else in the world before 2025, the US would have been among the first to condemn them.

Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian entrepreneur and actor in the American Pie movie franchise, was detained for almost two weeks in “inhumane” conditions by US border authorities over an incomplete visa. She wrote in the Guardian: “I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.”

Fabian Schmidt, a German national who is a permanent US resident, was detained and, his mother said, “violently interrogated”, stripped naked and put in a cold shower by US border officials. A French scientist was denied entry to the US after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticism of the Trump administration, according to the French government.

Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island, was deported despite having a US visa. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University and citizen of India married to a Palestinian, was detained by immigration agents who told him his visa had been revoked.

Columbia University student activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident with no criminal record, was detained over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and is fighting deportation efforts in federal court. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator, reacted on social media: “In dictatorships, they call this practice ‘being disappeared'. No charges, no claims of criminal behaviour. The White House doesn't claim he did anything criminal. He's in jail because of his political speech.”

Another trigger for alarm is Trump's close relationship with tech oligarchs, many of whom donated to and attended his inauguration. Tesla and SpaceX head Elon Musk's department of government efficiency (Doge) has been taking a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy, firing thousands of workers in indiscriminate ways that have been challenged in court.

Musk's X regularly parrots pro-Trump propaganda. Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and the Washington Post, recently ordered that the newspaper narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. Several star reporters and columnists have quit in recent months.

Trump has escalated attacks on media outlets whose coverage he dislikes, including barring them from workspaces and events. He has filed lawsuits against media outlets and falsely claimed the flagship series 60 Minutes admitted guilt regarding a lawsuit.

His appointee to head the Federal Communications Commission is investigating PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) and NPR(National Public Radio). Last weekend the Trump administration put almost the entire staff of Voice of America – which began broadcasting in 1942 to combat Nazi propaganda – on leave and ended grants to Radio Free Asia and other media with similar news programming.

Trump's moves in the foreign policy arena hold up a mirror to his domestic vision. He has rattled longtime allies in Europe over whether the US remains committed to Nato and he has sided with Russia in talks to end the war in Ukraine. He even called the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a “dictator” and berated him in the Oval Office.

Trump has long shown an affinity with autocrats such as Putin, Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea and his actions have compared to Viktor Orbán's consolidation of power in Hungary, which includes remaking the judiciary, gaming elections and cracking down on media and civic organisations.

At the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington this week, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, told the Guardian: “If you haven't already read about Orban in Hungary, go read about what he did steadily, not that slowly, to put the noose around that country. Donald Trump admires Orban and I believe he and his team have learned from that and are replicating that.”

What some find most frightening of all is the relative lack of resistance so far. Trump's approval rating equals his best ever mark as president at 47%, according to a recent NBC News poll, although a majority – 51% - disapproves of his performance. Some 55% of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove.

Setmayer, who now leads the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, commented: “The fact that Donald Trump's approval rating is still in the mid-40s should scare the hell out of every American who understands the value of our constitutional republic, the freedoms that we enjoy and the rule of law because what he is doing is categorically against everything this country was founded on.”

This is reflected in Congress where the Republican party is more loyal to and unquestioning of Trump than ever. Few members have dared to speak out against the president's support for Putin, haphazard tariff policy or bullying of neighbour Canada. They know that dissent would likely result in public humiliation on social media and a primary election challenge funded by Musk.

Democrats, for their part, are still struggling to meet the moment as swelling protests across the country hunger for leadership. Last week Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, reversed his position by voting to pass a Republican budget plan that will make cuts to housing, transportation and education while also empowering Trump and Musk to slash more programmes.

Faced with the prospect of a government shutdown, Schumer argued that he was choosing the lesser of two evils but ignited a furious backlash from Democrats in the House of Representatives and grassroots activists. NBC's poll found that just 27% of voters say they have positive views of the party, its lowest rating since the question was first asked in 1990.

Meagan Hatcher-Mays, a senior adviser for United for Democracy, a coalition of 140 organisations aimed at reforming the courts, said Democrats were wrongfooted by Trump's narrow victory in the national popular vote last year.

“They took the wrong lesson from the outcome of that election and they think Donald Trump is a lot more popular than he actually is,” she said. “Their baseline is already to be scared but that made them more scared to push back or resist against some of Donald Trump's worst impulses. What you have now is they're more comfortable caving and that's what they have been doing.

“They have not been able to mount a durable opposition to Donald Trump or to congressional Republicans. You can't just be not Donald Trump. You have to be for something and you have to paint a vision for what you want for the American people. Instead what they've decided to do is just say nothing and hope for the best and that is not going to win them any seats in 2026.”

The courts are potentially the last line of defence. Federal judges have blocked dozens of Trump's initiatives, including attempts to eliminate agencies, end birthright citizenship and freeze federal funding. This week a judge found that Doge likely violated the constitution “in multiple ways” with its dismantling of development agency USAID.

Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, noted that Democrats and their allies have filed more than 125 cases against various attacks on the rule of law and obtained more than 40 temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.

“We're in the fight of our lives,” he told the Guardian. “This is not a two week, two month or even two year fight that we're in. This is going to take us many years to defeat the forces of authoritarian reaction and the Democrats are rising to the occasion.

“If you look at he way democratic societies responded to fascism a century ago, it just takes time for people to realign and refocus and mobilise a concerted and unified response. Are we there yet? No. But are we going to be in a place where we can stand together and defeat authoritarianism in our country? Yes, we are going to get there.”

Norm Eisen, a lawyer and founder of State Democracy Defenders Action, has brought successful cases that stopped Trump targeting thousands of FBI employees and blocked Musk's access to sensitive data at the treasury department. He said: “Donald Trump is definitely pushing towards authoritarianism. He promised to be a dictator on day one and he hasn't stopped. That's the bad news.

“The good news is that he has met vigorous pushback from litigants like myself and many others and from courts at every level. So far, his most outrageous illegal conduct has been countered.”

If the Trump administration ignores such orders, America could face a full-blown constitutional crisis. But Eisen retains measured optimism. “It's a mistake to count us out. We have so surprised ourselves and the world over and over again in our history and there is cause for hope here when you see the furious legal pushback by lawyers.

“There is reason for hope but nobody knows. Will we go the way of Brazil, Poland, Czech Republic, where I was ambassador, all of which pushed out autocratic regimes in recent years? Or will we go the way of Hungary and Turkey, which failed to oust autocrats? It remains to be seen but I, at least, am hopeful.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

New poll also shows that a significant share of Americans will avoid companies that drop social-inclusion policies

One in five Americans plan to turn their backs for good on companies that have shifted their policies to align with Donald Trump's agenda, according to a new poll for the Guardian.

As high-profile brands including Amazon, Target and Tesla grapple with economic boycotts, research by the Harris Poll indicated the backlash could have a lasting impact.

“Companies and consumers are playing a high-stakes game of chicken – corporations betting on convenience winning out over conviction, while consumers wield their spending power like a weapon,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer at the Harris Poll.

“The data suggests this is a miscalculation,” she said. “When 20% of Americans are permanently changing their consumption habits and nearly a third of boycotters say they'll hold out indefinitely, convenience may no longer be the decisive factor companies think it is.”

When asked about the boycotts that have been making headlines over the last few weeks, 36% of Americans said they are or will be participating.

The strength of feeling varied significantly among people of different generations, races and political views:

53% of gen Zers and 46% of millennials said they are participating in boycotts, compared with 30% of gen Xers and just 22% of Boomers.

Over half of Black (53%) and Hispanic (51%) Americans are boycotting, compared with 29% of white Americans.

Democrats (49%) are far more likely to be boycotting now than independents (32%) and conservatives (29%).

When given a list of reasons why they are boycotting, Americans said the top reason was they want to show companies that consumers have economic power and influence (53%) and express their dissatisfaction with current government policies (49%).

Nearly half of those boycotting (46%) also pointed to companies rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies as a reason behind their boycott.

It's difficult to track the tangible impacts boycotts have on companies and exactly how many people participate in them. Many start on social media, but other consumers have said they made the decision to move away from companies on their own.

Some groups have coordinated boycotts within their communities in recent weeks, particularly in response to companies like Target, Amazon and Walmart rolling back DEI measures. Target, for example, ended hiring goals for marginalized groups, while Walmart said it will no longer prioritize finding suppliers that are women- or minority-owned companies.

Some Americans feel companies are giving up core moral values in bowing to the president.

The Rev Jamal Bryant, a pastor based in Baltimore with a large social media following, called on his followers to give up spending money at Target for Lent, which started on 5 March and lasts until 17 April.

“These rollbacks represent more than just corporate decisions; they reflect a deeper erosion of the moral and ethical commitment necessary to build a just society,” Bryant wrote on the website he made for the boycott, targetfast.org. “This Lent, we will begin a corporate fast, starting with Target, as a spiritual act of resistance.”

Hispanic activists have similarly called on their community to boycott companies, calling it the Latino Freeze Movement. The movement calls for a boycott on companies that have scaled back their DEI initiatives, and asks for participants to not spend money on non-essentials “until they show us that they care about our minority and immigrant populations”.

Last month, a Harris poll found that 31% of Americans have reported similar goals to “opt out” of the economy this year in light of the changing political climate.

The companies have said that they are responding to a changing legal environment around DEI. DEI has been a flashpoint in the culture wars for years, with conservatives arguing that it unfairly discriminates against groups that have historically been in the majority, like white Americans.

On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to abolish DEI, and he signed multiple executive orders ending DEI programs within the federal government as soon as he came into office. The impact that the administration can have on efforts in the private sector is still unclear, but some companies appear willing to risk losing customers instead of taking their chances.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Healthcare journal calls for radical change in approach, urging policymakers to invest in their communities

An academic journal may inject some optimism into US health policy – a scarce commodity amid the Trump administration's mass layoffs, funding freezes and the ideological research reviews.

A new issue of Health Affairs Scholar argues the conversation around healthcare can change – and radically – if academics think “bigger” and policymakers invest in their communities.

“We saw what happened in the public outcry of the murder of the United HealthCare CEO,” said Dr Victor Roy, a family physician and director of the health and political economy project at the New School in New York City.

“There is a sense people are fed up and people are looking for bigger alternatives. People have really visceral feelings around these issues and we have a way to tackle them if people come up with ideas on the scale of the challenges people are experiencing.”

Health policy has quickly become a major touchstone of the Maga (“Make America great again”) right, as the Trump administration undertakes a shock and awe campaign that has dramatically altered public health institutions.

In just a few weeks in office, the administration has scrubbed government health websites of information on women and racial minorities, reviewed billions in scientific grant applications for conformity to the president's agenda, and confirmed the nation's foremost vaccine critic, Robert F Kennedy Jr, as the nation's top health leader at the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration has also said it will pull the US out of the World Health Organization (WHO), which it helped found in 1948.

Additionally, congressional Republicans have floated major cuts to Medicaid, a health insurance program for the low-income and disabled that insures about 72 million Americans, to extend tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy.

But even outside recent upheaval, the scale of challenges to American healthcare is something to behold: the US spends more on healthcare than almost any other country as a share of gross domestic product, yet has some of the worst outcomes among developed democracies. It is a global outlier for failing to offer universal healthcare and one of the few countries that allows its citizens to be bankrupted by medical debt.

How to fix it? Don't tinker around the edges, Roy argues. Instead, look upstream for solutions to health problems. Abandon narratives about “deserving-ness”. Examine what is working in cities and states.

In an interview, Roy cited the example of the Philadelphia Joy Bank – a small program that provides pregnant and postpartum women with a $1,000 basic income. This money comes with no questions asked, which is a world of difference from traditional “welfare”, or temporary assistance for needy families (TANF).

TANF once provided temporary cash assistance to the poor. Since Clinton-era welfare reforms, the program has been drained of resources; its scant payments have lost venue with inflation and work requirements have saddled many with insurmountable bureaucratic barriers.

In Connecticut, lawmakers established first-in-the-nation “baby bonds”, a small investing account for each low-income child born in the state. The program provides $3,200 per child that is invested in the market, and can be used to buy a house, start a business, or pay for higher education or retirement.

In Washington DC, reformers at the American Economic Liberties Project are using the lessons of recent anti-trust victories to push for a proposed “Glass-Steagall for healthcare”. The initiative, called Break Up Big Medicine, refers to the New Deal-era Glass-Steagall legislation that separated investment banks from commercial banks.

Other articles in the issue propose home care cooperatives, to provide better working conditions to home care workers as baby boomers age; reinvest in public hospitals and public production of pharmaceuticals, such as California's $100m investment in local, public insulin production; or to provide social insurance for times people can't work.

“Prevailing approaches to health policy are leaving people in America behind, including rural and low-income residents and people from historically marginalized communities,” Kathryn A Phillips, the editor-in-chief of Health Affairs Scholar, said in a statement about the issue.

“Policymakers need to know there is another way – an approach that prioritizes investment in patients, communities, and health care clinicians and workers.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Giant blobs along 5,000-mile-wide sargassum belt has killed animals, harmed human health and discouraged tourism

Scientists in Florida believe they have identified a “tipping point” in atmospheric conditions in the Atlantic Ocean they say caused giant clumps of toxic seaweed to inundate beaches around the Caribbean in recent summers.

Previous theories for the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt that has killed marine animals, harmed human health and plagued the tourism industry in several countries include a surfeit of nutrients in the water, such as nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff from intensive farming and carried into the ocean in the Congo, Amazon and Mississippi rivers.

While marine scientists at the University of South Florida (USF) acknowledge that as a contributory factor, they say the primary source of nutrients is a seasonal phenomenon known as vertical mixing in which shifting winds churn up the ocean and deepwater nutrient concentrations are brought to the surface.

They identified atmospheric pressure changes over the Atlantic beginning around 2009 as the tipping point, with variations in circulation and wind patterns pushing more sargassum into the warmer waters of the tropics, where it grew through photosynthesis into the massive blooms that eventually ended up on the beaches of the Caribbean and the US Gulf coast.

“This was a surprising result,” said Frank Muller-Karger, distinguished professor and biological oceanographer at USF's College of Marine Science. His team of international researchers used computer modeling to replicate the transport of blooms on strong currents controlled by negative North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), and how the changing atmospheric conditions helped create the giant sargassum belt.

“We had posed the hypothesis before that it is not the rivers that feed the formation of the sargassum blooms in the tropical Atlantic. This model supports the idea that nutrients from slightly deeper layers in the ocean feed the blooms.”

Muller-Karger continued, saying that “models showed that some patches of the sargassum were swept up by the wind and currents from the Sargasso Sea toward Europe, then moved southward, and from there were injected into the tropical Atlantic.

“At first, we saw just a few patches being pushed south by the NAO. But these algae patches were met with the right conditions to grow and perpetuate blooms. This population of algae, now separated from the Sargasso Sea, forms new blooms every year thanks to having enough light, nutrients and warmer temperatures,” he said.

Almost annually for more than a decade, giant clumps of goop from the 5,000-mile-wide sargassum belt have washed ashore in the Caribbean, and from Florida to Mexico, creating problems for local authorities and businesses that rely on tourism.

There are also significant health concerns. The rotting sargassum releases large quantities of hydrogen sulfide, which fills the air with an acrid odor similar to rotting eggs, and can provoke asthma and other respiratory issues.

In 2023, scientists at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) warned of a “perfect pathogen storm [with] implications for both marine life and public health”, having found high levels of the flesh-eating Vibrio bacteria lurking in the decomposing vegetation.

They said plastic debris in ocean pollution mixed with the sargassum to create a proliferation of the bacteria, creating an additional health risk for tourists, municipal crews clearing the seaweed and volunteers conducting beach clean-ups.

“These Vibrio are extremely aggressive and can seek out and stick to plastic within minutes,” Tracy Mincer, assistant professor of biology at FAU's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and Harriet L Wilkes Honors College, said.

“We really want to make the public aware of these associated risks. In particular, caution should be exercised regarding the harvest and processing of sargassum biomass until the risks are explored more thoroughly.”

The USF research, a collaboration with scientists from the University of Toulouse, Sorbonne University and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education, was published in Nature Communications.

Their report analyzed decades of wind, currents and 3D nutrient measurements from the Atlantic to model the annual blooms.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

As Trump escalates a global trade war, looking to gold to shield cash might not be the worst option

As economic uncertainty roils the US, the price of gold has roared to record highs amid investors seeking a place to shield their cash from Donald Trump's scattergun trade wars.

A single ounce of gold cost $3,051.99 on Wednesday, compared with $2,160 in 2024, and gold has historically been seen as the safest place to invest in financially turbulent times.

But the buying, and potentially hoarding, of gold need not be restricted to the Scrooge McDucks of this world. In 2025, gold can be bought from Walmart and Amazon – although experts say more established gold dealers are a better source.

Once a person has bought the gold, they can do whatever they like with it: there are whole Reddit threads devoted to the best way to bury gold underground. (Dig a deep hole, dump your vacuum-sealed gold in the hole, put a layer of rocks on top of the gold so it can't be discovered by a thief with a metal detector, then try not to forget where the gold is buried.)

Experts suggest not burying the gold, however.

“Gold is one of the few elements on the periodic table that does not decay or oxidize over time, so there's no need to worry about deterioration,” said Alex Deluce, the host of the Gold Telegraph Show, and an expert in gold investment.

“However, for safekeeping, store it in a secure location, ideally in a safety deposit box or a well-protected home safe. Keep it away from direct sunlight and heat sources to maintain its condition and security.”

Deluce said gold should be purchased “from reputable suppliers who insure all deliveries”, and financial magazines including Forbes have lists devoted to gold-selling companies.

To the uninitiated, an equally important question is: what kind of gold should people buy?

Taylor Kenney, an economic journalist who works for ITM Trading, a gold and silver dealer based in Arizona, said most gold purchases are of bullion: gold that has been refined and shaped into coins or bars.

Some of those bars are the big heavy type that is frequently stolen from banks in heist movies, but those tend to be very heavy, which means they are very expensive. Instead, many gold purchasers will be buying much smaller bars.

A handy example was seen in the recent case of Bob Menendez, the now former Democratic senator who in January was sentenced to 11 years in prison for receiving bribes.

Photos shared by the FBI showed that Menendez had an amazing a hoard of gold bullion in a variety of sizes: he had a couple of gold bars that weighed just one ounce.

According to the United States Gold Bureau – which is not a government body, but instead a cleverly named private gold-trading company – the one-ounce bars are the most commonly traded around the world. Roughly the size of a US military dog tag, one-ounce bars were listed at Walmart for $3,122.10 on Friday, although anyone who has ever ordered and never received a table lamp from Walmart might want to try elsewhere.

Menendez had also accumulated, through nefarious means, some one-kilo gold bars, each of which, at today's prices, is worth just under $100,000.

“Now is the perfect time to buy gold,” said Kenney.

She said gold prices are rising “in response to inflation, geopolitical unrest and economic uncertainty”.

Kenney added: “As dollar dominance is called into question, gold carries no counterparty risk and serves as a true store of wealth, unlike fiat currencies [such as the US dollar] that can be printed at will. The same reason central banks are buying gold is the same reason that average citizens should be buying gold as well.”

Gina Miller, the founder of Moneyshe.com, is less convinced. She told CityAM that while gold has traditionally been viewed as a safe investment, “its track record reveals significant limitations as a long-term investment”.

“For instance, while gold surged 148% from October 2008 to August 2011, it took nearly nine years, until July 2020, to reach new highs. Such prolonged stagnation makes it unappealing for investors seeking steady, long-term growth,” Miller said.

With gold at record-high prices, it is unlikely that people will be able to buy the metal and flip it for quick returns. Instead, experts say, people should see gold as a small part of an investment portfolio, rather than pumping all their money into it and putting it in a big vault.

As Trump shows no signs of backing down on his trade battles, having a few dog tags of gold stored in a safe space, or, if you're Menendez, “jammed into jackets and boots”, might not be the worst option.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Westerners increasingly hesitant to travel to US out of fear of arrests and detentions as Trump enforces crackdown

A string of high-profile arrests and detentions of travellers is likely to cause a major downturn in tourism to the US, with latest figures already showing a serious drop-off, tourist experts said.

Several western travellers have recently been rejected at the US border on increasingly flimsy grounds under Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, some of them shackled and held in detention centers in poor conditions for weeks.

Germany updated travel guidance for travelling to the US, warning that breaking entry rules could lead not just to a rejection as before, but arrest or even detention. Three German citizens have been held for prolonged periods despite apparently having committed no crime nor any obvious violation of US visa or immigration rules – including one US green card holder who was detained at Boston's Logan airport.

The UK Foreign Office, too, has bolstered its advice to warn of a risk of arrest after Becky Burke, a tourist from Wales who had been backpacking across America, was stopped at the border with Canada and held for three weeks in a detention facility. Last week members of the UK Subs, a British punk band, were denied entry and detained after they landed at Los Angeles international airport.

Even before the most recent spate of detentions, forecast visits to the country this year had been revised downward from a projected 5% rise to a 9% decrease by Tourism Economics, an industry monitoring group, which cited “polarising Trump Administration policies and rhetoric”, particularly around tariffs.

It predicted that the drop-off would lead to a $64bn shortfall in the US tourist trade.

“There's been a dramatic shift in our outlook,” said Adam Sacks, the president of Tourism Economics, told the Washington Post. “You're looking at a much weaker economic engine than what otherwise would've been, not just because of tariffs, but the rhetoric and condescending tone around it.”

The decline has been most pronounced from neighbouring Canada, which Trump has menaced with crippling tariffs and repeatedly threatened to annex outright. The number of Canadians returning by road from the US fell by 23% in February, year on year, while air traffic fell 13% on a year earlier, according to Canadian government statistics.

A Canadian actor made headlines this week when she revealed US authorities had handcuffed her and moved her out of state to a detention center, where she spent several weeks in “inhumane conditions” despite not having been accused of any crime.

Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told Fast Company that travellers now viewed entering the US as “too difficult or unpredictable”.

“Even if you get a visa, you have the risk of being detained or to be denied,” she said, adding that even as a valid US visa holder, married to an American, she was hesitating to visit the country in the current climate.

That climate was in further evidence this week as Denmark and Finland issued cautionary advice to transgender travellers, following US state department rule changes spurred by the Trump administration decree that it would recognise only two genders. The Danish foreign ministry advised travellers who use the gender designation “X” on their passport to contact the US embassy before travelling, while Finland cautioned travellers whose gender had changed that they might not gain entry.

The recent episodes are all the more striking because they involve countries long allied to the US, although students and academics from India and the Middle East have also been detained in recent days despite holding valid visas. While visitors from many regions have long had difficulty entering the US, immigration officials have traditionally taken a more lenient stance towards travellers from allied nations.

Pedro Rios, the director of the American Friends Service Committee, a non-profit group that aids migrants, told AP that it was unprecedented in the 22 years he had worked at the southern border for travellers from western Europe and Canada to be detained with such regularity.

“It's definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense,” he said. “The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Amid angst over the technology, a consensus is  emerging about its capabilities – but there is an elephant in the room

In early March, a job advert was doing the rounds among sports journalists. It was for an “AI-assisted sports reporter” at USA Today's publisher, Gannett. It was billed as a role at the “forefront of a new era in journalism”, but came with a caveat: “This is not a beat-reporting position and does not require travel or face-to-face interviews.” The dark humour was summed up by football commentator, Gary Taphouse: “It was fun while it lasted.”

As the relentless march of artificial intelligence continues, newsrooms are wrestling with the threats and opportunities the technology creates. Just in the past few weeks, one media outlet's AI project was accused of softening the image of the Ku Klux Klan. AI is also playing a part in some British journalists recording more than 100 bylines in a day. Amid the angst over the technology, however, a broad consensus is beginning to emerge about what the technology is currently capable of doing accurately.

Yet media companies are already aware of an elephant in the room. Their calculations could be upended should users simply turn to AI assistants to get their content fix. “I think good quality information can rise in an age of AI,” said one UK media executive. “But we need to set the terms in the right way in the next couple of years, or we are all screwed.”

The speed at which the technology has arrived has brought some early case studies in journalistic misadventure. In early March, the LA Times launched an AI tool giving alternative perspectives on opinion pieces. It caused alarm by saying some local historians regarded the Ku Klux Klan as a “‘white Protestant culture' responding to societal changes rather than an explicitly hate-driven movement, minimising its ideological threat”. The pitfall, said one media executive looking at AI, was obvious: “It was given a task of making judgments it can't possibly be expected to make.”

The fact that even a tech giant like Apple had to suspend a feature that made inaccurate summaries of BBC News headlines shows just how hard it can be to ensure the accuracy of generative AI.

In reality, teams of journalists and tech tool designers have been working for years to find the best AI uses. In terms of public content, publishers are clustering around using it to suggest small chunks of text, based on original journalism. In practice, that means headline suggestions and story summaries, easily checked by human editors. The Independent became the latest to announce this week that it would be publishing condensed AI versions of its own stories. Many publishers are trialling or have already deployed similar tools.

Some big organisations have also been experimenting with their own AI chatbots, allowing readers to ask questions using content from their own archives. The problem is that editors cannot possibly know the answers being spat out. Attached to the Washington Post's chatbot feature is the note: “This is an experiment … Because AI can make mistakes, please verify the response by consulting these articles.”

The amount of AI-assisted text that can be safely overseen by human editors is a live issue. Reach, publisher of the Daily Mirror and a series of other local sites, has been using its Guten tool to repackage its own journalism for different audiences. It has contributed to some eye-wateringly high byline counts for some journalists. On one day in January, one regional Reach reporter recorded 150 bylines or joint bylines across the group's titles. While he did not use Guten himself, the technology was used to repurpose his work for other sites.

Some Reach journalists have privately expressed concern. A Reach spokesperson said Guten was only a tool and “needs to be used thoughtfully” by journalists. “We're encouraged by the progress we've made in reducing errors and supporting our everyday work,” they said. “This has enabled us to free-up journalists to spend more time on journalism which would otherwise go unreported.”

USA Today Network made the same point about its AI-assisted sports reporter post. “By leveraging AI, we are able to expand coverage and enable our journalists to focus on more in-depth sports reporting,” said a spokesperson.

Others doubt whether the time saved will go into original journalism. The former Independent editor Chris Blackhurst said recently he was “very cynical” about the idea, fearing it was more likely to be “freeing people up to work elsewhere”.

While publicly visible AI-assisted journalism has created the most debate, it is actually inside newsrooms that the technology is providing gains, interrogating huge datasets. The FT, the New York Times and the Guardian are among the groups exploring the technique. It has already helped find severe cases of neglect from more than 1,000 pages of hospital documents in Norway. Transcription and translation are other more everyday uses.

Others are using it for “social listening”. The News Movement, which aims content at a younger audience, has built a tool that monitors what its audience are talking about on social media and feeds it back to journalists. “It helps us understand what conversations and topics people are currently having,” said Dion Bailey, its chief product and technology officer. Despite the angst about AI errors, some companies, such as Der Spiegel, are actually trying to use AI to factcheck content.

What is coming next? According to academic research, it is “audience-facing format transformations”. In other words, taking a story and turning it into the kind of content that a user wants – be it condensed, audio or even video. About a third of media leaders surveyed by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism said they wanted to experiment with turning text stories into video. Tools can already turn long footage into short, shareable content.

Yet hanging over all this newsroom innovation is the fear that it could all be for nought if personal AI chatbots take the place of media companies in producing content. “What keeps me up at night is AI simply inserting itself between us and the user,” said one media figure. Google's launch this month of a new “AI Mode”, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot, has spooked the industry. Some believe government intervention is the only solution.

Some bigger media groups have been signing licensing deals with the owners of the main AI model owners, allowing the models to be trained on their original material with attribution. The Guardian has such a deal with OpenAI, owner of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, the New York Times is leading a lawsuit against OpenAI for using its work.

Bailey shares the concerns, but retains hope that the media world can adapt. “If the power goes to two or three big tech companies, then we have some real, significant issues,” he said. “We need to adapt in terms of how people are able to get to us. That's just a fact.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Strikes come as freed hostages and family members of people still held in Gaza urge Netanyahu to stop the fighting

Israeli artillery and airstrikes hit southern Lebanon on Saturday, in a fresh clash endangering the shaky truce that ended a year-long conflict against Hezbollah, as 40 survivors of Hamas captivity called on the Israeli government to halt the “endless war”.'

Three rockets fired from Lebanon towards Israel were intercepted by the Israeli air force, according to a spokesperson for the Israeli army, the first time in more than three months that groups in Lebanon have fired at Israel.

In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Hezbollah denied any involvement for the rocket attacks and stressed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement. It added that Israeli claims that it was behind the strikes were “merely a pretext for continued attacks on Lebanon”.

A variety of Palestinian factions, as well as other armed groups operate in southern Lebanon and not all are under Hezbollah's command.

The Israeli air force carried out dozens of airstrikes in south Lebanon, causing injuries in the border village of Kafr Kila, according to the Lebanese health ministry.

The exchange of fire was the most intense since the adoption of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah on 27 November, which ended more than 13 months of fighting between the two that had left more than 3,900 people dead and 1 million displaced in Lebanon.

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, warned of a severe response to the rocket fire, which was shot at the Israeli border village of Metula.
 “Metula and Beirut will be treated the same. The Lebanese government is fully responsible for any fire originating from its territory,” Katz said.

It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the rocket fire from Lebanon, and a spokesperson from Hezbollah declined a request for comment.
 The Lebanese army said it found and dismantled what it called three “primitive rocket launchers” in south Lebanon after the rocket fire towards Israel. Pictures released by the army showed fragments of bombs and three wooden posts dug into the earth, seemingly used in the launching of the rockets.

The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has stopped full-scale military hostilities between the two warring parties, though Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Lebanon despite the truce. Israel has maintained that it reserves the right to unilaterally enforce any violations of the ceasefire in Lebanon and has continued to strike what it says are Hezbollah targets across the country.

Hezbollah launched rockets near an Israeli military post in the week after the establishment of the ceasefire, but otherwise has not attacked Israel since. The group has been severely weakened after its war with Israel, with most of its senior leadership dead, thousands of its fighters killed and its weapons stock depleted.

The Lebanese prime minister, Nawaf Salam, warned on Saturday that renewed military operations in south Lebanon could risk dragging the country back into war and urged the ministry of defence to ensure that the Lebanese state, rather than Hezbollah, decides whether Lebanon goes to war.

Unifil, the UN peacekeeping force which monitors the Israel-Lebanon border, warned against further military escalation that could lead to the ceasefire to be broken.

“The situation remains extremely fragile and we encourage both sides to uphold their commitments,” it said in a statement on Saturday.

In Israel, thousands of protesters continue to take to the streets, blocking key highways across the country in opposition to Netanyahu's government.

The immediate trigger for the anger was the government's attempt to dismiss Ronen Bar, the head of the internal security agency, a move described as an attempt to undermine Israel's democratic system, but the prime minister's decision to shatter a two-month-old truce in Gaza with waves of lethal airstrikes has also fuelled the demonstrations.

Forty freed hostages of Hamas captivity and 250 family members of Israeli soldiers and civilians still held in Gaza signed a letter on Friday calling on Netanyahu to halt Israel's renewed military activities and return to the negotiating table in order to secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages who are still in the territory. In a letter sent to the prime minister, they warned that failure to do so would condemn the living hostages to death.

“This letter was written in blood and tears,” the text reads. ‘‘It was drafted by our friends and families whose loved ones were killed and murdered in captivity and who are crying out: ‘Stop the fighting. Return to the negotiating table and fully complete an agreement that will return all of the hostages, even at the cost of ending the war'.”

The signatories attacked the government for “choosing an endless war over saving and returning the hostages, and by doing that sacrificing them. This is a criminal policy – you do not have a mandate to sacrifice 59 people.''

The letter comes as Israel's defence minister on Friday said he had instructed the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and threatened to annex part of the territory unless Hamas released Israeli hostages still held in the devastated territory.

Israeli officials have escalated their threats in recent days, calling on Palestinians in Gaza to overthrow Hamas or face the consequences.

“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said in a statement. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”

Gaza's civil defence agency said more than 500 people had been killed since the bombardment resumed, one of the highest tolls since the war began more than 17 months ago with Hamas's attack on Israel.

A three-phase ceasefire was agreed in January but Israel refused to begin talks on the implementation of a second phase, which was supposed to lead to a return of all hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent end to hostilities.

Instead, Israel proposed a new plan, reportedly put forward by the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, involving a 30- to 60-day truce and the release of all remaining hostages. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners – a key component of the first phase.

The intense fighting comes as Netanyahu is locked in a fierce battle with Israel's judicial system after the supreme court blocked his attempt to fire the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency, who has been investigating Netanyahu's close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.

Amid protests against ministers' vote to sack Bar, the top court on Friday froze the decision, with the order remaining in place until the court can hear petitions filed by the opposition and an NGO against the dismissal.

Netanyahu said in a post on X that “the government of Israel will decide” who headed the domestic security agency, writing: “The State of Israel is a state of law, and according to the law, the government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

About 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, died in the surprise attack by Hamas in October 2023. The ensuing Israeli offensive into Gaza has killed more than 49,000 people, mostly civilians.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Offices investigated rights violations and oversaw citizenship, immigration and detention services

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday gutted three oversight offices by placing more than 100 workers on paid leave, a Trump administration official and two former officials said.

The workers, including those in the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, were given layoff notices as part of a large-scale government reduction by the Trump administration, one of the affected staffers said, requesting anonymity to discuss the matter.

“These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS's mission,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.“

McLaughlin said the offices would be subject to a “reduction in force”, the government term for layoffs.

Trump launched a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office on 20 January, pulling resources from across the federal government to focus on enforcement. Advocates have raised concerns that the more aggressive efforts could infringe on the rights of immigrants and US citizens alike.

White House officials are reviewing federal agencies' downsizing plans, a move expected to result in the mass firing of thousands of government workers within the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Friday.

Trump had given the agencies until 13 March to draw up plans for a second wave of mass layoffs as part of his rapid-fire effort to reshape and reduce the size of the federal government, which he has called bloated and inefficient.

The DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigates potential rights violations within the department and fields complaints from the public.

The other two offices targeted were the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which served similar oversight functions.

Thousands of workers fired in Trump's effort to slash the government workforce have sued to have their jobs reinstated by federal judges.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Booksellers take stand against influence of conservative billionaire by limiting orders of his company's books and placing them on lower shelves

A conservative Catholic billionaire and media owner is facing an independent bookshop rebellion in France over his influence in the publishing world.

Dozens of independent booksellers are trying to counter the growing influence of Vincent Bolloré, whose vast cultural empire includes television, radio, the Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche, and also, since 2023, the biggest book publishing and distribution conglomerate in France, Hachette Livre.

“Books matter,” said Thibaut Willems, owner of Le Pied à Terre independent bookshop in Paris's 18th arrondissement and one of the booksellers taking a stand by limiting their orders of Hachette Livre books and placing them on lower shelves.

Bolloré is best known in France for his group's ownership of CNews, the most-watched news channel on TV, which figures on the left have attacked for giving a platform to reactionary voices they say have aided the rise of the far right. He was once described by the former education minister Pap Ndiaye as “very close to the most radical far right”. Bolloré, in a senate hearing in 2022, denied political or ideological interventionism, saying his interest in acquiring media was purely financial and his cultural empire was about promoting French soft power. He said his group was so vast, it contained all views.

But some independent booksellers say it is dangerous for democracy for one conglomerate to have such a huge influence on cultural output. Hachette Livre, which was part of the Lagardère group bought by Bolloré's Vivendi in 2023, is the No 1 publisher and book distributor in France. It owns scores of publishing houses, producing the bestselling Asterix comic books, literary fiction, thrillers, political titles, Manga comics and school textbooks. The group also owns the Relay bookstores at French train stations. Hachette has more than 200 publishing imprints worldwide. It is the second biggest publishing conglomerate in the UK, where it owns Hodder & Stoughton, and is the third biggest in the US.

As well as the moves by some booksellers, protest groups on the left have started a “bookmark rebellion”, where individuals hide bookmarks inside paperbacks in large commercial stores with messages such as “boycott Hachette”, detailing the scale of the Bolloré empire.

These bookmarks have regularly been placed inside the memoirs of the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, published in France by a Hachette imprint, and of Jordan Bardella, the young president of Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, whose Ce que je cherche (What I'm Looking For) has sold more than 150,000 copies, with the might of Bolloré's publicity machine behind it.

Willems acknowledged it was hard to rebel against a group that controlled such a large part of distribution. “We'd like to be able to stage a boycott,” he said. But this was impossible because of Hachette imprints' vast back- catalogue, which includes key authors such as the punk feminist Virginie Despentes and writers including Lola Lafon. “A boycott would be damaging for customers who want to read those writers. So we do what we can,” he said.

This meant not ordering certain new books, or taking fewer copies and placing them away from prime positions on tables. Willems will also limit events for Hachette books, with one recent exception for a local novelist friend of the bookshop.

Willems said customers had been interested to learn about Bolloré's presence in publishing. “But it's hard for people these days. They're wary of what food to buy, what clothes to buy and now it's what books they buy. It becomes exhausting.”

In Lyon, Martin Beddeleem, from the independent bookshop La Virevolte, said: “In the book world, we've been worried for some time about the concentration of ownership that runs from book editing to publishing and distribution.” In the current polarised political landscape in France, he felt that books could become “a weapon”.

Beddeleem said that stopping buying books from a giant such as Hachette was impossible and would “kill our bookshop”, so instead small steps included not ordering Hachette's children's comic strip albums or social science books and choosing other publishers. “A tiny bookshop like ours doing this won't cause much pain [to Hachette], but at least it feels significant for us,” he said. The bookshop will host a public debate on the issue in June.

Benoît Grange, from the climate protest collective Les Soulèvements de la Terre, part of the bookmark protest, said: “This is about informing readers. Around 700,000 bookmarks have been printed. People keep asking us for more so they can slide them into books in shops. It's ongoing.”

The French Nobel-winning novelist Annie Ernaux said at the time of the Hachette takeover that she would refuse to be published by the group.

This week, the representative body for staff at Hachette Livre, expressed concerns over what it called an editorial line close to the far right in Bolloré's other print and TV media.

Jean-Yves Mollier, a historian of French publishing and professor at the University of Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, said Bolloré's expansion had added “an enormous publishing conglomerate” to a media empire. Mollier likened this to the expansion of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch into book publishing in the US. “I think for freedom of expression, pluralism and democracy it can represent a risk,” he said.

Hachette Livre was approached for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

South-eastern Ukrainian city struck more than 10 times, while three people die in attacks on Sumy and Donetsk; Germany approves €3bn in new military aid for Ukraine. What we know on day 1,123

Russian attacks killed two people in Ukraine's south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia late on Friday. The Zaporizhzhia regional governor, Ivan Fedorov, said on Telegram the city had been struck more than 10 times, killing two people and injuring nine. The injured included a nine-month-old infant and a woman in serious condition. Pictures posted online showed rescue teams sifting through rubble and apartment blocks and homes with windows and facades badly damaged. Fires burned amid piles of rubble.

Two people were reported killed in the Sumy region, on Ukraine's northern border with Russia, after Russian forces dropped at least six guided bombs on the village of Krasnopillia, while in the eastern Donetsk region, Russia dropped three bombs on the town of Kostiantynivka, close to the frontlines, killing one person.

Germany on Friday approved €3bn (£2.5bn) in new military aid for Ukraine, including artillery munitions and air defence systems, government officials have said. The funds were released after months of delay and come on top of €4bn in Ukraine military aid already planned in the budget for 2025. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said the latest package would include units of the German-made Iris-T air defence systems that had yet to be built and would be delivered over the next two years.

The UK is to “accelerate the pace and scale” of its military planning to be ready to support Ukraine, with No 10 saying all options, including troops on the ground, are possible. Keir Starmer's spokesperson said thousands of troops would be needed to support Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire and agreement to end the war with Russia, whether by “sea, on land or in the air”. “Not all the countries in the coalition will have capabilities for Ukraine but might have the capability for other deployments, which would free up other nations to deploy to Ukraine,” the prime minister's spokesperson said.

The UK said on Friday it had frozen more than £25bn in Russian assets since the start of the war in Ukraine three years ago. In a report, the UK treasury also said it had sanctioned “2,001 individuals and entities” in the period between Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and March 2024. The economic secretary to the treasury, Emma Reynolds, said: “Working with our allies, we have deprived [Russia] of over $400bn the equivalent to four years of Russia's military spending.”

A Soviet-era dissident has been sentenced to 16 years in prison in Russia for his anti-war views. Alexander Skobov, 67, was sentenced on Friday over a social media post supporting Ukraine's 2022 strike on the Crimea Bridge, as well as his alleged involvement with the foreign-based opposition group the Free Russia Forum. In a final statement before sentencing, Skobov accused the Putin regime of “waging an aggressive war [and] of committing war crimes in Ukraine”.

Ukraine accused Russia on Friday of illegally pressuring Ukrainians in occupied territory to change their legal status or leave, and said it would report the practice to the international criminal court. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, issued a decree on Thursday saying Ukrainian citizens living “in Russia without legal grounds” should “regulate” their status by 10 September. Heorhii Tykhyi, a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman, said Russia was conducting the “forced displacement of Ukrainian citizens from their homeland, or forcing them to acquire foreigner status”. Putin's decree affects Ukrainians who live in the Crimean peninsula, as well as occupied parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, expressed his unwavering support for Russia's war in Ukraine during a meeting with Russia's security council secretary, Sergei Shoigu, in Pyongyang on Friday. North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Kim during the meeting said his government would “invariably support Russia in the struggle for defending the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests”. Shoigu expressed gratitude for North Korea's “solidarity with Russia's position on all critical geopolitical issues, particularly on the Ukrainian issue,” according to his televised comments.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The moves that barred the media mogul's choice of lawyer are immune from legal challenge, giving the national security committee what one expert called ‘the powers of a police state'

The dwindling freedom in Hong Kong over the past few years has been described as “death by a thousand cuts”. Critics have been jailed, elections have been transformed into “patriots only” affairs, journalists have been harassed and hundreds of thousands of people have left.

This week, an obscure legal development has, in the eyes of some legal experts, inflicted another cut on the city's once revered legal system.

On 17 March, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal (CFA), the city's top bench, rejected an application from Jimmy Lai. The 77-year-old pro-democracy activist is now on trial for alleged national security offences – charges which could see the former media mogul spend the rest of his life in jail. Although the trial is well under way, Lai's legal team have been trying to appeal against the decision to bar his preferred lawyer, Tim Owen KC, from representing him.

The details of the saga date back to 2022, when Owen was first approved to represent Lai. The Hong Kong government objected to Owen's admission, but lost multiple appeals to have him blocked. So John Lee, the chief executive, turned to Beijing. In December 2022, the Chinese government issued an interpretation of the national security law, which had been imposed on the city in June 2020 to quell months of pro-democracy protests. The interpretation stated that the courts needed approval from the chief executive to admit foreign lawyers in national security cases.

Although Owen had been admitted to represent Lai before the interpretation was issued, Hong Kong's national security committee nonetheless instructed the immigration department to deny him a work permit.

“It's pretty well unheard of for somebody who is entitled to represent a client not to receive a work permit,” says Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court judge who quit the CFA last year, warning that the rule of law was “profoundly compromised” in Hong Kong. “I think it tells us quite a lot about the view of the rule of law taken by the executive”. Sumption said that blocking Owen via a visa refusal was “a subterfuge” on the part of the government.

But the issue at the heart of Lai's appeal was not the visa – but the fact decisions made by the national security committee cannot be legally challenged, a principle that has caused alarm in some legal circles.

Paul Harris SC, a former chairperson of the Hong Kong Bar Association, who fled the city in 2022 after being warned by the national security police that they were considering charging him with sedition, said that the principle “effectively gives the committee the powers of a police state”.

While the CFA did not give a reason for rejecting Lai's appeal this week, it did so using a rule that is normally reserved for applications with “no reasonable grounds” or that are “frivolous”.

“This is another, among many, blows to the rule of law,” said Michael C Davis, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong. “The CFA surely missed an opportunity to reign in what has become excessive resort to national security claims and to better articulate the boundaries, if any, of the committee's immunity from review.”

Samuel Townend KC, chairperson of the Bar Council of England and Wales until this year, said that the CFA's refusal to hear the appeal amounted to the court “washing their hands of any judicial oversight” of the national security committee.

Simon NM Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, warned against reading too much into the CFA's decision. He pointed to an earlier ruling which stated that the national security law was clear in its intent to immunise certain decisions from legal challenge. He said that by refusing to grant leave to appeal, the CFA judges may just have decided that Lai's specific claim was simply without merit. “The question of judicial reviewability of a NSC [national security committee] decision on jurisdictional grounds remains open,” Young said.

But for Lai, it is the end of the road on this legal challenge. He will not be able to instruct his chosen lawyer in any future proceedings. With his national security trial expected to run until the autumn, and further appeals expected if he is convicted, there may be many more to come.

Conservationists find critically endangered species thriving on Indian Ocean island of Aride

Record numbers of Wright's gardenia, one of the world's rarest and most fragrant trees, have been counted on the tiny tropical island of Aride in Seychelles.

The only place in the world where the critically endangered tree occurs naturally is on the 72-hectare granite island in the Indian Ocean. The tree was once found on other, larger islands in the Seychelles archipelago but its sturdy wood was harvested for firewood, leading to its disappearance from everywhere except Aride.

A team of eight staff and volunteers for the Island Conservation Society of Seychelles, which manages Aride for biodiversity, spent 272 hours scouring the challenging terrain of the island to identify and count the rare trees.

They found 2,913 trees, nearly 1,000 more than in the previous census in 2017. Some trees had more than 1,000 seedlings nearby, indicating that the species is now thriving on the island.

Conservation ranger Steve Esther, a Seychellois who is stationed on the island, said: “It's an evergreen tree which was originally on most of the granitic islands of the Seychelles but then it disappeared from the main islands. On Aride it thrived but it is a critically endangered species – at extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.”

The conservationists on Aride are not certain why the tree is doing so well again but according to the conservation manager Emma Cotton, one reason is that invasive fern species have been removed, increasing the area of ground on which it can grow.

“It's really nice to see the tree's rising population after the effort we put in to count all the trees,” she added.

According to Esther, the Wright's gardenias are also benefiting from a wetter climate in recent seasons on Aride, which was named by the French for being drier than the other islands.

“We often sit on the beach and see that it's raining on all the other islands but not here,” he said. “But it's been raining a lot more in the past few years than before.”

The tree's orchid-like white flowers decorated with small dots of purple and magenta bloom after the rains and spread their fragrance across the island – and the ocean.

Rob Lucking, the chair of the Island Conservation Society UK charity, said: “It's a lovely little tree. It flowers 10 days after heavy rainfall and it is very, very fragrant. You can be coming back to Aride on the boat and you can smell it half-a-mile out at sea, it's incredible.”

The rangers on Aride regularly monitor a sample of the trees to check for signs of disease, attack by insect or invasive pathogens.

Trees have been grown on other islands in the Seychelles archipelago to provide backup if the trees on Aride ever suffered from a catastrophe but the tree does not seem to thrive in the wild on other islands.

There are hopes that it will continue to spread and prosper on Aride even more now that Aldabra giant tortoises have been translocated to the island. Ten were brought back nearly a decade ago as part of an conservation programme to re-establish these herbivorous ecosystem engineers on the island. They've recently been joined by 50 smaller young individuals of a long-lived species.

The tortoises play a key role in dispersing seeds, including those of the Wright's gardenia, and as they forage bird species follow in their path to catch insects and invertebrates that they expose. The tortoises also excavate small wallows on the arid island, improving water retention and opening up water sources to birds, invertebrates and lizards.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The attack comes amid ratcheting tension over whether the partial ceasefire is being honored and as negotiators prepare to return to Saudi Arabia on Monday.

KYIV — A Russian drone strike in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region killed three — a 41-year-old man, his 38-year-old wife and their 17-year-old daughter — on Friday, ratcheting tension over whether a limited ceasefire is being honored.

The Friday night attack also injured 12 people, including a baby, Ukrainian authorities said, and damaged multiple structures, among them six apartment buildings, a catering facility, a house and a school. The city “is experiencing another tragedy,” said Zaporizhzhia city council secretary Regina Kharchenko.

The attack comes as negotiators prepare to return to Saudi Arabia on Monday for continued talks. In recent days, both sides have accused the other of undermining the current agreement.

On Friday, a few hours after Russian drones attacked the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, striking a shopping mall and an apartment building, Moscow blamed Kyiv for blowing up a gas metering station in Sudzha, a town in western Russia seized last year by Ukraine and recently retaken by Russia. On Wednesday, the day President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talked on the phone, the Kremlin said Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot in its Kuban region, setting it ablaze for days.

“It is obvious that by such antics Kyiv is once again demonstrating its complete lack of commitment, as well as its lack of desire to achieve peace,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Saturday, following the attack on Zaporizhzhia.

Speaking with reporters in Kyiv on Friday during a visit from the president of the Czech Republic, Zelensky emphasized the need to protect civilian infrastructure, saying that his office was preparing a list of sites, including ports and railways, that were a priority. He denigrated Russian President Vladimir Putin for not accepting the complete ceasefire proposed by the United States — even as Zakharova said that Ukraine's “provocations” are “being used to disrupt the negotiation process.”

“People have suffered,” Zelensky said. “In fact, every day in Ukraine is marked by such Russian attacks. … There is no silence only because Putin does not accept this proposal.”

Speaking with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday, Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said that he thought they were getting close to that outcome.

“The ultimate goal is a 30-day ceasefire, during which time we discuss a permanent ceasefire,” he said. “We're not far away from that. … I am very, very optimistic that we're going to be able to bring the two sides together.”

Scattered in the rubble at the scene of Friday's shelling in Zaporizhzhia were family pictures of the victims — a snapshot of a woman with a thin smile of red lipstick, a blonde girl sitting against a blue wall.

The couple's older daughter is the family's only survivor.

On Instagram on Saturday, she posted photos of the family she'd lost: her 17-year-old sister, holding a bouquet of pink and white flowers, celebrating her birthday last week; her parents taking a selfie, faces pressed against each other; the girls with their mom, flashing peace signs with manicured nails, alongside the caption, “Soft clouds to you. I love you.”

“Just one perfect moment to lose your loved ones,” she said in the post. “Just like a terrible dream.”

Now, she said, she was fundraising for their funerals.

Oops, something went wrong

BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink orchestrated the Panama Canal port takeover that made President Trump happy, but the cost may be an angry Xi Jinping.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the Chinese leader is not happy with a $22.8 billion deal giving a BlackRock-led investment coalition control of two key ports on either end of the vital shipping lane currently owned by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison.

CK Hutchison, which is controlled by the family of 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, didn't seek preapproval from Chinese government leadership, according to the Wall Street Journal.

What's more, Chinese leaders hoped to use the ports as a bargaining chip with the Trump administration as part of larger talks between the two countries, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Other signs of displeasure emerged in articles and commentary published in pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao, arguing that Chinese ships would now face restrictions in the canal and accusing CK Hutchison of ""prioritizing profit over everything, disregarding national interests and national righteousness.""

The deal deserves ""serious attention,"" Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, added earlier this week, without directly criticizing CK Hutchison.

The rumblings from Beijing add a new layer of complications to what appeared to be a big win for BlackRock's Fink, who himself reached out to the White House after Trump alleged Chinese interference in the canal and said he wanted to ""take it back.""

Fink argued to the White House that there would be no need to forcibly take the ports if BlackRock were to arrange a purchase on its own.

Trump referenced the deal during his address to Congress earlier this month while still reiterating that ""my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal"" and ""taking it back.""

It's not immediately clear what steps Hong Kong or Beijing could take to block the transaction, which isn't yet final and still requires consent from various regulators. The companies hope to sign a definitive agreement by April 2.

Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese authorities are examining the deal closely. Bloomberg said the review includes any signs of security breaches or antitrust violations, while the Wall Street Journal said officials have been told to see what Beijing can do to hinder the deal.

BlackRock's stock price would likely ""see a little hit"" if the pact falls through, according to CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert, but the bigger threat would be to the credibility of BlackRock's newly bolstered infrastructure group.

Last year, BlackRock paid $12 billion to buy private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners — a major investor in energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects — and GIP was part of the consortium that agreed to buy the ports at either end of the Panama Canal.

""There may be some pressure for this group to spin out or announce another deal to sort of regain some marketplace credibility,"" Seifert added.

The deal negotiated by BlackRock and GIP involves much more than just the Panama ports — it includes a total of 43 ports in 23 countries.

Fink, speaking at a Houston energy conference earlier this month, said there were some misconceptions about the deal as reported in the press. One was that BlackRock itself was buying the entire canal.

""My kids called me and said, 'BlackRock bought the Panama Canal? Can we go on it?' And I said, 'We did not buy the Panama Canal.'""

He also said the ""far left"" and ""far right"" didn't mention that there were many other ports in the deal, including six along the Suez Canal. ""They mentioned we bought two"" — the ones along the Panama Canal.

Those two ports, he said, represent 4% of the total value of the transaction.

He noted that ports do offer a great business for BlackRock, which will now have 100 in its portfolio if this deal goes through. They can produce returns of 15% to 16%, he said.

""Even with tariffs and other things, it means the ports will be quite active,"" he said.

This is not the first time CK Hutchison or Li Ka-shing, nicknamed ""Superman"" for his business prowess in Hong Kong, have faced criticism from Beijing.

When Li served at the conglomerate's helm in 2015, CK Hutchison faced backlash for diversifying its business to European assets. That's where the bulk of its revenue now currently comes from, according to Nikkei.

In an earnings statement on Thursday, CK Hutchison did not mention the ports deal but said that ""geopolitical and trade tensions have ... risen significantly.""

Victor Li, chair of CK Hutchison and son of Li Ka-shing, said in a statement Thursday accompanying the earnings release that the environment for CK Hutchison's businesses could be ""both volatile and unpredictable"" this year.

Oops, something went wrong

Chinese tech giant ByteDance has roughly two weeks to save its video app TikTok from a renewed US ban — and there are signs cloud computing giant Oracle (ORCL) could play a prominent role.

ByteDance faces a federal mandate to divest the popular social media app but won a reprieve from President Trump, who, on his first day in office, asked his attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days. If ByteDance can't find a buyer for TikTok's US operations, the ban passed by Congress will kick in April 5.

Vice President JD Vance told reporters this past week that a high-level agreement satisfying US national security concerns by early April was ""almost"" certain.

President Trump said last weekend that four bidders had emerged, but he didn't identify them. Names previously floated by Trump and others have included Microsoft (MSFT), AI startup Perplexity, a coalition of billionaire investors, and even the US government.

One prominent corporate name, however, keeps surfacing: Oracle.

The tech giant co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison already acts as TikTok's primary cloud provider and had attempted a prior purchase of TikTok that eventually fizzled during Trump's first term in 2020.

The app started routing its US traffic through Oracle's cloud in 2022 in an overhaul known as ""Project Texas"" that aimed to satisfy US regulatory demands to store Americans' data domestically.

Now Oracle is a leading contender to help rescue TikTok from its current predicament, the Information reported this past week. ByteDance's leaders reportedly want to retain a hands-on role with TikTok's operations in any such deal.

Bloomberg separately reported that an Oracle deal being mulled by the White House would task the tech giant with safeguarding Americans' data on TikTok in exchange for a stake in the company, while leaving app's algorithm in the hands of ByteDance.

TikTok and its CEO Shou Zi Chew have repeatedly objected to letting go of the app's proprietary algorithm. Neither TikTok nor Oracle responded to a request for comment.

On Friday, Reuters offered up yet another scenario involving Oracle. 

The news agency said the biggest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance may increase their existing stakes and acquire the US operations of TikTok as part of a new entity, while Oracle protects the US user data to ensure it is not available to China.

These investors include Jeff Yass' Susquehanna International Group and Bill Ford's General Atlantic. In such a scenario, Chinese ownership in the new business would drop below a critical 20% threshold needed to avoid the US ban.

""Every day there is another TikTok rumor,"" Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary, who is part of a consortium pursuing its own bid for the app's US operations, told Yahoo Finance this past week.

But ""it doesn't matter what I want or what Larry wants,"" O'Leary said, referring to Oracle's Ellison. ""What matters now is the narrative now between Xi and Trump,"" referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

""The question is, 'Does Xi want to sell TikTok, yes or no?'""

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, operates under Chinese Communist Party law, which requires it to share user data upon request.

US intelligence officials have expressed concern that the CCP could use Americans' data against them and use TikTok's algorithm to gain backdoor access to swaths of information on US citizens.

To address those concerns, former President Biden signed legislation last April requiring TikTok to divest or face a nationwide ban. The US Supreme Court upheld the law against a constitutional challenge from TikTok and TikTok users.

In effect, the statute outlawed app stores — like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) — and cloud services from offering the app for downloads unless it is controlled by a country that the US does not consider adversarial.

The law resulted in TikTok's short-lived shutdown on Jan. 20, Trump's first day back in office. That same day, Trump delayed enforcement of the divestment via executive order.

The order, which experts have said is legally dubious, opened a 75-day window for the Trump administration ""to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way"" for TikTok's US business.

Trump has said he is open to an extension of the 75-day pause if a deal isn't reached by the deadline. Trump is not empowered to repeal the law; new legislation to overturn the measure would need to be approved by a majority of federal lawmakers.

Vance told reporters this past week that ""we'd like to get it done without the extension.""

“I think the question is, what is the equity ownership of the new joint venture? Vance added. ""How do you do the contracts for all the investors, the customers, the service providers? … The deal itself will be very clear, but actually creating those thousands and thousands of pages of legal documents, that's the one thing that I worry could slip.”

Trump has sent encouraging signals about Ellison playing a role in the TikTok situation.

""I'd like Larry to buy it too,"" the president said on Jan. 21, with Ellison standing next to him at a press conference held to announce a new $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure commitment.

""Larry, let's negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said as SoftBank CEO Masa Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also looked on.

""What I'm thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we'll give you the permit. And they'll have a great partner, the United States.""

""Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President,"" Ellison said.

But Trump has also denied talks with Oracle when asked about the subject in late January after NPR reported that the company could be part of a TikTok deal.

""No, not with Oracle,"" he said then, adding that ""I never spoke to Larry about TikTok.""

Oops, something went wrong

Barely a year after the National Association of Realtors settled a lawsuit and rewrote the rules for how agents get paid, the powerful trade group is examining the fate of another policy that could change how homes are bought and sold across the country.

The policy, known as Clear Cooperation, requires agents to list homes on shared databases known as multiple listing services (MLS) within one business day of beginning to market the properties. The rule is designed to cut down on what are known as “off-market” or “pocket” listings, where a home for sale is marketed semi-privately to small pools of potential buyers without being advertised widely on the MLS.

Since it took effect in 2020, the policy has sparked fierce debate within the real estate world and at times pitted its top players against each other. Proponents argue that the rule helps ensure that the industry follows fair housing laws and helps sellers secure top prices for their homes by putting them in front of the broadest pool of potential buyers. Opponents, meanwhile, say sellers should get to dictate how their homes are marketed and argue that the MLS listing requirement violates antitrust laws.

Read more: Is it a buyer's market or a seller's market? Learn the difference.

The NAR is currently reviewing whether the rule should be repealed, remain in place, or be changed. At a time when the number of homes for sale remains below historical norms and brokerages have consolidated, the decision has implications for how hundreds of thousands of homes are marketed and sold each year.

“We take for granted that you can go to any portal ... and have a complete and total data set that's accurate in real time,” said Leo Pareja, the CEO of eXp Realty. “That only comes from the cooperative structure we have set up where everyone shares everything.”

A profitable niche

Pareja thinks his firm, the country's largest by agent count, would benefit if the policy is repealed. But he'd like to see it stay in place because he believes more transparency is better and cheaper for consumers.

Where most real estate companies fall on the issue tends to align with whether or not they benefit from the rule. Executives at Zillow and Redfin, which aggregate home listings from the MLS, are for it. Compass, a luxury-focused brokerage that touts its access to “Private Exclusives,” is against it. Anywhere Real Estate, the parent company of franchises including Century 21, Coldwell Baker, and Sotheby's International Realty, has said it would like to see the rule remain but with changes.

Pocket listings are a relatively niche way to sell a home in most parts of the country. Data is scarce, but estimates generally put the deals at 5% or less of sales nationwide. Using deals that were listed as “sold” the same day they first appeared on the MLS as a proxy, Redfin estimates that they made up 1.8% of deals in mid-2024.

They're most common in high-end real estate, where celebrities or other VIP clients may be keen on keeping a transaction low profile. Those sellers also sometimes want to test their listing prices in more private channels to avoid the stigma of publicly cutting prices or having a home linger on the market for months for all to see.

“With the luxury markets, they do like to keep things close to the vest,” said Linda Hussey, a real estate agent in Waikoloa Village, Hawaii. But the last pocket deal she closed was more of a matter of happenstance: The condo sellers walked into her office, and she happened to have been in contact with a buyer eager to purchase in their complex.

Pocket listings can proliferate in markets and time periods when inventory is particularly scarce, and some agents advertise their access to off-market deals in an effort to win business. In the midst of the pandemic buying frenzy in mid-2021, pocket listings totaled 2.8% of deals, Redfin said. While Clear Cooperation was designed to reduce pocket listings, they're still permitted under some circumstances, including if a property is only marketed within one brokerage.

Unclear impact on prices

There's debate as to whether pocket listings help sellers maximize their payouts. A seller can come out ahead by floating a price above what comparable homes are going for and finding a willing buyer. But without advertising widely, they also risk leaving money on the table. And since pocket listings frequently stay within one brokerage or with one agent who winds up representing both the buyer and seller, buyers and sellers can have limited power to negotiate commissions.

Learn more: Why real estate comparables matter

Zillow, which generally benefits from properties being widely marketed, analyzed 2.72 million homes sold in 2023 and 2024 and found that homes sold via pocket listings sold for 1.5% less on average than comparable residences that were listed on the MLS.

The brokerage Compass, which marketed more than half of its new listings in early February with some sort of off-MLS status, says its data shows that homes pre-marketed before hitting the MLS ultimately sold for 2.9% more.

Robert Reffkin, Compass's CEO, said in an earnings call last month that the MLS policy “harms homeowner value by taking away homeowner choice.”

Matt Curtis, a real estate agent in Huntsville, Ala., shares Reffkin's skepticism, even though he thinks most sellers benefit from having their house in front of as many potential buyers as possible.

“At the end of the day, it's the seller's house,” Curtis said. “I think the seller ultimately should be able to decide what they can and can't do.”

Fair housing advocates generally support the policy, saying pocket listings can hurt traditionally underrepresented buyers' ability to compete in today's market.

“It exacerbates potential segregation and discrimination,” said Laurie Brenner, associate vice president of housing and community development for the National Fair Housing Alliance. “When these listings are deemed as being exclusive, that, by definition, means that people are being excluded.”

The nonprofit group Consumer Federation of America believes that pocket listings harm both buyers and sellers, and has advocated that the NAR restrict the use of “office exclusives” as well.

Clear Cooperation has been subject to court battles over the years. Top Agent Network, an off-market listings service, initially sued the NAR over the policy in 2020. After several appeals and dismissals, it dropped its latest case earlier this year. The Justice Department also looked into the rule as part of a broader investigation into NAR policies.

The NAR is expected to rule on the policy in the coming weeks, but the threat of more litigation remains. Michael Ketchmark, the lead plaintiffs' attorney in the lawsuit that upended commissions, has threatened to sue if the policy is upheld.

Oops, something went wrong

Job-hopping has lost its luster.

The median pay increase for workers switching jobs sank substantially to 4.8% last month from a pinnacle of 7.7% two years ago, according to recently released data from the Atlanta Fed.

While job changers tend to receive higher pay increases than job stayers, the gap between job stayers and those who switch roles has fizzled and is now at its lowest level in a decade. A worker who stayed put and received an annual raise saw nearly the same bump in pay — 4.6%, the Atlanta Fed found.

“The pendulum is swinging back from the pandemic premium for new hires,” Julia Pollak, chief economist at employment search site ZipRecruiter, told Yahoo Finance.

“The gap between wage growth for job switchers and job stayers ballooned to the widest gap on record during the Great Resignation,” she said. “Companies rushed to rehire after the pandemic, and the No. 1 focus was on hiring incentives — signing bonuses and raising starting pay.”

The problem is that many companies felt burned by offering huge salaries and bonuses to people who stayed only a short while and then left for better opportunities.

Now the focus is on longer-term retention incentives such as retirement and health insurance benefits that make workers want to stay, Pollak said.

Federal job cuts and layoffs by large companies are contributing to a chilly job market overall, flashing the warning signs that the golden era for job seekers has ground to a halt. A recent Harris Poll found that 7 in 10 Americans think it's difficult to find a better position than the one they have now — and three-quarters say employers hold the power in the market.

“Hiring is so weak and unemployment durations are growing,” Pollak said. “Employers are opportunistically able to pick up great talents on the cheap.”

Talk about glum. A record-low 13% of job seekers described their search as going well, per the findings in a new ZipRecruiter report. Gloomier still — more than 6 in 10 job seekers reported zero job offers, the highest level in three years.

In 2022, wage growth contributed to people quitting their jobs for higher-paying options, Allison Shrivastava, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Yahoo Finance.

“At that time, finding a new job was easy for most, and companies had to compete to hire workers. Now, that competition has greatly decreased,” she said. “This shift … has made leaving their current job for a new one less attractive.”

The data backs that up. Workers are staying in their current jobs, as seen with the low quits rate tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics — 2.1% or 3 million people quit in January.

“The labor market is on ice,” Shrivastava said.

Another more recent cause of that cooling is the result of mixed messages about where things are going.

“Confusion and uncertainty (are) causing workers and companies to hold onto jobs and workers, while at the same time holding off on expanding their labor force,” she said. “This freezing can only last so long until the market gets frostbite, leading to an increase in layoffs or a further slowdown in hiring or quitting.”

On a brighter note: It could also be that some people were able to find roles that were a better fit for them in 2022 when job switching was commonplace, and they are happy where they are, Shrivastava said. “Either way, it's clear that people are going to be staying in their current jobs for longer.”

One caveat that can impact those lower starting salary figures: When people change fields, they tend to take a pay cut initially. And plenty of folks have been doing just that.

During the pandemic many workers had time to do some soul-searching about what they really wanted to do, and the number of those transitioning to new careers has risen.

“Only about 30% of job seekers say they want to switch industries, but more than 50% of recently hired workers got their jobs in a new industry,” Pollak told me.“That suggests that workers who keep an open mind, expand their search, invest in new skills, and follow opportunity are disproportionately successful.”

Whether you're a career switcher or simply a job shifter, it's not always about the money.

“Many job jumpers leave not just for money,” Jayne Mattson, a career coach, told me. “They leave companies because they aren't getting any professional development or growth, or they found employment during COVID and it is not the right role and they want to find a better fit.”

Mattson's advice for job seekers: Before you start your search, think of what you want in your next role and what it looks like.

“When people are leaving their job, I always ask, ‘What do you hope to get in your next role that you are not getting now?' If they're not clear of what they want to do, what their values and interests are, how will they know if they get an offer that is the right one?”

Oops, something went wrong

Donald Trump has taken a shine to the term ""liberation day"" as a shorthand for his coming reciprocal tariff plans.

""April 2 is liberation day for our country because we're finally going to be taking in money,"" he said Monday during a stop at the Kennedy Center.

He brought it up again Friday in the Oval Office, saying, ""We have been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe.""

All told, Trump has used a version of the term at least six times this past week in a reflection of how central tariffs have become to his second-term vision and how, in his mind, this liberation theme encapsulates his plans.

He used ""liberation day"" language previously in his inaugural address, but then he was looking at Jan. 20, the day he took the oath of office.

The now-in-focus April 2 trade deadline ""has become something of a catch-all date for tariff rate hikes from the White House,"" Henrietta Treyz of Veda Partners said this past week, noting that headline risk for markets and new duties for importers are likely around that day.

Trump's main agenda item on April 2 will be reciprocal duties after a plan was unveiled in February laying out an administration investigation that will end — as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently put it — with a situation where ""each country will receive a number that we believe ... represents their tariffs.""

The concern is that already battered markets might not realize how high some of those numbers may be, especially on allies such as Europe that Trump has criticized relentlessly without yet slapping with new duties.

A wide array of industries — from autos to shipbuilding to pharmaceuticals to semiconductors to copper to uranium to lumber to dairy — could also be in for new sector-specific duties after a flood of threats from the White House.

The main question for those sector-specific duties is whether Trump actually moves to impose new tariffs on these sectors that day or whether he instead launches new investigations that push those deadlines for another 30 days or longer as new investigations and public comment periods commence.

What Trump promised again and again this past week is that April 2 will be when the country-specific reciprocal tariffs are in place and money flows in.

""It's called April 2, and that's going to be tariffs,"" Trump said at another point this past week, even refusing to back down when his interviewer, Laura Ingraham of Fox News, responded by bringing up the chances of a recession.

""Everything could happen,"" Trump said.

He also brought up liberation day when he pressured the Federal Reserve to lower rates on Wednesday.

""He's more willing to soldier through a level of economic pain,"" Eurasia Group founder and president Ian Bremmer said in a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview.

""I think that some of the purpose of tariffs this time around is more structural,"" he added. ""It's really to change trade flows.""

And Trump has given himself an extraordinary amount of leeway to achieve those ends when it comes to what he could impose.

Trump and his aides plan to calculate their so-called effective tariff rate that combines all the factors Trump deems as fodder for retaliation, including things like domestic consumption taxes in Europe that have traditionally not been considered in trade talks.

The view from Trump's orbit, as one of his top aides put it in a recent podcast appearance, is that the recent weeks of market volatility will end once the full scale of the coming tariffs is clear. That point could come soon after April 2 as ""some of the tariff stuff comes into clearer focus for the markets to be able to absorb and price in.""

The aide, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair, added a promise that Trump wants to provide predictability for businesses as soon as April, suggesting ""we will get to a place very soon where [businesses] feel very comfortable with how to plan.""

Economic data releases and earnings

Three Wall Street strategy teams have cut their S&P 500 (^GSPC) outlooks amid the recent market drawdown in markets.

The calls all have a similar flavor. Economic growth forecasts have been falling as the uncertainty around President Trump's policy plans wears on. This comes counter to the environment many expected when consensus projected another year of strong economic growth for the US economy. 

At a high level, there's also been a sentiment shift, with strategists now arguing that markets might no longer trade at the extended valuations seen over the past two years, and therefore the benchmark S&P 500 likely won't rise as much. There's also the simple fact that any rally in stocks is coming from a lower starting point and therefore might not see the massive rise required to reach prior targets.

Still, 16 of the 17 strategists we track at Yahoo Finance forecast the benchmark index rallying from here.

What stands out now, as the chart below shows, is that there's not much of a clear consensus besides a general idea that stocks will go up at least somewhat.

With an upside range as low as 6,200 and as high as 7,100, forecasters are calling for the S&P 500 to rally anywhere from about 10% to more than 26%.

Broadly, strategists feel the current hesitancy in the stock market will continue until there's more clarity on President Trump's policies. The extent to which stocks rally from there likely depends on the outlook for the economy and corporate profits.

Deutsche Bank chief strategist Bankim Chadha wrote in a recent research note that if the souring mood about the president's tariff plans prompts a ""credible plan to resolve tariff uncertainty, it will allow the business cycle to continue.""

If so, Chadha believes the S&P 500 could hit 7,000 this year.

Meanwhile, other strategists are starting to talk more about how the path ahead might not be so linear.

""While we don't believe that a pullback beyond the 10% drawdown that has already been sustained is inevitable, we do believe that the path for stocks between now and December has gotten rockier with stronger headwinds,"" RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina wrote in a recent note when lowering her year-end S&P 500 target to 6,200 from 6,600.

Last week, Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert told us about a ""sentiment shift"" among investors over the past few months as more of their clients have been asking about the chances the S&P 500 hits their ""bear case"" of 5,500. This is a stark change from the past two years when the prevailing question was whether or not strategists had been bullish enough. 

Given the recent drawdown, the question makes sense. Stifel's Barry Bannister is standing by his 5,500 year-end target for the index, the most bearish call on Wall Street entering the year. Bannister believes stocks will stay in the doldrums amid a period of slower economic growth and sticky inflation, which he notes is ""historically adverse for the broad equity market.""

For what it's worth, that kind of environment could be an interpretation of the Fed's most recent economic forecasts released on Wednesday, which showed the central bank revising inflation projections higher for this year while cutting its economic growth forecast.

RBC's Calvasina often calls her S&P 500 target a ""compass, not a GPS,"" an idea this column has highlighted before. For now, the arrow is clearly pointed in one direction, with the majority of macro strategists arguing stocks will head higher at some point in 2025.

But it's hard not to acknowledge the needle on the compass might be wavering a bit, and the argument for where stocks are headed has become far more nuanced — and with less conviction — than the straight line higher of the S&P 500's past two years.

Costco is reportedly demanding price cuts from its Chinese suppliers as U.S. tariffs continue to take a toll.

With rising import costs due to tariffs, Costco (COST) – along with major U.S. retailers like Walmart – is trying to get suppliers to absorb some of the hit. This has placed additional pressure on Chinese exporters, who are already grappling with years of tariffs and razor-thin margins.

While sifting out signatures of supernova remnants, a high-schooler stumbled upon the afterglow of a dormant black hole. It may be one of the largest ever seen.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Long after the black hole in the center of a galaxy sputters out, you can still see its ghost lingering in surrounding gas clouds aglow with leftover radiation, like wisps of smoke emanating from an already extinguished flame. Astronomers call these cosmic ghosts ""light echoes"" — and that's what high-school junior Julian Shapiro found while scanning the cosmos for supernova remnants.

""There are these outer regions of gas being ionized by a supermassive black hole, which results in this echo,"" Shapiro said at a March 20 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society (APS) Global Physics Summit.

Shapiro, 17, is a student at The Dalton School in New York City. But in between classes and scoping out potential colleges, he's also an independent astronomer who presents at global conferences like this week's APS meeting.

Originally, Shapiro began sifting through the DECaPS2 survey — an inventory of the southern galactic plane from the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile — to find the debris of exploding stars in supernova remnants and planetary nebulas.

But after zeroing in on one such object, he found its structure didn't match the wispy filaments characteristic of a supernova remnant, nor did it show evidence of a supernova at its center. ""It was a real surprise to stumble upon this,"" Shapiro told Live Science.

The object, which he believes to be a light echo, stands in a field of potential supermassive black holes. Using measurements from the Southern African Large Telescope, he found high contents of oxygen and ionized sulfur sprinkled into the region — both indicators of shocked material. All of these signs suggest that the object is the afterglow of a now-dormant black hole, which once spewed radiation that ionized the surrounding gas, causing it to emit light even after the black hole quieted down.

Shapiro currently pegs the light echo at about 150,000 to 250,000 light-years in diameter — about 1.5 to two times the width of the entire Milky Way galaxy. And if his estimates hold up, he thinks it could be a viable candidate for the largest light echo ever discovered.

""This object covers a large area in the sky, which makes it a bit easier to get in-depth images of,"" Shapiro said.

According to Sasha Plavin, a black hole researcher at Harvard University who was not involved in the research, echoes like the one Shapiro discovered can help us learn more about how black holes behave in the hearts of galaxies.

""I really like how carefully [Shapiro] looked into these images,"" Plavin told Live Science. ""These galactic events are always of interest, and I think these echoes are a great way of studying them.""

Plavin is also interested in seeing how this new light echo measures up to others — whether it occurred faster or slower than existing examples. ""Putting this discovery in a wider context could be useful in the future,"" he said.

—Evidence for Stephen Hawking's unproven black hole theory may have just been found — at the bottom of the sea

As Shapiro continues studying the light echo, he hopes to learn more about its composition with measurements of its different regions. But in the meantime, he's excited to continue contributing to black hole science — even if he came across it by accident.

""My involvement in this area of research came as a bit of a surprise to me,"" he said. ""But I hope this object, in particular, helps expand the knowledge of galaxy activities that we don't have too great of an understanding of.""

Why don't some birds, like penguins, ostriches and kiwis, take to the skies?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Birds are often associated with flight, but not all of them take to the skies. Around 60 species — fewer than 1% of all bird species — are flightless, including ostriches, penguins and kiwis. These birds evolved from flying ancestors but lost their ability to fly, instead adapting to life on land or in the water.

But why did they give up flight? Why don't all birds fly?

The ability to fly is especially useful for escaping predators and traveling long distances in search of food and favorable living conditions. However, flight requires a lot of energy; birds burn about 75% more energy per day than similarly sized mammals do.

""If flight isn't necessary, birds can better survive and reproduce if they divert that energetic investment elsewhere,"" Natalie Wright, an associate professor of biology at Kenyon College in Ohio, told Live Science in an email.

In a 2016 paper published in the journal PNAS, Wright and her colleagues noted that island-dwelling birds, facing few to no predators and less competition for food and habitat, tend to evolve toward flightlessness.

""When living on an island without predators and without the need to migrate or travel long distances, for many kinds of birds the costs of flight outweigh the benefits,"" Wright said.

The shift to flightlessness leads to physical changes in birds. Over evolutionary time, their pectoral flight muscles shrink. The sternum (breastbone) with its central ridge (keel) — where flight muscles attach — also becomes smaller, Wright said. Wing bones — the humerus, ulna and carpometacarpus — become shorter and less robust, while their legs grow longer and sturdier as an adaptation to a more terrestrial lifestyle, she added.

Some birds have traded flight for superior swimming abilities. Penguins, for instance, retained their flight muscles and keel but repurposed them for swimming. ""They use their wings to fly underwater,"" Peter Ryan, a professor emeritus of ornithology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, told Live Science in an email. The flightless auk (Pinguinus impennis) also uses its wings to propel itself through water.

In birds that have been flightless for a long time, the long, stiff feathers needed for flight (flight feathers) disappear too, Ryan said. In some species, like kiwis and the Inaccessible Island rail (Atlantisia rogersi), the body feathers lose barbules — the tiny, hook-like structures that normally keep them aerodynamic — giving them a fluffier, fur-like appearance, Ryan added.

A 2025 study published in the journal Evolution found that flightless birds lose feather features in the reverse order of how they first evolved. The research also concluded that skeletal changes occur before changes in plumage, as it takes significantly more energy to grow and maintain bones than it does to maintain feathers.



Although flightless birds are uncommon today, fossils reveal that they were far more prevalent and diverse a few thousand years ago, Tim Blackburn, a professor of invasion biology at University College London, told Live Science in an email. However, the arrival of humans and animals like rats and dogs exposed these birds to predators.

""Having sacrificed their capacity to take to the air, there was no time for them to re-evolve this useful ability,"" Blackburn said. This led to the rapid extinction of iconic birds like the dodo (Raphus cucullatus) on Mauritius, the moa in New Zealand, and many others.

A 2020 study co-authored by Blackburn and published in the journal Science Advances found that there would be four times as many flightless bird species on Earth today were it not for human-driven extinctions.

—Are birds reptiles?

—Do birds pee?

—Why do hummingbirds 'hum'?

The loss of flight happened at least 150 times in different groups of birds throughout evolutionary history, Ferran Sayol, first author of the study and a researcher at Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF) in Barcelona, Spain, told Live Science in an email.

""Many of these species thrived on islands without predators but disappeared shortly after when humans arrived (due to direct hunting or introduced predators), making flightlessness seem rarer than it actually was,"" Sayol said.

Reductions in official development assistance can lead to a significant increase in death among mothers, children, and infants, according to a new Stanford-led study that reviewed three decades of sanctions on foreign aid. The researchers estimate that aid sanctions to low-resource countries lasting five years or more can negate 64% of progress against maternal mortality, 29% of the progress for infants, and 26% for children under 5.

The study, which began in 2022, is the first of its kind to assess the global impact of aid sanctions on human health – particularly maternal and child health. The authors hope government officials can use the findings to better understand how foreign policy decisions impact the health of local populations, then take steps to minimize unintended humanitarian harm, including waivers for lifesaving programs. 

""Foreign policy can be strategic in advancing national interests while also protecting the health of mothers and children,"" said lead author Ruth Gibson, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford Health Policy and, by courtesy, the Center for International Security and Cooperation. ""We used cutting-edge analytic methods to assess the impact of this targeted geopolitical tool so we could make clear policy recommendations for governments considering foreign aid sanctions or cuts to foreign aid."" 

The study published in The Lancet Global Health contributes to a growing foreign policy conversation about the use of foreign aid restrictions. The U.S. Congress has been considering ways to minimize the negative impacts of aid sanctions, while the shutdown of USAID has sparked additional debate on the removal of foreign aid and its impact on health. 

After more than a decade working on maternal and child health for foreign health ministries and humanitarian organizations, Gibson was struck by the serious toll that sanctioning foreign assistance took on the health and lives of women and children. In 2022, she set out to systematically study their impact as a postdoctoral scholar at the Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health. 

Gibson and a multidisciplinary team from Stanford, Drexel University, and the University of Washington developed a study that analyzed the extent to which past aid sanctions affected maternal and child mortality between 1990 and 2019. 

Using population health metrics from multiple databases, as well as assembling a new aid sanctions dataset for this study, the authors examined the relationship between aid sanctions, official development assistance for health, and measures of infant mortality, child, and maternal mortality. They found sanctions to foreign aid reduced roughly 2.4% of a country's total health care spending through decreases to development assistance for health. This led to increases in mortality of 6.4% for mothers, 3.6% for children under 5, and 3.1% for infants – negating much of the progress made against maternal and child mortality in these countries over the last three decades. 

The team took particular care to address concerns related to other factors that could impact mortality in countries experiencing aid sanctions, such as changes in gross domestic product, battle-related deaths, and other sanctions. Using state-of-the-art econometric analysis designed to prove causal relationships, they took numerous steps to control for variables that could confound the results and compared sanctioned countries with those that have never been sanctioned. They have provided open-source files so that their methods can be tested, replicated, and used to study the impacts of other foreign policies.

We believe our work stands out for its careful application of econometric methods and use of novel data. We take seriously the concern that the set of conditions that precipitate the imposition of aid sanctions may affect mortality directly, so we implemented a variety of modeling techniques to avoid conflating this effect with the true effect of sanctions themselves."" 

Sebastien Bradley, associate professor of economics at Drexel University, senior author and lead economist on the project

The researchers also recommended policy interventions to reduce the impact of aid sanctions on maternal and child health while ensuring national interests and security. 

They outlined, for example, health-related questions for any legislative body considering strategic changes in foreign aid commitments. They also proposed an additional fragility assessment for nations in conflict, such as food insecurity and displacement. 

""In a world where disease knows no borders, our national interests are well served by maintaining the health and stability of people in other nations,"" said Michele Barry, Stanford's senior associate dean of global health and a study author. ""This new research shows that we can shape foreign aid in strategic ways that advance national interests while also minimizing harm to vulnerable populations.""

Shenyang Institute of Computing Technology, CAS and Chinese PLA General Hospital Joint Team conduct series of investigations on Infantile Spasms Syndrome (IESS), also known as West syndrome, discovering a video-based epileptic seizure detection method that effectively enhances the accuracy of infantile spasm identification.

1. Background introduction and problem bottleneck

IESS is an epileptic encephalopathy that manifests during infancy, characterized by unique epileptic seizures, including repeated muscle contractions, extensions, or alternating flexion-extension spasms. These seizures are accompanied by high-amplitude electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms, known as hypsarrhythmia. IESS has adverse prognostic implications for intellectual development. In clinical practice, precise monitoring of bedridden patients' movements is crucial for effective disease management and epileptic seizure diagnosis. However, even experienced EEG technicians face challenges when analyzing relevant data.

2. Research opportunity and discovery

Given the massive generation of EEG data, the susceptibility of signal interpretation to interference, and the potential comfort issues for infants and young children when wearing EEG devices, we explored a video-based epileptic seizure detection method utilizing feature recognition. This method aims to simplify the assessment process, reduce non-medical expenditures, and ensure continuous evaluation of the patient's condition.

3. Brief summary of research content

This study initially integrated target detection technology into the video data processing stage to accurately locate patients in clinical monitoring videos, thereby extracting video clips that solely contain the patients. Subsequently, an enhanced 3D-ResNet was employed for video-based IESS detection. This method utilizes an optimized 3DResNet-50 architecture, which deeply extracts local key features from the video through asymmetric convolution and CBR modules, and introduces a 3D Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance the spatial correlation between channels in video frames.

4. Current challenges and future directions

Currently, the main challenges faced by the research include issues such as occlusion, lighting variations, and similar human body interferences during the identification process. Future research directions will focus on further enhancing the network's generalization capability, optimizing algorithms to address various challenges in practical applications, and exploring more AI-based solutions to alleviate the workload of doctors when screening VEEG data.

The Minnesota Vikings quarterback situation has been one of the main topics during the NFL offseason, and they are still working out their QB room, which includes 2024 No. 10 overall pick J.J. McCarthy, for 2025. The team is in communication with a veteran quarterback, but it's not Aaron Rodgers, as the team is reportedly not pursuing the future Hall of Famer. 

With former Minnesota starter Sam Darnold signing with the Seattle Seahawks, the team is reportedly sticking with McCarthy as their starter. It likely wants to add a veteran to its group, and with Rodgers seemingly out of the conversation, it's moving on to another seasoned QBs.

The Vikings have shown interest in adding Ryan Tannehill, but no deal has been discussed, per Fox Sports. Tannehill played for the Tennessee Titans from 2019 to 2023 but didn't sign with a team in 2024. 

The 36-year-old was adamant that it would take the exact right scenario for him to join a team, saying ""nothing really felt right"" during free agency last offseason. As a result, Tannehill didn't take any snaps during the 2024 season, last playing in January of 2024. The former No. 8 overall pick played in 10 games in the 2023 season, starting eight with a 3-5 record. 

Tannehill began his career with the Miami Dolphins, playing seven seasons in the 305 before playing five seasons with the Titans. 

In his 11-year career,  the former NFL Comeback Player of the Year has played in 155 games, with an 81-70 starting record, 34,881 passing yards, 216 touchdowns and 115 interceptions. He's started five playoff games, all with the Titans, with a 2-3 record, 754 passing yards, seven touchdowns and five interceptions.

Bigger than life in more ways than one, George Foreman captivated the hearts and minds of sports fans and found a place on the kitchen counter of many American homes. A two-time heavyweight champion, entrepreneur, author and minister, Foreman died Friday at age 76, according to his family and publicist. 

""Our hearts are broken. With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones,"" Foreman's family announced on Instagram. ""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.""

""Big George,"" as he was adored by family, friends and fans, was best known as a championship boxer. He won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics before beating Joe Frazier in Jamaica to capture his first heavyweight championship as a professional in 1973. The fight, dominated by Foreman, is well known for Howard Cosell's legendary call: ""Down goes Frazier!""

He then fought Muhammad Ali in 1974, a bout famously dubbed ""The Rumble in the Jungle."" Foreman suffered the first loss of his career as a heavy favorite in Zaire, dropping the title to Ali via eighth-round knockout. The fight was one of the most-watched televised events in history at the time and served as a springboard to Ali deserving his moniker, ""The Greatest.""

Though Foreman won a rematch against Frazier in 1976, he retired the following year after taking his second defeat at the hands of Jimmy Young.

A post shared by George Foreman (@biggeorgeforeman)

After 10 years away from the ring, Foreman returned in 1987, at age 38, and went on to win 12 straight fights before falling to Evander Holyfield via unanimous decision in 1991.

Foreman regrouped, though. Three years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman defeated 26-year-old Michael Moorer to capture the WBA and IBF heavyweight titles, becoming the oldest man to ever win a world heavyweight championship in boxing. He ultimately relinquished the titles at 46 years, 169 days old before retiring for a second time in 1997 having compiled a 76-5 career record with 68 knockouts.

Inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003, many consider Foreman to be one of the 25 best boxers of all-time.

Foreman also served as the spokesman for the George Foreman Grill, which was introduced in 1994 and became a worldwide sensation with a reported 100 million units sold in the first 25 years of its existence.

Foreman is survived by his wife, Mary Joan Martelly, and 12 children, five sons and seven daughters. ""Big George"" famously named all of his boys George Edward Foreman so ""they would always have something in common.""

The title of ""The Baddest Man on the Planet"" has been bestowed on many a heavyweight champion in boxing history. At his peak, it was hard to argue that George Foreman did anything but live up to that moniker as a heavy-handed wrecking ball.

Foreman died on Friday at the age of 76, leaving behind an incredible legacy in the ring as well as associating himself with an electric countertop grill that was seemingly present in every kitchen in America in the 1990s. Foreman's is a prototypical boxing story of a fighter who rose from turbulent adolescence to global superstardom.

Foreman's in-ring legacy is littered with accomplishments, from an Olympic gold medal, to legendary fights with the best fighters of heavyweight's golden era, to a stunning world title win at 45 years old.

With all of that in mind, let's take a look at five of Foreman's most memorable fights, presented in chronological order.

Foreman entered the fight with a 37-0 record with all but three of those victories coming by stoppage. Facing Foreman was a terrifying prospect, not only because of his power but because he had the technical boxing chops to get that power home, as evidenced by his 1968 Olympic gold medal. Frazier had won the WBA and WBC titles in February 1970, titles that had been stripped from Muhammad Ali, and had successfully defended those titles four times, including an iconic 1971 victory over Ali in ""The Fight of the Century.""

Foreman made good on his opportunity to face the champ, frequently trapping Frazier along the ropes and letting power shots rip. Frazier was frequently rattled and was dropped three times in the first round and three more times in the second before the fight was stopped at the 2:26 mark of the round. This was the fight that produced Howard Cosell's legendary call of, ""Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!"" while also crowning Foreman as world champion for the first time in his career.

After an easy first title defense against Jose Roman, Foreman was paired with a much tougher task in the form of Norton. Coming off back-to-back fights with Ali, with Norton winning the first by split decision before losing the second, also by split decision, Norton had proved he had the chops to go toe-to-toe with the best in the world and had fully earned his right to challenge for Foreman's status as the best heavyweight on the planet.

The fight played out in a way that made Norton's bonafides seem anything less than legitimate. Norton, a future Hall of Famer, was down three times in the fight before it was stopped at the 2:00 mark of Round 2, marking the second time Foreman had stopped a legendary heavyweight within two rounds in three fights.

There's no doubt how impressive someone's career was when they created several iconic phrases. While the first Frazier fight produced ""Down goes Frazier!"" the Ali fight introduced the phrase ""Rope-a-Dope."" The fight called ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" is one of the most iconic in boxing history for the action and the involved personalities. Ali avenged both his losses to Norton and Frazier in a three-fight stretch to earn the right to challenge Foreman and regain the world titles that were controversially stripped from him for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War.

After a strong start from Ali, Foreman tracked Ali down and repeatedly caught him along the ropes. Little did Foreman realize this was a part of Ali's plan as Ali covered up, taking punches to the body and arms as Foreman slowly wore himself out with a steady stream of heavy punches. In Round 8, a badly fatigued Foreman was caught by a flurry of Ali punches that dropped him and resulted in the fight being stopped. While it was a loss for Foreman, it further cemented his place in boxing lore as the perfect foe fought the perfect fight to topple the most dangerous man on the planet.

While Foreman fought other legends in his career, including his 1991 loss to Evander Holyfield, his fight with Lyle was one of his most exciting. Lyle had rebounded from back-to-back losses to Jimmy Young and Ali with a sixth-round knockout of Earnie Shavers. Foreman was fighting for the first time in more than a year after the loss to Ali.

Lyle dropped Foreman in the fourth round of the bout. Moments later, Foreman dropped Lyle with a huge right hand. Were that enough action for the round, Lyle connected with a wild right that sent Foreman down awkwardly before he was saved by the bell signaling the end of the round. In the next round, with both men seemingly exhausted, Foreman trapped Lyle in the corner and unloaded a barrage of punches until Lyle spilled the the canvas, landing on his face and failing to beat the referee's count as Foreman got back in the win column.

After a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977, Foreman stepped away from the sport. A decade later, Foreman decided to make his return. It took 25 fights for him to earn his shot at the titles again when he face WBA, WBC and IBF champion Evander Holyfield, but came up on the wrong end of the decision. Four fights later, Foreman again lost, this time against Tommy Morrison in a fight for the vacant WBO title. Despite the loss to Morrison, Foreman was given the chance to face Moorer, who defeated Holyfield to win the WBA and IBF titles.

In the fight, Foreman relied on a simple plan of throwing a straight right hand behind a jab. That combination would be what decided the fight as Foreman landed both shots in Round 10, sending Moorer spilling to the canvas where he was unable to beat the count. The win crowned Foreman as world champion at 45 years, five months and 18 days. To this day, Foreman holds the record as the oldest heavyweight champion in boxing history.

SMU is hiring Maryland athletic director Damon Evans to serve in the same position, the school announced Friday.

Evans will replace Rick Hart, who helped guide SMU into the ACC last year. Previously serving as Georgia athletic director, Evans has been at Maryland since 2014 and worked as the school's AD since 2018. He was recently named to the College Football Playoff Selection Committee. 

SMU recently hired away Jay Hartzell from Texas to be its new president. Hartzell is believed to have made a run at Texas athletics director Chris Del Conte, who brushed away those rumors in February. 

The timing of SMU hiring Evans is particularly interesting for Maryland as speculation continues to swirl around Villanova's interest in Terrapins basketball coach Kevin Willard. He guided Maryland to a second-place regular season finish in the Big Ten and a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament. 

The Terps are scheduled to play 13-seed Grand Canyon on Friday afternoon. Willard previously spent 12 seasons coaching in the Big East at Seton Hall, and sources have indicated he still has a strong affinity for the conference. 

Speaking ahead of the first-round game, Willard said Evans ""is probably going to SMU,"" and he spoke about the challenges of NIL demands. 

Villanova fired Kyle Neptune after three seasons in which the Wildcats did not make an NCAA Tournament berth. Neptune succeeded Jay Wright, who won two national championships at the Philadelphia-area school.

WICHITA, Kan. – This is a story about transition. No, the coaches at Houston and Gonzaga who meet here in a second-round Midwest Region NCAA Tournament game Saturday aren't going anywhere. Gonzaga's Mark Few and Houston's Kelvin Sampson have done just about everything they can do in their professional lives. 

Everything except winning it all. 

The pair of future hall of fame coaches have combined for 1,036 wins and four Final Fours in addition to a wealth of NBA and national team experience. But neither Few or Sampson have won a national championship and that is sticking out like a mountain range suddenly plopped down in the Kansas prairie surrounding this particular matchup. 

Leave it, then, to an informed observer to put the stakes in context. 

""When you get to this point, it's time to cash one in,"" said Kellen Sampson, his father's top assistant for the Cougars.

Kellen was speaking only of Houston, knocking on the championship door as a No. 1 seed for the third consecutive year. But the 39-year-old son could have been talking about Gonzaga as well. Few has his own won-everything-but-the-big-one career. The game's winningest active coach has spent 26 years winning 741 games but coming up agonizingly close losing championship games in 2017 and 2021. 

""You put in all this energy and commitment just for regular-season success. That's underselling the value of what we've already done,"" Kellen Sampson added. ""At some point in everybody's life it's gotta be OK to be greedy. I think that's kind of where both coaches are.""

This is a story about transition because one of these coaches will keep chasing that career-long dream after Saturday. The other, well, at least Few is philosophical.

""It's fine,"" he said of ending his career without a championship. ""I've had a great life. Listen, I'm as competitive as anybody, too crazy competitive. You get hooked on winning. You want to win everything.""

And then sometimes you can't. Gonzaga's rise to prominence spans parts of three decades. A private school in Spokane, Washington, proved it could play with the big boys. It still resides in the West Coast Conference playing a national schedule before Gonzaga plans to move to the Pac-12 in the 2026-27 academic year. 

It is a March staple without a crown. 

Houston is becoming a Lone Star copy of the Zags. Last week at the Big 12 Tournament, Sampson ruminated about getting knocked out of the 2021 Final Four by Baylor. Sampson made it a point to say, ""We weren't good enough"" that year. Left unspoken was a truth that hung in the air afterward.

Now we are. 

There is much evidence this is Kelvin Sampson's best team ever. He has three proven scorers – L.J. Cryer, Emanuel Sharp and Milos Uzan. The Cougars are among the top  3-point shooters in the country. The defense is a given. 

""He brings up that Baylor game a lot,"" Sharp said of his coach. ""I feel like every year since then we've had a team that could win the national championship … We've got all the tools … UConn was a great team but I still feel like last year we could have gotten to the Final Four and won.""

There is slow rumbling below the surface that suggests Kelvin Sampson may retire after this season – whether or not the Cougars win it all. But especially if that lifelong payoff comes next month in San Antonio.

""The way he coaches you'd think he's 30,"" Sharp added. ""He's the most consistent person I've seen, player and coach. He hasn't changed.""

Kellen has already been designated as the head-coach-in-waiting. How long that wait is, has to be determined. 

""'Ready' is a tricky word,"" Kellen Sampson said. ""When I first started to get some interviews, it revealed how ready I wasn't. 'Chief' says nothing forces you to take an inventory of your life more than opportunity. There were a lot of inventory things I wasn't ready for … I hadn't put a lot of good thought to it. 

""I'm more prepared today than I was yesterday."" 

The father-son dynamic sometimes plays out in muted tones. When Kellen approaches his dad from behind during games it is with head bowed, almost in deference, to make a strategic point in his ear during a game. The son calls his father ""Chief"" which seems to fit that dynamic. 

""There's a little respect there, and also we spent 11 years [together],"" Kellen said. ""People ask me sometimes, 'What's it like working with your dad?' We have figured out how to work together and love each other at the same time."" 

Kelvin Sampson is closer to the end of his career at 69. The detour after Indiana led him to the NBA as an assistant for six years before taking the Houston job. Few is 62, long established as a made man in the profession, armed with an Olympic gold medal (as an assistant coach with the U.S. Men's National Team last summer in Paris). 

Since about 2015 the man has barely paused for a breath between basketball gigs – coaching in the Pan American Games, the U.S. Men's Select Team, the FIBA World Cup team and last year in the Olympics.

There was some sort of serendipity at work this weekend. The last time Gonzaga lost an opening-round game was 17 years ago. A raw sophomore named Steph Curry from Davidson dropped 40 on the Bulldogs.

Few helped coach Curry last summer as an assistant with the national team. 

""I just consider it the highest calling you can get as a college basketball coach,"" Few said of his national team experience.

The two coaches became close when Kelvin Sampson started his career out West as both an assistant and head coach at Montana Tech and Washington State from 1980-1994. 

""Unless you're a big fly fisherman like me there aren't many people getting to Butte, Montana,"" Few said of Kelvin Sampson's Tech days. 

In 1989-90, Sampson's Cougars lost 18 in a row. 

""Washington State was obviously the hardest, toughest job in the Pac-10,"" he recalled. ""If it would have been a good job, they never would have hired me. They would have hired a real coach.""

That's roughly the same time when the seeds were being planted for Gonzaga to grow into a national program under Dan Fitzgerald, Dan Monson and then Few. 

Saturday's game could have been a rematch of conference rivals. A couple of years ago Gonzaga was close to joining the Big 12 in realignment. If Houston had won that 2021 Final Four game vs. Baylor, it would have played Gonzaga in the championship game. 

The matchup features No. 2 scoring team (Gonzaga) vs. No. 1 scoring defense (Houston). Gonzaga's nine straight Sweet 16s is the longest streak in the nation. Houston is next with five. The Zags' 26 straight trips to the NCAA Tournament is the third-longest active streak in the nation.

Through the last eight seasons Gonzaga and Houston are Nos. 1-2 in winning percentage. Few came into this season as the winningest active Division I coach. Sampson has ushered in a new era of Houston dominance not seen since the Phi Slama Jama days in the 1980s. 

""We owe a debt of gratitude to Gonzaga,"" Kellen Sampson said. ""We were not a power conference team [in the American Conference] when we first started. They were just this example for us to chase. We sold the idea of being the Gonzaga of Texas for so long. Asking our administration, asking our fans to keep doubling down on the investment on us … 

""Gonzaga tucked away in the eastern corner of Washington has become one of the best basketball brands in the country. Why not us?""

Sometimes the NCAA Tournament does this to teams. In terms of brand value, Houston-Gonzaga seems like it should be an Elite Eight or Final Four matchup. It is a second-round game only because Gonzaga entered with its lowest seed (No. 8 in the Midwest) since 2016.

But something unique – maybe unfair -- is still at work. The No. 8 seed in the Midwest Region is also the No. 7 overall team in KenPom.com's rankings going into Friday's play. The selection committee has endured enough criticism but this disparity probably deserves an explanation. 

Few's teams like to push tempo, playing inside out. The list of big men he has coached  is impressive – Adam Morrison, Drew Timme, Chet Holmgren and more. Massive 6-foot-9, 250-pound senior Graham Ike is the latest, leading the Zags in scoring. But watch redshirt sophomore Braden Huff who has started three career games. His last two starts have come in succession. Huff scored 18 points in the West Coast Conference championship game and in the first-round win vs. Georgia. 

""They've been the standard offensively in America here the last 10 years,"" Kellen Sampson said. ""Nobody has run a better, cleaner, more efficient offense than them. What they've done has bled to all corners of the country.""

Khalif Battle is a 6-9 barrel-chested transfer guard who has played at four schools in six seasons. Through stops at Butler, Temple and Arkansas, Battle has chased the NCAA Tournament like Elmer Fudd chases Bugs Bunny.

In his first career NCAA Tournament game, Battle scored 24 against Georgia. 

""He told me he's going to need me in March,"" Battle said of Few. ""I'm definitely going to take on the challenge. He recruited me here for these moments."" 

The coaches' longing Saturday will not be on display but it will be evident. It's fair to say this is Few's next chance to win it all. Considering his age, his roster and the alignment of the stars, this just might be Sampson's best chance to win it all.

""That's what makes it so urgent on this team,"" Sharp said. ""We know what he wants.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22tennis%20news%22%20site%3Abbc.com","PTPA: Tennis players' union seeks court order against ATP Tour","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c0q1vyp54dxo","Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:03:50 GMT","

The PTPA has criticised the schedule, ranking systems and control over image rights

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) is seeking a court order to prevent the ATP Tour engaging in ""improper, coercive or threatening communications"" with players.

The association alleges the ATP has tried to pressure players into signing pre-prepared statements saying they had no prior knowledge of the legal action launched this week by the PTPA.

The union, which was co-founded by 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic, cited ""anti-competitive practices and a blatant disregard for player welfare"" in lawsuits filed on Tuesday.

Djokovic is not one of the players listed as a plaintiff in the official court documents, but said publicly at the Miami Open on Thursday that there are elements of the lawsuit with which he agrees, and some with which he does not. 

The Serb went on to say: ""I've seen some changes, but there are some fundamental changes that are still yet to be made and I really hope that all the governing bodies, including PTPA, will come together and solve these issues.""

The PTPA, ""on behalf of the entire player population"", is taking action against the men's ATP Tour, the women's WTA Tour, the International Tennis Federation and the International Tennis Integrity Agency in the US, the UK and the European Union.

Australia's Nick Kyrgios is the most high-profile player to be named as a plaintiff alongside the PTPA.

In papers filed late on Friday to the United States District Court in New York, lawyers for the PTPA asked Judge Margaret Garnett to issue an order which prevents all four defendants from communicating with players about their involvement in the process.

The motion accuses the ATP of threatening to reduce prize money and pension contributions to offset legal fees which it will accrue from fighting the case. It argues this constitutes ""flagrant interference"" with the jurisdiction of the court.

Friday's motion also claims the ATP initiated a series of meetings and conversations at this week's Miami Open and alleges ""ATP officials have threatened players with adverse consequences for participating in this action"".

The ATP says prize money has increased by $70m (£54m) in the past five years, and can point to the $28.5m (£22m) of prize money available to emerging and lower-ranked players on the Challenger Tour this year.

The PTPA says an expedited decision, to prevent defendants communicating with players, is necessary so players can make ""informed decisions about their participation in this case, and fully and freely pursue their legal rights without undue influence by the same parties who control their pay cheques and professional endeavour"".

In a statement released on Tuesday, the ATP said it ""strongly rejects the premise of the PTPA's claims"", declaring the case to be ""entirely without merit"" and promising to ""vigorously defend"" its position.

It accused the PTPA of having ""consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress"" and said the ATP ""remains committed to working in the best interests of the game"".

The WTA said it will defend its position and said in a statement the legal action is ""both regrettable and misguided"".

It added: ""Contesting this baseless legal case will divert time, attention, and resources from our core mission, to the detriment of our players and the sport as a whole.""

The BBC has approached the ATP for further comment.

Mike “The Miz” Mizanin last appeared on The Challenge in 2005, back when it was still known as Real World/Road Rules Challenge. 20 years later, he remains one of the franchise's iconic characters.

Mizanin, 44, spoke to Us Weekly exclusively at the Newport Beach Celebrity Classic golf tournament on Sunday, March 16, benefiting Steadfast LA and the Newport Beach Fire Department Foundation, where he set the record straight on whether he will return to the show.

“I retired from The Challenge,” he told Us. “I told everyone, ‘This is my last one.' And people were like, ‘No, it's not. Never will be blah, blah, blah.' And I was like, ‘It's the last one.' And then it literally was.”

That's not to say Mizanin has disappeared from the reality spotlight. He's competed outside of The Challenge franchise, appearing on Fear Factor and Dancing With the Stars. He also served as host of the reunion shows for several Challenge seasons and hosted spin-off series Champs vs. Stars for two seasons.



Even though he's no longer competing, he's paying attention.

“I love seeing the new, up-and-coming challengers. I love seeing where The Challenge is. Who would have thought that it's bigger than The Real World, bigger than Road Rules?” he said. It's one of the biggest shows out there.”

Mizanin shouted out Johnny Bananas specifically, as well as Wes Bergmann, who recently competed on season 3 of The Traitors. And, yes, he has considered potentially competing on the Peacock reality hit.

“The hard part about doing Traitors for me would be three weeks in Scotland with no phone,” he said. “I can't be away from my kids that long, not just that long, but it's about not even talking to them. I need to talk to my kids, but I feel like that's a show that I could totally go on and win.”

Mizanin also admitted that Mark Long, who he played with on The Challenge in the early 2000s and most recently competed on The Challenge 40: Battle of the Eras, has tried to recruit him back to the franchise before.

“He always talks to me. I always hear from Mark, but he knows the answer,” Mizanin said. “I'm busy. I literally have WWE. I have a new golf YouTube channel called Miz Golf.”

For his part, Long told Us that he's enjoyed following Mizanin's career and praised his fellow wrestler's work ethic.

“When I think of cast members, I always put Mike in his own category: ‘superstar,'” he said. “He's one of the hardest working guys out there so I never even ask him. But I love following his career and chatting with him.”

Mizanin also teased something “big” that will further occupy his time in the coming months.

“It's something that I had a passion [for] ever since I was a little kid, and now I get to be a part of it and I'm really excited about it,” he said. “And then also, me and my wife were working on something big as well.”

Happy's Place — and Rex Linn — are finally giving Reba McEntire the chance to have a sitcom romance after multiple failed attempts on her OG Reba series.

During the season finale on Friday, March 21, Isabella (Belissa Escobedo) attempts to set up her half-sister, Bobbie (McEntire), with their coworker Emmett (Linn). The only problem is that both Bobbie and Emmett are worried about ruining their decades-long friend so they pump the breaks. Happy's Place ends by hinting that Bobbie and Emmett are in it for the long haul, which isn't what executive producer Kevin Abbott originally had in mind.

“I actually had a different place I was going to wind up with in the first season. It involved that relationship,” he exclusively teased to Us Weekly. “But I couldn't because we like to track these out and then build them so that when we get there, it is a surprise. It seems obvious the tracks have been laid because we had the 13 episodes and we weren't told whether or not we were going to get picked up for more.”

Happy's Place ultimately received an additional four-episode order but the writers' room decided not to rush the romance, with Abbott adding, “I didn't have time to build where I wanted to build to. But I wanted to start that relationship because the one thing I never got to do on the old Reba show was relationships.”



Before working with McEntire, 69, on Happy's Place, the duo collaborated on Reba, which ran from 2001 to 2007. Abbott used what did — and didn't — work on Reba when reuniting with McEntire on NBC's new hit sitcom about coworkers at a tavern.

“For whatever reason, Reba can do almost anything. The one story we could not tell on the original show was relationships. There were love interests but the chemistry never worked,” he recalled. “We tried a couple different times and those were horrible episodes — from my point of view. They were always very tough episodes for me because they just didn't work well.”

Happy's Place didn't have that issue because McEntire was paired off with Linn, 68, who was already her real-life boyfriend.

“She's with Rex now and we thought, ‘If it's ever going to work, this is going to work.' For me it works. They are just wonderful together,” Abbott gushed. “So I'm interested in following that track and seeing how it goes. That was the plan even before we cast Rex — believe it or not. Because we did cast him and that was always intended as a possible love interest because I've got some of those stories I want to tell. I wasn't able to tell them in the old Reba sitcom.”

McEntire and Linn originally met while filming 1991's The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw, but they didn't pursue a romance until nearly three decades later. After reconnecting, McEntire and Linn have had fun starring in the same projects, including Big Sky and now Happy's Place.

The NBC series, which premiered in 2024, features McEntire as a tavern owner who inherited her father's business and discovered a new professional partner in a half-sister she didn't know she had. Linn, meanwhile, plays a cook named Emmett who has a crush on Bobbie, which will be explored in the already-ordered season 2.

Happy's Place also stars Melissa Peterman, which Reba fans remember from the original sitcom. But just because Happy's Place reunited the costars doesn't make it a copy and paste version of the Reba series.

“I did the original Reba show with Reba and she's everything that you would hope she'd be as a person — let alone as a performer. We didn't quite tell all the stories that we wanted to tell in the original Reba. That was an odd ending to that show. We were actually looking at doing a reboot of the original show,” he recalled about the pilot that was eventually not picked up. “I think we've done a pretty good job of [doing something different with Happy's Place].”

He continued: “We didn't want to do another family show with kids because we'd done a lot of that. So we wanted to just do an adult workplace show. We've been really happy with it. I'm thrilled to be back with these people.”

Happy's Place has been renewed for season 2. Season 1 is now streaming on Peacock.

NBC's Happy's Place went through quite a few story line changes — including when it came to those Reba cameos — but what were the show's original plans and how did they shift?

During an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, creator Kevin Abbott confirmed that the biggest shakeup was Danny (Steve Howey) was no longer going to be a potential sperm donor for Gabby (Melissa Peterman) despite past comments from him.

“With Steve Howey, we originally had an idea that he was going to be the sperm donor. Then NBC wanted a Christmas episode so we had to scramble and come up with something. We put Steve in that and we changed things,” Abbott explained. “But he was originally the sperm donor.”

Howey, 47, and Peterman, 53, previously teased to Us in individual interviews how they wanted to see the story go after sharing the screen on Reba. Abbott, however, admitted that it would be “a little weird” considering the way viewers have associated Howey with Van from Reba and Peterman with the role of Barbara Jean. (The pair played in-laws on the hit sitcom.)



“It got a little creepy and a little incestuous,” he quipped. “It got weird. So we decided against that. We are so lucky we've been able to have two of our old cast members on right now. And we're looking to bring JoAnna Garcia Swisher. Obviously we love her.”

Despite Happy's Place overlapping so much with Reba due to stars Reba McEntire and Peterman being on both shows, the NBC sitcom has to be careful with guest stars. (In addition to Howey, season 1 featured an episode with Christopher Rich as well.)

“We can't get too close to what the original [revival of Reba would have been],” Abbott noted. “We can only do so much without crossing legal lines. So that's always a big caution for us. Mostly my attitude on this.”

The other onscreen shift could come as a surprise for viewers who saw McEntire's Bobbie come to terms with her feelings for Rex Linn‘s character, Emmett.

“I actually had a different place I was going to wind up with in the first season. It involved that relationship,” Abbott confirmed about Bobbie and Emmett, who decided not to act on their feelings just yet during the Friday, March 21, season finale. “But I couldn't because we like to track these out and then build them so that when we get there, it is a surprise. It seems obvious the tracks have been laid because we had the 13 episodes and we weren't told whether or not we were going to get picked up for more.”

The Happy's Place writers decided not to rush the romance, with Abbott adding, “I didn't have time to build where I wanted to build to. But I wanted to start that relationship because the one thing I never got to do on the old Reba show was relationships.”

After Happy's Place was ordered to series in May 2024, the character descriptions, cast members and even potential onscreen relationships evolved.

“When you have a pilot, hopefully you create areas that you could grow into. For instance, Pablo Castelblanco‘s character was [pictured] as Larry Wilmore and I was thinking that was going to be a very different type of character,” Abbott explained. “Pablo came in and he was just so brilliant. I didn't know if he was going to be Steve or who but he was going to be in the show. So the dynamics put in place for Steve we didn't follow at all.”

He continued: “Originally Steve and Isabella [Belissa Escobedo], were possible love interests with each other. Obviously that's not going to be the case. … I could be lying [though]. You have no idea. You shouldn't trust me.”

Happy's Place has been renewed for season 2. Season 1 is now streaming on Peacock.

Wild Things isn't exactly considered a great film, but more than 25 years later, it's certainly proven to be a memorable flick.

The erotic thriller, which has a cast full of actors who were already household names, follows a high school guidance counselor (Kevin Bacon) as two students, Suzie and Kelly (Neve Campbell and Denise Richards, respectively), falsely accuse him of assault. However, it's all a scam to get money out of Suzie's trust fund before her mother's death. The plan for all three to split the money quickly goes awry as lust and greed take the wheel.

Despite the drama, Christina is thriving—focusing on her kids, enjoying her HGTV ventures, and rebuilding positive relationships with ex-husbands Tarek El Moussa and Ant Anstead.

Christina Haack is “energy cutting” amid her ongoing divorce from estranged husband Josh Hall. 

 Just because Christina Haack‘s estranged husband, Josh Hall, left The Flip Off one episode in doesn't mean his name didn't come up.

Fat Joe is close friends with LL Cool J — but the rapper still gets starstruck around the hip hop legend.

“LL Cool J is my idol and the guy who inspired me to make music,” Joe, 54, reveals exclusively in his 25 Things You Don't Know About Me feature in the latest issue of Us Weekly. “Every time I hang out with him I get nervous, even though I've hung out with him a hundred times in my life and we're friends. I owe everything to him.”

The Bronx-born rapper was also inspired by a few other New York City legends.

“When I was younger, a lot of music inspired me,” Joe told Us. “It was the Nas and Jay-Z era.”



Keep scrolling for more fun anecdotes from Joe, whose new album, The World Changed on Me, is available now:

1. My first car was a black BMW 525.

2. If I could only watch one movie, it would be The Godfather. It's the blueprint to my life — I watch it to keep my skills sharp.

3. We didn't have much growing up, so every Sunday, [when] my father would take us to the Chinese [restaurant] in the hood, we felt like it was big time. We ordered all the stuff we shouldn't order, like chicken wings, french fries and pork fried rice. We were so lucky in New York. You got good Chinese [food] in every corner.

4. If I could collaborate with anybody, it would have been Michael Jackson.

5. When I'm making a new album, I hang out in the studio for, like, a month, listening to music and beats and other artists. Then I start recording. I listen to a lot of other artists, from Bad Bunny to the Griselda Boys. When I was younger, a lot of music inspired me. It was the Nas and Jay-Z era.

6. My kids are everything to me and my most valuable possession.

7. My favorite song I've collaborated on is Ja Rule's “New York” with Jadakiss. Coming from New York City and representing where I'm from for crowds across the world, it gives me the most joy and pride.

8. LL Cool J is my idol and the guy who inspired me to make music. Every time I hang out with him I get nervous, even though I've hung out with him a hundred times in my life and we're friends. I owe everything to him.

9. My favorite book is the Bible, and the story of Job motivates me.

10. My alternate profession would have always been to be an entrepreneur.

11. “Give Me the Night” by George Benson brings back the best memories and reminds me of sitting in the back of my father's station wagon. It would come on and I would just feel like it was amazing. And then I found out in the future that Quincy Jones produced that and the writer was Rod Temperton. I loved it as a kid and my whole life, and then to find out who produced it and wrote it was the greatest.

12. My secret talent is that I used to play softball really well back in the Bronx, but those days are gone.

13. Social studies was and still is my best subject.

14. My go-to takeout order is cheese pizza from Patsy's Pizza on 119th Street and 1st Avenue in NYC. There's no better pizza.

15. The best time in my career was the success that [2017's] “All the Way Up” had after being in the game for such a long time. Very rarely did a guy over 40 years old put a hit out, and it came at the right time.

16. My first job was [handing] out flyers. A bunch of guys from my block would drive us to Brooklyn on Saturdays and we'd give out flyers in different houses and apartments.

17. My happy place is definitely Dubai and I also love, love, love the Dominican Republic. I have the best time there.

18. I collect sneakers and my favorite pair is a black [Air] Jordan Kobe Bryant set.

19. The items I can't leave the house without are my car keys, a watch, some cologne and a Diet Pepsi.

20. My fondest childhood memories are during summertime in New York, playing for hours in the sun and [my] mom screaming to get in the house because it was getting dark.

21. I've never been to Cuba and that's the one item left on my bucket list.

22. My favorite comfort meal would be octopus salad and Spanish-style rice and beans.

23. My ideal way to spend the weekend is as lazy as possible — sitting on my couch and watching sports — which never happens because I'm usually traveling and doing concerts.

Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo were seemingly still in love when they filmed Southern Charm season 10 — but after breaking up, not all their onscreen interactions have aged well.

“My whole life is business now. That's the fun stuff for me now,” Craig told Austen Kroll during season 10, episode 4, which aired in January. “Making money, getting healthy and f—ing my girlfriend.”

Craig's life motto for season 10 — which was filmed before he and Paige parted ways in December 2024 after three years of dating — isn't the only thing that makes Us do a double take watching it back.



Many of Craig's plans were made with Paige in mind, including his choice to freeze his sperm and delay his vision of becoming a dad until she was ready. The two also were very relaxed about their hopes for marriage, which hits differently now that they aren't a couple.

“She is doing housewife duties,” Madison LeCroy pointed out during episode 5 after Paige made floral arrangements for a party at Craig's house. She then asked, “What about just engagement without being engaged?”

Craig responded that the duo were “basically” engaged — and Paige didn't disagree.

Scroll down to see which of Craig and Paige's comments from season 10 haven't gotten better with age:


“For Paige and I, time spent in the backyard, that's our quality time,” Craig revealed during episode 3, which aired in December 2024, showing off his finished Charleston house. “When we first started dating, we were out and about all the time.”

He explained, “We just I guess [have] grown with each other. We'd rather spend the time at home relaxing than out partying. I built this sanctuary for us to be away from the world and be able to relax and connect.”

Craig shocked pals Austen and Shep Rose during episode 4 when he revealed, “Me and Paige have decided to freeze my sperm.”

His conversation with Paige, however, was equally as surprising. “I was thinking about freezing my sperm,” Craig told his then-girlfriend. “That's like the craziest thing in the world,” a stunned Paige said in response.

Craig went through with the process, telling his friends that it was Paige's decision to hold off on having kids, confessing that “without any influence from Paige” he would have his own timeline. “You date a little while, then you get married, then you have kids,” he said.

During the same episode, Craig said, “I want kids one day. Have I ever told you that I want kids right now?” He claimed, “I never said I want kids right now.”

Austen, however, told the cameras, “Ever since I've known Craig, he's wanted to get married, wanted to have kids.” Austen added, “I'm not entirely sold that Craig wants what Paige wants.”

Craig later confessed that his timeline had shifted after meeting the Summer House star. “The version of life that I saw myself living isn't what I'm living, which is this stable home that I grew up with,” he told the cameras. “Every night at dinner, my mom and dad were there with my brother. I just loved that.”

He concluded: “But I think If you find the right person and they happen to be a feisty Italian from New York things aren't always going to go how you have them planned.”

Paige was supportive of Craig's Sewing Down South company throughout their romance. They even joked about his crafts during episode 4, which aired on January 2, while envisioning one of the rooms in his house.

“Don't worry about me, you do what you want in that room,” Paige told Craig, who revealed he wanted the space to be “a multifunctional room where I can craft.”

Paige teased, “I want you to be able to hem things for me. It's been three years, and you haven't hemmed a single pair of freaking pants for me!”

While Paige was on board with a sewing nook, she shut down one of Craig's more outlandish suggestions for the room. “What about a wrapping paper wall?” he asked to which Paige replied, “What the f—? No.”

During episode 5, Craig joked about hosting a party to celebrate him freezing his sperm. He then revealed that he was leaving Paige his sperm if he dies, and she wants more kids.

“Is there a return policy,” she said with a laugh. Craig, however, was serious because of his dreams of their future.

“In the rom-com world that I live in, I die and you're like, ‘But I still want to have his children,'” he said. Paige, however, noted she “would never do that.”

She argued, “What, I'm going to have a child and then actively not give them a dad?” Craig responded by saying he understood that, but “instead of throwing it away immediately” she would now have a “choice” and it was a “gift” from him.

Craig and Shep had a heart-to-heart during episode 7, which aired on January 23, talking about his ups and downs with Paige. “You have been itching for this white picket fence existence. Now you have it,” Shep said, applauding Craig for his new life.

Craig admitted, “I think everyone knows, if it was up to me we would just get engaged. But she changes her mind a lot about stuff.”

He detailed Paige's inner thoughts, explaining, “One day she'll text me and say, ‘Let's build a f—ing farmhouse in the middle of nowhere.' Or like, ‘I'm moving to Charleston.' Then she'll have a good day in New York and be like, ‘I love it up here.'”

Shep asked if that's “hard to hear” to which Craig confessed, “It gets confusing.” He added, “I think that's life. It's a bunch of decisions and compromise.”

Craig later told the cameras that he did have some reservations about going off of Paige's timeline and not his own. “Me waiting a few years to have a kid, not a big deal. But what I'm risking is, ‘What if Paige wants to turn those couple years into 10 years?'” he asked.

During episode 9, which aired on February 6, Craig and Paige went to purchase bees for his Charleston home. While Craig called the experience his “fantasy,” Paige revealed she didn't love the idea of living on a farm.

“Sometimes I do fall into that fantasyland of being like, ‘Oh, wow, we could have a farm and a bunch of kids,'” Craig said. Paige acknowledged that she also makes up “fake scenarios” in her head but claimed she's more “realistic” than him.

Craig told Paige he's happy she's “grounded” but confessed, “It's also fun to hear excitement for the future too.”

Paige claimed that she didn't have a “checklist” of items she wants to do before they get married and have kids, but said she should be “allotted” the same time that Craig was in his early 30s to make her own timeline choices.

“I definitely feel a little pressure. I'm only 31,” Paige told Craig. “I'm not gonna lie, sometimes you make me feel like I'm 75.”

Paige then expressed frustration over anyone telling her when she should have kids, saying, “F— yeah it's my decision because I'm the one that holds it in my f—ing body,” she declared. “If you said to me right now, ‘We need to have a baby or I'm leaving,' you'd have to leave.”

Craig understood where she was coming from, but confessed that when Paige talks about “our kids” or says, “I'd be a great husband,” it makes him feel like, “Oh, she likes me.”

“[Is] who I am not enough? Do I not show enough love?” Paige fired back, adding, “If you can't handle the amount of love that I give then that's, like, a personal problem.”

Craig called the conversation “stupid” and said he was simply trying to be “lovey dovey” about their future.

Despite arguing during episode 9, Craig told his pals that he and Paige were heading toward engagement sooner rather than later.

“We're gonna get married,” Craig told Patricia Altschul at her annual guys' dinner, adding, “We're not really letting the ceremonial stuff keep us from living our lives.

He later clarified, “I'm gonna propose soon. Soon as in by the end of the year.” Craig also revealed, “I showed her a sheet of rings and told her to pick her favorite. She picked an emerald cut and elongated cushion.”

When asked if a proposal would prompt Craig to ask Paige to move to Charleston full-time, he confessed, “We don't know where we're going to end up.” He then asked, “What rule says we have to pick one city?”

“You shouldn't have to force someone into liking you. If the person likes you, they'll make time for you,” Craig said during the February 13 episode while reflecting on Shep's one-sided romance.

He confessed to his own shortcomings, revealing, “It's an insecurity that I have dealt with because Paige is so busy.” Craig noted, “Her career is one of her biggest priorities and I had to learn how to exist in that world.”

During the March 6 episode, Craig confided in Austen that he was an “addict” and had struggled with alcohol over the past few years. Craig explained that he had retreated from his friendship with Austen to help himself stay on track, but Paige was always there for him.

“I am very sorry for not understanding what you were going through,” Austen said during their group trip to the Bahamas, asking, “[Are] you and Paige strong as hell? You're fine with the distance? You're not like sitting at your house and being alone and battling, or no?”

Craig revealed that Paige was “right with me this entire time.” He explained, “There's a reason that me and Paige are so close. I just could not imagine being closer to someone. I'm so lucky that she chose to be like, ‘I see someone there.' She helped me, like, beat this demon.”

During the March 13 episode, Craig spoke more about his ups and downs with alcohol, revealing alcoholism runs in his family. “It was cyclical. I would be good for a few months and then I'd go too far,” he explained.

Craig noted that he wanted to get better when he saw how it affected Paige. “I got to my bottom when I could just see it on Paige's face. Just this look of, like, I wasn't the guy that she had seen herself marrying,” he shared, revealing, “So Paige was pretty much done.”

He confessed, “It wasn't until almost losing Paige for me to change my behaviors. Paige was my rock.”

Paige, meanwhile, told Craig during the episode that she “bit my tongue so many times because it truly is a personal journey.” She revealed that once Craig got on track she was “very proud” of him and his “self-awareness” over the past year.

“I will always be grateful I didn't lose you when I hit my bottom. I don't plan on going back there,” Craig vowed. Paige then teased, “But just know if I ever need to leave in the middle of the night with kids, I will.”

During season 10, episode 14, which aired on March 13, Austen came over for a visit to see both Craig and Paige. During their poolside chat, Paige made it clear that her allegiance was to Craig after Austen and Craig finally made up after being at odds for months.

“Look, I do love you. I love you as a friend. But my loyalty will always be to Craig no matter what,” Paige said. “So if Craig is fighting with someone, I also have to hate them.”

Once they buried the hatchet, Paige and Austen started talking about his love life and new girlfriend Audrey Pratt, who is 10 years his junior. “Honestly, I love that she lives in Charlotte. I'm not even going to think about that shit until we've hit the two-year mark of dating,” Austen shared.

Paige totally understood where Austen was coming from but pointed out that her relationship with Craig wasn't that relaxed to start. “Want to hear what a mind f— this is, Craig and I have been dating two and a half years,” she said. “Right when we started dating, it was like, ‘But are you going to move?' I was like, ‘I've known this man for six months.'”

Craig was visibly upset by the comment, asking, “Would it be weird to ever talk about if you wanted kids at six months in?” Austen said the kid conversation is fine to have early, revealing he and Audrey already talked about it and she wants four kids.

“She should marry Craig, Craig wants four,” Paige quipped. Craig replied that Paige wanted three, but she fired back, “I want two.”

Craig explained, “You said if you don't have one of each though, you will keep having kids,” which Paige acknowledged was the truth, noting two was her dream number.

“When I'm with them, I've noticed things are not as calm and cool as he makes it seem,” Austen later told the cameras of the then-couple. “Like, did she just snap at him a bit or is he, like, annoyed with her? I'm going to be honest, they are so on opposite sides of, like, the spectrum of life.”

During the season 10 finale, which aired on March 20, Craig was melancholy when Paige had to leave Charleston for work before heading on a family trip to Italy and then her “Giggly Squad” podcast tour.

“When am I going to see you?” he asked before dropping Paige off at the airport. She teased, “Never, this is the last time you're ever going to see me and you just don't know it.”

When they kissed outside the terminal, Craig confessed, “Aw, I don't know why, usually it doesn't feel like this.”

Later in the episode, Craig gushed to Austen about his and Paige's life plans, saying, “[I'm] 99 percent confident I'm going to propose this year, and I think we're both very excited about it.” Five months after filming that scene, Paige and Craig's breakup made headlines.

“At its core, Ransom Canyon isn't just a town. It's an idea. It's the painful longing for your first love. It's the burning desire to protect your family. It's cowboys and lovers, grifters and thieves. Lust, deceit, heartache, home. Ransom has it all,” creator April Blair told Tudum in March 2025 about the series. “I think people are going to fall in love with this little slice of Texas and the dramas and romances that we created there.”

On Monday (March 17), audio footage was leaked of a conversation reportedly between Jonathan and Grace, where he allegedly admitted to physically abusing her. 

“I'm ashamed I've ever...I've never [been] aggressive with a woman before. I've never aggressed a woman — I aggressed you,” Jonathan allegedly said in the clip, per Rolling Stone. 

“You strangled me and pushed me against the car,” Grace said. 

“Yes, all those things are under ‘aggressed,' yeah.” Jonathan responded.

Jonathan was first arrested in March 2023 after an alleged domestic dispute against Grace. He was found guilty of third degree assault and guilty of harassment in December 2023.

Shortly before the audio leaked, Jonathan and actress Meagan Good got married in a private ceremony.

Sophie Rain has built a massive, multimillion-dollar brand with her work on OnlyFans.

Despite receiving criticism left and right for the questionable content she shares online, the 20-year-old model only listens to the words of a higher power.

Rain, who goes by SophieRaiin across social media platforms, exclusively told Fox News Digital that the subscription-based site is simply a stepping stone in her career, which has already helped her amass $43 million just two years out of high school.

The content creator admitted that while she does receive backlash online, she's never questioned her Christian faith.

""I'm very strong,"" she said. ""I have a very close relationship with my church and I love God. I believe that he will forgive your sins for anything, and I think that he's happy that I'm successful.""

She doesn't often have time to attend services in person, but makes sure to dial in weekly to virtual services.

WATCH: OnlyFans model has 'close relationship' with God

""I do a little video call because I'm currently living in Miami, but I used to live in Tampa, and that's my home church,"" she said. ""I love that church so much and… my pastor that is there. I can't listen to another pastor.""

She added, ""It's so nice because I don't have to be there to listen to the Word of God. I can listen to it from my phone.""

Rain also credited her strong morals and values for helping her stay focused on her future and quiet the outside noise.

""Having personal boundaries is the biggest thing,"" she said. ""You have got to have morals or else you're going to get lost in the industry. That's just what happens. It's really easy to listen to what someone else says and listen to them and try to follow what they do, but you have got to stay true to yourself.""

She added, ""Essentially, there's just this big misconception on OnlyFans that you are labeled as a porn star, but I'm still a virgin. I keep my content on OnlyFans very reserved, and you can still make money from doing all of these things.""

Before Rain became one of the most coveted influencers online, she was ""barely making by"" working as a server at a restaurant. She recently shared a video admitting she made $4 million from OnlyFans in one month.

""I was working long shifts just because I was just trying to make money,"" Rain said. ""I was still living with my parents. I wanted to move out. I wanted to go do my own thing, and it just wasn't making me enough money. Like everything is so expensive nowadays, I'm barely making by. My sister was actually doing OnlyFans first and she kind of got me into it. I started with her and everything, and it just blew up, and it turned out into this.""

What began as posting a few fun photos online has now spawned into a profitable business. Rain and a few of her friends live and work out of a home in South Florida — the Bop House, a money-making idea that formed organically.

""We always were hanging out, going on trips, like, just hanging out, being friends,"" Rain said. ""So we had this idea, 'Why don't we just all move into a house together and all work together?' And that's exactly what happened.

""We all are there to help support each other. We're all there to help each other grow.""

She added, ""I honestly was a little nervous about it… moving into a house with eight girls was going to be tough, but it's so much fun. We're all there to just support each other, and we've built a community where our collaboration fuels our success.""

When it comes to her critics, Rain takes a different approach than many to handling disapproval.

""I listen and I take in their criticism, and sometimes I don't believe it, but I'll just sit there and listen to them because it's nice to have someone to talk to and hear another view on what I'm doing, so I can work on being better,"" she said. ""A lot of times it is good information, but if I don't think that I need that information, I'm going to sit there and listen to them anyway.""

Rain added, ""That's a lot of where the morals come back in to play. Like you have to stay true to yourself. And as long as you have that security, you're going to be good in this industry and you're going to be successful.""

 ROME - Negotiations on a potential contract between Elon Musk's satellite internet operator Starlink and the Italian government have stalled, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions, Italy's defence minister said on Saturday. 

 Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government is aiming to guarantee encrypted communications between the government, diplomats and defence officials operating in risky areas and Starlink is among the contenders to provide the system. 

 ""It seems to me that everything has come to a standstill,"" Guido Crosetto was quoted as saying by newspaper La Repubblica. 

 He said it was partly due to the fact that discussions moved from technical aspects to ""statements"" by and about Musk, without elaborating about those statements. 

 Starlink is a dominant force in the sector with around 7,000 active low-orbit satellites and it has been offering its services in Italy since 2021. Sources have told Reuters Rome was considering a five-year deal worth a total of 1.5 billion euros with the company that is part of Musk's SpaceX group. 

 But talks between the government and Starlink have sparked outrage among opposition politicians who question the wisdom of handing a national security contract to a foreign businessman and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. 

 Meloni has put the alliance with the United States at the heart of Italy's foreign policy, but Trump's actions, which have antagonised Rome's European allies, are forcing her to perform a political balancing act. 

 At home, she is under pressure from her coalition partner, the far-right League, to keep supporting Trump and Musk. 

 On Friday, the League's leader and Meloni's deputy Matteo Salvini said he had a phone call with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, in which he praised ""the remarkable American capabilities in key areas such as satellite communications"". 

 Crosetto said that when the situation calmed down, talks would move back to a technical level. 

 ""The point is: what is most useful and safe for the nation,"" said the minister, who in the same interview described Musk as a ""visionary genius"". 

 Andrea Stroppa, a representative for Musk in Italy, said on Saturday it made sense for Italy and its European partners to create their own independent satellite infrastructure for low-orbit telecommunication, but Starlink could be the best solution for the short term. 

 ""In the next 3-5 years, there's an operating necessity that should be fulfilled,"" he said during a live interview on X. 

 Stroppa said Crosetto had visited SpaceX facilities in the U.S.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on his supporters to vote for a candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court who already had the full-throated backing of Trump's billionaire adviser Elon Musk.

“All Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

Trump's post came a little over a week before the April 1 election that will determine control of the court, which since 2023 has a majority of liberal justices. Who controls the court will impact a wide range of pending high profile issues, like abortion rights and congressional district boundaries, but it could also determine what the voting rules are for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election in the battleground state.

Schimel reacted to Trump's post with a statement saying: “I'm humbled and deeply honored to receive the endorsement of our President.” He added, “On April 1, Wisconsin conservatives must unite to restore objectivity to our Supreme Court and save our state like we saved our country in November.”

Schimel, a former Republican attorney general, is a Trump backer who had previously said he would welcome an endorsement from the president. He also appeared at a rally with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., in March, posed for a picture in front of a giant inflated Trump and attended Trump's inauguration in January. Schimel has also benefited from more than $12 million spent by groups funded by Musk.

One of the mailers used by the Musk group says that Schimel would back Trump's agenda from the Supreme Court. Trump Jr. stressed that a Schimel win was needed to protect his father's agenda. And Schimel told a group of Turning Point USA canvassers earlier this month that he needs to be elected to be part of a “support network” for Trump.

“Donald Trump doesn't do this by himself; there has to be a support network around him,” Schimel said, according to a video of his comments posted on YouTube. “They filed over 70 lawsuits against him since he took the oath of office barely a month ago, over 70 lawsuits to try to stop almost every single thing he's doing because they don't want him to get a win. ”

Schimel has also echoed unfounded concerns about unproven voter fraud that Trump raised following his 2020 loss.

Despite all of that, Schimel has repeatedly said he would not let his feelings about Trump impact any rulings he would make on the state Supreme Court, which came one vote away from reversing Trump's loss in Wisconsin in 2020. Trump won the state in both 2016 and 2024.

“If President Trump or anyone defies Wisconsin law and I end up with a case in front of me, I'll hold them accountable as I would anybody in my courtroom,” Schimel said during a March debate.

Schimel faces Democratic-backed candidate Susan Crawford in the election for an open seat. Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Whoever wins will be elected to a 10-year term that begins in August.

On Truth Social, Trump called Crawford “the handpicked voice of the Leftists who are out to destroy your State, and our Country — And if she wins, the Movement to restore our Nation will bypass Wisconsin.”

A spokesman for Crawford's campaign said, “Schimel has spent his entire career on bent knee to right-wing special interests, we assumed he had this endorsement locked up months ago.”

This isn't the first time Trump has gotten involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race. He endorsed the conservative candidate in the 2023 whose loss led to liberals taking control of the court for the first time in 15 years.

(NEXSTAR) – Spring has sprung and you may be starting to get early signs of the sniffles. But there's bad news for allergy sufferers: The worst is still to come. 

Multiple allergy forecasters indicate 2025 is likely to be a pretty rough year for seasonal allergies. Pollen counts are expected to be higher than average in 39 states, predicts Alan Reppert, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. 

If you're stocking up on antihistamines and bracing for impact, AccuWeather put together three maps showing when common allergens are expected to peak across the continental U.S. 

Tree pollen is usually the first culprit to arrive on scene, and it may already be starting to irritate you sinuses. Peak tree pollen season comes soonest to the southern states, around early April, before making its way northward through the start of June. 

Grass pollen is up next, peaking between May and July depending on where you live. 

Residents of the Pacific Northwest and New England can expect the worst when it comes to grass pollen, according to AccuWeather's forecast. 

Before you can catch a break, here comes weed pollen, causing issues from mid-to-late summer. 

Things are expected be roughest for the weed-allergy sufferers in the southern and Gulf states. It could be even worse if we have an active period of tropical storms and hurricanes, which tends to extend the extend the weed pollen season, according to AccuWeather.

Nationwide, allergy season is growing longer and more severe. Of the nearly 200 cities studied by Climate Central, the researchers found 87% have seen allergy season worsen since the 1970s. The biggest changes have happened in the Northwest and Southwest. 

Much of the change can be attributed to a warming climate, according to Climate Central. The earlier arrival of spring and warmer temperatures stretch out growing season, giving trees, weeds and grass more time to prosper and release pollen. 

It's not just that allergy season is growing longer – there's also evidence it's getting more intense. One study looked at the impact of increased carbon dioxide on ragweed plants. It found that with more carbon dioxide in the environment, ragweed plants grew larger and produced significantly more pollen.

A man in Norway has filed a complaint against artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT for accusing him of murdering his two sons and attempting to kill the third. The AI chatbot also alleged that he was serving 21 years in prison.

The man, Arve Hjalmar Holmen, asked the Norwegian Data Protection Authority to impose a fine on OpenAI, the creator of the chatbot.

Mr Holmen asked ChatGPT, ""Who is Arve Hjalmar Holmen?"" The AI chatbot made a fabricated story saying, ""Arve Hjalmar Holmen is a Norwegian individual who gained attention due to a tragic event.""

It further claimed, ""He was the father of two young boys, aged 7 and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020 and is currently serving a maximum sentence of 21 years in Norway.""



The AI chatbot also used a disclaimer: ""ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check the important info.""

Mr Holmen said, ""Some think that there is no smoke without fire; the fact that someone could read this output and believe it is true is what scares me the most.""

Noyb, a digital rights organization that brought the complaint on Holmen's behalf, claims the response is in violation of the European data protection rules around the accuracy of personal data.

Additionally, Nyob said Mr Holmen searched several times that day, including entering his brother's name into the chatbot, which resulted in ""many different stories that were all incorrect.""

Noyb lawyer Joakim Soderberg said, ""You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.""

Open AI has responded to the complaint, saying the issue was related to a prior version of ChatGPT, and the company had since upgraded its models.

""We are always looking for new methods to increase our models' accuracy and decrease hallucinations,"" the company said in a statement.

""While we're still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improve accuracy,"" it added.

Earlier, a Reddit user asked the chatbot to write the ""most unattractive"" Tinder bio for him.

ChatGPT delivered a savage response, ""A 42-year-old couch potato with a passion for complaining. Looking for someone who doesn't mind my 12 cats and can tolerate my collection of toenail clippings. I don't believe in deodorant, and I think showering is overrated.

""My ideal date is watching conspiracy theory videos on YouTube while eating expired canned food. No, I won't stop talking about my ex, and yes, I live with my mom. Swipe left if you can't handle the real me,"" it said.

Andrew Tate, the self-styled ""king of toxic masculinity"", and his brother Tristan have flown from the US to Romania to fulfil legal obligations related to a criminal investigation against them.

The brothers are under investigation in Romania on multiple accusations, including forming an organised crime group and human trafficking. They have denied all wrongdoing.

The brothers' plane - which Andrew Tate said earlier in a post on X cost $185,000 dollars (£143,140 to ""jet across the Atlantic to sign one single piece of paper"" - landed at Bucharest Henri Coanda International Airport shortly before 1am local time on Saturday morning.

After arriving at their residence near Bucharest, they vowed to clear their names in court, with Tate saying ""innocent men don't run from anything"".

He went on to tell reporters: ""After all we've been through, we truly deserve the day in court where it is stated that we've done nothing wrong and that we should have never been in court in the first place. We should have never gone to jail. We should have never had our assets seized. We should have never had our names slandered.

""Anyone who believed any of this garbage has a particularly low IQ.""

As part of preventative judicial control measures pending the investigation, the Tates are required to regularly check in with authorities in Romania. Their next check-in is due on Monday.

Their return to Romania comes almost a month after the brothers travelled to Florida after Romanian prosecutors lifted a travel ban against them.

Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier said earlier this month that his office had opened a criminal investigation against the brothers, a move welcomed by the US National Centre on Sexual Exploitation, which represents one of Tate's alleged victims.

Tate said on X at the time that the brothers had returned to Miami to see family and had been insulted by the opening of the investigation.

""We have no criminal record and expected a hero's welcome after being unfairly abused abroad,"" he wrote.

An initial criminal case against the Tate brothers failed in December when a Bucharest court decided not to start the trial and sent the files back to prosecutors, citing flaws in the indictment.

Soaring temperatures are leading to rapid and largely irreversible changes in the mountain ranges of the world, according to a new UNESCO report. In several regions, higher elevations seem to be warming faster than lower ones; glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate; permafrost is thawing at an increased rate; snow cover has declined; and snowfall patterns have become more erratic.

The ‘The United Nations World Water Development Report 2025 – Mountains and glaciers: Water towers' was released to mark the first-ever World Day for Glaciers on Friday (March 21).

Here is a look at how rising temperatures impact mountain ranges, and why this is significant.

What is happening?

GLACIER MELTING: Glaciers are disappearing faster than ever, with the last three-year period seeing the largest glacial mass loss on record. Scientists measure the state of a glacier by measuring how much snow falls on it and how much melt occurs every year, according to the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).

Since 1975, glaciers, which do not include the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, have lost more than 9,000 billion tonnes of mass. “This is equivalent to a huge ice block of the size of

Germany with a thickness of 25 metres,” Michael Zemp, director of the Switzerland-based World Glacier Monitoring Service, said during a press conference on Friday.

He also noted that five of the last six years registered the largest losses, with glaciers losing 450 gigatons of mass in 2024 alone. Last year, glaciers in Scandinavia, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard and North Asia witnessed the largest annual loss of overall mass on record.

Warmer temperatures are not the only reason behind accelerating glacier melting. More frequent and intense wildfires and dust storms are leading to more deposition of black carbon and other particulate matter on glacier surfaces and perennial snowpacks. “The impurities darken snow and ice surfaces, thus causing greater absorption of solar radiation… This can significantly influence the surface energy balance, thereby increasing melt rates, especially during periods and at locations of high incoming solar radiation,” according to the UNESCO report.

ACCELERATING PERMAFROST THAW: Permafrost is any ground that stays frozen — 0 degrees Celsius or lower — for at least two years straight. In high-altitude regions, permafrost can underlie much of the landscape. However, rising temperatures are melting permafrost in these regions rapidly. This is an issue as permafrost contains a vast amount of organic carbon and other nutrients. Mountain soils with permafrost contain approximately 4.5% of the global soil organic carbon, according to the UNESCO report. As the permafrost thaws, this organic carbon is released into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change.

Moreover, permafrost in mountain regions also stabilises rock slopes, moraines (material left behind by a moving glacier), and debris-covered slopes. However, due to permafrost melting, slopes become more vulnerable to erosion, increasing the risk of landslides and other hazards.

DECLINE IN SNOW COVER: According to the UNESCO report, snow cover in nearly all mountain regions has reduced, especially in spring and summer, with an expected further decrease in the coming decades. Snow cover is the total of all the snow and ice on the ground. It includes new snow and previous snow and ice that have not melted.

A study, ‘Uneven global retreat of persistent mountain snow cover alongside mountain warming from ERA5-land, published in the journal Nature in November 2024 revealed that there had been a significant global mean decline of 7.79% in persistent snow cover between 1979 and 2022.

ERRATIC SNOWFALL PATTERNS: In some regions, the elevation at which rainfall transitions to snowfall is shifting upwards due to atmospheric warming, the UNESCO report says. “Lower elevations and warmer climates are therefore undergoing greater decreases in snow cover depth and duration,” the report added.

It has also been observed that some of the mountain ranges are receiving a greater fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than snow. The snow duration has reduced, snow-melt is taking place earlier than usual, and the snow-covered area has shrunk.

Why is this significant?

Mountains, which cover 33 million sq km of the Earth's surface, are crucial for sustaining life on the planet. For instance, around 2 billion people downstream depend on mountains for freshwater resources from melting glaciers. If climate change-induced glacier melting continues at the current rate, it can have catastrophic impacts on these people.

“Water flows from mountains will become more erratic, uncertain and variable. Changes in the timing and volume of peak and low flow periods, increased erosion and sediment loads will affect water resources downstream, in terms of quantity, timing and quality,” the UNESCO report said.

Glacier melting and permafrost thaw also increase the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). GLOFs are sudden and catastrophic floods caused by the failure of natural dams, usually formed by glacial moraines or ice, which contain glacial lakes. The report noted that these floods “alone have resulted in more than 12,000 deaths in the past 200 years, and have caused severe damage to farmland, homes, bridges, roads, hydropower plants… often prompting further internal displacement”.

According to WGMS, melted ice of glaciers accounts for 25 to 30% of the currently observed increase in global sea levels. Between 2006 and 2016, the global mass loss of glacier ice amounted to 335 billion tonnes of lost ice per year, which corresponded to an increase in sea levels of almost 1 mm per year. Every millimetre can expose up to 300,000 people to annual flooding, WGMS said.

“When you ask me how many people are actually impacted, it's really everyone… It is really high time that we create awareness, and we change our policies and… We mobilise resources to make sure that we have good policy frameworks in place,” Sulagna Mishra, a scientific officer at the World Meteorological Organization, said in a press statement.

The US, led by President Trump, has deported 333 Indian nationals in January 2025 as part of its tough stance against illegal immigration. However, legal immigration has also increased, with more visas being issued to Indians for business, tourism, and skilled work. This highlights the US government's emphasis on attracting skilled professionals to boost the economy,

Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla investor, has publicly called for Elon Musk to step down as CEO, arguing the billionaire's divided attention - particularly his White House role - is driving the company into crisis.

""There's no question [Musk] has been committed to his job at the government, that's where he's spending his time. He is not running Tesla,"" Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management, told Sky News. ""I think Tesla needs a new CEO. The business has been neglected for too long.""

For over a decade, Gerber Kawasaki has backed Tesla under Musk's leadership. While not among Tesla's largest stakeholders - it holds 262,352 shares as of February 2025 - the firm has been steadily reducing its Tesla holdings since 2023. Ross Gerber, a vocal advocate for change within the company's board, has grown increasingly critical of Musk, particularly since his involvement with the White House.

""There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla,"" he told the outlet.

As Tesla stocks continue to slide - down 5 per cent in the past five days and more than 50 per cent from its December peak - Gerber insists that leadership change is necessary.

He further argued that Musk's involvement with Twitter (now X) diverted his focus and brought negative publicity to Tesla. ""The company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk,"" he said. ""Sales are plummeting, so yeah, it's a crisis. You literally can't sell the best product in the marketplace because the CEO is so divisive.""



The controversy surrounding Musk is also fueling a consumer backlash. Recently, French entrepreneur Romain Roy, who had used Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) for his company, cancelled a deal to protest against US policies and Elon Musk. Upset with Musk's statements and US environmental policies, Roy cancelled an order of 15 Teslas and chose European brands instead.

Tesla is also facing protests and vandalism at its dealerships. Earlier this month, shots were fired at a Tesla showroom in Oregon, while in Boston, a fire was set at the company's charging stations. Authorities also arrested protesters for violent demonstrations outside a Tesla dealership in Lower Manhattan.

A report revealed that Tesla sales in Germany, Europe's biggest EV market, dropped 76 per cent in February compared to the previous year.

Heathrow Airport is ""fully operational"", a spokesperson said on Saturday, a day after a fire at a power station shut down Europe's busiest air hub and caused travel mayhem.

The electricity substation blaze closed the London airport for most of Friday before some flights began to arrive and take-off later in the evening.

""We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today,"" the spokesperson said on Saturday morning.

""Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday's outage at an off-airport power substation.""

About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website.

Delays and cancellations were expected on Saturday as services resume.

""We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport,"" the spokesperson said.

""Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight.""

British Airways said it expected to operate around 85 percent of its scheduled flights at the airport throughout the day.

Restrictions on overnight flights have also been temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, according to the UK's transport department.

Around 230,000 passengers use Heathrow every day -- 83 million a year -- making it one of the world's busiest airports. Planes from Heathrow serve around 80 countries.

The scale of the disruption raised questions about the vulnerability of one of the UK's critical pieces of travel infrastructure.

Fire officials said the fire, which broke out on Thursday night, was ""believed to be non-suspicious"" and that an investigation would ""focus on the electrical distribution equipment"".

Earlier, London's Metropolitan Police said the force's Counter Terrorism Command was leading the investigation into the fire given its impact, but that there was ""currently no indication of foul play"".

Is it a barge? Is it a bridge? It is both. Last summer China began building several unusual vessels at its Guangzhou shipyard on the south coast. The barges had legs that could drop down to stabilise the craft in shallow water, and wielded a 100m-bridge that could extend from the bow and onto a beach. In recent weeks pictures have emerged of these mongrel ships (see photo) and of how they connect together into giant causeways. The fear is that they could one day be used to funnel troops and tanks onto the beaches of Taiwan.

Until recently, Chinese military planners had two options to support an invading force. They could use vehicle ferries to unload troops and tanks at a port. Or they could use “roro” (roll-on, roll-off) ferries to unload amphibious vehicles into the sea. “There was a missing link,” says Tom Shugart, a retired American naval officer. “How are they going to allow these ferries to send non-amphibious vehicles and trucks onto the beach without a port?” A floating causeway, seen on satellite images of Chinese ports in 2021, was one option. But they are cumbersome.

China filed patents for the new barges in 2020, notes Mike Dahm, a former naval intelligence officer. They resemble the “Mulberry harbours” used for the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944, but are more versatile. They can be joined to make one vast bridge allowing larger vessels to disgorge troops and tanks onto the barges further offshore. “I was stunned when I saw these three things put together,” says Mr Shugart. “I had never guessed that's what they were going to do.”

When connected, the barges would seem to allow four roro ferries to dock at the same time. That would mean about 1,200 vehicles and 6,000 people, equivalent to a brigade. Moreover, the vessels unlock the carrying capacity of China's 60-plus vehicle carriers, whose side-ramps could not be used on a causeway or beach. The contraptions are probably too big and vulnerable to mines and artillery to be used in the first stage of any invasion, says Sidharth Kaushal of rusi, a think-tank in London, but would be used to deliver follow-up forces and supplies once China had a beachhead.

Mr Shugart thinks China probably has seven of the new barge-bridges.The good news, he says, is that seven is probably not enough to mount an invasion of Taiwan. The bad news is that China builds ships very fast. A paper published on March 11th by csis, another think-tank, found that a single Chinese state-owned shipbuilder produced a larger tonnage of commercial vessels in 2024 than America has built since the second world war. Mr Shugart does not think dozens of barges would be needed. “I'm confident that in about eight months, they could probably build enough.”

MIAMI — The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it will revoke legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, setting them up for potential deportation in about a month.

The order applies to about 532,000 people from the four countries who came to the United States since October 2022. They arrived with financial sponsors and were given two-year permits to live and work in the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they will lose their legal status on April 24, or 30 days after the publication of the notice in the Federal Register.

The new policy impacts people who are already in the U.S. and who came under the humanitarian parole program. It follows an earlier Trump administration decision to end what it called the ""broad abuse"" of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there's war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

During his campaign President Donald Trump promised to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally, and as president he has been also ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the U.S. and to stay.

DHS said parolees without a lawful basis to stay in the U.S. ""must depart"" before their parole termination date.

""Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status,"" DHS said.

Before the new order, the beneficiaries of the program could stay in the U.S. until their parole expires, although the administration had stopped processing their applications for asylum, visas and other requests that might allow them to remain longer.

The administration decision has already been challenged in federal courts.

A group of American citizens and immigrants sued the Trump administration for ending humanitarian parole and are seeking to reinstate the programs for the four nationalities.

Lawyers and activists raised their voices to denounce the government's decision.

Friday's action is ""going to cause needless chaos and heartbreak for families and communities across the country,"" said Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit at the end of February. She called it ""reckless, cruel and counterproductive.""

The Biden administration allowed up to 30,000 people a month from the four countries to come to the United States for two years with eligibility to work. It persuaded Mexico to take back the same number from those countries because the U.S. could deport few, if any, to their homes.

Cuba generally accepted about one deportation flight a month, while Venezuela and Nicaragua refused to take any. All three are U.S. adversaries.

Haiti accepted many deportation flights, especially after a surge of migrants from the Caribbean country in the small border town of Del Rio, Texas, in 2021. But Haiti has been in constant turmoil, hampering U.S. efforts.

Since late 2022, more than half a million people have come to the U.S. under the policy, also known as CHNV. It was a part of the Biden administration's approach to encourage people to come through new legal channels while cracking down on those who crossed the border illegally.

Washington — Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Congress created the government-funded Radio Free Asia to broadcast facts into countries where governments are afraid of them.  

""The U.S. saw China gunning down its own citizens and then also successfully covering it up afterwards,"" RFA President Bay Fang told CBS News. ""The U.S. Congress created us with an eye to giving these people in China and other authoritarian countries around Asia the ability to have free press, to get access to the truth through an unbiased news service.""

Fang put 75% of RFA staff on leave Friday, the result of funding cuts ordered by Kari Lake, senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent agency of RFA and Voice of America, the nation's largest international broadcaster. 

Last weekend, all full-time employees and contractors with VOA were informed they were being placed on administrative leave, while Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty were notified that federal grants for both broadcasters had been terminated. 

""USAGM and the outlets it oversees will be reduced to their statutory functions and associated personnel will be reduced to the minimum presence and function required by law,"" the agency said in a March 15 statement. 

Lake, a former television broadcaster who ran unsuccessful Republican governor and Senate campaigns in Arizona, had been initially tapped by President Trump to serve as VOA director before taking on the role of senior adviser to USAGM. 

RFA had a full-time staff of about 400 people prior to the layoffs, according to its website. It also had another approximately 500 stringers and contractors. 

At least eight RFA journalists could be forced to leave the U.S. if they lose their work visas. Vietnamese journalist Khoa Lai is one of them and fears the possibility of being deported.

""I believe so, but I hope not,"" Lai said. ""I believe that if I go back, then the government will snatch me right away.""

Five people who worked for RFA are already behind bars overseas. RFA funds their families and their legal defense.

""These are not U.S. citizens, but they are people who are in jail because they worked for a U.S.- funded network,"" Fang said. 

RFA's stated mission is to provide fair, objective and uncensored news and information to Asian nations where there are few, if any, free speech protections.

 ""We're worth saving because we actually bring benefit to the U.S. taxpayer,"" Fang said. ""I think it is in the U.S. national security interest to have something like us. We are actually one of the lowest cost-effective elements of soft power that they could have.""

RFA told CBS News that unless the courts, Congress or a private financier steps in, it only has enough money to continue broadcasting for approximately one more month. On Friday, meanwhile, a group of VOA employees filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking to be reinstated. 

Margaret Brennan is moderator of ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the ""CBS Evening News,"" leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts.

MESSMORE, Pa. – Meteorologists with the National Weather Service say they never know what they'll encounter during a storm survey and while it's not unusual to come across something unexpected, discovering a mysterious creature lurking in the background of one of their photos certainly makes for a memorable experience.

During a recent investigation into damage caused by severe weather, something unusual was spotted beyond a fallen tree - the appearance of what many refer to as ""Bigfoot.""

The sighting occurred in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, an area nestled within the hills and the higher terrain of the Allegheny Mountains, north of West Virginia.

The figure appeared to be human-sized, if not larger, as it walked through the wooded landscape, but, according to an NWS meteorologist, there is no need to worry, as what was spotted was likely something purposely staged to add a bit of fun to people's lives.

Locals said it's rather common for residents to create figures out of iron or other similar materials, either for decoration or to spark curiosity from passersby.

Giant Bug Found At An Arkansas Walmart Identified As A Jurassic-era Insect

While the recent sighting may not have been an actual living creature, there have been historical reports of similar-sized entities in the region.

According to the Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society, in 1977, a family driving along a dark stretch of a nearby roadway spotted a six-foot-tall figure covered in shaggy, reddish-brown hair. When they shined their headlights at it, the creature reportedly disappeared over a 40-foot embankment, never to be seen again.

In 2004, in nearby Greene County, two friends reported seeing a 7-foot-tall creature making cat-like noises during their bike ride, and in 2013, a man reported seeing an 8-foot-tall creature with caveman-like features in the far distance.

According to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, Pennsylvania is often a hotspot for sightings and ranks in the top 10 of states with the most reports.

The earliest reports of Sasquatch sightings date back to at least the 1800s, according to the State of Washington.

Many of these early cases lacked photos or video evidence, so they were often dismissed as misunderstandings or gags.

Advancements in technology have led to numerous modern sightings captured on video or in photos, fueling ongoing debate about the existence of these creatures.

War Trophy From George Washington's Army Discovered Amid British Shipwreck

Despite actually seeing apparitions of a figure, many believe there's more to these encounters than meets the eye.

Studies over the years have pointed to some sightings actually being large bears, while others could be pranks or attempts by people to simply gain attention.

For now, there's no conclusive evidence to prove the existence of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or whatever name you prefer to call it.

So, if you ever find yourself driving along Messmore Road in Fayette County, don't be alarmed if you spot something out of the ordinary - it simply appears to be a lawn decoration meant to capture a passerby's imagination.

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The parents of a U.S. college student who vanished almost two weeks ago in the resort town of Punta Cana have asked authorities to declare her legally dead.

In a letter to Dominican police dated Monday, Subbarayudu and Sreedevi Konanki state that after an extensive search, local authorities believe that Sudiksha, a 20-year-old student at the University of Pittsburgh, drowned.

“Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence,” they wrote. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.”

A police official not authorized to speak about the case confirmed Tuesday that authorities received the letter.

Sudiksha Konanki and five female friends had traveled to the Caribbean nation on March 3 for spring break. Police said she disappeared at a beach by her hotel before dawn on March 6.

Authorities have interviewed people who were with Konanki before she vanished, including Joshua Riibe, a senior at St. Cloud University in Minnesota.

Riibe has been detained by Dominican police and is believed to be the last person to see Konanki. He has not been named as a suspect.

He is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday afternoon following a request from his attorney that he be released.

According to the transcript of an interview with prosecutors, reported by Dominican media as well as NBC and Telemundo, Riibe told police he was drinking with Konanki on the beach and they were kissing in the ocean when they got caught in a current. Riibe said he was a former lifeguard and helped bring her ashore.

He told investigators he vomited upon reaching the beach and that Konanki said she was going to fetch her things. When he looked up, she was gone. He said he was later surprised to hear of her disappearance.

In their letter, the Konankis wrote that “the individual” last seen with their daughter is cooperating and that no evidence of foul play has been found.

Sudiksha Konanki was born in India and later became a U.S. permanent resident.

Canadians travelling to the United States for longer trips are being reminded of new registration rules that will kick in next month.

The Canadian government updated its travel advisory for the U.S. on Friday, notifying travellers planning to head south and stay for more than 30 days that they will be required to register with the U.S. government.

The rule was part of U.S. President Donald Trump's “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” executive order, which was signed on Jan. 20 and applies to anyone who is not an American citizen or permanent resident.

“Canadians and other foreign nationals visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days must be registered with the United States government,” Canada's travel advisory states.

“Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution.”

The rule, which goes into effect April 11, will apply to some Canadians, including “snowbirds” who travel south in winter months, according to immigration lawyer Rosanna Berardi.

Ottawa advises travellers to refer to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website to check if they need to register or not.

“You can verify if you have been automatically registered on entry to the U.S. by looking up your I-94 admission form on the U.S. Customs Border Protection (CBP) website,” the travel advisory states.

In the past, Canadians have been able to visit the U.S. for six months without a visa, though they were required to declare how long they intended to stay upon entry, according to the federal government.

Under the new rule, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says “certain groups of aliens” may not have been registered on entry.

The change comes amid tensions between Canada and the U.S over tariffs imposed on Canadian imports by the Trump administration and Trump's repeated claims that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.

Trump's threats have prompted many Canadians to cancel or change their plans to visit the U.S. amid a growing “Elbows up” movement.

Canada is not the only country updating its travel advice for the U.S.

Earlier this week, the United Kingdom and Germany also updated their advice for travellers following reports of British and German nationals being detained at the border amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration.

President Donald Trump selected the aerospace giant to build the Next-Generation Air Dominance Platform, which he said will be the most lethal aircraft ever built.

Boeing caught a break this week with two pieces of good news that sent its stock up more than 10% over the past five days.

The U.S. Air Force on Friday selected the aerospace giant to build and deliver its next suite of fighter jets, beating out other top aerospace companies, namely Lockheed Martin. The Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Platform is something no other country can match, according to President Donald Trump.

""The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built. An experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation,"" Trump said while announcing the contract along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The program is intended to replace Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor. Lockheed shares fell 5.7% for the week.

""We recognize the importance of designing, building and delivering a sixth-generation fighter capability for the United States Air Force. In preparation for this mission, we made the most significant investment in the history of our defense business, and we are ready to provide the most advanced and innovative NGAD aircraft needed to support the mission,"" said Steve Parker, interim president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security.

Other Boeing jets include the F/A-18, F-15 Eagle, B-52 Stratofortress and a modified version of the 747 that is used as Air Force One.

The contract is welcome news for Boeing, which has been struggling with a federal probe over quality control issues. In January 2024, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9, prompting a domino effect of headwinds, including several whistleblowers who spoke out about manufacturing and safety lapses.

Two months later, CEO Dave Calhoun announced his intent to step down at the end of 2024. He was replaced by Kelly Ortberg in August.

""And then free cash flow, we're seeing less working capital drag. So, that could be better when we close the quarter, and it could be in the hundreds of millions of cash flow better. So, we think we're off to a good start for the year,"" West said during a presentation at the Bank of America Global Industrials Conference. 

""Boeing for this year was always going to be about safety, quality and stability. And, so far, we're off to a pretty good start on all three dimensions.""

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has ruled out ""tax and spend"" policies, signalling that she will neither raise taxes nor government budgets in her critical Spring Statement next week.

Speaking in a BBC documentary, The Making of a Chancellor, Reeves also warned that the government could not afford the kinds of spending increases seen under the last Labour government.

She is expected to make cuts to some government departments on Wednesday. More money has already been allocated to defence by reducing the aid budget.

""We can't tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That's not available in the world we live in today,"" she said.

In her autumn Budget, Reeves increased the levels of tax and public spending significantly – paid for largely through extra taxes on businesses which proved highly controversial.

But she is now under pressure on several fronts. It emerged on Friday that government borrowing – the difference between its spending and its income from taxes – was even higher than expected in February.

The official prediction for that month from the Office for Budget Responsibility was £6.5 billion, but it hit £10.7bn, leaving the chancellor with less fiscal headroom. 

Adding to the Treasury's in-tray, official growth forecasts for the economy are also likely to be cut.

Last week, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving £5bn a year by 2030 and creating a more ""pro-work system"", though ministers have not set out the breakdown of forecast savings.

The changes will affect people claiming disability and health benefits, as well as those aged under 22 relying on top-up payments while on universal credit.

The chancellor will set out the impact of these changes in more detail in her Spring Statement, and is expected to announce further cuts – this time to some Whitehall departments – to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.

The Treasury has reiterated that these rules – to not borrow for funding day-to-day public spending and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economy by 2029-30 - are ""non-negotiable"" .

""What I've done so far is put money into public services,"" Reeves insisted in her BBC interview.

She said there was ""real growth"" in spending for each of the next few years ""but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly"".

But Labour grandee Lord Blunkett wants Reeves to ""loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules"", calling them ""Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst"".

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster on Saturday, the former work and pensions secretary under Tony Blair said he would ""raise the self-imposed rule by at least £10-15bn"" to help fund ""a new deal for the unemployed, getting half a million of those young people who are out of work and training into a job or a training programme"".

Reeves spoke to me earlier this week amid unease among Labour MPs at the welfare changes.

In the interview, she opened up on how the job is going so far following a number of controversies not only over her decisions, but also over the accuracy of parts of her CV.

Asked whether she had been treated fairly, and in the same way as her male predecessors, Reeves told me: ""I think that would be up to others to judge and people to judge over time.

""I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers' money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job.

""One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that's not the sort of politics that I do.""

Responding to Reeves' comments on the economy, shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: ""The Labour chancellor promised 'growth, growth, growth' but since the Budget, growth is down, inflation is up, and business confidence has collapsed.

""Labour are having to come forward with an emergency Budget on Wednesday - a situation entirely of their own making.

""Rachel Reeves must urgently rethink her anti-business Budget.""

The latest figures for the UK economy add pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Spring Statement next week.

Borrowing costs had been widely expected to be left unchanged with inflation, predicted to go up in the coming months.

Interest rates, set by the Bank of England, affect mortgage, loan and savings rates for millions.

The rate at which prices are rising remains above the Bank of England's 2% inflation target.

The government has set out plans to save billions of pounds from the welfare bill - how have previous attempts to do this fared?

      When Schumpeter recently visited New York, it was at its springtime best. There were cherry blossoms in Central Park, birdsong in the bushes, and—to drown out any false sense of serenity—the usual cacophony of car horns and jackhammers in the streets. Whoosh up in elevators to the salons of Wall Street's gilded elite, and it only gets better. The views are breathtaking, the preferences revealing—CDs lining the shelves of one legal beagle, a handkerchief in the top pocket of another. Yet if you thought such veterans had seen it all, think again. “It's a shitload more complicated than it's ever been,"" says the boss of one bank.


     
      The hierarchy of concerns changes depending on whom you talk to. But the components are the same. An interest-rate shock not seen for more than a generation. The difficulty of doing deals when money is no longer cheap. A maverick approach to antitrust from the sheriffs in Washington, DC. The rhetorical—if not yet real—decoupling between America and China, which business is afraid to speak out against, however much it stands to lose.


     
      So it was serendipitous that one of the New York companies your columnist visited was Pfizer, at its new headquarters in Hudson Yards. The pharma giant, worth $220bn, is rare among American firms in shrugging off many of the sources of uncertainty. Its covid-related partnership with BioNTech, a German vaccine developer, has given it a strong enough balance-sheet to take higher interest rates in its stride. It is a dealmaking machine, uncowed by the trustbusters. And it remains proud of its business in China. It may be sticking its neck out. But if that helps stick a needle into the skittish rump of corporate America, all the better.


     
      You can tell Pfizer is flush with cash by visiting its new digs. The main meeting room is a futuristic “purpose circle"". The shimmering executive suites look like they belong on the starship Enterprise. A spiffy newish double-helix logo emphasises its devotion to science. The first topic of conversation is mergers and acquisitions. In little over a year it has splashed out $70bn. That includes the $43bn takeover of Seagen, a maker of cancer medicines, announced in March. It is the biggest pharma deal since 2019.


     
      Pfizer can do M&A because unlike most firms, it is not paralysed by the short-term economic outlook. Instead it is galvanised by the certainty that its covid-related bonanza is tapering off. Though sales of pandemic-related vaccines and antivirals beat Wall Street's expectations in its first-quarter results on May 2nd, they still contributed to a 26% drop in overall revenues compared with the same period in 2022—and will fall further this year. It also faces a looming patent cliff from 2025 onwards, affecting non-covid blockbusters such as Eliquis, an anticoagulant, and Ibrance and Xtandi, two cancer drugs. To offset both of these forces, Pfizer is buying and developing a pipeline of new drugs that it hopes will boost revenues by $30bn in 2030. Like the rest of big pharma, it benefits from the fact that smaller, cash-strapped biotech firms are struggling in the high-interest-rate environment. That makes them relatively receptive to takeovers.


     
      In doing such deals, Pfizer is unintimidated by the trustbusters, who are having a chilling effect on dealmaking in other industries. Jeff Haxer of Bain & Company, a consultancy, notes that America's Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice are likelier to sue to stop deals taking place than tackle M&A-related competition concerns through remedies such as divestments. So far they have failed to block many transactions, but the timeline for doing deals has lengthened. That affects the cost of financing for the buyer, and raises risks that the seller could be left stranded. Pfizer has taken steps to head off the trustbusters, such as playing down cost-cutting (ie, job-threatening) “synergies"", and playing up its commitment to cancer innovation. It insists the Seagen acquisition will close by early 2024.


     
      Unlike many other American firms, Pfizer also remains unusually bullish about its business in China. It employs 7,000 people in the country, which helped bolster covid-related revenues in the first quarter. Its CEO, Albert Bourla, was one of a few bosses of well-known American firms to attend the China Development Forum in Beijing in March (Apple's Tim Cook was another). Reuters reported that last month Pfizer signed an agreement with Sinopharm, a Chinese drugmaker, to market a dozen innovative drugs in China. It may make sense for a company with a promising business there to double down on its operations. But in a tense geopolitical climate in which many American businessmen fear a backlash if they raise their voices in defence of the trade relationship, it is bold nonetheless.


     
      So far Wall Street has given Pfizer little credit for its purposefulness. Its share price has fallen by almost a quarter this year. Critics argue that it may be overpaying for Seagen, and that the acquired drugs may not generate enough revenues to move the needle at Pfizer. They worry that pressures on drug pricing in America may end up destroying some of the economic rationale for its acquisitions. Pfizer still has its work cut out convincing investors its post-covid future is a bright one. As Mr Bourla put it: “It's not enough to save the world. We need to increase the stock price.""


Seeing the vial as half-fullOther industries might argue that big pharma, with some of the juiciest margins outside the tech industry, is unrepresentative of corporate America, and offers few lessons in how to cope with the current wave of uncertainty. Yet it is worth remembering that it is often in the depths of M&A squeamishness that companies with strong balance-sheets strike the best deals. An investment banker notes that in 2009, during the global financial crisis, Pfizer paid $68bn for Wyeth, a vaccine-maker, despite misgivings on Wall Street. As luck would have it, more than a decade later that underappreciated business helped Pfizer rescue the world during the covid crisis. It can pay to be bold—even in mysterious ways.

Christus Good Shepherd Health System's new mobile mammography unit is designed to increase accessibility to mammograms, particularly in rural East Texas.

“This unit will be a game changer for our health care outreach and how we can serve our more rural communities,” said Amy Dorsey, radiology supervisor for Christus Good Shepherd Health System. “We are now able to offer the same technology that we have at our comprehensive breast center in Longview.”

The approximately $1 million unit replaces the hospital system's older unit. The new coach uses upgraded, 3D technology and ""advanced artificial intelligence software to provide the highest quality images available while emphasizing patient comfort and compassion in mind,"" the hospital reported.

Funding was provided by the hospital system's Lyrics & Legends event in April 2024 and by community donations to the Christus Good Shepherd Foundation.

The boutique Miss Behavin' is now open in the Murray Center at 2318 Judson Road in Longview.

Janet Griffin and her business partner, Lacy Horn, offer ladies clothing, including shoes, jeans, dresses and tops as well as some gift items, jewelry and hats and caps. 

Horn also owns a boutique in Mount Pleasant, and Griffin said she has long wanted to own a boutique as well. She also works full-time as a respiratory therapist, but wanted to open the store now. The store will give her something to do when she retires at a later date. Her husband, Ken ""Boomer"" Beard, is already retired and helping her out at the store.

Miss Behavin' is open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday-Friday and 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday.

Longview-based Thomas Oilfield Services has launched a new division, Thomas Supply, which offers equipment and hardware from the company's inventory for rental or purchase.

cloud-based business purchasing and AP automation platform.

The new division is built on an ""intelligent procure-to-pay platform,"" according to Vroozi, which is a cloud-based purchasing and accounts payable automation platform company.

The new ""direct materials procurement innovation creates a new revenue stream while reducing supply chain risk,"" the company reported. Vroozi is based in Los Angeles.

""The initiative represents a major advance in direct materials procurement and inventory management within the oil and gas industry,"" Vroozi reported. The Vroozi system monitors inventory levels and ""triggers purchase requests when supplies run low, while managing all associated data and transactions.""

Vroozi reported that the new system helped Thomas Oilfield's financial turnaround following a significant business downturn. Those difficulties led Thomas Oilfield to create additional revenue streams through the rental and sale of inventory items. The automation has eliminated manual processes typically required for direct materials procurement.

Christi Allen, a longtime local personal chef, has launched a new business serving a different group of clients.

Christi Allen

""It's still very brand new,"" Allen said of her home-based business, Happy Tails Dog Treats.

Allen will be selling her treats today  at the annual Strut your Mutt 1 Mile Wag Walk, a fundraiser benefitting the Longview Animal Care and Adoption Center. Registration starts at 9:30 a.m. at 303 H.G. Mosley Parkway, with a registration fee of $30. The walk kicks off at 10 a.m. 

""I love animals. I love dogs,"" Allen said. She has two herself, Finnegan, a lab, and Farrah, a ""mutt.""

She researched to find the best ingredients for dogs, and her treats have ""limited ingredients."" Allen uses oat flour instead of wheat, with other ingredients that include peanut butter, bananas, carob and oats, depending on the different flavor varieties. She also offers pupcakes — a cupcake treat — and birthday cakes.

CINCINNATI — More than a dozen small businesses across Cincinnati are receiving grants to help grow and overcome any obstacles they may face.

Each business will receive $20,000 from the City of Cincinnati's Commercial Tenant Improvement Program (CTIP) through the Department of Community and Economic Development.

“Helping to kind of create a more vibrant community and strengthening our regional economy would be the goal of our Commercial Tenant Improvement Program and relieving the barriers of really high construction and material cost that are being, you know, being realized right now by our small businesses,” said Gerald Fortson, senior community development officer for the city's Department of Community and Economic Development.

The grants are available to businesses that have been in business for at least one year within the city or are looking to relocate to the city.

This is the second round of CTIP grants the city has given out. In 2024, they provided grants to 11 local businesses.

One of the businesses receiving $20,000 is Selfie Cincy, located right downtown.

“We have a lot of different experiences all within this space,” said Amari Samya, CEO and owner of Selfie Cincy.

WATCH: Local business owners break down how these grants will help 

Selfie Cincy has nine different interactive rooms where customers can take all the photos and videos they want. With the grant money, Samya said they plan on moving to a new space with double the square footage of their current building.

“We'll be expanding to upwards of 15, which is like a big jump, and we'll be able to curate a space that is also meeting the need and demand of event space,” Samya said.

Renika Smiley and her business, Lusheous Collection, also received a $20,000 grant. They will be using the money to turn an old barber shop in College Hill into her dream boutique specializing in women's plus-size clothing.

“With me being a plus-sized woman, and me knowing how hard it is out there for us, I wanted to make sure that we have something of our own,” Smiley said. 

The new Lusheous Collection building will have a boutique in the front, and suites for other beauty-centered small businesses for rent in the back. 

“So we'll have more revenue come in and we'll be able to highlight other business owners and grow within College Hill,” Smiley said.

We asked both Samya and Smiley what it meant as small business owners to have opportunities like this grant to grow their business.

“A blessing, a huge huge blessing,” Smiley said. “It gives you a lot of confidence.”

“The grant opportunities, the city support, the support of the City of Cincinnati is very important to us cause it allows us to keep our footing and grow,” said Samya.

Bitcoin traders have been sitting on the sidelines in recent weeks as they wait for an update on U.S. president Donald Trump's bitcoin plans (while they scramble to defend against a new, mystery crypto wallet threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has flat-lined through March, stuck at around $85,000 per bitcoin, despite a huge, prescient bitcoin price prediction setting the market alight.

Now, as the Federal Reserve could be gearing up to open the “floodgates,” a senior White House official has revealed the U.S. could use its gold reserves to buy bitcoin.

“If we actually realize the gains on [the U.S. gold holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more bitcoin,” Bo Hines, White House executive director of the president's council of advisers on digital assets, said in an interview with the Crypto in America podcast, adding there's been “countless ideas” and the ""best ideas” will be enacted by Trump.

""I'll actually point you to senator [Cynthia] Lummis' Bitcoin Act of 2025, in which she believes that we can identify the real true value of some of these gold certificates,” Hines said.

Lummis reintroduced her Bitcoin Act this year, proposing the U.S. buy 1 million bitcoin, around 5% of the total bitcoin supply, over five years through the sale of Fed gold certificates.

Earlier this week, speaking during a bitcoin and crypto conference, Hines said the U.S. wants ""as much [bitcoin] as we can get.”

“It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what president Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines said, referring to Trump's executive order that prevents the sale of bitcoin and crypto that U.S. has seized.

Trump also addressed the conference, promising in a pre-recorded message that he will make the U.S. “the undisputed bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world … Pioneers like you will be able to improve our banking and payment system and promote greater privacy, safety, security and wealth for American consumers and businesses alike,"" Trump said. ""You will unleash an explosion of economic growth.""

Trump's comments, piling praise on bitcoin and crypto technology, companies and investors, have reassured the market that he remains committed to crypto.

“Bitcoin is rewriting the rules of wealth creation and economic freedom for all—a truth president Trump recognized at the Digital Assets Summit by vowing to make the U.S. a ‘bitcoin superpower,'” Cory Klippsten, the chief executive of bitcoin-only app Swan Bitcoin, said via email.

“Nation-state adoption is inevitable, but the real revolution lies in empowering individuals to shape a more fair and prosperous future.”

The recent bitcoin price stagnation has been blame on macro economic factors, though many crypto market watchers remain confident the down turn is a temporary correction rather than the beginning of a long-term trend.

“The bitcoin bearish price action is being driven by exogenous factors like trade wars, uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies as well as geopolitics. The world is going through major structural changes, and we believe both bitcoin and gold will outperform other asset classes in the coming months,” Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at Switzerland-based hedge fund Tyr Capital, said in emailed comments.

""Zooming out bitcoin is still performing relatively well and will most probably be well supported around the $75,000 level. We still expect to see new record highs above $125,000 in 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

TUCSON, Ariz. (13 News) - Cryptocurrency scams are on the rise in Pima County.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department said con artists from other countries are using Bitcoin ATMs to carry out their scheme and are targeting the elderly.

“We're seeing these government impersonation scams essentially daily at this point,” said PCSD Financial Crimes Detective Michael Wilson.

Wilson said the fraud unit is seeing an increase in international scammers calling the elderly and pretending to be PCSD.

“They will say ‘Hey you unfortunately didn't show up for jury duty and as a result, you have a warrant for your arrest. The best way to prevent you from going to jail is to just pay the bond in advance,‘” Wilson said. “They will give some reasoning for why they need you to pay this in cryptocurrency.”

The scammer on the other line will then coerce the victim into making large cash withdrawals and depositing the funds into a Bitcoin ATM which are often found inside convenience stores. These machines convert the cash into cryptocurrency.

“Once it's in there the money moves from account, to account, to account, in extremely rapid speed and as a result it becomes very difficult to locate after that,” Wilson said.

He said these scammers purposely target the elderly.

“They have a steady income and unfortunately they are a little more trusting,” he said.

Victims have lost thousands of dollars — in a single visit.

Because these scammers are depositing the funds in accounts in other countries Wilson said getting the money back can be difficult. He said they try their best to recover the stolen money before it reaches these overseas entities, but that's not always possible.

“We've had a lot of success, we continue to make progress in these types of scams, but as the technology grows it's becoming increasingly difficult,” he said.

The PCSD has put warning signs on some of these Bitcoin ATMs to try to warn people before they make a mistake.

“Having these alerts right in a place they can see right where they're making those deposits can sometimes be the difference between them losing money and them safeguarding themselves and just hanging up the call,” Wilson said.

These scams are always evolving. If you get a suspicious phone call or text, call 9-1-1 or contact the PCSD's fraud unit at (520) 351-3000 or at fraud@sheriff.pima.gov.

Oops, something went wrong

Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) Reserve and the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The former will hold Bitcoin -- no surprises there. The latter will hold four more of the largest cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA).

The fact that the U.S. is stockpiling crypto is exciting news for crypto investors. But are these good cryptocurrency investments? Let's take a closer look at each one.

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and has also been the most successful. At the time of writing, its market cap is $1.7 trillion, larger than that of every other cryptocurrency combined. Over the last three years (as of March 19), Bitcoin's price has increased by 98%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 27% return.

While Bitcoin was intended as a decentralized digital currency, transactions are too slow and expensive for it to work as a payment method. Processing times generally range from 10 minutes to over an hour, depending on network congestion, and fees are around $1 per transaction.

Despite that, Bitcoin has caught on as a digital store of value, or ""digital gold."" The supply is capped at 21 million Bitcoin, adding an element of scarcity to it. If you're looking for a way to hedge against inflation or add cryptocurrency to your portfolio, Bitcoin is worth considering.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it became popular through introducing smart contracts. A smart contract is a program built into a cryptocurrency's blockchain network to record transactions.

Developers can use smart contracts to launch decentralized apps (dApps). This gives Ethereum a wide range of uses, including decentralized finance (DeFi) services, such as crypto lending platforms, blockchain gaming, and launching new crypto tokens.

Because Ethereum was the first to offer smart contracts, it has a large lead in terms of market share. According to DefiLlama, Ethereum currently has $46 billion in total value locked into its DeFi applications, the most of any blockchain.

On a negative note, Ethereum's performance lags behind other smart contract blockchains. The average transaction fee is $0.19 as of March 19, compared to $0.00025 for rival Solana. Ethereum has also lost 34% of its value over the last three years. You're better off avoiding Ethereum until it proves that it can reverse this downward trend.

XRP is the native cryptocurrency for Ripple, a blockchain designed as a cross-border payment solution. The current system of choice for international payments, the ​​Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), can take three to five days for international banking transfers. Fees generally cost $15 to $50, depending on the banks involved.

On the Ripple blockchain, transactions process within four to five seconds for a fee of 0.00001 XRP, a fraction of a cent. In addition to being used for its minimal transaction fees, XRP is also a bridge currency used to facilitate international transfers.

With a real-world use case, XRP is one of the stronger crypto investments currently available. Over the last three years, it has topped every other cryptocurrency on this list with its 187% return. Its biggest headwind since 2020 has been a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but on March 19, RippleLabs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had dropped the lawsuit.

Solana is a competitor to Ethereum, as it also provides developers with a platform to launch dApps. The difference is Solana's unique proof-of-history system for validating transactions, which makes it a far more efficient blockchain.

As mentioned above, the average transaction fee on Solana is just $0.00025. It processes over 4,000 transactions per second (tps). In comparison, Ethereum processes about 17 tps, because it hasn't developed a fast method to validate transactions like Solana has.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Solana is a high-risk, volatile investment. But it's up 39% over the last three years, and its speed and low costs should continue attracting developers to the Solana ecosystem.

Cardano is another Ethereum competitor that supports smart contracts and allows for the development of dApps. It helped popularize the proof-of-stake system, where people who own a cryptocurrency can pledge their tokens to be part of the transaction validation process and earn rewards. The proof-of-stake system has minimal energy requirements, and even Ethereum adopted it in 2022.

One of the unique things about Cardano is the developers' dedication to using peer review and evidence-based research. This hasn't always been to its benefit, though. Cardano's development has been notoriously slow. For example, it didn't introduce smart contracts until 2021.

Cardano's price has decreased by 18% in the last three years. As with Ethereum, it's best to see if Cardano can build any forward momentum before committing your money to it.

Just because the U.S. government will be stocking up on these five cryptocurrencies doesn't mean you should invest in all of them. Cryptocurrency is a risky, unproven asset class. Two of the cryptos on this list, Ethereum and Cardano, have lost value over the last three years. Even though the others have done well, they're still highly volatile.

As far as crypto investments go, Bitcoin is the safest option, relatively speaking. It's the most well-known cryptocurrency, and it has been the largest since the very beginning. If you're looking for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, XRP and Solana are two standout projects. With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, you could have a solid crypto portfolio that covers multiple use cases.

No matter which cryptos you choose, be careful about your asset allocation. Because of the risk involved, cryptocurrency shouldn't be more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio. Use the rest to invest in stocks, bonds, and other stable assets.

Mokena Village Hall on Monday, Oct. 8, 2018, in Mokena (Alex Ortiz)

A Mokena resident won back more than $100,000 that was lost in an overseas cryptocurrency scam thanks to a Mokena police detective and Will County prosecutors.

The investigation of the scam began Sept. 11, 2024, when a Mokena resident reported losing more than $150,000 from an online scam involving cryptocurrency, according to a statement from the Mokena Police Department.

“The victim advised that in July of 2024, they responded to an online job ad presented as a commission-based, remote work opportunity aimed at optimizing app developers,” police said.

The victim was directed to set up a cryptocurrency exchange account and transferred funds “across the accounts as directed” by fraudsters for the next few months, police said.

The investigation revealed a “portion of the funds” were held on a cryptocurrency wallet controlled by a person with a Nigerian passport and using an internet protocol address out of Cambodia, police said.

The financial institution hosting the cryptocurrency wallet had more than $101,000, police said.

Police investigators and prosecutors worked to freeze and seize the funds so they could be returned to the victim, police said.

Mokena Police Chief Brian Benton thanked the work of Mokena Police Detective Darin McVicker, who worked “vigorously to locate the lost money and to seek out those responsible for committing this fraud.”

Benton also thanked Assistant State's Attorneys Mike Casson and Dant Faulk for their assistance in the investigation.

“While it is unfortunate that we were unable to arrest those responsible for committing these crimes, we are glad we were able to return a significant amount of the lost money,” Benton said.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has charted a diametrically opposite trajectory when compared to its older sibling, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), over the past year.

Consider this. Bitcoin has jumped 32% in a year, reaching an all-time high of $109,000. Its share in the overall cryptocurrency market has expanded from 52% to 60%.

Ethereum, on the other hand, contracted 39% during the same time, reducing its market share from 16% to 8%.

The widening gap has sparked discussions about Ethereum's role in the cryptocurrency hierarchy and its future course Benzinga spoke to a few analysts to understand the factors contributing to the ecosystem's ongoing downturn.

Jeffrey Hu, Head of Investment Research at digital asset manager HashKey Capital, believed the fault lies in Ethereum's economic model.

""The activation of EIP-1559 allows more Ether to be burned for deflation when Ether activity is high on Ethereum; however, in order to further support on-chain applications, Ethereum must scale,"" Hu stated.

The Ethereum London Hard fork, dubbed EIP-1559, introduced a token burn mechanism for the network. Under this mechanism, the base fee, i.e., the minimum fee per transaction, is removed to add deflationary pressure to ETH and boost its value.

So, what exactly is the problem?

Hu asserted that the rise of  Layer-2 blockchains and the Dencun Upgrade, which slashed fees on L2s by orders of magnitude, diverted on-chain activity away from the base Ethereum chain, resulting in inflation.

According to Ultrasound Money, ETH's deflation rate started slowing down in May 2024, and since early February, the coin's supply has been net increasing.

Trever Koverko, Web3 investor and co-founder of Sapien, echoed these observations.

""Ethereum is struggling to establish a narrative around how L2's are accretive and not extractive to the main chain,"" he added.

However, L2s were not the only competition that Ethereum encountered.

""Ethereum is also not doing well in terms of community culture. In contrast, Solana clearly places more emphasis on meme coin community culture, which has attracted more application development and on-chain transactions,"" Hu said.

Over the past year, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) has indeed become a meme coin hotspot, helped by its user-friendly meme coin generator Pump.fun. In fact,  President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump also chose Solana to launch their Official Trump (CRYPTO: TRUMP) and Official Melania (CRYPTO: MELANIA) coins, respectively.

It's worth remembering that Ethereum remains the only cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin to have its spot exchange-traded fund on Wall Street, however, inflows have been relatively subdued.

Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ Global, stated this is due to a lack of a clear consensus on Ethereum's narrative.

“Lacking a pure store-of-value proposition and often perceived as the ""middle child"" of the crypto ecosystem, Ethereum struggles to capture the same institutional confidence,” Maradiya argued.

He also noted that the absence of staking rewards has made Ethereum ETFs less appealing, which may be remedied given that fresh applications have been filed to allow them.

A spokesperson for the Ethereum Foundation—a non-profit dedicated to promoting and developing Ethereum-related technologies—declined to comment on ETH's shrinking market share but said that their focus remained on ecosystem development and research.

(Bloomberg) -- Rug pulls. Sniping. Trading “cabals.” The niche world of memecoins on the Solana blockchain is rife with danger for those unfamiliar with the machinations that cause token prices to suddenly surge and then crash.

While the memecoin craze centered on the upstart network initially appeared organic during its onset two years ago, its rapid growth – fueled most recently by high-profile newcomers including Donald and Melania Trump, as well as Argentine President Javier Milei – has given rise to a web of covert participants who control a large slice of the now multibillion-dollar corner of the cryptocurrency market. This has made the sector feel like an insider marketplace to many in the industry, with those in the know securing the most lucrative trades and retail investors often bearing the brunt of losses.

The first memecoins were issued just a few years after the birth of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, with developers riffing on popular internet memes as a joke. The breakout memecoin on Solana was Bonk Inu, created after the collapse of the FTX exchange. It was an immediate hit in late 2023 as speculators sought to turn a quick profit on the essentially useless but popular dog-themed token, as Solana emerged from under the cloud that Sam Bankman-Fried's downfall cast over crypto.

When launching a memecoin today, chances are that it will be on the Solana blockchain, which was touted as being faster and cheaper than the groundbreaking Ethereum network. In reality, Solana has became the preferred choice for everything from the Trump memecoins to the Libra token endorsed by Milei that triggered political controversy, because of the interlocking network of participants behind the creation, launch and sale of the cryptocurrencies, according to market participants who see it as repeat of earlier crypto cycles.

“Memecoin launches were being promoted as an antithesis to the ‘utility' coins where VC insiders were able to invest at 100 times lower valuations and sell to retail after launch,” said Jordi Alexander, founder of digital-asset trading firm Selini Capital, which makes markets for tokens including memecoins. “In truth, memecoin launches often have as much — if not more — of an insider advantage.”

The risks to those who get in late are easy to see in the memecoin market. The Trump memecoin jumped to a high of almost $74 the day before his inauguration and has since shed about 85% of its value, according to prices on CoinMarketCap. The Melania token is down about $95% from its high. Amid all the high-profile losses, the Solana blockchain's native token SOL has lost more than half its value since the middle of January.

The most visible participants in the memecoin market are those referred to as key opinion leaders, or KOLs, who are often social-media influencers with huge followings on platforms like X. They are key for gaining recognition amid the sea of hundreds of memecoins being launched daily after platforms like Pump.Fun lowered the technical bar to the create tokens.

KOLs often get to invest in tokens at deep discounts before a project launch in exchange for promoting them to their followers. While memecoins often claim to embrace a “fair launch” model – where all tokens are made available to the public simultaneously – this is rarely the case, according to Mohamed Ezeldin, head of tokenomics at Animoca Brands.

‘Pump and Dump'

Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who recently embraced memecoin trading, said in an X space on Feb. 16 that he was invited to support the launch of Libra, which included doing an interview with Milei. Portnoy said he was offered Libra coins before the launch in exchange for his support, but said he did not take any coins. Portnoy didn't respond to a request for comment.

Influencers often connect with creators through what crypto traders call “cabals,” which are groups specializing in launching memecoins. Hayden Davis' Kelsier Ventures, responsible for the launch of Libra, belongs in this category. These groups often are deeply involved in creating and allegedly manipulating prices of various memecoins to exploit retail investors, according to Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities in London.

“There were various market makers who were doing similar things in 2021 — dark pool liquidity,” said Edwards. “They would help these tokens launch and it would be a pump-and-dump every single time.”

Few outsiders knew of Davis until he disclosed his involvement in Libra during an interview with a YouTube journalist known as Coffeezilla. He also claimed to be involved with Melania and Enron memecoins. Other cabals such as the Fantom Troupe and LA Vape Cabal are mostly pseudonymous. Davis didn't respond to a request for comment.

One of the techniques that's used by the cabals is called sniping, which is when trading bots are used to buy tokens during a launch and then sell them quickly to capture the normally short-lived price gains. Snipers gained notoriety during the Trump memecoin launch, when certain digital wallets acquired tokens at negligible costs before dumping them shortly after the launch, causing the price to crash. One wallet that acquired the memecoin at launch had been pre-funded just hours before Trump announced its debut on Truth Social, Bloomberg reported previously.

In a leaked audio of a conversation between Moty Povolotski, co-founder of the crypto project DeFiTuna, and Ben Chow, the co-founder of Solana-based decentralized exchange Meteora, Povolotski said he saw Davis and his family sniping Enron. Povolotski told Bloomberg that the audio was real. Chow did not respond to requests for comment.

While Pump.fun is the most popular platform for launching and trading memecoins, Meteora has risen in prominence. Trump, Melania and Libra were all launched through Meteora. Meteora is part of Jupiter, a broader Solana ecosystem that aggregates token trading. Jupiter also owns Moonshot, an app enabling users to buy and sell memecoins via credit cards or Apple Pay. Not long after Libra's collapse, Meteora's Chow, who said on the leaked audio that he connected Kelsier Ventures with the Melania token's team, stepped down.

“With the rise of platforms like Pump.fun, what it's really allowed people to do is zoom in on those who are only focused on ROI and not focused on fundamentals or utility,” said Animoca Brands' Ezeldin, referring to return on investment. “They're just focused on ‘how can I get in as early as possible and how can I exit as close to the top?' In doing so, we've created a zero-sum game.”

‘Fearsome Declines'

Still, the controversy doesn't seem to be clouding the outlook for memecoins. At the end of February, US Securities and Exchange Commission staff stated that memecoins are not considered securities. The SEC staff compared memecoins to collectibles, noting they have limited or no use or functionality and are often accompanied by statements about their risks and lack of utility. As a result, people who offer and sell memecoins do not need to register with the agency, and buyers are not protected by federal securities laws.

“The message is loud and clear from the regulators,” Ark Investment Management Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “There will be some fearsome declines in the prices of some of these meme assets. And, you know, there's nothing like losing money for the people to learn.”

 BTCfi is set to surge. Bitcoin DeFi cannot be ignored. Sidechains will bring new use cases and opportunities without compromising the base layer's integrity. 

Opinion by: Brendon Sedo, Core DAO initial contributor

Bitcoin is outgrowing the “digital gold” narrative. The primary driver of this shift is the rise of Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi), which looks beyond the mere store-of-value use cases. 

In 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) became a natively yield-generating asset and the centerpiece of Ethereum-style decentralized finance ecosystems. 2025 is when that kindling can grow its flame on innovative Bitcoin sidechains. 

Most past attempts to tap Bitcoin's value as a productive asset required significant changes to its base layer. That's a big reason they failed. The Bitcoin layer 1 is not designed for much change, leaving most Bitcoiners to merely hodl and not do much else. The result is that Bitcoin remained underutilized as a network and an asset.

Bitcoin sidechains have emerged as the perfect solution to all these problems, scaling Bitcoin's utility without altering or being limited by the base layer. Naturally, these protocols will be the most potent catalyst for BTCfi's growth, especially with BTC surpassing $100,000, constituting over 60% of the total crypto market share, and entering a new regulatory landscape with the first “pro-crypto” US government regime.

Per Hal Finney, “Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction […] included in the blockchain.” That's why there's a need for a secondary level of payment' in his view. 

For a long time, the blockchain space ignored Finney's call to action and prioritized innovation that isolated Bitcoin. However, innovations previously limited to chains like Ethereum are now crossing over to the world of Bitcoin. Sidechains, rollups and other scaling solutions offer more options for holders who want Ethereum-style utility while remaining aligned with Bitcoin. This prepared the ground for BTCfi, where holders can access a range of income-generating solutions like staking, lending and derivatives. 

The industry is, however, still in the early innings of this revolution in Bitcoin. As of November 2024, merely 0.8% of its circulating supply is utilized for DeFi use cases, according to Galaxy Digital. Out of Bitcoin's roughly $2 trillion market cap, less than $7 billion comprises BTCfi TVL.

While this may appear unencouraging, it highlights the massive remaining opportunity. Bitcoin L2 infrastructure scaled 7x from 2021 to November 2024. 

Recent: Bitcoin DeFi TVL up 2,000% amid bumper 2024 for BTC price, adoption

More importantly, it has accounted for a sizable share of new liquidity flowing into BTC, besides institutional products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 

Even if the supply of Bitcoin in BTCfi platforms and sidechains grows by 0.25% annually, the sector will have a total addressable market of $44 billion to $47 billion by 2030, according to Galaxy Digital. However, as Bitcoiners know, this is a conservative estimate and would be accelerated by accelerating BTC price action or even more Bitcoin DeFi adoption. 

VCs, for one, have started to recognize the potential of Bitcoin sidechains, investing over $447 million already, according to Galaxy Digital. Of this, about $174 million was invested in Q3 2024, setting the stage for more explosive growth in 2025. More funding for early-stage projects will ensure more successful launches, innovations, choices for users, and overall value. 

As Bitcoin-native solutions provide access to productive use cases for Bitcoin, users will no longer need to rely on trusted intermediaries and Bitcoin-agnostic smart contract platforms. Sacrifices that were necessary to expand the utility of Bitcoin in the past will no longer be required. That can unlock substantial value for principled BTC holders and even the Bitcoin network itself. 

So far, bridging to Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains has been a go-to way to facilitate yields and other financial use cases on Bitcoin. For example, the wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) market on Ethereum is more than $10 billion. While solutions like WBTC have been suitable for some, many Bitcoin holders prefer not to entrust custodians with their capital or rely on chains like Ethereum, which do not align with Bitcoin's consensus principles or support the network at all. 

BTCfi, defined by Bitcoin-aligned and Bitcoin-powered infrastructure, is a solution from which both WBTC users and Bitcoin purists can benefit. Users who are already accustomed to Ethereum's smart contract sophistication can continue to enjoy that EVM experience while also growing closer to Bitcoin's roots. Principled Bitcoin users can get more options for their BTC's utility if the sidechain aligns with the base network. 

Bitcoin holders also gain access to BTC derivatives superior to Ethereum-native solutions like WBTC. Yield-bearing BTC derivatives on Bitcoin-aligned sidechains are a 100x improvement, offering self-custody and previously unavailable yield sources to Bitcoin holders. 

Overall, BTCfi can be much more significant. Not just compared to where it is now, but also vis-a-vis EVM and SVM-based DeFi. Bitcoin sidechains are already driving this shift, and will continue to do so throughout 2025. All that is needed is the right approach and consistency regarding development and product pipelines.

For BTCfi, the path is clear: Deliver use cases with product-market fit to Bitcoin holders on Bitcoin-powered platforms. This will lay the foundation for generating even more value for the Bitcoin community as a whole. And ultimately, there will be a positive flywheel of Bitcoin adoption. 

The institutional side led headlines in 2024. Now, it's time for the native, onchain camp to show its strength and deliver.

According to Cas Abbé, when considering purchasing cryptocurrencies, traders should focus on projects with robust technology, well-structured tokenomics, and verified founders. Strong technological foundations can facilitate mass adoption, while balanced tokenomics with non-aggressive vesting schedules prevent large token dumps, maintaining price stability. Additionally, projects with doxxed and trustworthy founders increase investor confidence. (Source: Twitter @cas_abbe)

Cryptocurrency and blockchain continue to captivate with promises to revolutionize finance, culture, and now philanthropy. In 2024, digital currency donations surpassed $1 billion, as reported by The Giving Block, fueled by a booming crypto market and clearer regulations. However, the true significance lies not just in the figure but in what this phenomenon reveals about our societal values. 

Crypto philanthropy reflects our trust in technology, our skepticism towards traditional institutions, and our evolving understanding of generosity. Does this trend herald progress or illuminate deeper societal currents?

Blockchain's allure in charitable giving lies in its transparency. Traditional philanthropy often leaves donors uncertain about the fate of their contributions, undermined by opaque processes. A public, immutable ledger, exemplified by initiatives like GiveTrack, offers reassurance. In 2024, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) collectively accounted for 90% of crypto donations, allowing donors to trace every transaction, as reported by The Giving Block. This is less about cost-effectiveness than about certainty—a means to restore confidence in an era wary of intermediaries.

The wealth generated by cryptocurrency further enhances its appeal. Market volatility has attracted benefactors eager to share their gains. Vitalik Buterin's $1 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) donation to India's COVID-19 relief effort in 2021 and the Pineapple Fund's distribution of 5,057 BTC, valued at $86 million in 2017, to various causes exemplify this trend. The $1 billion milestone in 2024 underscores this momentum. Such acts resonate not only as acts of generosity but also as demonstrations of technology's potential to convert digital success into tangible good, a narrative that captivates our imagination.

While crypto philanthropy offers a promising vision, it faces the challenge of delivering tangible results. The $1 billion milestone in 2024 serves as a reminder that promises alone are not enough. It is crucial to ensure that these donations are effectively utilized and have a meaningful impact on society. This challenge requires collaboration between donors, charities, and technology experts to create a sustainable and effective philanthropic ecosystem. 

Yet, this enthusiasm encounters limitations. For instance, the SHIB donation caused a price drop, reducing the aid provided despite its bold announcement. The Pineapple Fund's contributions, while substantial, were dependent on Bitcoin's fluctuations—some recipients benefited significantly, while others received less. Even with the total donations reaching a billion dollars in 2024, the practical impact remains inconsistent. The spectacle of cryptocurrency giving inspires, but its outcomes often depend on unpredictable markets, raising questions about its reliability.

Furthermore, the culture of cryptocurrency—dynamic and risk-oriented—diverges from philanthropy's traditional demands. Established figures like Warren Buffett, committed to decades of giving through the Giving Pledge, embody endurance. In contrast, cryptocurrency donations often align with tax advantages or public recognition rather than sustained support. The environmental impact of Bitcoin's energy consumption further complicates the matter—can philanthropy derived from such a source be considered unequivocally virtuous? Our fascination with the novel may overshadow enduring priorities.

What, then, drives our fixation? Crypto philanthropy reveals a profound reliance on technology as a solution. Disillusioned with the pace of conventional systems—whether governmental or charitable—we turn to blockchain for immediacy and transparency. The Giving Block notes that regulatory clarity in 2024 attracted more participants, leading to an increase in donations. This reflects a desire for control—a system we can oversee rather than entrust to others.

This trend also reveals a broader mistrust. Our insistence on transparency stems from disillusionment with established frameworks. While crypto giving doesn't yet surpass traditional philanthropy in scope, it compensates for perceived shortcomings. Initiatives like Gitcoin, which experiment with methods to fund grassroots projects, suggest a potential redefinition of impact—yet their reach remains limited. The $1 billion in donations in 2024 don't signify triumph but rather an aspiration: to create a form of generosity that aligns with our digital age. We're enamored with innovation, sometimes at the expense of proven consistency.

What does this signify? Crypto philanthropy occupies an ambiguous space—neither a definitive failure nor a complete success, but rather a lens on our priorities. It raises questions: Can generosity match the speed of technology? Must it bear a digital imprint to hold value? Those advancing this cause should temper their boldness with pragmatism. True impact doesn't lie in the tools employed but in the lives improved. Traditional philanthropy offers lessons in persistence; crypto provides audacity. A synthesis might yet emerge, but for now, our enthusiasm exceeds our evidence. The paradox lies here: in amassing over $1 billion, we reveal a society eager to redefine good yet still grappling with what that entails.

 According to Bo Hines, a senior White House advisor on crypto who spoke on the Crypto in America Podcast, the US could leverage its gold holdings to fund its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). 

Hines suggested that the Trump administration would explore creative ways of funding the SBR without further burdening the American taxpayer, News.Az reports citing foreign media.

His sentiments seem to be an attempt to pacify Americans, many of whom, according to a recent survey, oppose the SBR. The Data for Progress advocacy group poll showed 51% of American voters disapprove of the idea, placing it last on the list of priority areas for federal funding. 

America's budget-neutral means of financing its SBR

Hines explained that his think tank had received countless ideas on how to fund the SBR. He, however, hinted that the one(s) it would settle on would have to be budget-neutral. On that account, the US could use the gains from its gold certificates to acquire more Bitcoin. 

The crypto council head honcho also held that the certificates were massively undervalued compared to actual gold values. Therefore, getting their correct valuation, as Senator Cynthia Lummins' Bitcoin Act 2025 proposes, would give America the finances it needs to build its BTC stash. 

He said, “If we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.”

How does revaluing the gold certificates work? 

Lummins' push and, therefore, Hines' stance have merit, too. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, the Fed banks holding gold certificates value them at $42.22 per troy ounce. That figure pales in comparison to the $3,037, which is a similar unit of the precious metal fetches in the market. 

America owns about 8,133 metric tons of gold, which comes to 260.8 million troy ounces (using the formula, 1 metric ton = 32,150.7 troy ounces). Gold's current price gives you a market value of roughly $792 billion ($3,037*260.8M). Meanwhile, the book value is slightly over  $11 billion ($42.22*260.8M), bringing potential gains to over $780 billion ($792B – $11B). 

As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold's prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Such a windfall would provide the US with enough liquidity to set up the SBR without tapping into taxpayers' funds. 

Overcoming challenges and exploring alternatives to revaluing gold certificates

While the financial advantages are clear, questions remain about revalued gold certificates' scalability. Such a shift could induce pushback from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department itself, since it would risk impacting monetary policy and inflation expectations.

Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue.

Revaluing gold certificates is a strong possibility, but other budget-neutral approaches are worth contemplating. The U.S. could, for instance, consider issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds, as El Salvador has, or allocate some of the confiscated assets from criminal crypto activities toward funding the reserve.

Other experts have proposed tokenizing segments of federal assets and allowing private investors to contribute to the SBR via decentralized finance (DeFi) methods.

 A new government outlook may bring crypto firms back to the United States after years of regulatory confusion. 

Once, long ago, cryptocurrency companies operated comfortably in the US. In that quaint, bygone era, they would often conduct funding events called “initial coin offerings,” and then use those raised funds to try to do things in the real and blockchain world.

Now, they largely do this “offshore” through foreign entities while geofencing the United States.

The effect of this change has been dramatic: Practically all major cryptocurrency issuers started in the US now include some off-shore foundation arm. These entities create significant domestic challenges. They are expensive, difficult to operate, and leave many crucial questions about governance and regulation only half answered. 

Many in the industry yearn to “re-shore,” but until this year, there has been no path to do so. Now, though, that could change. New crypto-rulemaking is on the horizon, members of the Trump family have floated the idea of eliminating capital gains tax on cryptocurrency, and many US federal agencies have dropped enforcement actions against crypto firms.

For the first time in four years, the government has signaled to the cryptocurrency industry that it is open to deal. There may soon be a path to return to the US.

The story of US offshoring traces back to 2017. Crypto was still young, and the Securities and Exchange Commission had taken a hands-off approach to the regulation of these new products. That all changed when the commission released a document called “The DAO Report.”

For the first time, the SEC argued that the homebrew cryptocurrency tokens that had developed since the 2009 Bitcoin white paper were actually regulated instruments called securities. This prohibition was not total — around the same time as The DAO Report's launch, SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman publicly expressed his views that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) were not securities.

To clarify this distinction, the commission released a framework for digital assets in 2019, which identified relevant factors to evaluate a token's security status and noted that “the stronger their presence, the less likely the Howey test is met.” Relying on this guidance, many speculated that functional “consumptive” uses of tokens would insulate projects from securities concerns. 

In parallel, complicated tax implications were crystallizing. Tax advisers reached a consensus that, unlike traditional financing instruments like simple agreements for future equity (SAFEs) or preferred equity, token sales were fully taxable events in the US. Simple agreements for future tokens (SAFTs) — contracts to issue future tokens — faced little better tax treatment, with the taxable event merely deferred until the tokens were released. This meant that a token sale by a US company would generate a massive tax liability.

Projects tried in good faith to adhere to these guidelines. Lawyers extracted principles and advised clients to follow them. Some bit the bullet and paid the tax rather than contriving to create a foreign presence for a US project.

All this chugged along for a few years. The SEC brought some major enforcement actions, like its moves against Ripple and Telegram, and shut down other projects, like Diem. But many founders still believed they could operate legally in the US if they stuck to the script. 

Then, events conspired to knock this uneasy equilibrium out of balance. SEC Chair Gary Gensler entered the scene in 2021, Sam Bankman-Fried blew up FTX in 2022, and an unheralded opinion from Judge Paul Barbadoro came out of the sleepy US District Court for the District of New Hampshire in a case called SEC v. LBRY.

The LBRY case is a small one, affecting what is, by all accounts, a minor crypto project, but the application of law that came out of it had a dramatic effect on the practice of cryptocurrency law and, by extension, the avenues open to founders. 

Judge Barbadoro conceded that the token may have consumptive uses but held that “nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract.” 

He went on to say that he could not “reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered [the token] as a security simply because some [token] purchases were made with consumptive intent.” Because of the “economic realities,” Barbadoro held that it did not matter if some “may have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes.” 

This was devastating. The holding in LBRY is, essentially, that the factors proposed in the SEC framework largely do not matter in actual securities disputes. In LBRY, Judge Barbadoro found that the consumptive uses may be present, but the purchasers' expectation of profit predominated. 

And this, it turned out, meant that virtually any token offering might be considered a security. It meant that any evidence that a token was marketed as offering potential profit could be used against you. Even the supposition that it seemed likely that people bought it to profit could be fatal.

This had a chilling effect. The LBRY case and related case law destabilized the cryptocurrency project landscape. Instead of a potential framework to work within, there remained just a single vestige of hope to operate legally in the US: Move offshore and decentralize. 

Even the SEC admitted that Bitcoin and ETH were not securities because they were decentralized. Rather than having any promoter who could be responsible for their sale, they were the products of diffuse networks, attributable to no one. Projects in 2022 and 2023 were left with little option but to attempt to decentralize.

Inevitably, the operations would begin in the United States. A few developers would create a project in a small apartment. As they found success, they wanted to fundraise — and in crypto, when you fundraise, investors demand tokens. But it's illegal to sell tokens in the US. 

So, their VC or lawyer would advise them to establish a foundation in a more favorable jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands, Zug in Switzerland, or Panama. That foundation could be set up to “wrap” a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which would have governance mechanisms tied to tokens. 

Through that entity or another offshore entity, they would either sell tokens under a Regulation S exemption from US securities law or simply give them away in an airdrop.

In this way, projects hoped they could develop liquid markets and a sizable market cap, eventually achieving the “decentralization” that might allow them to operate legally as an entity in the US again.

These offshore structures didn't just provide a compliance function — they also offered tax advantages. Because foundations have no owners, they aren't subject to the “controlled foreign corporation” rules, under which foreign corporations get indirectly taxed in the US through their US shareholders. 

Well-advised foundations also ensured they engaged in no US business activities, preserving their “offshore” status.

Presto: They became amazing tax vehicles, unburdened by direct US taxation because they operate exclusively offshore and are shielded from indirect US taxation because they are ownerless. Even better, this arrangement often gave them a veneer of legitimacy, making it difficult for regulators to pin down a single controlling party.

After the formation, the US enterprise would become a rump “labs” or “development” company that earned income through licensing software and IP to these new offshore entities — waiting for the day when everything would be different, checking the mail for Wells notices, and feeling a bit jumpy. 

So, it wasn't just regulation that drove crypto offshore — it was hope. A thousand projects wanted to find a way to operate legally in the United States, and offshore decentralization was the only path. 

Now, that may change. With President Donald Trump in office, the hallways of 100 F Street in Washington, DC may just be thawing. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has taken the mantle and is leading the SEC's Crypto Task Force. 

In recent weeks, Peirce has expressed interest in offering prospective and retroactive relief for token issuers and creating a regulatory third way where token launches are treated as “non-securities” through the SEC's Section 28 exemptive authority. 

At the same time, evolutions in law are beginning to open the door for onshore operations. David Kerr of Cowrie LLP and Miles Jennings of a16z have pioneered a new corporate form, the decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association (DUNA), that may allow autonomous organizations to function as legal entities in US states like Wyoming.

Eric Trump has proposed favorable tax treatments for cryptocurrency tokens, which, though it might be a stretch, could offer a massive draw to bring assets back onshore. And without waiting on any official shifts in regulation, tax attorneys have come up with more efficient fundraising approaches, such as token warrants, to help projects navigate the existing system.

As a16z recently put it in a meeting with Commissioner Peirce's Crypto Task Force, “If the SEC were to provide guidance on distributions, it would stem the tide of [tokens] only being issued to non-U.S. persons — a trend that is effectively offshoring ownership of blockchain technologies developed in the U.S.”

Maybe this time, they'll listen.

Excitement has swelled in the crypto community following Bitcoin‘s recent upward move to key resistance levels. While the move may have sparked optimism, many investors' reactions toward BTC were negative as they continued to bet on a sustained decline, creating a bearish outlook for the asset.

As Bitcoin's price struggles to break through key resistance levels, a worrying shift has been cited among big investors or whales. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data platform reveals rising pessimism among these investors as they bet on an extension of the ongoing correction.

BTC recently saw a brief surge to the $87,000 level even as volatility grows in the broader crypto market. However, the upward move was met with strong resistance as whale holders massively opened short positions after the upswing. “Whales Enter Short Positions on Bitcoin as Leverage Increases,” the platform stated.

Despite the brief move to the $87,000 mark, these big investors have chosen to close their long positions and open more shorts. Given the ongoing volatility of the market, this shift has raised questions about BTC's prospects in the short term.

Whale participation often influences price trajectory, which could cause Bitcoin to continue dropping in the upcoming weeks. However, if buying pressure intensifies at critical support zones and creates a strong defense, BTC may move in an upward direction.

Furthermore, Alphractal points to a rise in market leverage. After examining the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest/Market Cap Ratio, the platform noted that the metric is rising again, reflecting growing leverage. According to the platform, this increase in market leverage might set off a fresh round of volatility, resulting in further mass liquidations.

On-chain data have also revealed substantial sell pressure among Bitcoin large investors, triggering concerns about potential downside risks. Leading market intelligence and data analytics platform IntoTheBlock, outlined a decrease in whale balances as the market fluctuates.

Looking at the chart, BTC whales seem to have been trending downward for almost a year. However, data from March suggests a potential reversal as whales now hold about 62,000 more BTC than they did at the beginning of the month, signaling renewed accumulation.

The renewed accumulation by BTC whales raises the likelihood of a price reversal from the ongoing downtrend. This price reversal could be part of a larger trend as Captain Faibik, a crypto analyst and investor predicts an impending surge to its current all-time high. His prediction is supported by a key chart pattern, particularly the Falling Wedge formation. 

Captain Faibik believes that BTC could consolidate within the key pattern for the next 10 to 15 days before undergoing a huge bullish breakout. When this breakout happens, Bitcoin's price will rally significantly to the $109,000 mark, reigniting the bull market.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's years-long crusade against the crypto industry appears to be over.

The final chapter closed on Wednesday, when Ripple announced that the SEC had officially dropped its four-year-old lawsuit against the company. The suit, filed on Jay Clayton's last day as SEC chair, accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through the sale of its XRP token without registering it as a security. 

Crypto companies and exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, Binance, and OpenSea all previously saw lawsuits or investigations dropped, resolved or put on hold. Ripple is now taking a victory lap. 

""Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back — and won on essential legal questions — throwing a major wrench into the SEC's plans to destroy crypto in the U.S. through enforcement,"" Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told CNBC in an emailed statement. ""The SEC has now abandoned its appeal in our case. In a fitting irony, Ripple was the first major case they brought and will now be the last one they walk away from.""

XRP was created in 2012 as one of the first non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies. It was started by the founders of the company Ripple, and became the platform's native currency. Like bitcoin, XRP can be bought and sold by retail investors. XRP jumped about 11% after Wednesday's announcement. 

Ripple spent $150 million battling the government in a bruising legal standoff with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose approach to crypto was widely viewed as hostile. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is ""not necessarily a security on its face,"" undercutting the foundation of the SEC's case.

The win wasn't just a turning point for Ripple. It signaled to the crypto industry that the tide was turning, and built momentum for a movement that helped return President Donald Trump, a former crypto critic, to the White House. A year after the judge's ruling, Trump, as Republican nominee, delivered a keynote at the annual Bitcoin Conference, and announced that he was ""laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world."" 

Ripple and its crypto peers were major contributors to Trump's campaign. The president has spent his first two months in office paying them back. 

On Friday, the SEC hosted its first major crypto roundtable, signaling a new approach of regulation through engagement, rather than enforcement. Leading the effort is Hester Peirce, who is helming the regulator's newly established Crypto Task Force. 

Peirce's message to the industry is that the SEC is no longer an adversary, but is instead trying to give crypto a clear, lawful framework.

In a major policy reversal, the SEC rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 — a controversial rule that required banks to treat crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. Introduced in 2022 and championed by Gensler, the rule was widely viewed as a major barrier to institutional adoption of bitcoin and other digital assets. 

""Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun,"" Peirce wrote on in a post on X after the change was announced in January.  

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that month, CEOs from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America signaled that the thaw in Washington could lead to renewed crypto engagement. 

And at the White House, David Sacks, Trump's AI and crypto czar, stood beside the president as he signed an executive order on digital assets. Sacks had recently attended the Crypto Ball as part of the inauguration, where he declared, ""The war on crypto is over.""

Coinbase's lawsuit was dismissed in February. Then came Kraken. The SEC pulled back from its Wells Notice against Robinhood's crypto division. The investigation into Binance is on hold.

Ripple's legal team long argued that the SEC's strategy wasn't about upholding the law, but about using it as a blunt instrument. The regulator sent subpoenas to foreign regulators that worked with Ripple, demanded troves of documents from business partners and even sued CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen personally. Those charges have also been dropped.

""While this chapter is closed, the fight for clear, fair, and transparent crypto regulation continues,"" Alderoty told CNBC. ""Ripple will continue to lead that fight.""

        Share    

TRON founder Justin Sun has shared his thoughts about potentially reducing TRX block rewards, drawing parallels to Bitcoin's halving mechanism.

In a recent tweet, Sun shared his thoughts on implementing a reward reduction for Tron (TRX). He noted that the cryptocurrency is already deflationary, with supply decreasing by 1% annually. 

This makes TRX “the only deflationary asset among major cryptocurrencies,” according to Sun.

“This discussion about TRX's upcoming reduction in block rewards is worth paying attention to! Will TRX follow Bitcoin's path and enter a halving cycle?” Sun wrote on X. He also compared the potential change as an evolution similar to Bitcoin's development.

Sun explained that as Bitcoin's (BTC) network matured and its price increased, block rewards were gradually reduced through the halving mechanism. He suggested that TRON could follow a comparable path, noting that the rising TRX price has increased rewards for block-producing nodes across the network.

The proposal, formally submitted on GitHub as “Reduce TRX block rewards #738,” outlines several potential scenarios. Reducing 1 million TRX in daily block rewards would increase the deflation rate by 50% to 1.5% per year. At the same time, a 2 million TRX reduction would double the deflation rate to 2% annually, creating an impact “comparable to Bitcoin's halving.”

The GitHub proposal also mentions multiple benefits of implementing such changes. This includes better deflation, increased staking incentives, strengthened network security, and improved economic alignment. “Timely adjustments to TRX block rewards can better promote the healthy and sustainable development of the TRON network and TRON ecosystem,” the proposal states.

Unlike Bitcoin's automated halving mechanism that cuts rewards by 50% approximately every four years, TRX's proposed reduction would be implemented through community governance. “Ultimately, this decision rests with the TRX community!” Sun emphasized.

Sun highlighted that even with reduced block rewards, “the current incentives for network validators remain highly attractive.”

Brands and NVIDIA Partner to Drive AI Innovation Across 500 Fast Food Restaurant Locations","https://restauranttechnologynews.com/2025/03/yum-brands-and-nvidia-partner-to-drive-ai-innovation-across-500-fast-food-restaurant-locations/","Sat, 22 Mar 2025 02:29:06 GMT","

Yum! Brands, the global powerhouse behind Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC, and Habit Burger Grill, is taking a major leap into the future of restaurant operations through a new, high-profile partnership with NVIDIA. The alliance, announced during NVIDIA's recent GTC developer conference in San Jose, is designed to accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence across Yum!'s global footprint—impacting everything from drive-thru ordering to back-of-house operations and labor management.

This collaboration comes at a pivotal time for the quick-service restaurant sector, where digital transformation is no longer optional but essential. Faced with rising labor costs, changing consumer expectations, and increasing demand for speed, convenience, and personalization, operators are turning to technology not just to streamline workflows, but to reshape the customer experience from the ground up.

Yum! Brands' Chief Digital and Technology Officer Joe Park told attendees at GTC that digital sales now account for more than 50% of the company's total revenue, up from 19% in 2019. The sharp rise is driven by a strategic focus on integrating digital tools—including AI-powered solutions—across Yum!'s vast portfolio of more than 61,000 restaurants worldwide.

A primary focus of this initiative is the deployment of voice AI agents at drive-thrus and call centers. Developed in partnership with NVIDIA, these systems leverage advanced natural language processing and conversational AI models to understand, respond to, and even upsell to customers—all in real-time. These voice agents don't just replace human labor; they're designed to enhance the ordering experience by being consistent, friendly, and efficient—particularly during high-volume periods like lunch rushes or major sporting events.

According to a 2024 drive-thru study by Intouch Insight, the average customer spends about 5 minutes and 29 seconds in a fast food drive-thru. Early data shows that AI-powered drive-thrus can reduce that time by up to 29 seconds—a potential game-changer for both customer satisfaction and throughput efficiency. With higher accuracy and the ability to upsell at scale, voice AI can also boost check averages while reducing strain on front-line employees.

Park emphasized that the use of AI is not intended to replace team members, but to support them. AI can take care of repetitive and transactional tasks, he noted, so that team members can focus on delivering great hospitality and managing operations.

Yum! Brands is not simply layering AI onto existing systems. The company is building on its proprietary platform, Byte by Yum!, which integrates POS, inventory management, labor scheduling, delivery logistics, and customer data into a single technology ecosystem. By integrating NVIDIA's AI and edge computing technologies, Yum! can now scale these capabilities across multiple brands and markets with improved efficiency and lower cost of deployment.

NVIDIA's contribution includes the use of its NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform and NIM microservices—pre-trained AI models that can be easily customized and deployed on edge devices within restaurant environments. This technology allows for real-time, on-site processing of AI tasks, reducing latency and dependency on cloud infrastructure.

Additionally, NVIDIA's computer vision solutions are being used to analyze restaurant camera feeds. For example, AI can assess whether the food being handed out at the window matches the customer's order, helping to improve order accuracy and reduce waste. Vision-based AI is also being trained to identify bottlenecks in kitchen or drive-thru operations and recommend adjustments in real time.

Yum! has begun piloting these AI tools in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations across the U.S., with plans to expand to 500 locations—including KFC and Habit Burger Grill—by the end of Q2 2025. While the company hasn't disclosed the specific locations of these pilots or financial terms of the partnership, the scale and scope of the project indicate a significant investment in long-term AI infrastructure.

Yum! is also exploring the use of AI-generated action plans for restaurant managers. These tools leverage historical performance data and current conditions to offer prescriptive guidance—essentially telling managers not just what is happening in their stores, but what they should do about it.

Yum!'s move is part of a broader industry shift. The QSR industry has become a proving ground for AI deployment, with competitors like McDonald's, Wendy's, White Castle, and Panda Express all testing voice AI and automation in various forms. However, the path hasn't been smooth for everyone. McDonald's, for example, ended a voice AI pilot with IBM in 2023 after customer complaints and technical difficulties, signaling that successful implementation requires not just innovation, but rigorous testing and human oversight.

This is where Yum! appears to be differentiating itself—by focusing on strategic integration, transparency, and iterative development. The company has made it clear that AI will not be a “set it and forget it” solution, but a tool that evolves through continuous learning and refinement.

For restaurant executives, franchise operators, and technology leaders evaluating AI initiatives, the Yum!-NVIDIA partnership offers a compelling blueprint for success. AI is no longer a futuristic buzzword—it's a practical tool for improving operational performance, guest experience, and financial outcomes. When integrated thoughtfully, AI can act as a force multiplier across an organization, empowering staff and enhancing every aspect of the customer journey.

Yum! Brands has the scale, infrastructure, and leadership commitment to drive meaningful results with AI. And with more than 61,000 locations worldwide, what happens at Yum! often sets the tone for the broader industry. The company's partnership with NVIDIA is not just about faster drive-thrus—it's about creating the intelligent, responsive, and scalable restaurant model of the future.

As AI matures, it will be the operators who embrace strategic innovation—backed by data and tested through real-world use—who gain the clearest competitive advantage.

A aviation company is turning heads with an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle.

Remember those futuristic dreams of flying cars we saw in ""The Jetsons""? 

Well, they might be closer than you think. 

CycloTech, an Austrian aviation company, is turning heads with its BlackBird demonstrator, an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL) designed to showcase a game-changing propulsion system. 

Could this be the technology that finally makes flying cars a practical reality?

CycloTech isn't just building another eVTOL. It's hinging its vision on unique CycloRotor technology. What's so special about it? Well, the BlackBird demonstrator is designed to test the seventh generation of CycloTech's 360-degree thrust vectoring propulsion system. 

CycloTech claims that its CycloRotor technology is the only propulsion system that can fully control the thrust vector in strength and direction throughout a complete 360-degree path. This allows the Blackbird demonstrator to have unmatched maneuverability; imagine a vehicle that can take off and land vertically, move sideways, brake mid-air and even parallel park. With six CycloRotors, the BlackBird is designed to do just that.

Also, the BlackBird's design aims to decouple the flight path from the aircraft's orientation, promising a smooth and comfortable ride even in less-than-ideal conditions without needing to bank or tilt. When it comes to safety, the Blackbird has it covered with its six CycloRotors, providing redundancy in the event of an engine failure, allowing the aircraft to continue to fly in a controlled manner. CycloTech CEO Hans-Georg Kinsky notes, ""With our BlackBird, we are showing how this innovative technology will open up the market for flying cars.""

THIS FLYING MOTORCYCLE CAN TAKE YOU FROM TRAFFIC TO SKY IN MINUTES

Safety is paramount in aviation, and CycloTech addresses this with a multi-rotor design. ""That's why we at CycloTech use at least six CycloRotors to ensure that the aircraft can continue to fly in a controlled manner in the event of an engine failure,"" explains Kinsky. The 360° thrust vector control also allows the aircraft to brake and stop mid-air, enhancing control and safety, particularly in congested airspace. The two CycloRotors along the vehicle's length enable sideways flight without banking, further increasing maneuverability.

A FLYING SHOPPING CART COULD MAKE YOUR FUTURE GROCERY RUNS THAT MUCH EASIER

CycloRotors enable the construction of compact aircraft, potentially half the size of those using propellers or rotors. This compact design means they can be more easily integrated into existing environments without requiring special infrastructure. The BlackBird demonstrator showcases the capabilities of the 7th generation CycloRotor, offering precise control, vertical take-off and landing, and maximum stability at various pitch angles (up to 30 degrees while hovering). This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Just hours before IPL 2025, the Indian government has taken strict action against illegal online gaming platforms. The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), under the Ministry of Finance, has blocked 357 foreign online gaming websites and seized around 2,400 bank accounts linked to them. This move aims to curb tax evasion and protect Indian users from fraudulent platforms.


Along with the crackdown, the Finance Ministry has issued a public warning, which has been urging users to stay away from unregistered foreign gaming websites. The ministry has also advised cricketers, Bollywood celebrities, and social media influencers to avoid promoting these platforms, as they could be misleading Indian users into financial risks.

The DGGI is investigating around 700 foreign e-gaming companies that have failed to register for GST and are evading taxes. Reports suggest that these gaming companies are using fake bank accounts for transactions, making them a significant concern for tax authorities.

As part of the investigation, 2,400 suspicious accounts have been seized in two major cases.

To further tighten its grip on illegal gaming platforms, DGGI has frozen ₹126 crore that was linked to these platforms. This action was taken in collaboration with I4C (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

Authorities have also arrested three individuals linked to the illegal gaming networks. The government is actively working to eliminate tax fraud in online gaming and protect users from financial risks.

Delaware Healthcare Association, Medical Society of Delaware, Delaware Nurses Association, Delaware Health Care Facilities Association, and Delaware Association for Home & Community Care to announce a first-ever cross-sector advocacy agenda to strengthen healthcare in the First State

 

Delaware policy-makers and healthcare advocates are collaborating to address the state of healthcare in The First State.

Leaders of associations that represent hospitals, doctors, nurses, caregivers and other medical sectors gathered with a group of lawmakers at Legislative Hall recently to unveil an eight-point program. This comes as pressure continues to mount on the healthcare system due to Delaware having the nation's 6th-oldest population while also being the 8th-fastest growing state. 

""It's a privilege to partner with my colleagues across the healthcare continuum to turn principles into policies,"" Delaware Healthcare Association President and CEO Brian Frazee said. ""Despite any clouds of uncertainty on the federal level, we are ushering in a new beginning and positive step forward that will make the First State first in health. That takes all of us, together, to fight for what our patients, health workers and communities deserve – a strong system for quality, affordable, accessible and equitable healthcare.” 

“We're working on issues that are bigger than any one of our organizations, and coming together for patients, providers, partners and, frankly, Delaware. The Medical Society of Delaware is laser-focused on improving the health and wellness of all Delawareans and this agenda will help all of us achieve that goal,” Medical Society of Delaware Past President and current chair of government relations Dr. Richard Henderson said. 

The agenda includes addressing the healthcare workforce shortage and removing certain barriers to healthcare, as well as advocating for adequate reimbursement rates. 

Also involved in the collaboration are the Delaware Nurses Association, the Delaware Health Care Facilities Association and the Delaware Association for Home and Community Care. 

Two nurses that serve in the General Assembly are hopeful.

“Today, we are taking words on paper and turning them into action. As a nurse, I've seen it all. On the frontlines, you can see what works, what doesn't and how we can come together to make things better in healthcare. That's exactly what we are doing today – shining a light on how we can support our health workers, provide a quality, affordable experience for our patients and families, and strengthen communities. Which in turn leads to improved outcomes and a better quality of life for all,” House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle said.  

“In Delaware, we have higher rates of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer than the rest of the nation which places a strain on our healthcare facilities and contributes to higher healthcare costs. At the same time, our much-needed healthcare workforce struggles with burnout stemming from the day-to-day stress of caregiving, administrative burdens of dealing with insurance, and even violent threats and assaults. We cannot improve healthcare in Delaware unless we tackle the challenges of the entire healthcare system,"" Representative Valerie Jones Giltner, R-Georgetown said. ""I am certain our cross-functional collaboration will have an exponential impact on these issues.”

HONOLULU (Island News) -- ""I'm originally from New Jersey. I've been on island for about six and a half years,"" said Keri Anacker.

Anacker is a school psychologist, who spent years in grad school for her specialist degree.

Now she works at a number of public schools assessing students for special education, then comes up with plans to help them.

Local lawmakers want to spend millions to attract and keep new healthcare professionals in Hawaii through a bill that forgives loans used when studying for their profession.

In her move to the islands, she brought more than just her belongings.

""I accumulated I want to say about a little under $30,000 in student loans,"" stated Anacker.

She said she would pay a little each month, but planned on paying for ten years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Instead, she signed up for a Hawaii program that nearly wiped it all away.

""I got awarded the money 2024. I had about $26,000 in student loan debt and they sent a check to my loan servicer for $25,500,"" said Anacker.

She is one of the nearly 900 healthcare workers, who took part in the loan repayment program over the past two years.

Now lawmakers want to set more money aside to help hundreds more Hawaii healthcare professionals.

""$30 million, that is $15 million in each of the next two years, which pays for the loans that people take out when they study to become doctors, nurses, physician assistants, social workers. This pays back the amount of money they took out in loans up to $50,000,"" said Rep. Gregg Takayama.

The program is a popular one, with more than 1,300 people on the wait list, but it does come with an important requirement.

""As part of forgiving of their student loans, they have to agree to serve at least two years in a rural area, which in Hawaii is almost all of Hawaii. So we get back committed healthcare workers to serve in our community. That meets a real shortage we have of healthcare workers all across the board,"" added Takayama.

The House bill survived crossing over to the other side of the State Legislature, but now will be heard by the Senate Ways and Means committee, which reviews all bills with a financial impact.

For new healthcare workers like Anacker, the program has made a difference in her Hawaii career.

""Although this program didn't help bring me here, it's definitely helped to retain and keep me here,"" stated Anacker.

She is a such a fan of the program. She's also reached out to other current and former students, to let them know about the loan repayment program and encourage them to come to Hawaii.

""I'm hoping to bring more people to the island because of it. So I'm hoping to even recruit, more healthcare workers and mental health workers like myself,"" added Anacker.

A sign at the now-shuttered East Ohio Regional Hospital shows the services that are no longer available in Martins Ferry. Other upper Ohio Valley medical facilities are preparing for increased workloads as EORH patients seek care elsewhere. 

After weeks of uncertainty, East Ohio Regional Hospital officially closed its doors Thursday night, the impact of which is rippling through the surrounding healthcare landscape. 

Local hospitals are preparing for larger patient loads during an abnormally busy year, while first responders say they expect longer transport and wait times for emergency medical services. 

Cumberland Trail Fire Captain Jeremy Rife said it is normal for his department to take multiple patients to EORH a day as it is one of the closest facilities for them. Now, having to drive patients further to WVU Medicine Barnesville or Reynolds Memorial hospitals will make turnaround times for EMS longer. 

The closure will also have a ripple effect on local hospitals who will be forced to take on more patients than usual, Rife said. 

“I think one of the biggest things is that it's going to overwhelm other hospitals and cause them to possibly have to go on diversion more often and they're just going to have to work a lot harder to get patients through that can no longer go to EORH,” Rife said. 

OR&W Fire Chief R.C. Fellows echoed this concern, noting that a particularly bad flu and COVID season has already been overwhelming hospitals in recent months. 

“The hospitals have been overloaded right now regardless and with taking an ER away from us it's going to really impact all of these hospitals because they're getting more and more patients and we've been busier than we've probably ever seen before,” Fellows said. 

Patients with a preference for EORH or who have  providers there are also being forced to make changes, Rife said. 

“There are a lot of patients that prefer to go to EORH now they're having to switch up where their doctors are and stuff like that and just try to find different options,” Rife said.

Health Department Deputy Commissioner Robert Sproul emphasized that Belmont County is already an area with a shortage of physicians.

“Any time we lose medical services it is a detriment to the county. So it's very sad to see [EORH] close because there's a lot of services, a lot of care that they're providing to the community,” Sproul said.

 “As a health department our job is to fill the gaps and help the community in any way we can.” 

Sproul said the county leaned on EORH for things like infectious disease reporting and general medical services, much of which will now be diverted across the Ohio River. He said he hopes Wheeling-area hospitals can sustain the increase in patient load. 

He also noted how difficult it is to get a hospital up and running again after a closure, which EORH has already seen once before in its troubled past. 

“Anytime we lose these services, it's hard to get it back. The first time [EORH] closed, look how long it took to reopen. The worry is, how long will it take for another entity to move into that facility to provide care to the county again? That is a concern,” Sproul said. “It's just a sad day, that's for sure.” 

A statement from WVU Medicine – which has Wheeling, Reynolds Memorial, Barnesville and Weirton hospitals in its fold – extended “good thoughts and prayers to fellow caregivers and support staff” at EORH. 

The statement said WVU Medicine's hospitals are prepared to take on the additional patient load – and potentially offer jobs to some of the laid off EORH healthcare staff. 

“Our hospitals and clinics in eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia stand ready to care for East Ohio's patients, and we encourage the hospital team members to explore opportunities to join our team at WVUMedicine.org/Careers,” the statement read. 

The Ohio Department of Transportation said counties will soon work to remove EORH from highway signs indicating that it is the nearest hospital.

Grove City is moving forward with a potential program to help low-income residents with health care costs.

A new committee of city officials and mayoral appointees will figure out more specifics for the program, which the city council member who sponsored it says is one of the first in the country.

Council member Ted Berry said in an interview with The Dispatch that he introduced the idea because “I've gotten sick and tired of waiting on the federal government and the state to do something about it.”

Berry also said that he knows of many people in Grove City who don't get health insurance, including people who work multiple part-time jobs that don't offer healthcare, as well as seniors who struggle to pay for health care.

He added that some people work part-time for small businesses that need workers but can't afford to pay for health care for full-time employees.

An original version of the ordinance included $75,000 in pilot funding, but the final version the city council passed unanimously March 17 omitted the seed funding. Berry said the committee will first establish more guidelines for the program before moving forward.

Berry said that there is plenty of health care around Grove City and in central Ohio, but it can be expensive.

“We're lucky enough not to have an accessibility problem because we've got some of the best hospitals in the world located right here in central Ohio — it's just we have an affordability problem,” Berry said.

About one in four working-age adults in Grove City do not receive employer-sponsored health care, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. About 4% of people do not have health insurance.

The draft program includes an income cap of $30,000 with an annual grant maximum of $400 for individuals and $600 for family plans, but Berry said the committee will evaluate all of the numbers and could make changes.

This wouldn't be the first direct grant program to city residents: Grove City offers $1,000 per semester to local full- and part-time college students, for a total benefit of up to $12,000.

Why two sides are throwing barbs","https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/03/22/south-county-hospital-lawsuit-against-opposition-group/82569352007/","Sat, 22 Mar 2025 09:08:19 GMT","

SOUTH KINGSTOWN – When nearly the entire team of hematology oncology providers abruptly resigned from South County Hospital last June, their departure was discreetly announced in a newsletter to the medical staff.

That may have been the end of it – except that patients and former medical staff started questioning the hospital's version of events that a divergence of perspectives on how to handle the cancer center's finances created a rift between the institution and the providers. Soon an opposition group formed, which claimed the blame lay with the hospital's top administration.

The opposition group, dubbed Save South County Hospital, held public forums calling on the hospital's top administrators to resign, sent letters to the hospital's board and appealed to state authorities to intervene. It also set up a website to press forward with its public information campaign.

The hospital, for its part, launched an entire landing page on its website dedicated to “addressing the facts” – defending the hospital's administration, explaining departures of physicians and the hospital finances. It also held news conferences, community forums, and question-and-answer sessions in response to Save South County Hospital's efforts.

Now, more than half a year after it all started, the battle for South County Hospital is heating up.

On March 11, the hospital filed a lawsuit against Save South County Hospital and Claudia Swain, a former development executive who managed donor relationships.

The lawsuit claims Swain disclosed confidential information to Save South County Hospital to convince donors to stop financially supporting the hospital.

“Though [Save South County Hospital claims] to advocate for quality care, their actions threaten the very funding that enables us to maintain that standard. By targeting donor contributions, they risk creating the very lapses in care and quality they profess to oppose,” says a news release provided by Matt Moeller, director of marketing and communications at South County Health, the parent organization of South County Hospital.

Save South County Hospital's Director Steven Fera, a former cardiologist at the hospital, denies that any disclosures of confidential information occurred and says that a list of the donors to the hospital are all on publicly available plaques in the hospital lobby.

He chalked off the lawsuit as an attempt to stifle opposition.

“This lawsuit is nothing short of a shameless, desperate stunt designed to choke off dissent and cover up the catastrophic fallout of gross mismanagement at South County Hospital,” Fera said.

In a separate news release sent to media Wednesday, Save South County Hospital announced it is convening a special meeting of members of South County Health's endowment on April 3. At the meeting, which will be open to the public, members will seek to elect nine additional trustees to the hospital's board to “right the hospital's ship.”

But, in an email to the media Thursday, Moeller said the meeting did not meet the criteria to be considered a meeting of South County Health's endowment.

“Any decisions or votes taken at this gathering hold no validity or authority to enact change at [South County Hosptial],” Moeller wrote.

Fera disagrees.

“The meeting has been thoroughly researched by lawyers and is legally able to be held to provide opportunities for new leadership at the hospital,” he said.

South County Hospital has an annual meeting scheduled for April 7, which will include the board of trustees, the health system's executive leadership and members of South County Health's corporations. It is not open to the public.

Tension between South County Hospital's leadership and Save South County Hospital has been building since the beginning of the year. The group held a meeting on Jan. 28 at South Kingstown High School, where former patients, providers and stakeholders spoke. About 300 people attended the event, according to the group.

Earlier in January, a separate group of more than 60 donors, former trustees and staff sent a letter to South County Hospital's Board of Trustees asking the hospital to rehire the hematology oncology providers who resigned, remove CEO Aaron Robinson and pursue a partnership with a larger health system. The letter was unaffiliated with Save South County Hospital, though Fera and Chris VanHemerlrijck, also one of the group's directors, were among its signers.","{'href': 'https://www.providencejournal.com', 'title': 'The Providence Journal'}"

WICHITA FALLS, Texas (KAUZ) - High school students got an up-close and personal look at the many career paths available in healthcare, thanks to a collaboration between the North Central Area Education Center, MSU Texas and Vernon College.

“We want them to be able to see the campus, touch the materials, interact with the students and the faculty so that they can just really get a good idea about if this is the direction it's going, what's it going to look like,” community base educator Paige Rask said.

This healthcare high school tour is sparking the interest of high school students in the area, long before they set foot in a formal college classroom setting.

“A lot of times students go in knowing I want to help somebody. That's what I want to do long term. I want to help somebody, but many times they don't know all of the different programs that we have to offer and so this gives them exposure to every single one of them, whether it's radiology, social work, dental hygiene, athletic training, all of them. I'll say for respiratory therapy we actually had some cadaver pig lungs that we had. We have a healthy set and we had one that was exposed to cigarette smoke. It allows the students to see what kind of damage can actually be done to the lungs,“ director of interdisciplinary education Randy Case said.

“In dental hygiene they got to clean teeth, they go through the sterilization, they look at even making models and taking x-rays and so each department really brought its own and let them really get a good idea about what they would see, feel, and interact with as a student,“ Rask said.

During the tour, each department added its own touch with unique activities in each profession.

For some students it wasn't just about exploration, it was discovering new and valuable skills, like working on a team.

“Everyone's a team, even though there's so many different ways that you can be a health care provider,“ Windthorst High school student Lane Hale said. 

“Just communication is a big key, a big part of it. Teamwork, like they said earlier, but just listening and observing bigger patients and everything,” Iowa Park High school Trinitey Sousa said.

At its core, this event offered more than just exposure as students were being guided, leading students to take meaningful step into their future.

“What we really hope that this does is just help inspire students to get excited to possibly open their minds up to different opportunities and they knew that were even available. Really give them a good idea about what not only does it look like in college, but what it could look like as their career,“ Rask said.

A cascade of actions from the Trump administration represents a “grave threat” to health care, social, educational and other critical services in Indian Country, including for Native American communities in the Northwest, tribal leaders say.

In the past two weeks, the Trump administration has announced the cancellation of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities and 25 Bureau of Indian Affairs offices, representing nearly 30% of all agency locations, including one each in Toppenish, Washington, and Lapwai, Idaho, as part of an effort to decrease federal office space.

Additionally, IHS employees were included in the latest buyout offer from the Trump administration, alarming tribal officials and Indigenous community leaders who fear that any employees leaving the understaffed, underfunded agency will force the shutdown of critical health services.

A steady stream of executive orders from the president and cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency — combined with frequent changes of course — have had a destabilizing effect on agencies that serve tribes, including those in the Northwest. Hundreds of employees at the Bureau of Indian Affairs have been fired. Access to important payment systems has been blocked. Congressionally approved grants have been unilaterally terminated.

The chaos intensifies concerns about whether critical health care services for roughly 3 million Native American and Alaska Native tribal citizens can be preserved.


“Significant underfunding cannot be categorized as wasteful,” said Greg Abrahamson, vice-chair of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the chairman of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, who, along with other Northwest tribal leaders, testified before the U.S. House Interior Appropriations Committee on Feb. 27.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Additionally, IHS employees were included in the latest buyout offer from the Trump administration, alarming tribal officials and Indigenous community leaders who fear that any employees leaving the understaffed, underfunded agency will force the shutdown of critical health services.

A steady stream of executive orders from the president and cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency — combined with frequent changes of course — have had a destabilizing effect on agencies that serve tribes, including those in the Northwest. Hundreds of employees at the Bureau of Indian Affairs have been fired. Access to important payment systems has been blocked. Congressionally approved grants have been unilaterally terminated.

The chaos intensifies concerns about whether critical health care services for roughly 3 million Native American and Alaska Native tribal citizens can be preserved.


“Significant underfunding cannot be categorized as wasteful,” said Greg Abrahamson, vice-chair of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the chairman of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, who, along with other Northwest tribal leaders, testified before the U.S. House Interior Appropriations Committee on Feb. 27.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The University of Maine System said Friday that it was found to be in compliance with federal and state laws, as well as NCAA rules that were changed following President Donald Trump's executive order to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in female sports.

The confirmation came after the Trump administration had previously said an investigation had found the university system violated Title IX, which bans sex-based discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding, and that the Department of Agriculture would be suspending federal funds to UMS, which comprises seven universities across the state.

“We are relieved to put the Department's Title IX compliance review behind us so the land-grant University of Maine and our statewide partners can continue to leverage USDA and other essential federal funds to strengthen and grow our natural resource economy and dependent rural communities through world-class education, research and extension,” Dannel Malloy, the system's chancellor, said in a statement to NBC News.

In the 2024 fiscal year, UMS received almost $30 million in USDA funding, according to the school system. 

The statement from UMS followed an announcement from the USDA on Wednesday that said the university system “clearly communicated its compliance with Title IX's requirement to protect equal opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, as articulated in President Donald J. Trump's Executive Order.”

Trump's transgender sports order, which he signed last month, prohibits trans women and girls from participating in female sports and states that the federal government will rescind funds from educational programs that don't comply. The order, which refers to trans women as men, says that having trans women in female sports “is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.”

The USDA temporarily paused UMS' funding, the system said in a news release on March 11. In an email, the USDA's Office of the Chief Financial Officer said it was evaluating “if it should take any follow-on actions related to prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to the release.

“USDA is committed to upholding the President's executive order, meaning any institution that chooses to disregard it can count on losing future funding,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said last month, according to a news release.

Samantha Warren, UMS' chief external and governmental affairs officer, said Maine's public universities have always been compliant with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, and the system “remained compliant when the NCAA updated its rules in February.”

In 2022, the NCAA adopted a sport-by-sport approach for transgender athletes, deferring to policies set by each sport's national governing body, subject to review and recommendation by an NCAA committee. Last month, following Trump's executive order, the college sports association updated its policy to limit “competition in women's sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.”

BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to attend the NCAA wrestling championships for the second time in three years, the latest example of how he has mostly limited travel early in his new term to trips built around sports events.

Trump is expected to be at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on Saturday night as Penn State looks to close out its fourth straight men's team title. The Republican president spent Friday night as his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, about 70 miles northeast of Philadelphia, on what was his first visit there of his second term.

“We're going to the big fight. The reason I'm going is in Philadelphia. They have the NCAA, world, wrestling for college. And I've always supported the wrestlers,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday evening. “I want to support them. These are the great college wrestlers from the various schools.” 

In the two-plus months since returning to the White House, Trump attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500 in Florida, where his motorcade drove a portion of the track. While president-elect he went to a UFC fight in New York. 

That's more travel for sports than for policy announcements or official duties, though a long January swing took Trump to tour damage from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and wildfires in Los Angeles. He then gave a speech and visited the floor of Las Vegas' Circa Resort & Casino before heading to Doral, Florida, to address a House Republican policy conference.




Trump has long built his public and political persona around sporting events, and relishes turning up at live events to hear cheers from the crowd, even if some in attendance boo him. He also has signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports — an action which he points to frequently to fire up his core supporters. 

The president has used most Saturdays and Sundays to play golf at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, though he also sometimes remained in Washington to give weekend speeches.

Trump was a candidate when he went to the 2023 NCAA wrestling championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Bill Hammond

The entire process of devising and delivering baseball signs has always fascinated me.

The instant communication — coach to players, catcher to pitcher and player to player — is the game's secret code. It greatly appealed to a young me.

Signs, alternately called signals, used by my baseball and softball teams ranged from devious to ridiculously simple.

I played on one team whose players each had a personal set of signals. It was chaos.

On another team, the coach gave signals that meant absolutely nothing. It was what he would do next. If he stood perfectly still, nothing was happening. If he stepped forward, that meant bunt, if backward, steal. Diabolically simple!

Bob Muscato

My fascination grew into the lost art of stealing signs. It was taking note of the unusual — a tell, a glance, a nod — a player staring extra long at a coach or a coach giving signals more slowly than usual. Any clue something was up!

The first time I remember stealing signs was during a Grape Belt League game. My dad was manager of our local American Legion team and he entered us in the Grape Belt to pick up experience playing older teams. We were 18 and younger.

One day we were playing a team we had no business beating. The longtime town ball club boasted a pitcher with some minor league experience. He's in the Chautauqua Sports Hall of Fame, so let the guessing begin.

Anyway, I was coaching first base when I noticed something unusual about the ace pitcher's catcher.

Whenever he wanted a fastball, he'd quickly flash his right hand in and out between his legs extending one finger. Any other pitch he wanted, he would much more slowly display two or more fingers.

Tom Prevet

I brought the information back to my dad and he came up with a plan.

Our team was no match for the ace's curves, sliders, drops and changeups. But we could hit fastballs. If the batter wanted to know when the fastball was coming — some didn't — then my dad would call him by his last name. 

It worked wonderfully. We knocked their ace out of the game early and rolled to an upset victory.

My Fredonia State coach, Tom Prevet, would designate two non-starters strictly to stealing signs. One would watch the base coach and the other would monitor the manager.

Back in high school I misread a signal from Cardinal Mindszenty Coach Bob Muscato. Or did I?

As I recall it, we were playing in Lackawanna against Baker Victory High School.

After doubling to left field, I somehow made it to third base. Here's where it got interesting. Earlier in the season, Coach Muscato told us players about an article he read in a coaching journal. It was on the squeeze bunt and identified the perfect ball-strike count to trigger it.

The author argued a pitcher was more likely to throw a buntable pitch on a three-ball, no-strike count.

Well, the soon-to-be first-time Smith Division champion Monarchs were going to test the theory. If the situation ever presented itself, Muscato would signal the batter and base runner by raising his right hand.

The opportunity never arose in early games and nothing more was ever mentioned about the play. I assumed (Yeah, I know what it makes out of you and me!) the play was still in effect.

Well, the count went to 3 and 0 on our ace pitcher Terry Leja, a left handed batter.

I looked to my right at Coach Muscato in the third-base coaching box and he slowly raised his right hand. In my mind, the squeeze bunt had just been ordered.

Once the pitcher started his windup, I took off for home. Ahead of me, a look of surprise, concern and then fear overtook my teammate's stricken face as he realized I was headed his way.

Terry had interpreted his coach's hand gesture as a “don't swing” signal, so he was understandably confused.

I soon realized there would be no squeeze bunt from Terry, who backed away from the plate as I rumbled closer.

I was too far gone to stop when Coach Muscato screamed, “What are you doing, Hammond? Get back here!”

The commotion apparently startled the pitcher so much he threw ball four in the dirt and it bounced to the fence.

I scored standing up with an early run and we went on to win the game.

Coach Muscato later questioned my mad dash and I explained my rationale. He was skeptical but made sure to go over our signals — real and imagined — before every game from that day forward.

On the bus trip home I waged a losing battle with our team scorekeeper. He wanted to credit my run to a wild pitch while I wanted to call it a steal of home. It would have been the only one of my career. Oh, well, I guess it could easily have been worse. A lot worse.

Impending tariffs could have far-reaching effects on professional sports leagues and the sports industry. The sports sector, usually able to insulate itself from political fluctuations, is finding itself in a similar boat as automakers and liquor producers in the face of President Trump's tariffs.

“I expect all professional sports leagues and sports companies to keep an eye on how tariffs impact their businesses moving forward because while sports leagues and franchises have historically been stable assets with predictable revenue patterns, at the end of the day, their businesses are still impacted by activity in the global economy,” Sports Report host Joe Pompliano explained on the podcast (see video above or listen below).

The US has imposed a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports and some goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 20% tariff on Chinese imports. President Trump has issued other tariff threats as well, including a significant reciprocal tariff proposal scheduled to take effect on April 2.

Pompliano explained how these measures are impacting various sports industries, with golf especially vulnerable.

“Golf equipment company Topgolf Callaway Brands, which uses parts from China for some of its products, is anticipating a $5 million headwind on its EBITDA this year,” Pompliano shared as an example. “Additionally, Amer Sports, owner of Wilson Sporting Goods, generates 11% of its revenue via goods like balls and rackets from China. So tariffs on Chinese goods equate to $112 million of the company's $5.1 billion in sales.”

Though these sales impacts may seem relatively minor, they represent a surprising hit to an industry and sport Trump holds dear.

Year to date, Topgolf Callaway stock (MODG) is down 12%, while Amer (AS) stock has fallen 3%.

Sports fans who attend live events may also find themselves paying even more at the concession stand, adding to the already inflated prices many pay.

“Stadiums said in February that tariffs on supplies from Canada, Mexico, and China would apply to about $56 million in total sales, about three-tenths of 1%,” Pompliano said.

Though a large part of Trump's tariffs on Canada were delayed, should they go into effect, hockey fans could see some impact.

“25% of the league's revenue is driven by Canadian teams, and if Canadian tariffs reduce the value of the Canadian dollar compared to the US dollar, the league's Canadian-related businesses could feel some pain,” Pompliano continued, noting that all NHL players are paid in US dollars. “This means a weak Canadian dollar could have a material impact on the league's deals with Canadian entities.”

And those who invest in athletic-wear stocks may want to ensure they're invested in companies that don't rely heavily on imports from China for their products. Leaders like Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA), and On Holdings (ONON) are expected to weather this storm more easily than others, as they have diversified their supply chains away from China.

However, even Nike is facing uncertainty. Nike stock fell over 5% on Friday after the athletic apparel company said it expects fourth quarter gross margins to decline by 400 to 500 basis points, in part due to newly implemented tariffs.

Mar 22, 2025



Dad wasn't even 40 yet when he said, “I'm glad I didn't get a deer today.” I was 13, and I didn't understand why he said that. I failed to get a deer that day, and “disappointed” didn't adequately describe how I felt. For me, getting a deer was a lifelong goal, my highest priority, a validating accomplishment. I didn't just want a deer; I needed a deer to satisfy something within me. 

Long ago someone identified the five stages a hunter goes through in his hunting career: (1) the shooter stage, (2) the limiting-out stage, (3) the trophy stage, (4) the method stage, and (5) the sportsman stage. I first read about these stages in the 1980s, in an article by Charlie Alsheimer in Deer & Deer Hunting magazine. These stages are based on social research into what satisfies a hunter. No doubt, what satisfies a hunter at age 15 (the year I shot my first deer) is not the same as what satisfies a hunter at age 65. The stages are valid, but are they a hard-and-fast rule? 

Ever since I was 6 years old, I wanted to shoot a buck. Dad was far beyond me. Shooting a buck wasn't his satisfaction. His focus came to be on me getting a buck. Is there a “stage” where that is the priority? 

I spent many years in the “shooter” stage, but living in a state where the limit is one buck, I don't think I've ever been in the “limiting-out” stage. We either get a buck, or we don't. We have abundant antlerless tags, but filling every doe tag is not what satisfies many hunters. 

The so-called “trophy stage” isn't easy to identify, because the trophy is in the eye of the beholder. Shooting a nice, mature deer is always satisfying, but most hunters live where the odds of shooting a record-book trophy are low. 

What about the “method stage”? My preferred method is still-hunting, the way my father and my uncles hunted before stand-hunting became popular. I prefer being on the ground, one-on-one with the deer. I want to be where the deer can see me — and to be skilled enough to see him first. 

You probably have your preferred method for hunting deer. Most archers take to the trees in a strategic location. A few hunt from the ground. Is one method, in some sense, higher value than the other? Maybe, maybe not. In a few states, chasing deer with dogs is considered fair chase. Many hunters have killed deer during drives. Whether one method is superior to another depends partly on what “superior” means. Does superior mean a high-success rate? Does superior imply a degree of difficulty? We can debate these things, but we can never settle them. 

Today, I'm at least partly in the “sportsman” stage. I understand that I play an important role in my state game agency's efforts to manage all wildlife. But that's not the only reason I hunt, and it's a reason I'm seldom conscious of when I'm in the woods. 

In a 50-year span of time, a hunter's priorities change. Getting a deer is still the assumed goal of every hunter, but when something within him tells him he is hunting for more than a deer, he will be satisfied even if he doesn't get a deer. In the end, it's not his real goal.

How long will hunting still excite me? I don't know, but when rifle season rolls around, when we have a few inches of snow on the ground (but not stacked on tree limbs), when the temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees, and when the air is calm, I'm eager to play the age-old game of predator and prey — and I'm almost certain I'll get a buck. Many times, on days like that, my certainty has been fulfilled. And if I don't get a buck, I go home dog-tired — but still satisfied. 

I may hit a slump in my deer hunting, and if I do you'll never find me singing “I Can't Get No Satisfaction,” because I'm at the stage where I'm satisfied even if I don't get a buck.

Former Illini and Kansas City Royals second baseman Michael Massey was back in Champaign last November for an Illinois football game at Memorial Stadium.

Michael Massey, the highest drafted infielder in University of Illinois baseball history, celebrates his 27th birthday on Saturdya.

Chosen in the fourth round of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft by Kansas City, he's spent the last three seasons with the Royals, primarily playing second base. As a rookie in 2022, he debuted on July 15 and then started 46 of the 48 games in which he appeared.

This past season, Massey suffered with back pain in spring training and didn't make his first appearance with Kansas City until June 24. He played the final 100 games of the season and hit .259 with 14 home runs and 45 RBI. 

Team-wise, the Royals tied the Tigers for second place behind Cleveland in the American League Central Division. Kansas City then swept the Orioles in the Wild Card series but lost in four games to the Yankees in the AL Division series.

So far this spring, he's hitting above .300, occasionally adding outfield duties on defense to his regular spot at second base. 

The Royals play their season opener against the Cleveland Guardians this coming Thursday.

Here's a look at Massey's career, by the numbers:

➜ 3: Number of seasons Massey earned All-Big Ten honors (third team in 2017, second team in 2018 and first team in 2019).

➜ 6: His jersey number as an Illini.

Joey Wright outside Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee on Friday evening.

Friday in Milwaukee was a tad warmer than Thursday.

That was a good thing for all of the basketball fans who gathered in the Deer District across from Fiserv Forum to watch their favorite schools kick off their March Madness bids. Especially so for the Illini faithful, who outnumbered fans from other schools as far as I could tell on Friday evening. Even those from the rabid Kentucky fan base.

The Illini crowd at Uncle Buck's tried to cheer for Troy at the start of its game against Kentucky. That didn't work so well, with the Wildcats eventually crusing to a 76-57 win. Fortunately, Illinois fans were packed shoulder-to-shoulder at the multi-story bar and grill and had plenty in common to pass the time.

And cheers and chants were plentiful when Illinois' pep band and cheerleaders made their way through with some 90 minutes until tip-off, energizing the crowd further.

Lots of fun to be had in Brew City so far this week. We'll see what the weekend brings.

Players celebrate Friday after Parkland College upset No. 1-ranked Pima (Ariz.), 95-74, to punch its ticket to tonight's NJCAA Division II national championship game in Danville.

DANVILLE — The Pima Community College men's basketball team was the team to beat.

Ranked No. 1 in the country.

With a 34-0 record.

All signs pointed toward the Aztecs cruising to an NJCAA Division II national championship.

But none of that mattered to Parkland. The Cobras went into Friday night's national semifinal game as the fourth seed with belief. And came out as confident as ever after a convincing 95-74 win to advance to Saturday night's national championship game.

“We all just trusted each other,” Parkland sophomore Chandler Jackson said. “We knew we could beat them. As the clock winded down, it felt surreal. I knew from the minute we stepped on the floor that we could beat these guys. It was just an amazing moment.”

The Cobras (33-2) will play either third-seeddd Kirkwood (Iowa) or seventh-seeded Kalamazoo Valley at 7 p.m. on Saturday at Mary Miller Gym for the title.

It's Parkland's first trip to the national final since its runner-up finish in 1988, and the Cobras are going for their first championship since 1986.

“Parkland has a deep tradition,” Cobras coach John Bowler said. “Not just the fan base, but a group of tight-knit players who talk about it. Going back means a lot, but we obviously have another 40 to play.”

From the opening tip, the Cobras looked like a team on a mission. By the first media timeout, they were already ahead 14-4, and they stretched that advantage to as many as 18 points midway through the first half.

“Job's not finished,” Jackson said of their mindset after jumping out to that early lead. “We just had to keep it going the whole game.”

As halftime approached, however, Pima started to chip away at that deficit. Little by little, the Aztecs got back into the game, and Parkland's double-digit lead was only 44-38 at the break.

The Cobras knew this was coming. A team that earned the top seed and kept a zero in the loss column all year wasn't going to let them run away with it.

“They're a really good program,” Bowler said of Pima. “They're tough, big, physical, talented at every spot, deep and a great offensive team. Our guys knew the type of team we were playing, and they elevated themselves and played up to the standard and competition we asked for.”

The Aztecs got within four points just before the 10-minute mark, and that's when Parkland freshman Adam Squire caught fire from beyond the three-point arc. Just when it looked like Pima was on its way to taking its first lead, Squire buried three consecutive threes to put the Cobras back up by 15 points.

“I had a good game (Wednesday), so once I got in there, I knew I had to be aggressive,” Squire said. “Once I hit my first one, I knew I had the green light. Unconscious, really.”

From there, the Cobras (33-2) took off and ended the game with their largest lead.

Squire's 23 points off the bench, going 5 for 6 from deep, led the way. Drew Lewis Jr. scored 17 points, and Champaign native JaMonte Williams put up 16. Jackson dropped another 16 points while grabbing nine rebounds. Jaiden Martin recorded a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds.

In many ways, Friday's semifinal felt like the championship game, but the Cobras have one more to go. Their key in the 24 hours before then is to not get too high on this win, stay composed and play 40 more minutes of solid basketball.

“I'm a parrot right now, but we've been saying it all year: 81 minutes better than last year,” Bowler said. “On the board (Friday) was 80. We got that one back (Wednesday). Now, the board changes to 40. Our goal and our focus has been on those numbers the entire time. The guys see that. At the end of the day, the level is what it is. Everybody wants to be recruited and go to the next thing. These dudes in here are bought into each other, bought into what we've sold, our standard and our expectations. All the credit goes to them.”

Back Row: Tytrel Mosley, Taevon Felley, Cale Hansen, Sam Moser, Zach Jorgensen

Nik Moser is a track guy.

Moser, Fort Dodge's football coach, and former Iowa State defensive back, knows all about track.

In high school Moser was a four-time state champion. He won the 200-meter dash twice and 400-meter low hurdles twice.

Now Moser will head back to his roots on the track as Fort Dodge's boys coach.

There's not a lot of restructuring or teaching fundamentals in track. 

So for Moser, it's simple — having guys that want to compete.

“The biggest thing is competing,” Moser said. “It's about running to beat your previous best time.

“The goal is to be running your best at the end of the season and competing against yourself to get better.”

Moser takes over for Kevin Astor, after being an assistant for two seasons.

“The thing about track is every sport a kid competes in, they run,” Moser said. “We have a lot of baseball, football and basketball players out.

“They see the benefits of running and competing.”

Moser, whos dad Sam, was Fort Dodge's track coach for 20-plus years.

“The biggest thing is, I want multiple sports kids,” Moser said. “We have football, baseball, wrestling and basketball players out competing and getting better.”

Moser returns two state qualifiers in juniors Noah Daniel and Dalton Eckley.

Daniel competed in both the 100 and 200 meter dash, while Eckley was a state qualifier in the high jump.

“Both Noah and Dalton earned some state experience,” Moser said. “We have guys coming back that compete and that we will rely on heavily.”

Returning letterwinners for the Dodgers are Mason Bolton, Kyree Rochon, Jayce Point, Joe Constable, Tytrel Mosley, Taevon Feeley, Cael Hansen, Sam Moser and Zak Jorgensen.

According to Moser, senior Hunter Richardson can run anything from 200s to 800s and hurdles. Senior Rylan Kingrey will be part of sprints, relays and the long jump.

Also in the junior class is Mosley, along with a sophomore group of football kids. Sophomores Rochon, Tru McBride, Constable and Moser will also be key contributors.

“We have a good group of distance kids,” Moser said. “Hansen (sophomore) can run anything from a 400 to two miles and is solid at the 800. 

“Point (sophomore) can run in the 400, 800 and 1600.”

The Dodgers will field a solid group of throwers as well, led by Constable and junior Luke Fierke. 

Sophomore Kellin Crouse, along with freshmen Brody Maehl, Nolan Arends and Memphis Donahe will also be in the pits.

“We have about eight or nine throwers competing,” Moser said. “Joe and Luke have the most experience.”

Freshmen Luke Beckley, Avery Bryne, Myles Summers, and Joseph Petersen will be key newcomers.

“I think we will have some good sprints, 4×800 and distance medley,” Moser said. “We have two sophomores in the 800 that can go two-flat.

“I think we have a good balance of sprinters and distance guys.”

With Eckley in the high jump, also competing will be Bolton (sophomore) and freshman Amari McCaleb.

Kingrey, junior Zain Rowe and Moser will take part in the long jump.

“I feel like we have a good balance where we can move things around,” Moser said. “Guys like Noah, we can put in the 200, 4×1 or 4×2, sprint medley or the 4×4. 

“We want to work on things for Drake and want the kids to be successful.”

Moser will be assisted by John McBride and Kyron Wilson. McBride was the boys track coach for 15 years before Astor.

Correspondent photo / Robert Hayes. Youngstown State offensive lineman Jaison Williams competes in a drill with a Cleveland Browns scout during YSU's pro day at the WATTS on Friday afternoon.

YOUNGSTOWN — For many who play and love football, getting to the NFL is always a dream.

Few ever get the opportunity to play college football, while even fewer are given the opportunity to make it to the NFL.

A couple nights ago, Youngstown State running back Tyshon King was making his final preparations for YSU's annual pro day on Friday when he came to the realization of the position that he found himself in. 

Inside the Watson and Tressel Training Site, after countless jumps, sprints and drills, King sat down on the turf and tears trickled down his face as he began to reflect. 

“I just started crying, just thinking about how far I've come, all the losses I took in life, the things I had to go through growing up. But it all paid off,” King said. “I'm here in this position, in a position to make a name for myself and put my name out for these franchises, and I feel like I did that.”

King, offensive lineman Jaison Williams and defensive end Hunter Allen each went through a myriad of NFL Combine-style drills on Friday in front of scouts from the Cleveland Browns and Jacksonville Jaguars.

Four non-YSU players also participated in the pro day, including Grove City receiver Scott Fraser, Ohio Dominican receiver Daishaun Hill, Kenyon College defensive end Andrew Canonico and Robert Morris linebacker Keon Freeman, who spent most of his career at YSU before transferring to join the Colonials prior to the 2024 season.

Each player went through drills consisting of the vertical jump, the bench press, the broad jump, the 40-yard dash, the shuttle run and the three-cone drill, while some went through other position-specific drills. 

“I feel like I came out here and had a really good day,” King said. “I feel really confident for my future as far as playing in the NFL. I just feel a lot of gratitude for everybody who helped me along the way because I didn't get here by myself. I just feel thankful, by the grace of God, that I'm still here today. I'm just happy to be here. I'm just happy to have this opportunity.”

King posted strong numbers across the board, with a 33.5 inch vertical jump, 19 reps on the bench press and a 4.7 40-yard dash. Williams showcased his footwork, agility and strength as a lineman, while Allen had the best broad jump of the three at 9-feet, 11-inches. However, Allen pulled up with an injury during his second 40-yard dash attempt, and was forced to sit out the rest of the drills.

“I felt like I had a really solid day,” Williams said. “Some areas we definitely could have done better, but overall, I felt good. I feel really satisfied walking off the field today.”

Since the end of the season in November, Williams has spent his time in New Castle, Pa., training and working out at Grossetti Performance to prepare for pro day and the draft. 

Now that the pro day is in the rear view mirror, Williams said he'll remain in the area to train and work out until the draft rolls along April 24-26.

“Now we can switch from combine training to just more football stuff, film room and getting touched up in that area,” Williams said. “Getting back more in football shape, as opposed to Olympic running.”

Meanwhile, King took some time to get healthy after battling through some injuries during the season before he began working out to prepare for the pro day. 

“The scouts all told me I had a really good day,” King said. “They told me I looked good, so that's a boost of confidence. But now it's just back to work, staying in shape and when draft weekend comes, just hope I'm one of those guys that gets drafted. And if not, one of those guys that signs a free agent deal, and if not, then one of those guys that gets a rookie minicamp invite.”

The Penguins have established a pattern of success with players making their way to the NFL in recent years. 

Tight end Kevin Rader signed as an undrafted free agent with the Green Bay Packers in 2018, then tight end Andrew Ogletree was drafted in the sixth round by the Indianapolis Colts in 2022. 

More recently, record-breaking running back Jaleel McLaughlin signed with the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent in 2023 and has been on Denver's 53-man roster the past two seasons, while wide receiver Bryce Oliver signed as an undrafted free agent with the Tennessee Titans last year and was called up to the 53-man roster from the practice squad midway through the 2024 season. 

Each of their successes have given players like King, Williams and Allen a blueprint for how to get to the next level. 

“It definitely lets you know that it can happen, because when you come in, you feel like the NFL is so far away,” Williams said. “But when you see guys that you were going to battle with every Saturday make it, it kind of makes it more tangible, more real. Definitely seeing those guys inspires me and pushes me to get up there with them.”

South Dakota State's Madison Mathiowetz takes a jumper during the Summit League Championship game against Oral Roberts on March 9 at the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

BROOKINGS, S.D. — Sleepy Eye St. Mary's graduate Madison Mathiowetz is not unfamiliar with playing in big games.

After making it to the Minnesota State Class A Girls Basketball Tournament in 2021 as a high school junior, Mathiowetz is now in her junior year of college with the South Dakota State Jackrabbits and will be competing in her third consecutive NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament Saturday.

Playing in the big games is one thing, but making a run is another.

Mathiowetz and the No. 10 Jackrabbits (29-3) will look to start that tournament run when they take on the No. 7 Oklahoma State Cowgirls (25-6) in a first-round matchup at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut.

“They are a physical team,” Mathiowetz said. “They actually play a super fast and up-tempo game, which is very similar to like Oral Roberts in our conference, so we've gotten to see that before, but it's a tough offense to play against considering we like to control the tempo and slow it down and play within our offense and our system. So I think it'll just be slowing them down and not letting them get hot, just playing our defense, playing our game and not letting them rush us, that'll be the biggest challenge, but it's definitely something that we can overcome.”

The Cowgirls are led by 5-11 sophomore guard Stailee Heard's 16.7 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. Heard is also shooting 47.8% from the floor and 40.9% from beyond the arc. Micah Gray, a 5-8 junior guard, adds 13.8 ppg for the Cowgirls, while 5-8 senior guard Anna Gret Asi averages 11.7 ppg.

Mathiowetz, a 5-10 guard, averages 8.7 ppg this season for her Jackrabbits, fourth on the team. The Jackrabbits are led by 6-2 junior forward Brooklyn Meyer's 17.4 ppg and 5.8 rpg. Redshirt junior and 5-11 guard Haleigh Timmer is adding 13.1 ppg, while 5-6 senior guard Paige Meyer is scoring 12 ppg.

As a team, South Dakota State has outscored opponents this season 76.3 ppg to 61.4 ppg while outshooting them 48.3% to 38.5%. The Jackrabbits are averaging 12.7 turnovers per game.

Oklahoma State is outscoring opponents 76.7 ppg to 60 ppg while outshooting them 45% to 36.7%. The Cowgirls are averaging 15 turnovers per game.

The Jackrabbits, winners of three consecutive Summit League Tournament championships, were the ninth seed in the NCAA tourney in 2023 and defeated eighth-seeded USC in a first-round matchup before falling to top-seeded Virginia Tech in the second round. Last year, the Jackrabbits were seeded 12th and fell in the first round to fifth-seeded Utah. 

After those two straight appearances, Mathiowetz said the team is looking to build on them and bring a more confident level of play this year.

“I think last year we got a really good taste again of the NCAA Tournament and what that feels like and the competitiveness and the level that we need to play at to succeed there,” Mathiowetz said. “I think just going into this year's, knowing that we had a great nonconference, obviously we ran the table in the conference season, just knowing that we have the ability and we have the skill to make a run for it in this tournament is huge for us. That confidence will be huge for us come game time.”

Mathiowetz was the ironwoman for the Jackrabbits last year as she led the team in minutes played with 798, an average of 30.2 minutes per game. She was also third on the team in both scoring (11.5 ppg) and assists (2.5 apg).

Mathiowetz is still well involved in the Jackrabbits' game plan and has started all 32 games she's played this season, but she's seen the team become more developed with more options to step in off the bench. This season, Mathiowetz is averaging 24.9 mpg.

“Obviously last year was a little bit of a different season with a lower number of girls on our team,” Mathiowetz said. “This year I think we have so much talent and so much depth, and it's honestly been the biggest blessing and it's the biggest strength of our team. …

“The difference in minutes isn't much, but it also helps us stay fresh and play our best basketball throughout the entire game and I think that's been huge coming down at the end of games and in tough stretches that we've been able to come out on top of. So I think continuing to be a solid leader, a solid presence out there, but also knowing that you don't have to be perfect every game is nice to kind of have that and have those girls behind you.”

No women's team in history seeded below three has ever won the National Tournament. If the Jackrabbits want to make a Cinderella run and make history, Mathiowetz said continuing the team's consistency and relying on their coaching staff, captained by head coach Aaron Johnston, will be key.

“I think our consistency as a team and our coaching staff does such a great job of preparing us and getting us mentally and physically ready to play some of these teams from some of the best conferences across the country,” Mathiowetz said. “And I just think our consistency in practice, our ability to constantly be competitive with each other and make each other better is something that will really help us when we got to play these tough schools and tough teams in March, the best time.”

Brink's 31 Points Lead Panama Boys Into Class D Final 

BINGHAMTON — At the start of the basketball season, Panama head coach Ed Nelson wrote the No. 25 on a board in his classroom, knowing his Panthers would need to play that many games to get to the state final.

When they left school Thursday, that number stood at two.

Now it's down to one.

Senior Carter Brink had 31 points, eight assists, four rebounds and three steals to lead Panama to the first New York State Public High School Athletic Association championship game in program history with a 74-53 win over Section III's Sackets Harbor in a semifinal Friday at Visions Veterans Memorial Arena.

“We all realize that the job is not done yet. We still have work to do,” Brink said postgame. “Get a good night's sleep and come back tomorrow ready to go.”

Panama will take on Section XI's Bridgehampton in today's 6 p.m. championship game. The Killer Bees beat Section II's Loudonville Christian 63-53 in Friday's first semifinal.

“They bring a lot of energy. It's another man-to-man team, very quick and very physical,” Brink said of Bridgehampton. “That's the way we play too, so we're excited for the matchup.”

The Panthers took control from the outset of their game, leading 1-0 before the game technically began as Brink sank a free throw after the Patriots were assessed a technical foul for dunking during warmups.

Panama led 19-10 after the first quarter as senior Alex Barmore gave them that nine-point lead on a bucket with 1:30 remaining in the period.

“We knew they'd be coming in playing man to man. … We always like speed matchups. We feel like we're a very fast team and we can play fast,” Brink said. “We love it when a team plays man to man because we feel like we get good shots against them.”

Sackets Harbor hung around during the second quarter as seniors Marcus Castine and Dylan Aubert each had a pair of 3-pointers during the frame.

“Scouting report said that they weren't a great perimeter shooting basketball team. Contrary to the scouting report, No. 4 comes in and lights it up for five treys,” Nelson said of Aubert.

The Patriots cut their deficit to as few as six with 1:48 left in the first half, but free throws from Brink and senior Bryce Hinsdale pushed the Panthers' lead back to eight at halftime.

“We scouted them pretty well. We knew exactly what was coming at us,” Nelson said of Sackets Harbor, which eventually switched to some zone defense. ” … One of the luxuries we have is playing some really good basketball coaches in our league. Playing against Cory Emory's 2-3 defense late in the season, you can't get much more prepared than that.”

Brink hit a 3-pointer on Panama's first possession of the third quarter and Hinsdale followed with a bucket to make it a 44-31 game. Brink finished the quarter with a three-point play as the Panthers took a 56-40 lead, but Aubert hit another 3-pointer at the buzzer to keep hope alive for Sackets Harbor.

“He's a versatile player who can score at all levels. … Big-time players have to play great in big-time moments,” Nelson said of Brink. “Shout-out to Baker Mayfield … we woke up feeling dangerous this morning. Hopefully we wake up with the same feeling tomorrow.”

Nelson's Panama teams lost fourth-quarter leads in each of their semifinal appearances in 2016 and 2019. 

In fact, six years ago, the Panthers led by four in the closing seconds in the same Binghamton arena they were in Friday before a four-point play sent that game into overtime where they later lost.

But Barmore converted a three-point play with 4:57 left this time and Brink later hit a 3-pointer to make it a 21-point game before both coaches began to empty their benches.

“Nelson deserves this,” Brink said. ” … This is his last year, we want to make sure he's going to end on a bang. We're going to do everything we can to make that possible.”

Now Nelson, who has said that this season will be his last of 18 on the Panama varsity bench, hopes their final game of 25 ends in the school's first championship.

“We definitely had some ghosts. We've found some big ways to lose on this stage, so it feels good,” Nelson said. “Our end goal wasn't to win this game. We'll go out there and battle tomorrow, and see what happens.

“This is the end for me,” he added. “I've got one more to go.”

NOTES: Barmore had 13 points, nine rebounds and two steals; Hinsdale had 12 points, six rebounds and six assists; and senior Tate Catanese had 8 points and seven rebounds for Panama, which shot 30 of 58 from the field, including 4 of 12 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 10 times. … The Panthers scored 11 points off 10 Sackets Harbor turnovers and allowed just 2 second-chance points. … Panama was credited with a 38-29 rebounding advantage. “Our breakdown … right before we go out there is ‘Eat glass,'” Nelson said. “It's kind of our mantra … If we do that, we're pretty successful.” … Castine had 26 points, eight rebounds and three assists; Aubert had 21 points and four rebounds; and Ethan Tracy had nine rebounds and two steals for Sackets Harbor, which shot 18 of 55 from the field, including 7 of 26 from 3-point range. … Bridehampton took a 21-19 with 3:54 remaining in the second quarter and led the rest of the way in Friday's first semifinal against Loudonville Christian. The game was close throughout, but Killer Bees led or were tied for all but 1:11 of the contest.

Southwest Minnesota State University shortstop Abby Russell slides into third base during a Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference softball game against Minnesota Crookston on Friday at Mattke Field in Marshall.

MARSHALL — In its first official Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference action of the season, the Southwest Minnesota State University earned a split against Minnesota Crookston on Friday at Mattke Field. The Mustangs held on despite a fourth-inning rally from the Golden Eagles to snag a 9-8 victory in the first game before their own rally fell short, 6-5, in the rematch.

Just a year after finishing 19-32, Friday's results bring SMSU's record up to 19-9 this season. 

“They've just done a good job of competing,” SMSU head coach Bailey Bouman said. “We had a great spring trip. We competed, we played a lot of games and then we came out here and competed hard for a doubleheader. Obviously game two maybe didn't go how we wanted, but at the end of the day, we competed and we gave ourselves opportunities.”

SMSU had played games against Bemidji State, Minnesota Duluth and St. Cloud State earlier in the season, but all four were played as non-conference games.

The Mustangs will return to action at Mattke Field today at noon when they host Bemidji State for another pair of NSIC matchups. Both today's and Friday's games were originally scheduled to be played on the road, but were relocated to Marshall due to inclement weather. As such, the Mustangs will be batting in the top of the inning again today. 



Game 1

SMSU 9, 

UMC 8

SMSU held a 9-3 lead with two outs in the bottom of the fourth when Crookston made a game out of it. Jocelyn Hernandez was the first runner to reach base on a walk, Chayse Doering reached on an error by Riley Kramolisch and Madisen Yandle walked to load the bases. 

Rayna French broke the tension by driving in a pair of runs on an error by Abby Russell and Hannah Trzinski singled to drive in another pair. Irelyn Spencer drove in Trzinski on the third Mustang error of the inning and the second by Russell, but Jordyn Marsh relieved Karlie Miller and struck out Bryanna Decker to leave the tying run stranded.

Marsh pitched lights-out for the game's remaining three innings, holding the Golden Eagles to two walks, no other baserunners and striking out a pair of batters to help SMSU hold on to its one-run lead. The result improved Marsh's record to 6-2 on the season.

“She's done a good job of, like you said, staying composed in those situations,” Bouman said of Marsh. “She pounded the strike zone and gave our defense opportunities to get outs. She's just kind of been that steady kind of closing role for us right now, and she's done a really good job. Nothing rattles her too much.”

The Mustangs struck first with a pair of first-inning runs. Kramolisch singled up the middle to lead off the game, advanced to third on a wild pitch and an Abby Boxrud bunt, and scored on an Abby Russell single. Boxrud then also went on to score on a Paris Van Dyke ground out to make the score 2-0 in favor of the Mustangs.

In the second, SMSU's lead ballooned to 7-0. Karlie Miller singled and Lexi Ingalls doubled before Kaylee Hafermann followed up with another RBI single when Crookston pulled Sydney McMurdie for Charlotte Dombrowski.

Still, the Mustangs continued to rally. Boxrud drove in Ingalls with a single and Russell tripled to right-center field to drive in the third and fourth runs of the frame. Russell then scored on an Emma Humpal sacrifice fly to make the score 7-0.

“They did a good job of being aggressive, but selectively aggressive,” Bouman said of the rally. “They did a good job of looking for their pitch and then jumping on it when they found it, and then executing. When you get people on base, you've got to find ways to score them. I thought we did a good job of hitting the ball hard and finding ways to score runs.”

McMurdie was charged with five earned runs on six hits over one inning in the start, dropping her to 3-3 on the season, while Dombrowski allowed two earned and two unearned runs over the game's final six innings. She allowed six hits and one walk in the relief appearance.

Boxrud led SMSU with three hits in the game while Russell and Miller each recorded a single and a double. Russell's three RBIs were a game-high.

Crookston answered SMSU's rally with a run of their own in the bottom of the frame, with Haley Koch driving in Trzinski on a sacrifice fly. Still, SMSU continued to extend its cushion to eight runs in the third when Boxrud and Kramolisch singled before being driven in when Russell reached base on an error by Hernandez.

Miller was tagged for three earned and five unearned runs in her start, going 3 2/3 before leaving with a no-decision. She struck out two batters while giving up three hits and six walks.  



Game 2

UMC 6,

SMSU 5

Minnesota Crookston took the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning by capitalizing on a handful of SMSU miscues. Yandle started off the frame by reaching on an error by second baseman Lexi Ingalls and got to third base on a Trzinski single. From there, Spencer popped a ball up to center field, but Hafermann lost it in the sun and Yandle scored to make the score 3-2.

Decker kept the rally going when she hit a slow grounder to third. SMSU catcher Grace Anderson tagged Trzinski out, but Crookston challenged the play and the out was overturned after the officiating crew ruled the play baserunner interference. Koch then drove in Spencer on a fielder's choice to make the score 5-2.

Morgyn Otte was charged with the loss, dropping her record to 6-3 on the season after allowing five unearned runs in the five-inning outing. She surrendered five hits and a pair of walks while striking out a pair of batters. Marsh also allowed one earned run on one hit in an inning of relief.

SMSU came back within a run when Van Dye walked, advanced to second on a Webber bunt and scored when Ireland made a throwing error after fielding Anderson's bunt at third. Kramolisch also drove in Webber on a ground out to second, but another ground out from Boxrud left runners stranded on second and third.

Crookston got another run in the bottom of the sixth when Hafermann misplayed a fly ball to center field. Hafermann tried to slide to make the grab, but the ball bounced past her and Doering rounded the bases for an inside-the-park solo home run to give the Golden Eagles a 6-4 lead heading into the final frame.

With their backs against the wall, the Mustangs started the final frame strong with a triple from Russell. Humpal drove in Russell on a sacrifice fly to right field, but a line out and ground out from Van Dyke and Webber ended the game with SMSU falling one run shy.

Russell and Anderson each had a pair of hits for the Mustangs, including an extra-base hit for each, while Van Dyke walked twice. Anderson and Humpal also drove in three and two runs, respectively.

Delaney Penner improved to 4-0 in the circle for Crookston, allowing one earned and three unearned runs over 5 1/3 innings. She gave up four hits and five walks while striking out a pair of Mustangs. In relief, Alexa Guilford earned her third save of the season after giving up one earned run on one hit over 1 2/3 frames.

SMSU scored the game's first run when Kramolisch hit a leadoff single before scoring on a Humpal sacrifice fly. 

Crookston claimed its first lead of the day in the third inning. Koch led off the frame with a ground-rule double and scored on a throwing error from Humpal at third base on a Doering bunt. Doering advanced to third on a French single and Otte fumbled a slow bouncer up the middle from Trzinski to allow Doering to score.

Van Dyke gave SMSU a tying run in the fourth when she drew a leadoff walk and scored on an Anderson double.

Mar 22, 2025



BELLAIRE — RL Strength and Conditioning partnered with the Wheeling Miners indoor football team to provide a safe after-school activity for children of the Ohio Valley.

“This is a major collaboration with our Wheeling indoor football team, the Miners. I got to speak with coach Rez (Josh Resignalo), and we collaborated. They wanted to come because they care about the community,” RL Strength and Conditioning owner and operator Rick Leigh said. “They wanted to come over and see the youth, so we collaborated. And we're here today to help train the youth. It's a beautiful thing when the community can come together like this, for the youth of the Ohio Valley,” Leigh said.

Leigh added that the reason he created RL Strength and Conditioning was due to him growing up in Section 8 housing and didn't have a positive outlet after school. 

“We were poor and had no money. All the kids that I grew up with were going to football camp, basketball camp or paying private trainers and I didn't have that type of money,” he said.

“I've been through a lot of drama in my life, a lot of things that would knock a lot of people out of the game, and I made it through the storms. I just want to come back and help the youth make it through their storms and show them there is a way. Because when I was little, if I had a program like this, it would have saved me.”

Resignalo said that events like the one with RL Strength and Conditioning are crucial for the team so it can show the community it plays an active role in the community. 

“We actually do a lot of stuff in the community, we got to a lot of schools, a lot of elementary schools, we try to get involved as much as possible in the community.”

During the event, RL Strength and Conditioning volunteers and players from the Wheeling Miners broke the kids in attendance into several different groups to do several different drills. 

“We do weight training, agility drills, boxing, the agility ladder, box hops, and then after that, we break it down into cardio and plyometrics. We then hit the kids with the cardio and plyometrics to get them ready for their sports that they do in school,” Leigh said. “And then at the end, I come up with some games for them to play where they don't realize they're actually doing sprint drills and a lot of cardio and keep them in shape.”

RL Strength and Conditioning holds free events for children every Wednesday and then every other Saturday at the Bellaire Presbyterian Church at 3599 Guernsey St., across from Bellaire High School from 5-7 p.m. 

Leigh added that he tries to get at least one special guest per month like the Wheeling Miners were this month. 

“I try to set that up at least once a month, I try to do business owners, politicians, mayors. We've had pro boxers, and pro football players, so I try to give them a variety of everything. We've even had rappers and singers come in, just because not all kids are the same. Not everybody's going to the NFL or NBA, but maybe there's somebody that in the community doing good that can spark them kids and give them motivation to pull themselves out of whatever they're in and do great,” Leigh said. 

He added that RL Strength and Conditioning is a nonprofit organization and if anyone would like to donate to support it, they can find RL on Facebook at RL Strength & Conditioning, Inc.

The winter sports season was full of success for our local boys and girls, though no basketball or hockey squad advanced further than the quarterfinals.

The dominant run in skiing continued in northern Michigan however after the Harbor Springs girls brought home the division 2 state championship for the first time since 2015, and the Traverse City Central girls took back the division one crown, winning for the first time in 3 years and making if a 4-year run that either west or central has won.

The Petoskey hockey team made an incredible turnaround this year, at one point they had a losing record and had lost five games in a row, but turned it around and made a run to the quarterfinals, they hoisted a regional championship trophy after beating St. Francis, before falling 5-2 to Alpena in the quarters.

Sault Ste. Marie is a case of a team playing their best hockey at the right time, they finished the year with a losing record, though eight of their losses were by two goals or less. they dominated Escanaba 4-0 for the regional title, before losing 3-0 to Plainesdale Jeffers in the quarterfinals.

Chris Givens went into his 33rd season at traverse city central, and the long-time head coach led his squad to another incredible playoff run, central ended the year 14-14, but they would shut out both of their opening playoff opponents but fell in a heartbreaker 1-0 against Grandville in the quarters.

In basketball two girls' teams stood above the rest for our local squads.

St. Ignace reached the quarterfinals now two years in a row, this year would be dominant. They won 22 straight games, finishing 25-2, they rolled Pickford for the district final, beat Inland Lakes 80-39 in regional finals, but lost to Ewen-Trout Creek 47-37 in the quarterfinals.

Frankfort sought to improve on an empty trip to the Breslin in 2024 and would have a great year once again. they finished 18-7, topping Gaylord St. Mary 48-30 for a regional crown, but lost to a strong Fowler team in the quarters

In boys' basketball there were solid runs across divisions.

Pickford went 23-3 on the year winning 16 straight, and though they ended the regular season with a loss they rolled through the playoffs, claiming the regional title after beating Harbor Light Christian, but lost a heartbreaker in overtime of the quarterfinals, losing 45-43 to Crystal Falls Forest Park.

Bellaire also had a strong year that resulted in a trip to the quarterfinals, they finished 22-5 after going to regional finals the prior season but fell to Fowler 65-27 in the quarters this year.

McBain was coming off a final four overtime loss and kept the bar high, they finished this year 23-3 including 12 straight wins, they claimed a regional crown against Beal City but would ultimately fall to Ishpeming Westwood 48-40 in the quarters.","{'href': 'https://www.9and10news.com', 'title': '9 & 10 News'}"

Mar 22, 2025



NORMAN, Okla. — Jan Jensen teared up when she reflected on the moment.

Iowa's head coach was an assistant for 24 years at the school before getting promoted ahead of this season. She enjoyed being assistant head coach for Lisa Bluder, though she acknowledged that she has been questioned over the years for staying and not taking other opportunities.

Jensen held out and got her dream job when Bluder retired. Now, she has led the Hawkeyes to the NCAA Tournament. Third-seeded Iowa will play No. 14 Murray State on Saturday.

She struggled to find the words at first when she thought about her journey.

“I don't even know why I'm choked up,” she said. “I think that tells you all you need to know, maybe.”

Jensen, 56, spoke passionately about the challenge of keeping the Hawkeyes winning. Caitlin Clark and Kate Martin are now in the WNBA after leading Iowa to the national title game the past two seasons.

“I'm just a really thankful coach that got a shot later in life,” she said. “And we're having a blast. And I hope we get to have a blast for at least another game and get another shot at the next game.”

Tourney rematch

In the late game Saturday, No. 3 seed Oklahoma will host No. 14 Florida Gulf Coast in a rematch of what was nearly one of the biggest upsets of last year's tournament.

The fifth-seeded Sooners barely held on for a 73-70 win over the 12th-seeded Eagles in Bloomington, Indiana last year. FGCU led 35-33 at halftime.

The biggest difference for the Sooners is that 6-foot-4 Raegan Beers, who led Oregon State to the Elite Eight last season, has transferred in and been dominant. She could pose a problem for the undersized Eagles,

FGCU still has its star. Emani Jefferson, the Atlantic Sun Player of the Year, had 22 points and 12 rebounds against the Sooners in last year's game.

Style contrast

Florida Gulf Coast, which is on a 23-game win streak, allows just 53.2 points per game — eighth-best nationally. Oklahoma, which has won nine of 10, ranks fourth in scoring with 85.2 points per contest.

“I think this will be a fun matchup, seeing as they're a really good defensive team, and I think we're a really good offensive team,” Oklahoma's Payton Verhulst said.

Beers said the Eagles do it with energy.

“From what I've seen and what we've worked on this week especially, they're relentless,” Beers said. “They're a relentless team. They're constantly coming after you. They're really, really scrappy.”

Traveling fans

Oklahoma coach Jennie Baranczyk knows full well how serious Iowa's fanbase is.

She's from Iowa and played for the Hawkeyes. Even without Clark, they averaged nearly 15,000 for home games this season.

Now, she's excited for those fans to come down and support women's basketball. Iowa has the early game on Saturday, so many of their fans likely will stay for the second game.

“Iowa has done a great job,” Baranczyk said. “Even after graduating a superstar in Caitlin Clark, they're still selling out. I'm proud of that, being from there. And at the same time, I know that that's also going to challenge our fans to be able to show up as well. So I'm excited to be able to see just our sport on a national level and be highlighted here in the Lloyd Noble Center tomorrow, whether it's the 11:00 game or the 1:30 game.”

Baranczyk hopes the crowd will cheer for the Sooners because of the Iowa connection.

“I'm sure they'll cheer for us,” she quipped.

A different Katelyn

Instead of featuring a high-scoring Caitlin, the Hawkeyes have to play against one.

Katelyn Young moved into 14th place on the all-time Division I scoring list and surpassed 3,000 career points in the Missouri Valley Conference title game, a 34-point barrage against Belmont. She averages 22.2 points per game on nearly 56% shooting from the field.

She has help — the team leads the nation with 87.8 points per game.

“I think they're here for a reason,” Olsen said. “No random team just makes March Madness. So that's important to note. They have a 3,000-point scorer on their team. Not a lot of people do that in their career. They play so fast. They just shoot the ball well. They're going to be tough.”

New Iowa scorer

Though it will be the first time since 2019 that the Hawkeyes play in the tournament without Clark, Lucy Olsen has picked up much of the slack this season to help them return. She averages 18 points, 3.6 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game. She averaged 23.3 points per game at Villanova last season before transferring.

Panama's Carter Brink drives to the basket during Friday's NYSPHSAA Class D semifinal against Sackets Harbor at Visions Veterans Memorial Arena in Binghamton. Brink led all scorers with 31 points as the Panthers won 74-53.

BINGHAMTON – At the start of the basketball season, Panama head coach Ed Nelson wrote the No. 25 on a board in his classroom, knowing his Panthers would need to play that many games to get to the state final.

When they left school Thursday, that number stood at two.

Now it's down to one.

Senior Carter Brink had 31 points, eight assists, four rebounds and three steals to lead Panama to the first New York State Public High School Athletic Association championship game in program history with a 74-53 win over Section III's Sackets Harbor at midday Friday at Visions Veterans Memorial Arena.

Panama will take on Section XI's Bridgehampton in Saturday's 6 p.m. championship game. The Killer Bees beat Section II's Loudonville Christian 63-53 in Friday's first semifinal.

The Panthers took control from the outset of their game, leading 1-0 before the game technically began as Brink sank a free throw after the Patriots were assessed a technical foul for dunking during warmups.

Panama led 19-10 after the first quarter as senior Alex Barmore gave them that nine-point lead on a bucket with 1:30 remaining in the period.

Sackets Harbor hung around during the second quarter as seniors Marcus Castine and Dylan Aubert each had a pair of 3-pointers during the frame.

The Patriots cut their deficit to as few as six with 1:48 left in the first half, but free throws from Brink and senior Bryce Hinsdale pushed the Panthers' lead back to eight at halftime.

Brink then hit a 3-pointer on Panama's first possession of the third quarter and Hinsdale followed with a bucket to make it a 44-31 game. Brink finished the quarter with a three-point play as the Panthers took a 56-40 lead, but Aubert hit another 3-pointer at the buzzer to keep hope alive for Sackets Harbor.

Nelson's Panama teams lost fourth-quarter leads in each of their semifinal appearances in 2016 and 2019. In fact, six years ago, the Panthers led by four in the closing seconds in the same Binghamton arena they were in Friday before a four-point play sent that game into overtime where they later lost.

But Barmore converted a three-point play with 4:57 left Friday and Brink later hit a 3-pointer to make it a 21-point game before both coaches began to empty their benches.

Now Nelson, who has announced that this season will be his last of 18 on the Panama varsity bench, will hope their final game of 25 ends in the school's first championship.

NOTES: Barmore had 13 points, nine rebounds and two steals; Hinsdale had 12 points, six rebounds and six assists; and senior Tate Catanese had 8 points and seven rebounds for Panama, which shot 30 of 58 from the field, including 4 of 12 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 10 times. … The Panthers scored 11 points off 10 Sackets Harbor turnovers and allowed just 2 second-chance points. … Castine had 26 points, eight rebounds and three assists; Aubert had 21 points and four rebounds; and Ethan Tracy had nine rebounds and two steals for Sackets Harbor, which shot 18 of 55 from the field, including 7 of 26 from 3-point range. … Bridehampton took a 21-19 with 3:54 remaining in the second quarter and led the rest of the way in Friday's first semifinal against Loudonville Christian. The game was close throughout, but Killer Bees led or were tied for all but 1:11 of the contest.

HOUGHTON — With the Great Lakes Hockey League regular season title potentially on the line, the top seed in the league's playoff tournament in play, and one last chance to beat their rivals from just up the road, the Portage Lake Pioneers needed a comeback. They got just that, scoring two goals in a span of 11:02 to defeat the Calumet Wolverines, 2-1, at Dee Stadium Thursday night.

“Any time you can be the one-seed in this league, it's a huge advantage going into the tournament next weekend, for sure,” said Pioneers defenseman Ross Rouleau.

Rouleau would know a thing or two about beating the Wolverines. He has scored multiple game-winning goals against them in both regular season games and Gibson Cup games.

Thursday was no exception. The Pioneers drew a late-game power play with just over three and a half minutes remaining, and they kept the pressure on Calumet goaltender Matthew Ryynanen, who had been stellar prior to that point in the game.

Rouleau himself had two different looks from the high left circle on the man advantage, but Ryynanen fought them both off. A third look by Rouleau from the left boards near the hash marks found a hole and beat the Wolverines netminder at 18:32.

“Not much,” said Rouleau, when he was asked about what he saw when he got the puck along the boards. “I just saw the goalie was down, so I tried to get it up.”

With the win, the Pioneers improved to 15-1-0-1 overall, good for 31 points. A win Saturday over the Dane County Dairy Kings guarantees them the top seed.

“Any time you can beat Calumet (is big),” Rouleau said. “We're huge rivals. We love playing each other. I can't wait for the Gibson Cup. It'll be packed. It'll be a fun game.”

The game went into the third period 0-0, thanks in large part to 22 saves by Ryynanen through the first 40 minutes. Wolverines captain Logan Rastello could not have been happier with where the game was at as the old rivals took to the ice for the final frame.

“I was happy with it,” he said. “I mean, we had great goaltending. We came out hungry. 

“That's the best I think we looked all year, and perfect timing, right before playoffs, right before the Gibson Cup.”

The Wolverines dropped to 7-8-2-0 with the loss, but there was plenty for the team to feel good about with the way they played.

“We know we've got at least three, counting tonight, three games against the Pioneers coming up,” Rastello said. “We assume we're going to run into them in the playoffs. We assume. We're hoping the Gibson Cup goes three. We're assuming the Gibson cup goes three games. So (we) had to set the tone tonight. 

“This game was important to both of us. We needed a point, or the win, to get out of the placement we're in, and we knew that they wanted to win, to hold on to first place, and be reigning regular season champions from last year.”

Rastello broke the scoreless tie himself just 2:12 into the final frame when he crashed the net and quickly converted a pass from forward Gabe Coppo. Alternate captain Stephen Dudenas also picked up an assist on the play as well.

“I'm just happy Coppo drove,” said Rastello. “He pushed the play. He used his speed, came around the net, and he found me in tight. Thankfully, the goalie didn't have his paddle between his legs.”

The goal seemed to spark the Pioneers, who immediately went to work trying to even things. Defenseman Matt Mantta had a look from the left point off a feed from left winger Nick Harris that Ryynanen had to track down two minutes after Rastello's tally.

Still, the Pioneers did not panic when things weren't going their way.

“(I) wasn't too frustrated, because we had a tough first period,” said Pioneers alternate captain Spencer Donnelly. “Definitely didn't play our best game there. But, I think the second period and then into the third, we definitely picked it up. The game was in our control. So, honestly, not to sound cocky, but when they scored that one, I wasn't sweating it. We were all over them and I knew that it was going to come.”

When the tying goal came, it scored off Donnelly's stick.

He drove hard into the slot on an odd-man rush, cut to his left, towards the middle of the slot, and then wristed a shot that missed the net entirely. However, he followed the puck as it bounced off the back boards, and he beat everyone to it before quickly firing it at Ryynanen, and this time, he did not miss at 8:58.

“I missed the net first, by a tiny bit,” he said. “Then, from there, I just, I saw a bounce, and I busted butt, and found the rebound and was able to put it home.

“I saw an open net, actually. I just saw that puck, and I said, ‘I better get there first.' That puck hit my stick, and I saw an open net. I sent it there and it went in.”

Ryynanen made 38 saves in the loss for the Wolverines. A.J. Petrulis made 25 saves to earn the win for the Pioneers.

UP NEXT

The Wolverines were back in action Friday night at home against Dane County to close out the regular season. The Pioneers face the Daily Kings on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Dee Stadium to close out their season.

SYDNEY (AP) — Former police officer Tiara Brown became WBC world featherweight champion by beating Skye Nicolson in a split-decision victory on Saturday.

The 36-year-old Brown took Nicolson's belt when judges scored the bout 97-93 and 96-94 in her favor, with one judge scoring it 96-94 for Nicolson.

Brown (19-0) dropped to the canvas in tears when she was announced as the winner. It was the first professional loss for Nicolson (12-1), an Australian.

Brown had been an officer both in the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington D.C. and more recently for the Fort Myers Police Department in her native Florida.

The Fort Myers PD had wished Brown good luck ahead of the 10-round bout, saying on Instagram that she “has always been a fighter — both in and out of the ring.”

Brown is a boxing coach with the Fort Myers police athletic league.

Speaking ringside to broadcaster DAZN, Brown gave a shoutout to God and her hometown of Fort Myers and said it's been “20-plus years of wanting this moment.”

The new champion said she's not focused yet on her next bout.

“I like my options, my options are good, (but) right now I just want to go home and eat some cupcakes and some cookies and watch some cartoons,” Brown said.

The second round of the NCAA Tournament will dominate the headlines in sports over the next two days, but that doesn't mean the carousel is going to stop. Just the opposite. I've got the latest below. 

Most recent news: VCU's Ryan Odom is going to Virginia. Yes: the coach who oversaw one of the biggest upsets in sports history will now lead the program on the losing end of that epic UMBC-UVa ending in 2018. Quite a story. I've got more on Virginia in the Wahoos' capsule further down.

Elsewhere: McNeese coach Will Wade is on the move to NC State just as soon as McNeese's season ends. The Cowboys have Purdue early on Saturday in the second round of the Midwest Region. 

Here are other coaching moves in the past week-plus:

The biggie: We're waiting on what's next at Texas. Rodney Terry is expected to be fired, but as of Saturday afternoon, UT AD Chris Del Conte had not met with Terry, sources said. It would be a stunner if there's not a change there. Once it's official, I'll dive more into what's expected with the search (which might not take long at all).

We're at 31 job flips as of Saturday. Here they are:

COLUMBUS — It's hard to remember a time when the heir apparent to a vacant starting quarterback job at Ohio State let that chance slip away.

Will Howard (2024), Kyle McCord (2023), C.J. Stroud (2021), Justin Fields (2019) and Dwayne Haskins (2018) all were preseason favorites to be the Buckeyes' starting quarterback during spring practice for those seasons when there was no incumbent starter.

And every one of them started the opener despite Urban Meyer and later Ryan Day insisting the competition was too close to call until a few days or a few weeks before the first game.

It would be no surprise to see Julian Sayin join that list of OSU quarterbacks who went from heir apparent to starter this season.

Sayin, a 5-star recruit rated the top quarterback nationally in the 2024 recruiting class, arrived at OSU in January 2024 when he entered the transfer portal after enrolling at Alabama but having second thoughts when Nick Saban resigned as the Crimson Tide's coach.

He played briefly in four games last season and threw one touchdown pass.

Starter Will Howard and No.2 quarterback Devin Brown are gone so Sayin's competition at this point is coming from Lincoln Kienholz, who appeared in two games without throwing a pass last season, and freshman Tavien St. Clair.

New OSU quarterbacks coach Billy Fessler said it is much too early to discuss who the starting quarterback will be after the second day of spring practice for the Buckeyes on Wednesday.

“I think that we're just a long way away from even talking about how close it is,” Fessler said. “Right now, those three guys are really just focused on getting better every single time they step in this building in meeting rooms, step out on the field on practice.”

Sayin said becoming the starting quarterback  is “definitely the goal,” but answered a question about being the heir apparent by saying he ignored “the outside noise.”

“I saw that last year how much noise there is. You just have to block out the noise and focus on spring practice,” he said.

Sayin said he has gained around 10 pounds from the 185 he weighed when he arrived at Ohio State.

One of the things he was known for during his high school career was having a quick release on his passes.

“I think I've always naturally had kind of a quick release. I've always had a quick release and I've been trying to get it quicker,” he said.

He also praised the leadership quarterback Will Howard showed last season.

“Will was a really great leader for this team and it was fun to watch. He was someone who everyone could kind of relate to and was liked by everyone. So I've kind of been trying to take that approach,” Sayin said.

Kienholz said he believes there is an open competition to be the starter.

“I'd say it feels wide open,” he said. “It feels good because I can come in and strive to be the best quarterback in the nation and that's what I'm trying to do.”

David Goffin handed Carlos Alcaraz his second straight defeat with a stunning comeback Friday night at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The 34-year-old Belgian showed class and veteran composure in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory, making the second seed pay for an error-strewn opening performance at the ATP Masters 1000 event.

Goffin, who has now notched three consecutive wins against Top 3 players, improved to 2-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Alcaraz, 13 years his junior, with the upset. He previously beat the 21-year-old in Astana in 2022 and World No. 3 Alexander Zverev last October in Shanghai.

""It feels amazing. Sometimes some matches are tough and you have to fight, like the first round, and you're happy to have a second round like that in a stadium,"" said Goffin, who also came from a set down to beat Aleksandar Vukic in his Miami opener. ""That's why I continue to play tennis, to have that kind of match in a stadium, to play some good tennis. 

""[I was] just trying to enjoy the moment... I felt that physically I was ready to fight and then I was feeling the ball really well, so it's the kind of night that you feel great and you're happy to fight, you enjoy every point and at the end it's it's a perfect end with a great match point. It was amazing.""

Making moves in Miami 🕺

Goffin is through to the Miami third round for the first time since 2019 after becoming the first man to defeat a top two seed in the event's opening round since David Ferrer beat Zverev that same year. He is also the first player outside the Top 30 in the PIF ATP Rankings to beat Alcaraz this season.

The Belgian led by a break in all three sets and made his advantage count in the second and third. Content to counterpunch at times against the superior power of his opponent, Goffin expertly picked his spots to attack and repeatedly left Alcaraz stranded at the net as he turned the match around.

""I think it was key to be aggressive from the return, especially on his second serve,"" said Goffin, who won 45 per cent (15/33) of his second-serve return points. ""Sometimes he hits the target on the first serve and you cannot do anything. The key was, even if I missed, I had to be aggressive. Because otherwise, if I'm just too passive, then he has his forehand or... he has everything. If you're too passive, then you're dead.""

Goffin won 17 of his 24 net points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while Alcaraz committed 43 unforced errors — including 28 on the forehand wing that also let him down against Draper in Indian Wells.



Goffin will next take on American Brandon Nakashima, the No. 32 in the PIF ATP Rankings, on Sunday after the American's 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 result against Roberto Carballes Baena.

With the defeat, Alcaraz's hopes of returning to No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings following the tournament were dashed. The 2022 Miami champion needed to win this year's title and have Zverev exit early in order to pass the German for World No. 2. Alcaraz is not in danger of losing his position at No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings this month despite suffering just his third opening defeat at an ATP Masters 1000.

Carlos Alcaraz exits Miami Open in the second round to 55th-ranked David Goffin but Novac Djokovic ends losing streak.

World number three Carlos Alcaraz said “he was not feeling great” as he suffered a shock early exit from the Miami Open with Belgian veteran David Goffin fighting back for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 win.

The 34-year-old Goffin beat Alcaraz three years ago in Astana in their last meeting, and, sensing the Spaniard was far from his best in the opening set of their encounter at Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, he went on the attack.

The 55th-ranked Goffin, whose world ranking reached No.7 in 2017, struck some glorious winners while Alcaraz was struggling with unforced errors.

The slightly built Goffin was up by a break in all three sets but having let Alcaraz recover in the first he showed poise and calm to stay on top.

“It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure – against Carlos and in a stadium like that. And the night that gave me a lot of confidence to continue,” Goffin said.

Alcaraz was blunt in his assessment of his performance.

“In general, it was a poor level from me, I didn't play well,” said Alcaraz who said he had felt a little heavy in his legs despite coming into the game feeling in good shape.

“I thought I was going to play really good tennis but it didn't happen … playing a break down in the third set, not feeling great or confident physically, it's really tough to get back,” he added.

Novak Djokovic powered to a straight-sets win over Australian Rinky Hijikata, while Daniil Medvedev also headed home early after suffering a 6-2, 6-3 upset defeat to Spain's 56th-ranked Jaume Munar.

Medvedev, the 2023 Miami champion, showed his frustration, hurling his racket on several occasions as Mallorca-born Munar, 27, picked up his third career win over a top-10 opponent.

The Russian made 32 unforced errors and although he gave himself a chance of a comeback in the final game, he couldn't convert on two break points.

Medvedev confirmed he had a problem with his back but said it was no excuse and gave credit to Munar.

“Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match,” he said. “Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.

“He played well, so that's why (he won). I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.”

Djokovic, who lost his first match in Indian Wells to a lucky loser, was in no mood for another disappointment as he beat 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1) to snap his three-match losing streak.

Djokovic, who has won a record 40 titles at Masters 1000 level, has now equalled Rafael Nadal for most match wins (410) since the series' introduction in 1990.

Karen Khachanov ensured the Nick Kyrgios comeback trail was cut short with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 win.

Australian Kyrgios, who has struggled since wrist surgery, defeated Mackenzie McDonald in the first round to earn his first tour-level win since October 2022, but was unable to overcome Khachanov, who reached the semis in Miami in 2023.

In the women's draw, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced into the third round after surviving a second-set dip to beat France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5.

Swiatek had beaten Garcia with ease at the same stage at Indian Wells earlier this month, but she faced a little more resistance at Hard Rock Stadium.

Swiatek was 3-1 down in the second set and had to save a set point, when serving at 5-4 down before rallying to win the last three games.

Swiatek lost to Mirra Andreeva in the semifinals at Indian Wells, with the 17-year-old Russian going on to win the title.

Andreeva is in action later on Friday when she takes on fellow Russian Veronika Kudermetova.

“My energy level got down really fast. So I tried to wake myself up, keep the intensity from the first set, follow through and go for it,” Swiatek said.

On the grandstand court, Britain's Emma Raducanu showed grit and perseverance to overcome eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro 7-6 (8/6), 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a two-hour, 53-minute battle.

Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal dominated tennis for years, winning the sport's biggest prizes.

Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal became known as the ‘big three' as they ruled the ATP Tour for almost 20 years.

The trio remarkably combined for 66 Major titles, battling it out for the Grand Slam record throughout their tennis careers.

It is Djokovic who now leads the way with 24 triumphs at the sport's four biggest events, ahead of Nadal on 22, and Federer on 20.

Arguments over who is the greatest of all time in men's tennis persist, as one former American ATP star now makes his pick.

Appearing as a guest on the Digital Social Hour podcast, former world number 11 Sam Querrey revealed who he thinks is the greatest of all time.

“I have [Novak] Djokovic as the best tennis player of all time,” he said.

“The most impactful person, [Roger] Federer.

“I think if you went around the world [asking] who do you love watching the most and who made the biggest impact on your life, I think Federer wins that.

“But if I gave you three blind resumes Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal, and said who is the best here, you would be like this guy definitely, it would be Djokovic.”

Querrey played 21 matches against members of the ‘big three' as he now explains which of the trio were hardest to play against.

“I was able to beat Djokovic, Nadal and [Andy] Murray,” he said.

“Federer I played five times and lost all five and never even had a close set against him.

“I had a couple of sets that were like 6-4 but the way his game matched up to mine, it just didn't sit right with me.

“He was able to put me in uncomfortable positions.”

The American then outlined what was different about playing Federer that always made him ‘nervous'.

“Federer for whatever reason his name seemed bigger so I was a little bit more nervous,” said Querrey.

“Any time you played Federer it was on a Centre Court at Wimbledon or the French Open or these big events and the crowd loved him.

“He was beloved everywhere, you were always nervous, the crowd always wanted him to win.

“I could never really settle in against him, and never got close to winning a set against him, even when I was playing at my best.”

The big-serving American was always a threat on the grass and produced one of the biggest wins of his career in 2016 when he took down Djokovic at Wimbledon.

Djokovic was the two-time defending champion but Querrey dashed any hopes of a three-peat, knocking him out with an impressive four-set win, 7-6, 6-1, 3-6, 7-6.

A win over Nicolas Mahut followed for Querrey before he came up short against Canada's Milos Raonic in the quarter-finals.

He returned one year later in even better form, taking down the defending champion for a second year running when he beat Murray in the quarter-finals.

In his only career appearance in a Grand Slam semi-final, Querrey fell to defeat, losing in four sets to Marin Cilic, 7-6, 4-6, 6-7, 5-7.

The American retired from tennis in 2022, having scored wins over Djokovic, Murray, and Nadal, collecting  ten titles on the ATP Tour.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","Meet Coleman Wong, based at Nadal's academy: 'I really hope I can inspire someone'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/coleman-wong-miami-2025-feature","Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:54:05 GMT","

Coleman Wong became a tennis player by complete coincidence. Now, the Hong Kong native is one of the brightest young talents in the sport.

The 20-year-old's tennis journey began aged five when his older sister by two years, Elana, was meant to take a private lesson at Victoria Park, home of the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open. She fell ill and their parents, Bruce and Dora, did not want to waste the money, so Coleman took the lesson.

“I really liked it,” Wong recalled to ATPTour.com. “I was a bit out of shape, I was a bit chubby and at first it was just for keeping fit. Then, slowly, I grew.”

Fifteen years later, Wong is competing in the Miami Open presented by Itau, one of nine ATP Masters 1000 events. His smile left no doubt regarding the emotions the rising star felt after he defeated Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 6-3 on Thursday for the biggest victory of his career.

“It feels unreal. This year I've been struggling a little bit, playing tougher tournaments. That's why I'm not winning a lot,” Wong said. “Maybe sometimes I win a round and then I lose second round, playing some really good players. But I'm really happy to get one of my biggest wins in my career. For me, it means a lot, and I really hope it's the first of many.”

 

The No. 182 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was full of gratitude when discussing his special moment. Wong was sure to thank the tournament for providing him with a main draw wild card, his team and his family. He made clear how many people have supported him.

Wong does not come from a sporting family. His father is a school principal, his mother is a teacher and his sister works in the bank industry, so Coleman is the outlier as a professional athlete.

Aged 17, Wong spoke to his parents and decided to move to Spain to train at the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar. The then-teen told his parents he would not be able to become a professional without making the move.

“They didn't have any picture of it, and they let me go,” Wong said. “I really, I really need to thank them as well. It's a big sacrifice, because I don't see them at all. I probably see them a few times a year.” 

Wong has not physically been with his family since the first week of the season in Hong Kong. It was special to compete in the ATP 250 event.

“Being from Hong Kong, it means a lot, because Hong Kong, we had two gold medals in the past few years in the Olympics, [so] many people are starting to like sports,” Wong said. “So I'm really happy. I feel like they're always behind me, supporting me, and I really hope that I can inspire someone.”



It has now been around four years for Wong at Nadal's eponymous academy and he has been able to train with the Spaniard on a half-dozen occasions. One memory sticks out, and it did not occur in Mallorca. When Nadal last won the Australian Open, in 2022, Wong earned the boys' doubles title with Bruno Kuzuhara. They had a chat on the practice court.

“He congratulated me. We have a picture together, holding the trophy, my doubles,” Wong said. “He said, 'You're in the right path, because we have one of the best coaches', and I believed him.”

A post shared by ATP Challenger Tour (@atpchallengertour)

Tennis has become more than just a sport for Wong. It is a place where he can forget about anything going on off the court and just work on his game.

“I like to win. I want to be the best, and I want to see what my limit is. I'm still searching for it,” Wong said. “The best in this journey is I can always challenge myself every time. Every day, I want to improve. So I think this is one of the points that my coaches really liked about me, because I really like to work. But I always say it's not enough, not enough. So that's why I think if I don't like tennis, I cannot do that for sure.”

Wong will certainly try to enjoy the experience of playing home favourite Ben Shelton on Saturday in Miami. He hopes to continue making a name for himself and Hong Kong.

“I want them to know that Hong Kong can also have a professional tennis player,” Wong said of the fans. “We don't believe in that yet, but I want to tell them that even a small city like Hong Kong can still produce someone that can play against the world.”

LAWRENCE, Kan. - The TCU women's tennis team fell to Kansas, 4-1 on Friday night at the Jayhawk Tennis Center. 

TCU fell to 10-6 and 5-2 in Big 12 conference play.

Lee's Thoughts
""Crazy how sports can put you on such a rollercoaster. A week ago we knocked off a top 15 team and had tons of positive momentum, and now we have a feeling of disappointment lingering after the last two losses. It's really tough and we are bummed as a team. But it's time now to really dig in and get things back on track. It's time for us all to have some introspection and honest conversations about the things that must improve immediately. We have no time to waste. It must be right now. There's not a bigger moment of our season than right now. It's time to put it all on the line for this match Sunday and get the momentum back on our side this season.""

The Rundown
The Horned Frogs won the doubles point as the No. 18 ranked pairing of Jade Otway and Isabel Pascual defeated He Janse van Vuuren and Gracie Mulville, 6-3. The win moved the pair to 6-1 in Big 12 play and 8-5 in 2025. 

TCU clinched the doubles point with a win on court three as Raquel Caballero and Tomi Main took down Kyoka Kubo and Anna Putilina, 7-5. The duo won three consecutive games to clinch the court. The win moved to 5-1 on the year.

PROVO, Utah - The No. 17 UCF men's tennis team dropped a contested match Saturday evening, losing its first Big 12 away duel of the season at BYU, 4-2.

A point of emphasis for the Knights (15-6, 1-2) has been their growth in doubles play, however, in the high altitude of Provo, the Cougars (11-4, 1-2) retained serve to claim the early advantage.

Shifting up to court one, Yassine Dlimi and Emilio Sanchez couldn't find their footing against BYU's Zach Fuchs and Wally Thayne, while Luca Hotze and Simeon Terziev fell to a similar fate on court three. Mehdi Benchakroun and Santiago Giamichelle sat just a game away from taking court two before the contest was abandoned.

The team split the first sets to open singles play as the Knights looked to find the leveler, which would come in just over an hour. On court four, Giamichelle tallied his 100th career win at the collegiate level with a dominating 6-2, 6-2, victory over Adam Chodur. In just three seasons, the Argentinian native hit the century mark with his 52nd singles win, paired with 48 in doubles.

BYU immediately jumped back out to a lead with wins on courts two and six, as Benchakroun and Sanchez suffered straight-set defeats. Freshman Nicolas Oliveira authored one of his best performances to date as the Brazilian put the Knights within one following a 7-5, 6-3, result over Tygen Goldammer. 

With the 90th-ranked Dlimi amidst a third set, Colin was striving to push his court-three duel to a similar situation, though the junior was eventually bested in a second-set tiebreak as the Cougars secured the win via Redd Owen, 6-3, 7-6. 

UP NEXT

UCF will look to jump back in the win column on Sunday afternoon as it makes the short journey north to Salt Lake City for a meeting with No. 52 Utah. First serve is at 3 p.m. ET.

Cullowhee, N.C. – The Western Carolina tennis team closed its nonconference schedule impressively on Friday as the Catamounts claimed a 6-1 win over the NC A&T Aggies at the Catamount Athletic Complex. WCU seniors Andrea Redondo and Angela Perez were honored for their contributions in a special pregame ceremony. The duo led the team with a doubles win on court two and a pair of singles victories in Friday's win.


The shorthanded Aggies were forced to forfeit on the third doubles court and the sixth singles seed, giving the Catamounts an early advantage in the match. Redondo and Perez cruised to a 6-1 second-court victory to secure the doubles point before Jade Groen and Chloe Schwarz swept the initial point with a 6-4 victory.  

Redondo and Madison Schwarz rattled off straight-set victories with little drama, outscoring their opposition a combined 24-8. Redondo allowed only three points total in her match as the fifth seed, while Schwarz earned her highest-seeded victory since a 6-2, 6-1 win against Lees McRae on the second court in 2023.  

Isabella Sambola and Perez pushed to a third set in their matches on the top and third courts, respectively, as the two fell 6-0 and 7-5 to open singles play. With the match already decided in WCU's favor, the two battled their opponents in 10-point tiebreakers. Perez rolled in her match tiebreaker, claiming a 10-3 advantage to finish off the day and notch her ninth win of the season. Trailing 7-1, Sambola mounted a furious comeback, claiming 11 of the final 14 points to earn the 12-10 victory.  

Up Next for The Catamounts: 
WCU returns to Southern Conference play as the Catamounts host Samford on March 23 at Noon. The Catamounts remain at home for their next two, hosting the UNC Greensboro Spartans on March 29 at 2 p.m. and the Chattanooga Mocs the following day at 3 p.m.

Fayetteville, Ark. – No. 4 Texas Men's Tennis defeated No. 36 Arkansas, 4-1, on Friday at the Billingsley Tennis Center in Fayetteville. The Longhorns moved to 7-0 in the SEC and 16-3 overall.

After Texas took the doubles point with a win at No. 1 and a tiebreaker victory at No. 2, the Longhorns secured singles wins from freshmen Evan Burnett at No. 6 and Timo Legout at No. 1. Arkansas then won at No. 2 before sophomore Lucas Brown clinched the match at No. 5.

Texas began doubles with a 6-2 win by the No. 8 duo of Legout and Brown over No. 48 Connor Smillie and Jakub Vrba at No. 1. The Longhorns broke first for a 3-1 lead and consolidated it for 4-1 before later claiming the only other break of the match to win.

Arkansas evened doubles as the pair of senior Pierre-Yves Bailly and freshman Sebastian Eriksson fell to Brendan Boland and Marino Jakic, 6-4, at No. 3.  After both teams held, starting with Texas, three-straight games went to deuce. The last of those proved to be the only break of the match for a 3-2 lead for the Razorbacks that they did not relinquish.

That left it to No. 2 where juniors Sebastian Gorzny and Jonah Braswell combined for a 7-6 (5) win over Bozo Barun and Benni Emesz. With Arkansas serving first, the match stayed on serve the entire way to the tiebreaker. The Razorbacks served first in that, as well, and held on the opening point. The teams alternated points from there up to 3-3 when the Longhorns grabbed their second straight for a 4-3 lead. Both teams the held both of their next two serves starting with Arkansas, but with Texas leading, 6-5, the Longhorns came up with the mini-break they needed to capture the match.

With both Bailly and freshman Oliver Ojakaar out of the singles lineup, Burnett moved in at No. 6 and made the most of his opportunity with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Jean-Baptiste Badon. Burnett actually trailed, 2-0 and 5-1, in the first set, losing three straight deuce points to get to that 5-1 deficit. However, from there, it was all Burnett as he won 10 straight games and 12 of the last 13 to take the match. That included four deuce points, three of which came in the first four games of the second set as he took a 4-0 lead.

Legout was next off the court with a 6-2, 7-6 (7) win over Barun to extend the overall lead to 3-0. The first four games were on serve, including the last of those that started a 5-0 run for Legout to the set win. In the second set, Legout broke first on a deuce point for a 2-1 lead that he consolidated for 3-1. Barun responded with a 3-0 run that included a deuce-point break for 3-3 on the way to a 4-3 lead. Two games later, Legout broke again and had a chance to serve out the match, but Barun deflected two match points to break back. Barun then held on another deuce point, but Legout also held, sending it to a tiebreaker. In the breaker, the players exchanged 4-0 runs starting with Legout. They then alternated points starting with Legout all the way to an 8-7 lead for him when Barun double faulted to provide the final point for Legout's win.

The lone point for Arkansas came as No. 13 Gorzny was downed by No. 80 Lukas Palovic in three sets, 1-6, 7-5, 6-1, at No. 2. Gorzny controlled the first half of the match, jumping out to a 4-0 lead before Palovic broke on a deuce point for 4-1. However, Gorzny broke right back and served out the set. In the second, Gorzny broke first for a 2-1 lead that he consolidated for 3-1 on a deuce point. Leading, 4-2, Gorzny had another break chance on a deuce point, but Palovic was able to hold to stay within 4-3 and then broke for 4-4. However, Gorzny broke back and had an opportunity to serve for the match, but Palovic stayed alive with a break and began an 8-0 run to claim the set and a 5-0 lead in the third. That included three deuce points, which were for a 6-5 lead in the second set, along with 2-0 and 5-0 advantages in the third set on the way to the 6-1 win. 

That turned the attention for Texas to No. 5 where Lucas Brown came through with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Arthur Bellegy to clinch. Brown moved out to leads of 3-0 and 5-1 in the first set, and although Bellegy got back within 5-4 on a deuce-point hold, Brown served out the set in the next game. In the second, Brown broke first for a 3-2 lead on a deuce point and held for 4-2, but Bellegy went on a 3-0 run to take the lead, including a deuce-point break that had evened it, 4-4. However, Brown broke again to regain a 6-5 lead and served out from there for the win.

That left two matches unfinished, starting with No. 53 Braswell trailing, but on serve in a third set against Vrba, 3-6, 6-3, 1-2 at No. 3. Vrba opened with a deuce-point hold and break for a 2-0 lead, but Braswell broke back and held for 2-2. Vrba then went on a 3-0 run, and after Braswell held in the next game, Vrba served out on a deuce point. In the second, it was Braswell who broke first for a 3-1 lead, which started a string of three-straight breaks. Braswell snapped that for a 5-2 lead, and the last three games were on serve to give the set to Braswell, including a deuce-point hold for Vrba. The third set also stayed on serve with Vrba taking a 2-1 lead on a deuce point just before play stopped.

Eriksson was leading the other match for Texas, 7-5, 3-6, 3-2, over Emesz at No. 4. Eriksson took a 3-0 lead on the strength of a deuce-point break in the second game, but Emesz answered the run. The next five games were then on serve until Eriksson broke for the set. In the second, Eriksson's first two service games went to deuce with him losing the first and winning the second, but Emesz moved out to a 5-1 lead. Eriksson got two games back for 5-3, but Emesz broke on a deuce point to take the set. Eriksson had just picked up the first break of the third set for a 3-2 lead when play halted. 

The Longhorns will complete their two-match road swing at LSU on Sunday at 12 p.m. CT.

No. 1 Georgia women's tennis secured yet another SEC win against Arkansas 5-2. The win adds to the Bulldogs' streak against the Razorbacks, marking the team's 17th win in the last 17 meetings.

Doubles play began with a dominant doubles performance from No. 10 Dasha Vidmanova and Mell Reasco. The pair of seniors secured the first doubles match for Georgia after defeating Olga Bienzobas and Carolina Gomez Alonso.

No. 74 Guillermina Grant and Anastasiia Lopata clinched the doubles points for the Bulldogs after a 6-2 win on court two. The senior-junior duo bested Anet Josel and Grace O'Donnell.

In singles play, No. 100 Grant finished first on court four against Kosel, securing her match in consecutive sets 6-2, 6-3. No. 1 Dasha Vidmanova secured a ranked win against No. 74 Gomez Alonso, winning her first set 6-3, and shutting out her opponent with a 6-0 win in the second set.

No.55 Aysegul Mert made the score 3-0 after a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Katarina Pavlechova. No. 52 Lopata clinched the match for Georgia after defeating Olga Bienzobas 6-4, 6-1.

At the time of Lopata's win, the matches on court five and six continued. Sofia Rojas faced O'Donnell, and fell short in the first set 6-1. The junior fought back in the second set, and forced a third set after a 6-3 victory. Ultimately, though, Rojas fell short against O'Donnell in the super-tiebreaker 1-0 (10-8)

Arkansas' Jimena Gomez Alonso accounted for the Razorbacks second point of the match after defeating Mai Nirundorn in consecutive sets 6-4, 6-3.

Georgia will face No. 12 Oklahoma at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex on Sunday.

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Emma Heming Willis and her husband, Die Hard actor Bruce Willis, celebrated their 16-year wedding anniversary on Friday, March 21. Heming Willis shared a photo of her and her husband on Instagram to mark the special day. She also shared a candid caption about the years they've spent together.

""Today marks 16 years with the love of a lifetime. We've shared monumental highs and devastating lows, and through it all, we've built something timeless. I'm so deeply grateful for every chapter I've had with him—and all the ones we'll continue to write, in our language of unconditional love,"" she wrote.

Indeed things have looked very different for the couple in recent years. Willis was diagnosed with aphasia in 2022 and then, more specifically, frontotemporal dementia, in 2023. The actor has since lost the ability to communicate verbally.

Dozens of comments have amassed on Heming Willis' recent Instagram post, with family, friends, and fans sharing their well wishes for the couple.

""Love you Emma you are magic 321 and papa he loves you so much,"" wrote Willis' daughter, Rumer Willis.

""You're an angel that walks this earth. I love how deeply you care about your family extended family and Bruce,"" someone else added.

""Through thick and thin love is always the best compliment in life,"" a third comment read.

""Happy Happy Anniversary!! What a true and all encompassing love you share,"" a fourth Instagram user said.

A post shared by instagram

The couple's wedding anniversary comes two days after Willis' 70th birthday.

""It's Bruce's birthday, and if there's one thing I know, it's that there's no greater fan than a Bruce fan. So flood him with all the love today—he will feel it, I swear he will. You are one powerful bunch. I love how you rally for him, and I'm so grateful that he has you,"" Heming Willis captioned an Instagram post on Wednesday, March 19.

She later posted an update on her Instagram Stories, scrolling through all of the messages that fans sent her husband.

The ""Snow White"" star recently reflected on the impact the Disney project had on her life and, over the course of multiple social media posts, praised the film's cast and crew for their hard work. However, the 23-year-old's glaring omission of costar Gal Gadot has fueled ongoing speculation of a feud between the actresses.

“This movie was a life-changing experience that has held about four years of my career,” Zegler wrote in a March 20 Instagram post alongside behind-the-scenes photos of the cast and crew on set. “I became a real adult during the course of this film—learned hard lessons, did hard things, laughed, cried, turned 21, lived across the ocean from my family, made new friends, and completely fell in love with this group of people I got to work with for three magical summers.”

A post shared by rachel zegler (@rachelzegler)

She continued, “We had the greatest crew in the world on this movie. It cannot be overstated. This photo dump doesn't even dig into the fun, the magic, and the love that was shared throughout this process. But it's a start.”

In addition to no pictures or references of Gadot in the first heartfelt post, the ""West Side Story"" actress did not include her costar in a second tribute to her “daily magicians” from “both in front of and behind” the film's camera.

“It takes a village to bring stories like Snow White to the big screen and I loved this one so very much,” Zegler wrote in her second March 21 Instagram post. “Here's a little glimpse into this family I came to care for deeply.”

Following the posts, fans wondered whether Gadot's absence was intentional, with one X (formerly Twitter) user writing in a translated post, “Disney is having a hard time trying to debunk the Rachel Zegler-Gal Gadot feud because Rachel posted 19 photos on Instagram thanking her co-stars for helping her grow during the 4-year process, but she didn't mention or post any photos of Gal.” 

Though Zegler and Gadot have not commented publicly on the rumored feud, they presented together at the Oscars March 2 and both attended the Los Angeles premiere of the Disney remake on March 15. At a separate screening, Zegler also gushed about the film and shared her love for the cast and crew.

""This is a movie that is so close to my heart,” she said in a March 17 Instagram video shared by Disney. “I auditioned for this movie when I was 19 years old and I am about to turn 24. So it's a really big chunk of my life, and about five of the seven years of my career, which is crazy.”

She added, “I love everybody in this movie so dearly.""","{'href': 'https://www.nbcboston.com', 'title': 'NBC Boston'}"

Former heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman, known as much for his gregarious personality as his vicious right hook, died Friday. He was 76 years old.

Foreman, known during his post-boxing career for pitching his now-omnipresent countertop grill, was heavyweight champion twice. He also won gold at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.

His family announced his death in a post on Instagram.

""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose,"" the statement said.

""A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.""

Foreman won his first heavyweight title at just 24 with a stunning knockout of the then-undefeated Joe Frazier.

Foreman's most famous fight, billed as The Rumble in the Jungle, ended in his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in October 1974. He surrendered the heavyweight title in the knockout loss. He would regain the belt after a 10-year retirement in a fight in 1994 against Michael Moorer at age 45.

Katherine Ryan has been diagnosed with skin cancer.

The 41-year-old comedian was first diagnosed with melanoma in her early twenties but revealed on Friday (21.03.25) that the disease has come her way a second time despite doctors initially telling her that everything was ""totally fine"" with her when she raised concerns over a suspicious mole.

Speaking on her 'Telling Everybody Everything' podcast, she said: ""I know you should never Google things but I'm actually really worried. Normally I'm that positive person

""I think it's really easy to take a diagnosis of ‘you're healthy' and walk away.

""But the mole kept changing, I know a lot about melanoma, I had melanoma as a very young woman - aged 21 - on my leg, I've spoken about that before.

""It was flat, it wasn't that big but it was melanoma. It is a deadly form of skin cancer and it does spread quickly.

""I just thought that this mole wasn't right. It's on my arm. I showed pictures of it on my social media. I went in and I wanted the doctor to remove it and stitch it up in a straight line.

""But even when he looked at it, he was like, ‘it's not melanoma, it's totally fine, I will do a shave and send it away for testing.

""And he rang me today and it did come back as melanoma. Early melanoma. The doctor was shocked and told me I need to go back.""

The '8 Out of 10 Cats' star also worried what could have been had she not been her ""own advocate"" and continued to seek medical advice.

She said: ""It just feels crazy to me, what could have happened, if I hadn't been my own advocate - and I will continue to be my own advocate.""

The Canadian-born star previously opened up about her first diagnosis and joked that moving to the UK had been the ""best thing"" for her because of the lack of warm weather.

She told The Guardian: ""I just joked that it was free lipo. If you're prone to skin cancer, then living in the UK is the best thing you can do.""

Neil Young has cancelled his free concert in Ukraine.

The 'Rockin' In The Free World' hitmaker had announced earlier this month that he planned to kick of his 'Love Earth Tour' in the Eastern European nation - which was invaded by Russia in 2022 - on an unspecified date, but the ongoing war and changing political climate has made him rethink the decision due to safety concerns.

He wrote on his official website: ""Our concert in Ukraine is cancelled. We had a good venue, close to a shelter, but the changing situation on the ground was too much.

""I could not in good conscience take my crew and instruments into that area. My apologies to all. Ukraine is a great country with a good leader. Slava Ukraini.”

The 79-year-old rocker had shared his plans to perform in Ukraine for the first time just two weeks ago.

A post on his website stated: ""Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts will open the upcoming 'Love Earth Tour' of Europe in Ukraine with a free concert for all.

""We are currently in talks and will make the announcement of details here ... Keep on Rockin' In The Free World.""

His tour will start in Europe in June and July before heading to North America for a series of shows in August and September.

The trek will include a headline slot at the fabled Glastonbury Festival in the UK in June as well as a huge show in London's Hyde Park as part of the American Express presents BST Hyde Park series on July 11.

The 'Heart of Gold' singer was confirmed as the first headliner for Glastonbury after reversing his decision to boycott the world-famous festival due to it being a ""corporate turn-off"".

In a statement posted on his website, he explained: ""Due to an error in the information received, I had decided not to play the Glastonbury Festival, which I have always loved.

""Happily, the festival is now back on our itinerary and we look forward to playing. Hope to see you there.""

Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis expressed her delight at his change of heart.

She wrote on Instagram: ""What a start to the year!

""Neil Young is an artist who's very close to our hearts at Glastonbury. He does things his own way and that's why we love him.

""We can't wait to welcome him back here to headline the Pyramid in June.""

Bollywood diva Malaika Arora, known for her sizzling glamour and presence in over 30 films, has recently opened up about a surprising incident that took place on a dance reality show she was judging. While Malaika is a regular on TV as a judge on dancing competitions, she revealed a startling experience where a 16-year-old contestant crossed the line with his behavior, leaving her furious.

In an interview with ANI, Malaika recalled the moment when the young contestant began winking at her and blowing flying kisses during his performance. While she didn't initially plan to confront him, Malaika couldn't hold back her frustration. “I wasn't planning to scold him or tell him that what he was doing was wrong. But I told him, ‘You are doing a little too much. There's no need for all this.'” She emphasised that the moment felt inappropriate, even though playful gestures like winking or a kiss might be common in performances.

However, it wasn't just a scolding—Malaika's response took a more serious turn. “I asked him to give me his mother's number,” she said. This shocking reaction was rooted in the need to address inappropriate behavior, especially from a teenager on a professional platform.

Despite the intense confrontation, Malaika didn't hold a grudge against the contestant. She praised his dancing skills afterward, calling him a ""lovely kid"" and acknowledging his exceptional performance. ""He did a great job with his dance,"" Malaika shared, highlighting that even after the disciplinary moment, the contestant deserved recognition for his talent.



Malaika's candidness about the incident sheds light on the challenges judges face in maintaining professionalism while also fostering creativity. Known for her iconic item numbers and contributions to Bollywood, Malaika has proven time and again that she can balance tough love with encouragement, a quality that makes her a respected figure in the entertainment industry.

Her recent appearances on various dance reality shows and her role in films like Aik Number and Kho Gaye Hum Kahaan continue to show her versatility and strong presence both on-screen and off-screen. The glamorous star continues to command attention not only for her dazzling looks but also for her candid and empowering personality.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z are reportedly considering legal action against Kanye West.

The pair are said to be weighing up the move after scandal-plagued rapper Kanye, 47, made inflammatory social media comments about their seven-year-old twins Rumi and Sir.

He posted now-deleted remarks questioning the mental abilities of the children, apparently now prompting power couple and his former friends Beyoncé and Jay-Z to explore possible responses. A source told Page Six: “They are discussing how to handle the situation, whether privately or through legal channels.”

The source emphasised Beyoncé, 42, and Jay-Z, 54, “will absolutely not tolerate” Kanye's comments about their children, calling the language he used “vulgar and offensive.”

Even though Kanye later removed the post about their children, he denied doing so out of remorse.

He wrote on X: “I need everyone to know that I took the post about Jay-Z and Beyoncé's family down… because there was a possibility of my Twitter being cancelled.”

Kim Kardashian, 44, Kanye's ex-wife, is also reportedly outraged by his comments.

A source added to Page Six: “Kim has had enough and she's done trying to be reasonable with Kanye when it comes to communication.”

The insider also said regardless of whatever issues Kanye has with Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Kim firmly believes “kids are off-limits”, describing his comments as both “shocking and offensive.”

While their eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, 12, has been in the public eye since birth, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have taken a more private approach with Rumi and Sir, who have never attended red carpet events or award shows with their parents since their birth in June 2017.

The reports of potential legal action come after Kim reportedly ended an arranged visit between Kanye and their 11-year-old daughter, North, upon learning that highly controversial influencers Andrew Tate, 37, and Tristan Tate, 36, were also expected to be present.

Kanye recently made allegations against Kim, accusing her of exploiting their children in a series of deleted posts on X.

They followed North's appearance in a TikTok video and song with FKA Twigs.

Kanye West and Bianca Censori have unfollowed each other on Instagram.

The rapper, 47, who has been dogged for years by anti-Semitism scandals over his outbursts on social media, last month denied “absurd” rumours that he was “battering his wife”, 30 – and it emerged on Friday (21.03.25) he only follows fellow singer The Game on social media, while Bianca has unfollowed everyone.

Kanye, who had previously unfollowed all accounts before briefly re-following Taylor Swift, had been following model Bianca and jailed rapper Sean ‘Diddy' Combs as recently as a few weeks ago.

Fans also spotted Bianca, who recently returned to Instagram to share revealing photos, had previously followed multiple accounts.

Bianca's return to Instagram follows her husband's latest online attacks against his former wife, Kim Kardashian, and her parenting of their daughter, North.

The model, who has worked for Kanye's Yeezy brand for five years, shared two images taken by RAGA MALAK proprietor Gadir Rajab online to mark her return to social media.

The Melbourne-born designer captioned the photos “italy 2023”, which showed her wearing a sheer ensemble similar to the one she infamously sported at the 2025 Grammys on 2 February alongside Kanye.

She had previously wiped her Instagram account before reactivating it last month, posting images of herself roller-skating in a revealing outfit on 9 March.

Kanye, who shares four children with reality TV star Kim – North, 11, Saint, nine, Chicago, seven, and Psalm, five – recently posted a series of statements on X criticising the reality star.

Reacting to a planned musical collaboration between North and rapper Playboi Carti, 28, Kanye wrote: “So Kim got the name and likeness over my black children.”

He continued: “So a white woman has control over the name and likeness of my Black children and then speaks to Carti about putting my daughter on a song with him... these (dumb a**) celebrities be trying to play with me in my face.”

On Tuesday (18.03.25) evening, West posted a picture on X featuring 12 Polaroid photos of Bianca, captioning the post: “I shot these.”

The couple, who were first publicly seen together in January 2023, have yet to make any public statements regarding the status of their relationship despite widespread reports their marriage may be in trouble.

The status of the former Ukrainian territories that have joined Russia following referendums is key to resolving the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, told American journalist Tucker Carlson in an interview released on Friday.

Witkoff, who has also been actively involved in the US efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict, described the issue as “an elephant in the room” that “no one wants to talk about.”

“They're Russian-speaking. There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under [the] Russian rule,” Witkoff told Carlson during the hour-and-a-half-long interview, adding that Moscow also exercises effective control over the territories.

Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, as well as the two Donbass republics, officially joined Russia in autumn 2022 following a series of referendums.

Kiev has never recognized the votes and continues to claim sovereignty over the territories, as well as over Crimea, which joined Russia back in 2014. The Ukrainian military still controls parts of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, including the regional capitals of the latter two.

According to Witkoff, the issue now is whether the world will acknowledge these territories as Russian and whether Kiev will agree to drop its claims to them. “There are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory,” the envoy said, adding that it could also be particularly difficult for Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky as it could jeopardize his political career.

“Can Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this? This is the central issue in the conflict,” Witkoff said. The envoy still maintained that the US had “very, very positive conversation” on the issue with both sides.

The interview with Witkoff came out shortly after he held face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of diplomatic efforts aimed at mediating an end to the conflict. After the talks, he suggested that a complete ceasefire between Kiev and Moscow could be reached within “a couple of weeks.”

Thousands of supporters rallied in front of Istanbul City Hall for the fourth night on Saturday night after detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu faced further questioning over allegations of corruption and terror links.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Hundreds of supporters gathered in front of an Istanbul courthouse on Saturday, where detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu faced further questioning over allegations of corruption and terror links. His arrest this week intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition.

Police questioned Imamoglu for around five hours on Saturday as part of an investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. A day earlier he was questioned for four hours over the corruption accusations. The mayor rejected all charges during both interrogations. 

He was later transferred to a courthouse for questioning by prosecutors along with some 90 other people who were also detained with him.

The authorities barred access to the courthouse using barricades on local roads and closing nearby metro stations. Hundreds of police officers and over a dozen water cannon trucks were deployed. Still, hundreds gathered in front of the building shouting: “Rights, law, justice!”

Crowds also began to rally outside the city hall for a fourth night in a show of support to the mayor.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on social media that 343 suspects had been detained in protests in major cities on Friday night, adding “There will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people's peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.” The cities listed included Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Antalya, Canakkale, Eskisehir, Konya and Edirne.

Imamoglu, who is a popular opposition figure and seen as a top challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was detained on Wednesday following a dawn raid on his residence over allegations of financial crimes and links to Kurdish militants. Dozens of other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.

Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

His arrest has ignited protests that have steadily increased in intensity.

On Friday, police in Istanbul used pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city's historic aqueduct while hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers. Police also dispersed groups that had rallied outside of the city hall for a third night running, after the opposition Republican People's Party leader, Ozgur Ozel, delivered a speech in support of the mayor.

Simultaneously, police broke up demonstrations in Ankara, the capital, as well as in the Aegean coastal city of Izmir, resorting to forceful measures at times, according to television images. Thousands marched in several other cities calling on the government to resign.

Earlier, Erdogan said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and terror organizations. 

The Istanbul governor's office announced it was expanding a ban on demonstrations until March 26 and imposed restrictions on the entry and exit of vehicles deemed to be transporting people “likely to participate in unlawful activities.”

Erdogan on Saturday accused the CHP's leadership of turning the party “into an apparatus to absolve a handful of municipal robbers who have become blinded by money.”

He also accused it of “doing everything to disturb the public peace, to polarize the nation.”

Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.

The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday — through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey — to show solidarity with Imamoglu.

In a tweet posted shortly before his arrival at the courthouse, Imamoglu urged the public to safeguard the ballot boxes for Sunday's primary, “Don't forget: they are very afraid of you and your democratic right to vote.”

In an earlier message, Imamoglu described his arrest as a “coup” and accused the government of exploiting the judiciary and worsening the country's troubled economy.

A fire at an electrical substation knocked out power to the airport for most of Friday, forcing Europe's busiest hub to shut down for roughly 18 hours, causing widespread cancellations and rerouting headaches, and stranding roughly 200,000 passengers.

British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expects to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday.

While Heathrow reopened on Saturday, airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations.

LONDON (AP) — The British government on Saturday ordered an investigation into the country's “energy resilience” after an electrical substation fire shut Heathrow Airport for almost a day and raised concerns about the U.K.'s ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure. 

While Heathrow Airport said it was “fully operational” on Saturday, thousands of passengers remained stuck, and airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations. 

Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe's busiest air hub.

“This is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It's a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,” said Toby Harris, a Labour Party politician who heads the National Preparedness Commission, a group that campaigns to improve resilience.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he'd asked the National Energy System Operator, which oversees U.K. gas and electricity networks, to “urgently investigate” the fire, “to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.” 

It is expected to report initial findings within six weeks.

“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,” Miliband said.

More than 1,300 flights were canceled and some 200,000 people stranded Friday after an overnight fire at a substation 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away from the airport cut power to Heathrow, and to more than 60,000 properties.

Heathrow said Saturday it had “added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers.” British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expected to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday. 

While many passengers managed to resume stalled journeys, others remained in limbo.

Laura Fritschie from Kansas City was on vacation with her family in Ireland when she learned that her father had died. On Saturday she was stranded at Heathrow after her BA flight to Chicago was canceled at the last minute.

“I'm very frustrated,” she said. “This was my first big vacation with my kids since my husband died, and ... now this. So I just want to go home.”

Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion and then seeing a fireball and clouds of smoke when the blaze ripped through the substation. The fire was brought under control after seven hours, but the airport was shut for almost 18 hours. A handful of flights took off and landed late Friday.

Police said they do not consider the fire suspicious, and the London Fire Brigade said its investigation would focus on the electrical distribution equipment at the substation.

Still, the huge impact of the fire left authorities facing questions about Britain's creaking infrastructure, much of which has been privatized since the 1980s. The center-left Labour government has vowed to improve the U.K.'s delay-plagued railways, its aged water system and — especially — its energy network, promising to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy independence through investment in wind and other renewable power sources.

“The last 40, 50 years we've tried to make services more efficient,” said Harris. “We've stripped out redundancy, we've simplified processes. We've moved towards a sort of ‘just in time' economy. There is an element where you have to make sure you're available for ‘just in case.' You have to plan for things going wrong.”

Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year. 

Chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he was “proud” of the way airport and airline staff had responded.

“The airport didn't shut for days. We shut for hours,” he told the BBC.

Woldbye said Heathrow's backup power supply, designed for emergencies, worked as expected, but it wasn't enough to run the whole airport, which uses as much energy as a small city.

“That's how most airports operate,” said Woldbye, who insisted “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar blaze.

But Willie Walsh, who heads aviation trade organization IATA, said the episode “begs some serious questions.”

“How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,” he said.

Walsh said “Heathrow has very little incentive to improve” because airlines, not the airport, have to pay the cost of looking after disrupted passengers.

Friday's disruption was one of the most serious since the 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut Europe's airspace for days.

Passengers on about 120 flights were in the air when Friday's closure was announced and found themselves landing in different cities, and even different countries.

Mark Doherty and his wife were halfway across the Atlantic when the inflight map showed their flight from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to Heathrow was turning around.

“I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.

Doherty called the situation “typical England — got no back-up plan for something happens like this. There's no contingency plan.”

Associated Press journalist Kwiyeon Ha at Heathrow Airport contributed to this report.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a drone attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing three people and wounded 14, Ukrainian officials said Saturday, despite agreeing to a limited ceasefire.

Zaporizhzhia was hit by 12 drones, police said. Regional head Ivan Fedorov said that residential buildings, cars and communal buildings were set on fire in the Friday night attack. Photos showing emergency services scouring the rubble for survivors. 

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, though it remains to be seen what possible targets would be off-limits to attack.

The three sides appeared to hold starkly different views about what the deal covered. While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be part of the agreement, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.

The dead in Zaporizhzhia were three members of one family. The bodies of the daughter and father were pulled out from under the rubble while doctors unsuccessfully fought for the mother's life for more than 10 hours, Fedorov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. 

The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired a total of 179 drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks overnight into Saturday. It said 100 were intercepted and a further 63 lost, likely having been electronically jammed. 




Officials in the Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions also reported fires breaking out due to the falling debris from intercepted drones.

Russia's Ministry of Defense, meanwhile, said its air defense systems shot down 47 Ukrainian drones. 

Local authorities said two people were injured and there was damage to six apartments when a Ukrainian drone hit a high-rise apartment block in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on Friday night.

Zelenskyy told reporters after Wednesday's call with Trump that Ukraine and U.S. negotiators will discuss technical details related to the partial ceasefire during a meeting in Saudi Arabia on Monday. Russian negotiators are also set to hold separate talks with U.S. officials there.

Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Trump has proposed, saying: “We will not be against any format, any steps toward unconditional ceasefire.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Ukraine and its Western allies.

Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Saturday that Ukraine was continuing with “treacherous attacks” on energy infrastructure facilities, and that Russia reserved the right to a “symmetrical” response.

Her comments came after Russia accused Ukrainian forces Friday of blowing up a gas metering station near the town of Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine's military General Staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the station as part of Russia's “discrediting campaign.”

        President Kim Jong Un gave his full support to Moscow at a meeting with a top Russian official in Pyongyang, North Korean state media said on Saturday.
    

North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has expressed his unwavering support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian official in Pyongyang, North Korean state media said on Saturday. 

Friday's meeting between Kim and Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu followed a South Korean intelligence assessment in late February that North Korea had likely sent troops to assist Russia in its ongoing war against Ukraine. 

Both Russian and North Korean state media said the two officials discussed various issues including Moscow's dialogue with the Trump administration and the security situation on the Korean penisula. 

Kim and Shoigu reportedly reaffirmed the willingness of the two countries' leaders to “unconditionally” uphold a major mutual defence treaty which pledges mutual assistance if either country faces aggression. 

According to Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency, Kim said his government would “invariably support Russia in the struggle for defending their national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests.” 

Shoigu conveyed a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who extended his greetings to Kim and vowed to give “utmost attention” to implementing agreements reached in their recent summits.  

He expressed gratitude for North Korea's “solidarity with Russia's position on all critical geopolitical issues, particularly on the Ukrainian issue,” according to his televised comments.  

North Korean and Russia media didn't say whether any new agreements were reached before Shoigu departed Pyongyang later Friday.

        Ekrem Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate.
    

Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu appeared before police for questioning on terror-related charges on Saturday, a day after his interrogation over corruption allegations.

His arrest earlier this week sparked protests across Turkey, with many demonstrators viewing his detention as a politically driven attempt to eliminate a key rival from the next presidential race.

Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 343 suspects had been detained in protests across the country on Friday night, adding: ""There will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people's peace and security and pursue chaos and provocation.""

Local media reported that police questioned Imamoglu for around five hours as part of an investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan's Workers' Party, of PKK. On Friday he was questioned for four hours over corruption allegations.

Just before he was transferred to the courthouse, local authorities closed nearby roads and a large number of police were dispatched to the area.

Imamoglu is a popular opposition figure and seen as a major challenger to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He was detained on Wednesday following a dawn raid on his residence over allegations of financial crimes and links to Kurdish militants.

The mayor denied all charges put to him during both interrogations.

Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028.

His arrest sparked protests that have steadily increased in intensity. 

On Friday, police in Istanbul used pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city's historic aqueduct while hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers. 

Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

On an October night at a Philadelphia ballroom, guests enjoyed an elaborate cocktail hour with a raw bar.They recorded heartfelt messages into a rotary phone, which would be turned into an audio guest book, and cheered on a professional breakdancing competition, which could be viewed from their seats or on the giant video wall that showed a live feed of the dance floor. The event at Tendenza by Cescaphe was candy-themed, down to the sugar centerpieces, and the guest of honor imbibed a Martinelli's apple-cider tower.  This wasn't a wedding reception. It was a bat mitzvah, the celebration of a Jewish girl's coming of age in the faith. For months, children study and prepare for their bar mitzvah ceremonies, which take place in the synagogue around their 12th or 13th birthday. Afterward, many families hold a party to mark the milestone.Sari Marissa Gower, who helped plan the Northern Liberties event for her younger daughter, Dylan, said the festivities cost about $50,000. The price was well worth it, said Gower, 43, because of “how loved [her daughter] felt.” AdvertisementShe said she felt similarly about her older daughter Madison's Philadelphia-themed bat mitzvah celebration three years ago. That event, held at the Ping-Pong venue SPIN Philadelphia, included appearances by the Mummers and Gritty, and Gower said it cost closer to $35,000 (the South Philly family spent less, she explained, because they had already traveled to Israel for Madison's bat mitzvah ceremony). PARENTS WHO opt for higher-end parties usually spend between $20,000 and $70,000 on these events for their coming-of-age children, according to half a dozen Philadelphia-area event planners and vendors.  (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)The Gower family's parties are relatively modest celebrations. Local parents who opt for higher-end parties usually spend between $20,000 and $70,000 on these events for their coming-of-age children, according to half a dozen Philadelphia-area event planners and vendors. Some hit six figures.“On the decor, production, they could spend between $50,000 to $200,000” if they go all out, said planner Bobby Morganstein. “And then add in the rest of it, with food and everything – it's not that unreasonable to say they could spend $200,000 to $250,000 on an event on the high end.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Planners said the celebrations are increasingly held at unique venues, such as nightclubs in Center City, stadiums in South Philadelphia, or music venues such as the Fillmore, where Jamie Richman had her daughter Simone's June 2023 bat mitzvah. Advertisement“I wanted something really cool, and that was the first thing that came up on my search,” said Richman, 44, of Cherry Hill. While she declined to share publicly how much the party cost, she said every cent was worth it.Jamie Richman said her own bat mitzvah stands out in her memory in part because father died a few years later. She looks back on the party with added fondness because it was one of the last celebrations her family enjoyed together.For Simone, “I wanted it to be magical, to be everything,” she said, so “that we could all live with a very happy memory.”  Richman enlisted the help of Dylan Weisman, partner of Xplosive Entertainment, and Morganstein, owner of Bobby Morganstein Events, who has been emceeing, DJing, and planning bar and bat mitzvahs across the Philadelphia region for three decades. He also owns two venues, Beat Street in Huntingdon Valley and Platform Thirty in Manayunk, and a wholesaling company for event furniture, lighting, and decor rentals.Wealthier clients have always been willing to spend, planners said.But “the goalposts are moving for those high-end events,” said Weisman, whose 100 bar and bat mitzvah clients last year spent $8,500, on average, just on entertainment. Since the pandemic, he added, the parties have gotten more extravagant. “They're trying to find ways to outdo each other.”Today's families can spend on interactive games, like LED basketball and football; elaborate photo booth decor that can cost $6,000 on its own; and tons of swag branded with personalized logos. They can pay special guests – such as the child's favorite Phillies or Eagles players – to send well wishes via video or even make a surprise visit in person.Meanwhile, food, drinks, and other traditional party elements cost more than they used to, due to inflation.Tech, social media up the ante for high-end bar and bat mitzvahsEthan Mazer had a “low-key” bar mitzvah in 2011 at a Wynnewood synagogue hall. The music-themed affair had a DJ and a couple dance motivators, but no photo booths or elaborate games. At the end, one lucky guest got a T-shirt.Today, as the owner of Empower Event Group, Mazer plans parties that look much different.“Technology around photo booths and big screens and special effects are now being brought into some of these events to make really magical moments, with smoke cannons and confetti,” said Mazer, who each year plans about 80 bar and bat mitzvahs, most of which are on the Main Line or in the city.“Custom merchandising is something that never used to be a big thing,” Mazer said. “People always had giveaways, but people are taking it to the next level” with branded pajama pants, blankets, tech gadgets, sweatshirts, crocs, even charms for the crocs.The child being celebrated is often inspired by events and trends they've seen on social media, Mazer said. He has planned parties with Sephora makeup and Lululemon athleisure themes, he said. Another included video gaming stations and “Control-Alt-Delete” decor – a nod to the keystrokes for shutting down a frozen computer app.Morganstein, who's been doing high-end bar and bat mitzvahs for 30 years, said clients often come to planning meetings with elaborate Pinterest boards.Through Morganstein's wholesaling company, Philadelphia Event decor – which accounts for about 75% of his revenue – clients can pick from 15 different dance-floor styles, and a wide array of lounge furniture, lighting, and other decor. Then they add personal branding.Some families still keep bar and bat mitzvahs ‘low-key'Not every Jewish family is going all out.In Lafayette Hill, Valerie Felgoise, owner of Let's Party with Valerie, said some of her clients' budgets are “infinity,” but some plan to spend $2,000 or $3,000.Sharon Fullerton has been photographing bar and bat mitzvahs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland since the 1980s. Families' budgets have always varied, she said, but now they just have more activities and performers to keep the children engaged.“There have always been mitzvahs that raised the bar,” said Fullerton, who owns Mitzvahtography by Sharon Fullerton. “There have always been low-key mitzvahs that fit the family.”Jean Kintisch, owner and founder of Wayne-based Pine Hill Events, said she tends to attract clients looking for “low-key” and “not super-shiny” celebrations.That often means a simpler menu, a limited bar for the adults, a less expensive venue, some DIY decor, and fewer logos, said Kintisch, who has been planning events in the Philadelphia region, New Jersey, and Delaware for 30 years.A “low-key” bar or bat mitzvah could cost between $10,000 and $50,000, she said.“What I always guide my clients to do is not get sucked into the mitzvah machine. And keep the focus on the child,” Kintisch said. “The most important thing is celebrating the milestone of the child being called to the Torah. That's the big deal.”

She said she felt similarly about her older daughter Madison's Philadelphia-themed bat mitzvah celebration three years ago. That event, held at the Ping-Pong venue SPIN Philadelphia, included appearances by the Mummers and Gritty, and Gower said it cost closer to $35,000 (the South Philly family spent less, she explained, because they had already traveled to Israel for Madison's bat mitzvah ceremony).

IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir did not wait long to put his stamp on the military.In a flurry of decisions on Wednesday evening, only hours after being sworn in, he made a variety of major and medium-level changes to the IDF.  1. Iran: Zamir publicly said that 2025 was the year of war focused on Gaza and Iran. This was an incredibly explicit and forceful statement. It should put Iran on notice that the clock is ticking on reaching a diplomatic resolution of the nuclear standoff. And yet that statement was potentially less significant than the decision to close down a special full IDF command portfolio that has been part of the high command since 2020, specifically focused on Iran.Why close down the Iran command when Tehran is only becoming a more serious and more immediate issue than it has ever been before?

They noted that previously there was a Depth Command for strategy that was closed and converted. They said that military realities often change in radical ways.However, in the post-October 7 world, they said that even if it is still necessary to have senior officers who spend all of their time thinking about strategy related to Iran, that the IDF's emphasis in terms of funding and human resources must return to combat fighters regarding border threats.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Given that in the last two years, new units focused on Iran have been created separately in IDF intelligence and in the air force, sources said that it might be less necessary to have a major general and a full high command portfolio just focused on Iran strategy. AdvertisementIn any event, the current and outgoing IDF Strategy and Iran Command Chief Maj. Gen., Eliezer Toledano (he is due to retire) had recommended to Zamit to close down the command.2. Checking into closing the Northern Corps (separate from the Northern Command):The idea of the Northern Corps is to be ready to immediately command and vastly multiply mandatory and reservist forces in the North in the event of a conflict far beyond the expected capacity of what the Northern Command can manage on its own. The current commander, Maj. Gen. Dan Goldfus, was the key general who took over Khan Yunis and played many other critical roles in the war in Gaza.  The Northern Corps was closed before in 2006 by then IDF chief Dan Halutz, but he was criticized for this heavily when the IDF failed to properly manage all of its land forces in the North during the Second Lebanon War. Shortly after Halutz was forced to resign the Northern Corps was reopened.Why now?With that background and so much action this year in the North, why close it now?First of all, unlike the command focused on Iran, the fact that the issue is being reviewed means that Zamir views the situation in the North as dynamic.Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3. Changing the Face of the IDF high commandContrary to what some predicted, Zamir is not racing to quickly change all of the high command. That said there are some major changes, including two key reversals from outgoing IDF Chief Herzi Halevi. Halevi passed over major generals Tamir Yadai and Yani Asur for promotion.Yadai retired for several months, only to now return being promoted to be IDF deputy chief.Asur finished his last role as chief of the IDF Human Resources Command in November and was on his way to retirement, but was brought back by Zamir to be the crucial IDF Southern Command Chief.Zamir's promotion of Itzik Cohen to major general probably would also have happened under Halevi, but his giving Cohen the critical Operation Command in his first position as a major general might not have. Still, in this area, Zamir is keeping on current Operations Command Chief Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk for some period of months to ease the transition. Basiuk was Halevi's right hand man, but has been in his position for around four years, so his retirement is not controversial.Defense sources told the Post that the dozens of other appointments at all levels of command from brigadier general to lieutenant colonel throughout the military were likely close to identical to the list which Halevi would have made.Really what happened was that in mid-December, Defense Minister Israel Katz froze all of Halevi's appointments and there was a glut of officers who were stuck without the ability to move on to their next standard expected roles.In fact, sources noted that Zamir even promoted officers known as close to Halevi, something one would not expect if the new IDF chief was trying to redo all of the appointments.Also, there were specific earlier officers who Katz had frozen the promotions of, who now were allowed to move forward.   It seems that Air Force Command Chief Tomer Bar has been given a pass by Zamir for any October 7 failures as being systematic to the military and not personal to him.The remaining key open question is IDF Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder.Halevi cleared him from any major personal errors on October 7 which allowed him to ascend to his current post in August 2024.But Zamir has ordered a full review of the probes concluded by Halevi by former major general and southern command chief Sami Turgeman.4. New October 7 probesTurgeman ran the southern command 2013-2015, such that he is seen as an expert in the area, but far enough away from the invasion to not be viewed as responsible or have any conflict of interest.Will Turgeman find that Binder and some other officers who have been promoted failed in their duties on October 7 and should lose their posts?Another possibility is that Turgeman could look at October 7 with a wider lens, going beyond the IDF, especially since the Shin Bet report on the disaster is out now.Finally, will Turgeman recommend any more radical changes to the IDF than what Halevi suggested after his probes?One issue which remains very unclear is how long Turgeman will take with his review: a few months or much longer?5. More TanksZamir comes from the Tank Corps. No one was surprised that he is restoring and even growing the power of the tank corps within the military.Likewise, it was unsurprising that if Zamir is returning tank units cut by former IDF chief Aviv Kohavi during a time where the military was told to downsize, that Zamir will also be returning field intelligence collection units which work directly with the tank corps.

Halevi passed over major generals Tamir Yadai and Yani Asur for promotion.Yadai retired for several months, only to now return being promoted to be IDF deputy chief.Asur finished his last role as chief of the IDF Human Resources Command in November and was on his way to retirement, but was brought back by Zamir to be the crucial IDF Southern Command Chief.Zamir's promotion of Itzik Cohen to major general probably would also have happened under Halevi, but his giving Cohen the critical Operation Command in his first position as a major general might not have. Still, in this area, Zamir is keeping on current Operations Command Chief Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk for some period of months to ease the transition. Basiuk was Halevi's right hand man, but has been in his position for around four years, so his retirement is not controversial.Defense sources told the Post that the dozens of other appointments at all levels of command from brigadier general to lieutenant colonel throughout the military were likely close to identical to the list which Halevi would have made.Really what happened was that in mid-December, Defense Minister Israel Katz froze all of Halevi's appointments and there was a glut of officers who were stuck without the ability to move on to their next standard expected roles.In fact, sources noted that Zamir even promoted officers known as close to Halevi, something one would not expect if the new IDF chief was trying to redo all of the appointments.Also, there were specific earlier officers who Katz had frozen the promotions of, who now were allowed to move forward.   It seems that Air Force Command Chief Tomer Bar has been given a pass by Zamir for any October 7 failures as being systematic to the military and not personal to him.The remaining key open question is IDF Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder.Halevi cleared him from any major personal errors on October 7 which allowed him to ascend to his current post in August 2024.But Zamir has ordered a full review of the probes concluded by Halevi by former major general and southern command chief Sami Turgeman.4. New October 7 probesTurgeman ran the southern command 2013-2015, such that he is seen as an expert in the area, but far enough away from the invasion to not be viewed as responsible or have any conflict of interest.Will Turgeman find that Binder and some other officers who have been promoted failed in their duties on October 7 and should lose their posts?Another possibility is that Turgeman could look at October 7 with a wider lens, going beyond the IDF, especially since the Shin Bet report on the disaster is out now.Finally, will Turgeman recommend any more radical changes to the IDF than what Halevi suggested after his probes?One issue which remains very unclear is how long Turgeman will take with his review: a few months or much longer?5. More TanksZamir comes from the Tank Corps. No one was surprised that he is restoring and even growing the power of the tank corps within the military.Likewise, it was unsurprising that if Zamir is returning tank units cut by former IDF chief Aviv Kohavi during a time where the military was told to downsize, that Zamir will also be returning field intelligence collection units which work directly with the tank corps.
            



1. Iran: Zamir publicly said that 2025 was the year of war focused on Gaza and Iran. This was an incredibly explicit and forceful statement. It should put Iran on notice that the clock is ticking on reaching a diplomatic resolution of the nuclear standoff. And yet that statement was potentially less significant than the decision to close down a special full IDF command portfolio that has been part of the high command since 2020, specifically focused on Iran.Why close down the Iran command when Tehran is only becoming a more serious and more immediate issue than it has ever been before?

They noted that previously there was a Depth Command for strategy that was closed and converted. They said that military realities often change in radical ways.However, in the post-October 7 world, they said that even if it is still necessary to have senior officers who spend all of their time thinking about strategy related to Iran, that the IDF's emphasis in terms of funding and human resources must return to combat fighters regarding border threats.

Checking into closing the Northern Corps (separate from the Northern Command):The idea of the Northern Corps is to be ready to immediately command and vastly multiply mandatory and reservist forces in the North in the event of a conflict far beyond the expected capacity of what the Northern Command can manage on its own. The current commander, Maj. Gen. Dan Goldfus, was the key general who took over Khan Yunis and played many other critical roles in the war in Gaza.  The Northern Corps was closed before in 2006 by then IDF chief Dan Halutz, but he was criticized for this heavily when the IDF failed to properly manage all of its land forces in the North during the Second Lebanon War. Shortly after Halutz was forced to resign the Northern Corps was reopened.Why now?With that background and so much action this year in the North, why close it now?First of all, unlike the command focused on Iran, the fact that the issue is being reviewed means that Zamir views the situation in the North as dynamic.Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3.

Shortly after Halutz was forced to resign the Northern Corps was reopened.Why now?With that background and so much action this year in the North, why close it now?First of all, unlike the command focused on Iran, the fact that the issue is being reviewed means that Zamir views the situation in the North as dynamic.Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3. Changing the Face of the IDF high commandContrary to what some predicted, Zamir is not racing to quickly change all of the high command. That said there are some major changes, including two key reversals from outgoing IDF Chief Herzi Halevi. Halevi passed over major generals Tamir Yadai and Yani Asur for promotion.Yadai retired for several months, only to now return being promoted to be IDF deputy chief.Asur finished his last role as chief of the IDF Human Resources Command in November and was on his way to retirement, but was brought back by Zamir to be the crucial IDF Southern Command Chief.Zamir's promotion of Itzik Cohen to major general probably would also have happened under Halevi, but his giving Cohen the critical Operation Command in his first position as a major general might not have. Still, in this area, Zamir is keeping on current Operations Command Chief Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk for some period of months to ease the transition. Basiuk was Halevi's right hand man, but has been in his position for around four years, so his retirement is not controversial.Defense sources told the Post that the dozens of other appointments at all levels of command from brigadier general to lieutenant colonel throughout the military were likely close to identical to the list which Halevi would have made.Really what happened was that in mid-December, Defense Minister Israel Katz froze all of Halevi's appointments and there was a glut of officers who were stuck without the ability to move on to their next standard expected roles.In fact, sources noted that Zamir even promoted officers known as close to Halevi, something one would not expect if the new IDF chief was trying to redo all of the appointments.Also, there were specific earlier officers who Katz had frozen the promotions of, who now were allowed to move forward.   It seems that Air Force Command Chief Tomer Bar has been given a pass by Zamir for any October 7 failures as being systematic to the military and not personal to him.The remaining key open question is IDF Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder.Halevi cleared him from any major personal errors on October 7 which allowed him to ascend to his current post in August 2024.But Zamir has ordered a full review of the probes concluded by Halevi by former major general and southern command chief Sami Turgeman.4. New October 7 probesTurgeman ran the southern command 2013-2015, such that he is seen as an expert in the area, but far enough away from the invasion to not be viewed as responsible or have any conflict of interest.Will Turgeman find that Binder and some other officers who have been promoted failed in their duties on October 7 and should lose their posts?Another possibility is that Turgeman could look at October 7 with a wider lens, going beyond the IDF, especially since the Shin Bet report on the disaster is out now.Finally, will Turgeman recommend any more radical changes to the IDF than what Halevi suggested after his probes?One issue which remains very unclear is how long Turgeman will take with his review: a few months or much longer?5. More TanksZamir comes from the Tank Corps. No one was surprised that he is restoring and even growing the power of the tank corps within the military.Likewise, it was unsurprising that if Zamir is returning tank units cut by former IDF chief Aviv Kohavi during a time where the military was told to downsize, that Zamir will also be returning field intelligence collection units which work directly with the tank corps.

Given that in the last two years, new units focused on Iran have been created separately in IDF intelligence and in the air force, sources said that it might be less necessary to have a major general and a full high command portfolio just focused on Iran strategy.

It seems that Air Force Command Chief Tomer Bar has been given a pass by Zamir for any October 7 failures as being systematic to the military and not personal to him.The remaining key open question is IDF Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder.Halevi cleared him from any major personal errors on October 7 which allowed him to ascend to his current post in August 2024.But Zamir has ordered a full review of the probes concluded by Halevi by former major general and southern command chief Sami Turgeman.4. New October 7 probesTurgeman ran the southern command 2013-2015, such that he is seen as an expert in the area, but far enough away from the invasion to not be viewed as responsible or have any conflict of interest.Will Turgeman find that Binder and some other officers who have been promoted failed in their duties on October 7 and should lose their posts?Another possibility is that Turgeman could look at October 7 with a wider lens, going beyond the IDF, especially since the Shin Bet report on the disaster is out now.Finally, will Turgeman recommend any more radical changes to the IDF than what Halevi suggested after his probes?One issue which remains very unclear is how long Turgeman will take with his review: a few months or much longer?5. More TanksZamir comes from the Tank Corps. No one was surprised that he is restoring and even growing the power of the tank corps within the military.Likewise, it was unsurprising that if Zamir is returning tank units cut by former IDF chief Aviv Kohavi during a time where the military was told to downsize, that Zamir will also be returning field intelligence collection units which work directly with the tank corps.
            



Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3. Changing the Face of the IDF high commandContrary to what some predicted, Zamir is not racing to quickly change all of the high command. That said there are some major changes, including two key reversals from outgoing IDF Chief Herzi Halevi. Halevi passed over major generals Tamir Yadai and Yani Asur for promotion.Yadai retired for several months, only to now return being promoted to be IDF deputy chief.Asur finished his last role as chief of the IDF Human Resources Command in November and was on his way to retirement, but was brought back by Zamir to be the crucial IDF Southern Command Chief.Zamir's promotion of Itzik Cohen to major general probably would also have happened under Halevi, but his giving Cohen the critical Operation Command in his first position as a major general might not have.

US envoy Steve Witkoff, who played a key role in the ceasefire deal in January that enabled 33 hostages to be freed, spoke on the Tucker Carlson Show recently. The interview has raised eyebrows because some commentators have focused on Witkoff's comments about Qatar, the country which hosts Hamas and has played a role as mediator.The interview with Carlson comes at a unique time. Carlson has also interviewed the prime minister of Qatar recently. He has also had guests who have been critical of Israel.  On the other side, Witkoff has been playing a key role in other Trump administration initiatives, such as outreach to Russia. The interview comes a week after Reuters noted that the “Trump administration has withdrawn the nomination of Adam Boehler to serve as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.”Boehler had held direct talks with Hamas and also done a round of interviews on Israeli media. He was critiqued for his comments that appeared to be soft on Hamas. The interview also came out as CNN reported that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has “run the risk of being overshadowed” by Witkoff's role. Both Rubio and Witkoff have pushed back on this report. AdvertisementNevertheless, clearly, the interview comes at a unique time in US policy and also a unique time as the Trump administration seeks a doctrine in world affairs. STEVE WITKOFF delivers an address at the presidential inaugural parade in Washington on January 20. He deserves congratulations from all of us in Israel on successfully completing a hostage-ceasefire deal before starting his role as Middle East envoy for US President Donald Trump, says the writer. (credit: Carlos Barria/Reuters)The administration launched airstrikes on the Houthis and reportedly sent a letter to Iran. Many things are up in the air. Hamas did not accept a deal that Witkoff pushed that could have extended the ceasefire whose first phase ended on March 1. Israel began airstrikes on Hamas on March 18. Now the war is back on. All eyes on WitkoffMany eyes are focused on Witkoff. His comments to Carlson are important. What did Witkoff say? He said that Qatar wants stability in the region and also wants a peace treaty with the US.Qatar is already a major non-NATO ally of the US. He said Qatar is an ally of the US and that it has moderated its positions. He also said that the head of US Central Command has described Qataris as “special.” Hamas wants to rule Gaza, Witkoff noted. He said that is unacceptable to the US.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  “We can't have a terrorist organization running Gaza.” He went on to say, “we trust the Qataris,” the envoy said. He said the Qataris have explained to Hamas “where they have to get to, to make a deal.” AdvertisementWitkoff is passionate about the hostages. He also is passionate about condemning October 7. He said, having watched the Hamas attacks, that it's hard to be dispassionate in the talks. “We can't ignore the reality of October 7.” He said part of the deal-making involves trying to figure out what Hamas wants. He said he doesn't think Hamas is ideologically intractable. He believes that a deal is possible. “I had to feel it for myself,” he says in how a negotiator has to operate in the region. He spoke to the released hostages. He has deep empathy for the hostages. He also discusses how Trump is “up close and personal” in caring for the hostages and being involved.The envoy wants to finish things with dialogue. Currently, there is a conflict in Gaza and it remains to be seen if he can bridge the gaps. He says this is the same method for talks with Iran, Russia and also talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia.Witkoff discussed being critiqued for being too close to Qatar. He describes the country as a mediator and he says he must collaborate with Doha to be effective. He also describes how he wanted to be like Trump when Witkoff was a young lawyer. Now he has a chance as Trump's envoy to make an impact on the world. He talked about how he wanted to see Gaza and see things on the ground for himself. He also discussed how Israel has enabled talks by having eliminated Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and weakening the “Iranian crescent.” Witkoff discussed the nuances in the Middle East that he has seen. He talked about the Arab summit in Cairo and also Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies.  Another issue that Witkoff is dealing with is Iran. He discussed the recent Trump letter sent to Iran. He says the US can never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon and have outsized influence in the Gulf. He says that Hezbollah and Hamas are weakened. He also says the recent US campaign against the Houthis will clip their wings. He mentioned that Lebanon could normalize ties with Israel. He also mentioned the new Syrian government of Ahmed Sharaa. He mentioned the possibility of normalization with Syria and Saudi Arabia. This would lead to a “GCC that all works together,” referencing cooperation in the Gulf.In Gaza what matters is demilitarization, Witkoff says. He describes Hamas as an “idea” and notes that removing its arms is important. “How do you build a framework,” Carlson asks. “We will need stability in Gaza,” Witkoff says. he also discusses the need for a better life for people in Gaza. He says Gazans currently lack opportunities. He says the US will attempt to ascertain development plans for Gaza. He also mentioned the issue of two states. “How do we have a better living prescription for Palestinians living in Gaza,” Witkoff says. He discussed the idea of development in Gaza, providing “prospects” for people in Gaza. Discussing the ceasefire and other US initiatives, Witkoff praised Trump's team. He said Trump listens to his team and is flexible. “We go out with that way of thinking, for the most part.”Witkoff says he is optimistic about an end to the fighting in Gaza. He said Israel likely had to go back into Gaza. He describes Hamas as being unreasonable in refusing a bridge to a peace deal at the end of the first phase of talks. He says the Hamas reaction was “inappropriate.” Clearly, Hamas was obstructing things from March 1 to March 18. He says that there needs to be a real security force in Gaza that is not Hamas in Gaza.Witkoff discussed the importance of stability in the region. He notes the problems in Egypt, how the country's economy is problematic and there is large unemployment. He also discussed the challenges in Saudi Arabia and how the region may look at the changes in Syria. He said there could be several countries joining the Abraham Accords.Carlson also asked about the conflict in Ukraine. He notes that Trump tapped Witkoff to talk with Moscow after the success in negotiating the Gaza ceasefire in January. He described Russian President Vladimir Putin as respecting Trump. Witkoff described the goal in Ukraine as a thirty-day ceasefire with Russia. He says the frontline in Ukraine is complex because of some seventy different points of conflict and battle along the long front. He said that there is flexibility in Kyiv as well.“I am very optimistic that we will be able to bring the two sides together.” Witkoff is also optimistic about other conflicts. He speaks about Iran and Turkey and other countries responding to US “strong leadership.”Regarding Iran, Witkoff says that a diplomatic solution with Iran is achievable. He noted that Iran's air defenses have been weakened by Israel's strikes last year. He says Trump is reaching out to Iran from a standpoint of strength. Trump's administration is now trying to build trust with Tehran. Witkoff says things can be solved by dialogue. He says the situation is very complex due to Iran's nuclear program.At the end of the interview, the envoy discusses how he moved into his current role. “I wanted to do something that felt worthy to me,” WItkoff says. He wanted to save lives and do something positive. He says he consulted with Jared Kushner about Kushner's work during the first Trump administration. He calls his current work as having been “blessed.”

On Inauguration Day 2025, Israelis clamored, lining up and down the street for a Friends of Zion event in Jerusalem, celebrating Donald Trump's second-term swearing-in. The same red carpet welcome was given by Trump and the Republicans in control of Washington as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the newly returned-to-power president. Netanyahu's presence in American politics is significant, and his latest visit underscores his enduring role.Netanyahu often confronts, angers, and teases American presidents with his tactics. On February 4, 2025, Netanyahu met Trump at the White House, reinforcing Israel's rising global influence as Trump distanced the US from traditional allies. This time, an American president extended a warm welcome to the Israeli prime minister, strengthening his standing in Israel and on the global stage. Netanyahu was the first world leader Trump met with after his inauguration. The meeting with the Republican-controlled government was going so well for Netanyahu that he extended his trip.  Inside jokes and praise characterized Netanyahu and Trump's White House meeting, contrasting with the chilly winter weather. Netanyahu gifted Trump a golden pager, alluding to the September attacks in Lebanon, while Trump gave Netanyahu a photo of the two leaders. Netanyahu said he was “honored… to be the first foreign leader to visit the White House in your second term. This is a testament to your friendship and support for the Jewish state and the Jewish people.” Netanyahu gushed, “You are the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House.” He used the term “daylight” to describe the difference between his relationship with Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Trump. Netanyahu's relationship with Biden stands out among Democratic presidents. However, his relationship with Trump has not always been convivial.The strength of Netanyahu's influence over the USThis renewed agreement on policy for Israel and Gaza does not represent the strength of America but rather Netanyahu's influence, which spans from presidents Ronald Reagan to Trump. Typically, the US exerts its power over Israel in reverse. This moment highlights Netanyahu's continued political strength and influence in American-Israeli relations. Unlike other Israeli leaders, Netanyahu balances admiration for the US with a demand for Israel's independence and respect. His American upbringing shaped his political views and alignment with Republicans. AdvertisementAt the same time, his story spans almost the entirety of Israel's modern statehood history. Anshel Pfeffer, in his biography Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu, pointed out: “Netanyahu belongs to both Israels – its old ‘serving elite' and the seething underdogs. He is also a product of the United States, where he spent much of his early life and career. He believes that he understands and connects with America better than some American presidents and, when necessary, challenges them on their own turf.”  PRIME MINISTER Benjamin Netanyahu meets with then-US president Joe Biden in the Oval Office. (credit: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters)Netanyahu “fervently believes that Israel shares in the exceptional destiny of the United States – that together they are the world's indispensable nations. He sees an even greater bond between the two countries than what Winston Churchill described as “the special relationship” between the United States and Great Britain. Viewing Israel as equal to the US and his general disdain for Democrats have motivated Netanyahu's approach to his American counterparts, giving him the courage to strike if it serves Israel's best interests. Netanyahu's interactions with American presidents often lead to extensive media coverage, reflecting the complexity of these relationships. Even with the presidents most personally connected to Israel, such as Bill Clinton, Biden, and Trump, there have been contentions, while his disagreements with Barack Obama were legendary in words, actions, and images. Netanyahu has provoked the most colorful language from some of the American presidents, such as Democrats Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and Israel's closest ally, Republican Trump.In August 2019, President Trump gave himself the crown as “history's most pro-Israel US president.” Trump continually blamed “radical” Democrats for ruining “the special relationship between the US and Israel.” During his election campaigns, he accused American Jews, saying, “If you vote for a Democrat, you are very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.”    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  During his first term, Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, moved the US Embassy there (from Tel Aviv), acknowledged Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, cut aid to the Palestinians, and negotiated the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab nations. AdvertisementDespite their strong alliance, Trump felt betrayed when Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his election in 2020. Trump recalled in an interview, “The first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with… Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake,” Trump told Axios journalist Barak Ravid. “I haven't spoken to him since.”Since his first term in 1996, Netanyahu has challenged US presidents, famously provoking Bill Clinton to exclaim, ‘Who's the f---ing superpower here?' US diplomat Aaron David Miller later recalled the incident in his memoir The Much Too Promised Land. That was exactly Netanyahu's point. Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton worked to ensure that Netanyahu would lose his next election by manipulating who they would collaborate with on a peace agreement. This strategy shaped Netanyahu's approach to interacting with American leaders upon his reelection in 2009.Netanyahu's power struggle with Obama was more intense, straining US-Israel relations. Their clash began over Obama's insistence on the Iran nuclear deal and a two-state solution. Netanyahu's intimidation method of choice is lecturing. During his May 2011 meeting with Obama, Netanyahu spent six and a half minutes lecturing him about the peace process. His team was “comfortable” with his approach, believing it necessary.  In November 2011, Obama created a controversial incident in a hot mic moment when then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy called Netanyahu a liar. Obama replied, “You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.” Their tensions culminated in March 2015 when Netanyahu addressed Congress against the Iran nuclear deal without White House approval.Netanyahu has had the longest relationship with Joe Biden, whom he has known since Biden was a junior senator during Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s. However, their relationship deteriorated during Biden's vice presidency, especially after Netanyahu's government announced new West Bank settlements during Biden's official visit in 2010. Toward the end of his vice presidential term, Biden wrote on a photo of the two leaders, “Bibi, I love you. I don't agree with a damn thing you say,” which Netanyahu keeps on his desk.Netanyahu's support for Trump further strained his ties with Biden as president, delaying their diplomatic engagement. By March 2024, with the ongoing war in Gaza after the October 7 attacks, Biden's relationship with Netanyahu had reached a critical point. Biden publicly stated that Netanyahu was “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” and, in private, called Netanyahu an “A-hole.” Biden demonstrated his toughness by allowing two UN Security Council resolutions to pass and by withholding armaments for the war.Still, Netanyahu praised Biden in their July 2024 meeting after Biden dropped out of the presidential race, thanking him for “50 years of public service and support for Israel.” However, Netanyahu supported Trump over Biden's successor, Kamala Harris, in the election and quickly congratulated Trump on X, calling his victory “history's greatest comeback.”This time, Netanyahu is using a strength-through-peace attitude with Trump, making it clear that Israel is America's equal. Netanyahu's strategic positioning strengthens his US support while addressing critics in Israel. Trump's exit won't deter Netanyahu, who is already positioning himself for Israel's next election. Netanyahu continues to assert his influence, shaping the discourse around US-Israel relations. As scholar Walter Russell-Mead concludes, “One thing seems clear. Win, lose, or draw, Bibi Netanyahu is leaving deep footprints in the sands of time…He will occupy an outsize place not only in the history of Israel and the modern Middle East but also in the history of the Jewish people.” On the political stage, it's Netanyahu's world, and we are all living in it.■Bonnie K.

He is also a product of the United States, where he spent much of his early life and career. He believes that he understands and connects with America better than some American presidents and, when necessary, challenges them on their own turf.”  PRIME MINISTER Benjamin Netanyahu meets with then-US president Joe Biden in the Oval Office. (credit: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters)Netanyahu “fervently believes that Israel shares in the exceptional destiny of the United States – that together they are the world's indispensable nations. He sees an even greater bond between the two countries than what Winston Churchill described as “the special relationship” between the United States and Great Britain. Viewing Israel as equal to the US and his general disdain for Democrats have motivated Netanyahu's approach to his American counterparts, giving him the courage to strike if it serves Israel's best interests. Netanyahu's interactions with American presidents often lead to extensive media coverage, reflecting the complexity of these relationships. Even with the presidents most personally connected to Israel, such as Bill Clinton, Biden, and Trump, there have been contentions, while his disagreements with Barack Obama were legendary in words, actions, and images. Netanyahu has provoked the most colorful language from some of the American presidents, such as Democrats Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and Israel's closest ally, Republican Trump.In August 2019, President Trump gave himself the crown as “history's most pro-Israel US president.” Trump continually blamed “radical” Democrats for ruining “the special relationship between the US and Israel.” During his election campaigns, he accused American Jews, saying, “If you vote for a Democrat, you are very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.”    Stay updated with the latest news!

AdvertisementDespite their strong alliance, Trump felt betrayed when Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his election in 2020. Trump recalled in an interview, “The first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with… Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake,” Trump told Axios journalist Barak Ravid. “I haven't spoken to him since.”Since his first term in 1996, Netanyahu has challenged US presidents, famously provoking Bill Clinton to exclaim, ‘Who's the f---ing superpower here?' US diplomat Aaron David Miller later recalled the incident in his memoir The Much Too Promised Land. That was exactly Netanyahu's point. Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton worked to ensure that Netanyahu would lose his next election by manipulating who they would collaborate with on a peace agreement. This strategy shaped Netanyahu's approach to interacting with American leaders upon his reelection in 2009.Netanyahu's power struggle with Obama was more intense, straining US-Israel relations. Their clash began over Obama's insistence on the Iran nuclear deal and a two-state solution. Netanyahu's intimidation method of choice is lecturing. During his May 2011 meeting with Obama, Netanyahu spent six and a half minutes lecturing him about the peace process. His team was “comfortable” with his approach, believing it necessary.  In November 2011, Obama created a controversial incident in a hot mic moment when then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy called Netanyahu a liar. Obama replied, “You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.” Their tensions culminated in March 2015 when Netanyahu addressed Congress against the Iran nuclear deal without White House approval.Netanyahu has had the longest relationship with Joe Biden, whom he has known since Biden was a junior senator during Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s. However, their relationship deteriorated during Biden's vice presidency, especially after Netanyahu's government announced new West Bank settlements during Biden's official visit in 2010. Toward the end of his vice presidential term, Biden wrote on a photo of the two leaders, “Bibi, I love you. I don't agree with a damn thing you say,” which Netanyahu keeps on his desk.Netanyahu's support for Trump further strained his ties with Biden as president, delaying their diplomatic engagement. By March 2024, with the ongoing war in Gaza after the October 7 attacks, Biden's relationship with Netanyahu had reached a critical point. Biden publicly stated that Netanyahu was “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” and, in private, called Netanyahu an “A-hole.” Biden demonstrated his toughness by allowing two UN Security Council resolutions to pass and by withholding armaments for the war.Still, Netanyahu praised Biden in their July 2024 meeting after Biden dropped out of the presidential race, thanking him for “50 years of public service and support for Israel.” However, Netanyahu supported Trump over Biden's successor, Kamala Harris, in the election and quickly congratulated Trump on X, calling his victory “history's greatest comeback.”This time, Netanyahu is using a strength-through-peace attitude with Trump, making it clear that Israel is America's equal. Netanyahu's strategic positioning strengthens his US support while addressing critics in Israel. Trump's exit won't deter Netanyahu, who is already positioning himself for Israel's next election. Netanyahu continues to assert his influence, shaping the discourse around US-Israel relations. As scholar Walter Russell-Mead concludes, “One thing seems clear. Win, lose, or draw, Bibi Netanyahu is leaving deep footprints in the sands of time…He will occupy an outsize place not only in the history of Israel and the modern Middle East but also in the history of the Jewish people.” On the political stage, it's Netanyahu's world, and we are all living in it.■Bonnie K.

In November 2011, Obama created a controversial incident in a hot mic moment when then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy called Netanyahu a liar. Obama replied, “You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.” Their tensions culminated in March 2015 when Netanyahu addressed Congress against the Iran nuclear deal without White House approval.Netanyahu has had the longest relationship with Joe Biden, whom he has known since Biden was a junior senator during Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s. However, their relationship deteriorated during Biden's vice presidency, especially after Netanyahu's government announced new West Bank settlements during Biden's official visit in 2010. Toward the end of his vice presidential term, Biden wrote on a photo of the two leaders, “Bibi, I love you. I don't agree with a damn thing you say,” which Netanyahu keeps on his desk.Netanyahu's support for Trump further strained his ties with Biden as president, delaying their diplomatic engagement. By March 2024, with the ongoing war in Gaza after the October 7 attacks, Biden's relationship with Netanyahu had reached a critical point. Biden publicly stated that Netanyahu was “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” and, in private, called Netanyahu an “A-hole.” Biden demonstrated his toughness by allowing two UN Security Council resolutions to pass and by withholding armaments for the war.Still, Netanyahu praised Biden in their July 2024 meeting after Biden dropped out of the presidential race, thanking him for “50 years of public service and support for Israel.” However, Netanyahu supported Trump over Biden's successor, Kamala Harris, in the election and quickly congratulated Trump on X, calling his victory “history's greatest comeback.”This time, Netanyahu is using a strength-through-peace attitude with Trump, making it clear that Israel is America's equal. Netanyahu's strategic positioning strengthens his US support while addressing critics in Israel. Trump's exit won't deter Netanyahu, who is already positioning himself for Israel's next election. Netanyahu continues to assert his influence, shaping the discourse around US-Israel relations. As scholar Walter Russell-Mead concludes, “One thing seems clear. Win, lose, or draw, Bibi Netanyahu is leaving deep footprints in the sands of time…He will occupy an outsize place not only in the history of Israel and the modern Middle East but also in the history of the Jewish people.” On the political stage, it's Netanyahu's world, and we are all living in it.■Bonnie K.

An unassuming beach day for two beachgoers turned exciting when they allegedly came across a mysterious figure with a “skeleton-like” structure and fins. They shared the photos online, claiming the figure washed ashore on a UK beach. While the photos shocked people, it also sparked a debate on social media. While some were curious about it, others downright labelled it as fake.

According to Mirror, Paula Regan came across the eerie object while walking on the beach with her husband, Dave. “For the life of me, I can't tell you what it was,” Paula Regan told South West News Service, reported New York Post, adding, “It was the weirdest thing.”

The photos show what many speculate looks like the skeletal remains of the mythical mermaid. In the pics, the figure is partially buried in the sand with seaweed scattered around it. What is intriguing is that the pictures show the figure having a tail-like structure and a skeletal head.

The photos received numerous reactions from social media users. While some were amazed, a few expressed, ""There's no way this is real.""

“It was last Monday - a beautiful, sunny day - and we thought we'd blow the cobwebs away with a walk along the beach,” Regan told the Mirror. She added, “The beach was completely empty, so it really stood out. At first, I thought it was a bit of driftwood or maybe a dead seal because I could see these funny tail fin things.”

“When we got up to it, it was the weirdest thing. For the life of me, I can't tell you what it was. The head looked skeletal, but the back part - where the fishtail was - was soft and squidgy. It didn't feel slimy or decomposed, but it was definitely strange,” she continued.

She told the outlet that soon people started coming over, and a crowd gathered around it. “A small crowd gathered - people walking their dogs, passers-by - and even a man setting up the beach huts came over. Nobody could work out what it was,” she said.

“Some thought it might have fallen off a boat, while others suggested it could be a figurehead from a ship - like one of those carved mermaids. I just knew no one would believe us if we didn't take a picture,” she continued.

According to the outlet, Thanet District Council, the UK area where the figure was discovered, admitted that they knew about the situation but refused to comment on it.

Michelle Obama recently recounted her daughter Sasha's scary high school car accident. During her appearance on Kylie Kelce's Not Gonna Lie podcast, the former first lady opened up about the emotional challenges of raising independent children and the difficult lesson of letting go.

“Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go. Try as we might, there's only so much we can control,” Michelle shared in a 2019 interview with Vogue UK. Michelle and Barack share two daughter-Malia and Sasha.

Michelle recounted, “Once they [Sasha and Malia] got their license, we got a car for them. And then the agents ... they have to follow this teenager now to school, to parties,” she explained.

“But one time Sasha got T-boned, literally her car totalled. Some lady T-boned her,” Michelle recalled. “And you get this call that Sasha was in an accident; the car was totalled.”

Although the accident was severe, Sasha fortunately walked away without major injuries. Despite this scary experience, both Obama daughters became confident drivers.

Michelle had previously discussed their journey to becoming proficient behind the wheel.

Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2018, she shared how the Secret Service helped teach Malia to drive. “They had to do things like learn how to drive, and learn how to drive on their own,” she said.

“Her [Malia] instructor put her in the car and said, 'Floor it ... Press the gas as hard as you can, and then I want you to stop,'” she revealed.

Sasha has been captured driving confidently in various scenes over the years. In May 2022, she was later seen dropping Malia off at LAX in a black hatchback. Sasha got back behind the wheel as the sisters exchanged a warm embrace, seemingly unfazed by paparazzi attention.

Paparazzi lensed her driving in September 2023 as she smoked a cigarette behind the wheel and seemed relaxed in Los Angeles.

Scientists have been left amused after spotting an octopus hitchhiking during its journey, albeit with an unlikely marine friend. In a video posted on social media, researchers captured the orange-hued Maori octopus clinging to the back of a large shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), regarded as one of the fastest sharks in the world.

The footage captured in December 2023 but released this week shows the ""sharktopus"", casually strolling around in the Hauraki Gulf off the northern coast of New Zealand's North Island.

""At first, I was like: 'Is it a buoy? Is it entangled in fishing gear or had a big bite?'"" Rochelle Constantin, marine ecologist at the University of Auckland told the New York Times.

Afterwards, one of the technicians set up a drone for a closer look which managed to capture the stunning footage. As per the researchers, what made the incident unusual was the fact that octopuses are usually found on the seabed where shortfin mako sharks rarely pay a visit.

""We moved on after 10 minutes, so I can't tell you what happened next. The octopus may have been in for quite the experience, though, since the world's fastest shark species can reach 50 km per hour,"" said Ms Constantin.

""The 'sharktopus' encounter is a reminder of the wonders of the ocean. One of the best things about being a marine scientist is that you never know what you might see next in the sea. By supporting conservation initiatives, we can help to ensure that such extraordinary moments keep happening.""

As the video went viral, social media users reacted in astonishment with many calling the octopus smart for utilising the ocean resources for its commute.

""This octopus is a genius. Work smart, not hard,"" said one user while another added: 'Bro got himself an Uber.""

A third commented: ""You know humanity is doomed when the alien octopi start domesticating the sharks to ride into battle.""

The researchers said it is possible that the octopus may have fallen with the shark quickly devouring it but it is equally likely that the eight-armed commuter may have slid to the seabed safely, owing to the shallow waters.

A video of celebratory firing at a wedding in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar has gone viral, leading to the suspension of two police constables.

The clip shows Prashant Kumar, a constable posted at Ramraj police station, firing bullets while standing on a makeshift dance floor, while another constable, Gaurav Kumar, is seen dancing nearby.

After the video surfaced on social media, senior officials took cognisance of the matter and immediately suspended both policemen. A case has also been registered against Prashant Kumar at the Ramraj police station.

Circle Officer Jansath Yatendra Nagar said that further legal action will be taken based on the investigation.

A teacher at a Catholic school for children in Italy has been suspended after she was caught moonlighting as an OnlyFans model. One of the parents recognised Elena Maraga, 29, selling her content on the adult website and informed other parents through a WhatsApp group chat and Facebook, according to a report in The Telegraph.

After receiving the complaint, the school administration took action with Ms Maraga pushing back. She argued that what she did in her free time did not harm anyone else, adding that her salary of around 1,200 euros (Rs 1.1 lakh) a month was ""unsustainable"".

""That's why I had already considered other careers. I know friends who earn very well. I simply thought that I'm proud of the physical results I've achieved and I like to show them off,"" she told Italian media.

Notably, Ms Maraga has a degree in Educational Sciences and has five years of experience working in a Catholic nursery school.

""I love teaching children, it's my calling. But I earn much more on the Internet. I opened OnlyFans a month ago, partly for fun, partly out of curiosity, partly to see if you could really earn money. In one day I get a month's salary,"" she added.

Amid the controversy, Italy's education ministry is preparing to chalk up a new code of ethics prohibiting teachers from appearing on adult websites. The code is likely to direct teachers to ""avoid statements, images or behaviour that could damage the prestige and reputation"" of their schools.

As the news went viral, several social media users reacted sharply, calling out the school administration and the parent who snitched on Ms Maraga.

""What she does after hours is her business. Maybe the dad should look at himself. People in glass houses,"" said one user while another added: ""Surely her private life has got nothing to do with anybody.""

A third added: ""I think it's just about ethics. If you are teacher, you have to set an example for the students.""

Last year, YouTuber Zara Dar, who advocated for women in science and technology, quit her PhD programme to join OnlyFans. In a video titled ""PhD dropout to OnlyFans model,"" Ms Dar explained her decision, stating that while it was a difficult choice, she was not particularly sad, describing her move to OnlyFans as a career switch and a gamble on her future.

Critics say cuts will mean that children will have to face off alone in court against experienced Ice attorneys

The Trump administration is reported to have cut funding to a legal program that provides representation for unaccompanied immigrant children, one month after directing immigration enforcement agents to track down minors who had entered the US without guardians last month.

Organizations that collectively receive more than $200m in federal grants were informed that the contract through the office of refugee resettlement had been partially terminated, according to a memo issued on Friday by the interior department and obtained by ABC News.

The cut affects funding for legal representation and for the recruitment of attorneys to represent immigrant children but maintains a contract for “Know Your Rights”, a presentation given to unaccompanied immigrant children in detention centers.

Currently, 26,000 immigrant children receive government-funded legal representation, but many are representing themselves in immigration court due to a shortage of attorneys. In 2023, 56% of unaccompanied minors in immigration courts were represented by counsel, according to the Department of Justice.

In a White House memo to the justice department posted on Saturday, the executive branch identified the immigration system as one of several legal areas “where rampant fraud and meritless claims have supplanted the constitutional and lawful bases upon which the President exercises core powers”.

“The immigration bar, and powerful Big Law pro bono practices, frequently coach clients to conceal their past or lie about their circumstances when asserting their asylum claims, all in an attempt to circumvent immigration policies enacted to protect our national security and deceive the immigration authorities and courts into granting them undeserved relief,” the White House said.

The memo directed the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, “to prioritize enforcement of their respective regulations governing attorney conduct and discipline”.

Lawyers for Civil Rights, a legal advocacy group currently suing the administration over deportations, called Trump's sanctions threat hypocritical in a statement to Reuters, saying the president and his allies “have repeatedly thumbed their noses at the rule of law”.

The move to cut funding for legal representation was immediately denounced by immigrant legal and welfare groups.

“The US government is violating legal protections for immigrant children and forcing them to fight their immigration cases alone,” said Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, deputy director of the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.

“Already, we are seeing the government move for the expedited removal of unrepresented children. These services are critical not only as a matter of fundamental fairness – children should not be asked to stand up in court alone against a trained government attorney – but also for protecting children from trafficking, abuse and exploitation, and for helping immigration courts run more efficiently.”

Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), said the Trump administration had gone “all-in today on endangering unaccompanied children and interfering with their right to due process, breaking with decades of bipartisan congressional support for legal services for vulnerable children”.

Toczylowski added that without representation, “the 26,000 children whose access to counsel was slashed today will be at higher risk of exploitation and trafficking and their chances of obtaining legal protection will plummet. No child should be forced to fend for themselves against a trained [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] attorney without a lawyer by their side.”

A study published by Save the Children in December found that record numbers of unaccompanied minors have come into the US since 2021.

In 2022, the US Department of Health and Human Services received a record 128,904 unaccompanied minors, up from 122,731 in the prior year, the majority coming from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

There are more than 600,000 immigrant children who have crossed the US-Mexico border without a legal guardian or parent since 2019, according to government data.

According to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) memo – “Unaccompanied Alien Children Joint Initiative Field Implementation” – issued in February and obtained by ABC News and Reuters, agents are directed to detain unaccompanied immigrant children to ensure they are not victims of human trafficking or other forms of exploitation.

Ice agents are directed to categorize unaccompanied immigrants into three groups: “flight risk”, “public safety” and “border security”.

Republicans have claimed that the Biden administration “lost 300,000” immigrant children – figures that come from a Department of Homeland Security report referring to the number of minors whom agents had not been able to serve with papers to appear in court.

“The unique needs of children require the administration to ensure a level of care that takes into account their vulnerability while it determines whether they need long-term protection in the United States,” Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, said in a statement.

“To be successful in its goals, the government must partner with legal service providers and the vast network of private-sector pro bono partners who provide millions of dollars in free legal services to ensure children understand the process and can share their reasons for seeking safety in the United States.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Authorities responded on Friday to reports of gunfire at a park and have asked for videos from bystanders to aid in investigation

Three people were killed and at least 15 others were injured in a mass shooting on Friday night at an “unsanctioned car show” in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Local police said the shooting occurred at around 10pm on Friday at Young Park following “an altercation between two groups of people”. There were approximately 200 people at the park when the shooting occurred.

Those killed included two 19-year-old men and one 16-year-old boy. Police have not yet released the names of those killed and others who were injured but said that the victims were between 16 and 36 years old.

In a press conference on Saturday, police said that seven people who were injured had been sent from local hospitals to El Paso for further treatment. Four others have been treated and released, and police are still waiting on updates from local hospitals on the remaining four patients.

No arrests have been made but police are following “multiple leads”, officials said, adding that “this is a huge crime scene with a lot of moving parts”.

In a statement on Facebook on Saturday, the Las Cruces police department issued a public request for videos from the Young Park shooting, particularly “video that shows the shooting or subjects with firearms, to submit the video so investigators can analyze it and help develop a better understanding of the incident”.

Police added that casings had been located “throughout the park and parking lot” and that “all the casings located so far are handgun caliber casings”.

One witness, 20-year-old Angel Legaspy, whose parked car was struck by bullets, told the New York Times: “They just started shooting and they just started running around everybody,” adding that the shooting was “like all over the place”.

On Saturday morning, Johana Bencomo, a Las Cruces city councilor and the mayor pro temp, wrote on Instagram: “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city but that actually feels deeply untrue. Honestly [nowadays] a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment, yet also always praying and hoping it never will.

“As with all acts of gun violence in our city and beyond, my heart is broken for the victims and families impacted. This was a heinous act of violence that will leave our city mourning,” she added.

New Mexico's governor, Michelle Grisham, has also issued a statement, saying: “The indiscriminate nature of this shooting is both shocking and unacceptable, but sadly not surprising. This violence tears at the fabric of our communities and leaves wounds that may never heal.”

“I am mobilizing state resources to support local law enforcement in their investigation. If you have any information, particularly video or images that could help identify those responsible, please come forward and contact the Las Cruces police department immediately,” she added.

The Guardian has reached out to city officials for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Anger over detention of Ekrem Imamoğlu becomes a touchstone for opposing President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan

When demonstrators gathered ­at Istanbul's city hall last week in outrage at the arrest of mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, 26-year-old Azra said she was initially too scared to defy a ban on gatherings. As protests grew on university campuses and in cities and towns across Turkey, she could no longer resist joining.

“I saw the spark in people's eyes and the excitement on their faces, and I decided I had to come down here,” she said with a grin, standing among tens of thousands that defied a ban on assembly to fill the streets around city hall on Friday night. Despite the crowds, Azra feared reprisals and declined to give her full name. Many demonstrators were masked in a bid to defy facial recognition ­technology and fearing the teargas or pepper spray sometimes deployed by the police. Others smiled and took ­selfies to celebrate as fireworks illuminated the night sky.

The arrest of the mayor of Turkey's largest city in a dawn raid last week was a watershed moment in the country's prolonged shift away from democracy. Opponents of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan fear it is a move to ­sideline the sole challenger capable of defeating him in upcoming elections, expected before 2028.

İmamoğlu and more than 100 other people including municipal officials and the head of the mayor's construction firm were served ­detention orders and accused of embezzlement and corruption – charges the mayor denies. He also denies terrorism charges levelled at him over collaboration with a leftwing political coalition prior to local elections last year, which saw major losses for Erdoğan's Justice and Development party (AKP).

Justice minister Yılmaz Tunç attempted to rebuff any suspicion the charges against İmamoğlu and ­others from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) were ­politicised. “Attempting to associate judicial investigations and cases with our president is, to say the least, an act of audacity and irresponsibility,” he said.

Within days, what began as protests in response to İmamoğlu's detention has grown into something more. “This is bigger than İmamoğlu. It's about a fight for democracy, law and equal rights,” said Azra as demonstrators massed around her.

The Turkish president has long sought to retake Istanbul from opposition control, fuelling protesters' joy at defying a ban on gatherings in the city where Erdoğan began his ­political career as mayor. Standing outside a metro station as hundreds of cheering people poured into the street, breaking into anti-government chants and banging on the escalators, another protester, named Diler, called the demonstrations “a response to the pressure that has built up over years”.

“There are problems with the ­economy, with education, with the health ­system,” she said in a nod to the ­economic ­crisis that has seen the cost of ­living soar. “We are fed up with this government.”

Supporters of the mayor said 300,000 people joined the demonstration in Istanbul on Friday night, while video showed protesters taking to the streets and clashing with the police in major towns and cities across the country. Turkish interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said 343 ­people were detained across nine cities after taking part in demonstrations.

Turkish authorities ratcheted up their attempts to quell the growing protests, including blocking traffic across two bridges leading to city hall in Istanbul and locking down several thoroughfares nearby with lines of riot police.

Erdoğan voiced his increasing ­displeasure at calls to demonstrate by the head of the opposition, saying: “Turkey is not a country that will be on the street – it will not surrender to street terrorism.”

Despite the domestic outrage at İmamoğlu's detention, the international response remained muted. The clearest reaction was ­financial, with estimates that the Turkish central bank spent a record $11.5bn propping up the lira the day after İmamoğlu's arrest as investors fled and the ­currency plunged in value.

Reactions elsewhere were far less impactful. A spokesperson for the UN secretary general said they hoped “the normal rules for due process will be followed”, while US state ­department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Washington “will not comment on the internal decision-making ­processes of another country”.

US president Donald Trump and Erdoğan spoke by phone just days before İmamoğlu's arrest amid reports the Turkish leader is seeking a meeting at the White House in the coming months.

US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told rightwing pundit Tucker Carlson in an interview that Trump and Erdoğan's conversation was “transformational”, adding “I think there's just a lot of good, positive news ­coming out of Turkey right now.”

“The international climate has Erdoğan feeling very confident,” said Gönül Tol, an analyst with the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

“The president of the United States is undermining democracy there, meaning the US is looking inward. He just doesn't care what other foreign autocrats are doing to their people. Those things are really impacting a global climate where autocrats think they can do whatever they want.”

European leaders previously quick to criticise Erdoğan, such as French president Emmanuel Macron, have yet to voice objections to events in Turkey amid expectations they could increasingly look to Ankara to supply peacekeepers in Ukraine.

“With Trump's return to the White House and his shift towards Russia on Ukraine, the Europeans are panicking and trying to boost defence,” said Tol. “In this climate where Europe feels it has to defend itself against Russia alone, there's more talk about engaging Erdoğan.”

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen became the highest-ranking official to offer any criticism, stating Turkey “must protect democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials”.

Soner Cagaptay, a biographer of Erdoğan and an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said such statements were not likely to prompt any change in policy.

“There are unlikely to be any meaningful actions to follow; there will be no sanctions or disinviting Erdoğan to summits, declining to include Turkey in future planning. There will be no concrete repercussions, because of the way Turkey has positioned itself in this new global arena as an important power,” he said.

The CHP is expected to push ahead with declaring İmamoğlu its ­candidate for president this weekend, after a symbolic primary vote. Those ­outside city hall were insistent the Istanbul mayor should remain the opposition's candidate, even if this means his running from prison.

Cagaptay said despite the lack of international criticism, the push to ­nullify İmamoğlu could still ­backfire. Erdoğan was briefly jailed in the 1990s while mayor of Istanbul, ­galvanising his ­support and fuelling his run for national politics.

“He entered jail as a mayor and exited as a national hero,” said Cagaptay.

“Erdoğan is betting this won't happen [now] due to state capture, his control of institutions and the media, and he's not worried about international criticism.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A new exhibition at the National Archives in London will reveal the extent of MI5 operation to expose the British double agent who was also Observer reporter

Secret surveillance of Britain's ­notorious double agent, Kim Philby, made public for the first time in archived documents, reveals how keenly the Security Service wanted to confirm or disprove early suspicions of his high-level treachery.

In daily bulletins submitted to MI5 in November 1951, undercover operatives describe how Philby, codenamed Peach, moved about London.

They said he gave “no outward sign of being either nervous or on the alert, but your well trained man should not do so; every movement is natural – again as it should be”.

The notes, from official ­“watchers” who were tailing Philby and bugging his phone, raise a key question about how the arch-traitor eventually escaped justice: did the British establishment deliberately protect him, or simply hope to avoid a public scandal? Mark Dunton, of the National Archives, believes the ­documents, which go on display in the ­exhibition, MI5: Official Secrets, next week at Kew, west London, shed light on one of the most shady ­periods of British ­espionage.

During the cold war period, a group of “Cambridge Spies” managed to compromise the top ranks of British Security and Secret Intelligence Services, MI5 and MI6. “All the layers of description and detail in these documents make the complexity and the mistrust clear,” said Dunton.

“The original transcripts of Philby's interrogations later can be read by the public for the first time. They will be displayed alongside some extraordinary new loans from MI5. Philby's movements around London in 1951 make fascinating reading.”

Tracking him that winter between the Athenaeum Club, the Arsenal stadium, Harvey Nichols and The Goring Hotel, officers sought evidence. Signs of a relaxed demeanour were no proof of innocence: “Such behaviour, however, should not be taken as an indication (a) that his mind is at ease, or (b) that he is not on the look-out for followers. On the contrary he has used the corner of a street into which he was turning in such a way that it would not be difficult to spot a careless watcher: on a bus he has adopted the procedure of a clever agent – although it is impossible (as it should be) to say whether this (or the street corner manoeuvre) was deliberate or otherwise. For the present we are confident that our methods will combat such tactics – if indeed they are tactics, and in any case at the first sign of Peach becoming suspicious (the repetition of recognised spotting manoeuvres will be interpreted as such) we shall withdraw.”

Harold “Kim” Philby, an Etonian, had become a committed communist as an undergraduate and was recruited by the Russian intelligence services in 1934. He joined the British intelligence service six years later, serving in Washington from 1949 until 1951, when he first came under suspicion, after the defections of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

Philby, who later worked for the Observer as a Middle East correspondent, has been called the “Third Man” because he was suspected by both MI5 and the Americans of being the elusive double agent who had tipped off the two spies before they could be questioned, allowing them to flee to Moscow via France.

Philby was, however, publicly cleared of complicity due to a lack of evidence, or perhaps because of a ­protective MI6 strategy.

The new surveillance documents show Philby was being bugged and followed in this period. Ironic, since Philby's own memoir, My Silent War, revealed that he himself had bugged many communist sympathisers on behalf of the British government.

Philby drove a black cab that he had bought as a ­private vehicle.

The “watchers” made fun of their target, describing his “weatherbeaten face” and “untidy hair”. They added in their notes: “He is inclined to grin when driving; this is almost certainly due to the fact that his vehicle is an ex-taxi and it might well be called a self-conscious or shame-faced smirk.

“We have noticed this previously with drivers of similar ‘models' at which small boys and their like are inclined to jeer.” They later note that he has no mirror, “in breach of law”, which makes tailing him easier. “With our radio-equipped cars behind him it is extremely unlikely that he will see us so long as he is at the wheel.”

The five Cambridge spies – Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross – all passed information to the Soviet Union from key citadels of the British establishment.

Under suspicion again from 1962, Philby finally fled to Moscow a year later, handing over a written confession to his old MI6 friend, Nicholas Elliott. He had been accused by Flora Solomon, a former girlfriend, who said he had once tried to recruit her.

Solomon was prompted to speak out, she claimed, by what she saw as the anti-Israel stance of his ­articles in the Observer. This sealed the case against Philby, who had already been named by a Soviet defector, according to the Spycatcher author, Peter Wright.

Philby spent 25 years in Moscow, instructing trainee spies in the techniques of “tradecraft”. When he died, in 1988, he received full KGB honours.

The transcripts on display in Kew will include Philby's admission that he had passed on information leading to the presumed execution in Russia of the potential defector Konstantin Volkov and his wife.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

As delegations from Moscow and Kyiv prepare to meet US negotiators in Riyadh, details of pact remain unclear

Ukraine and Russia have agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after the US president, Donald Trump, spoke with the countries' leaders last week. But uncertainty remains about how or when the part-ceasefire will take effect as Ukraine and Russia prepare to send delegations to Riyadh this week for parallel talks with the US.

The three sides offered strikingly different interpretations of the limited ceasefire pact: the White House described it as covering both energy and infrastructure, the Kremlin framed it more narrowly as focused on energy infrastructure, while Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope that it would also include railways and ports.

There is also uncertainty on when the ceasefire was meant to go into effect.

Following Tuesday's call with Trump, Vladimir Putin gave the impression that the limited ceasefire would take effect immediately, reportedly ordering his military to stop all strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

Just hours later, Ukraine accused Russia of breaking its promises, with Zelenskyy reporting strikes on civilian infrastructure – including a hospital in Sumy. It remains unclear, however, whether Russia also targeted Ukraine's energy facilities.

Adding to the confusion, Moscow, in turn, accused Kyiv of violating the partial ceasefire, pointing to a strike on an oil depot that occurred before Zelenskyy had officially signed on to the truce.

The US is expected to push for a firm start date for the limited ceasefire when Ukrainian and Russian delegations hold separate talks with White House officials in Riyadh on Monday.

Ukraine remains deeply sceptical of any Russian agreement, pointing to past instances where Moscow failed to honour its commitments.

Zelenskyy's warning last month in Washington – that Russia cannot be trusted, backed by evidence of more than 25 ceasefire violations – was the initial spark that led to his dressing down by Trump and the vice-president, JD Vance.

The UK and European leaders have warned that Putin would face serious consequences if he violated a temporary ceasefire agreement. However, their leverage over Moscow remains limited – most sanctions have already been imposed, and Europe continues to struggle with supplying Ukraine with enough weapons to match Russia's military output.

Russia, meanwhile, is likely to seize on any Ukrainian ceasefire violations – real or fabricated – as a pretext to continue its offensive and pressure Washington into cutting off military support for Kyiv.

At present, the two sides remain far apart on what would be acceptable terms for a peace treaty, with no sign that Putin has relinquished any of his maximalist aims in the war against Ukraine.

Ukraine has laid out a step-by-step plan for peace: first, a full and immediate ceasefire, followed by negotiations toward a durable peace deal underpinned by western security guarantees.

Russia, meanwhile, insists that any agreement must be comprehensive from the outset, combining a ceasefire with long-term conditions in a single package – rejecting any phased approach.

Moscow has set out several key conditions for any long-term settlement – most of which are non-starters for Kyiv and its European allies. These include a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, restrictions on the size of its armed forces, and international recognition of the four Ukrainian regions Russia illegally annexed following staged referendums in 2022.

The Kremlin has also signalled it would reject any presence of western troops in Ukraine – something Kyiv views as essential to securing lasting security guarantees.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Israel Defense Forces targeted “dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers and a command center,” killing six and wounding 17. Hezbollah denied launching rockets.

BEIRUT — Israel launched strikes on southern Lebanon on Saturday, killing at least six people, authorities here said, in response to rockets fired from across the border earlier in the day. The exchange was the largest since the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect late last year.

The ceasefire remained in place, but the exchange fueled concerns that Israel's resumption of war in Gaza could imperil the truce in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, both a militant group and a Lebanese political party, denied responsibility for the rockets and said it remains committed to the ceasefire.

Rocket fire from Lebanon on Saturday morning triggered sirens in northern Israel for the first time in months. U.N. peacekeepers said four projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel near the town of Metula around 7:30 a.m. Israel said it was six, three of which entered Israel and were intercepted.

The Israel Defense Forces said Saturday's attack “constitutes a blatant violation.” In response, the IDF said, it targeted “dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers and a command center.”

“We promised security to the residents of the Galilee — and that is exactly what will be,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said. “I have instructed the IDF to respond accordingly.”

The Israeli strikes killed six people in southern Lebanon, the Health Ministry here said, one of them a child. Seventeen others were wounded.

Most of the strikes hit rural areas, videos and images of the aftermath shared on social media indicated. But one video showed a town hit and people rushing through debris to a strike site in the middle of a street.

After the rocket fire, the Lebanese army said, troops on a “search and inspection operation” found and dismantled three primitive launchers on the outskirts of the southern Lebanese town of Nabatieh. It did not identify who controlled the launchers.

“Hezbollah denies any involvement in the launching of rockets from southern Lebanon,” the group said in a statement. The group said Israel's “allegations are merely pretexts for its continued attacks on Lebanon, which have not ceased since the ceasefire was announced.”

Hezbollah, backed by Iran, renewed its attacks on Israel in support of Hamas at the outset of the Gaza war in October 2023. Hamas-led fighters streamed out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in Israel. Israel responded with a military campaign to eradicate Hamas.

Regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel on the Lebanese border erupted in September into all-out war. More than 4,000 people were killed and 1 million displaced in Lebanon, with 60,000 people displaced in Israel, before the sides agreed to a ceasefire in November.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza in January under significant pressure from the Trump administration. But after weeks of relative quiet allowed the exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, Israel this week restarted the war, launching airstrikes that have killed more than 600 Gazans, the Health Ministry there says.

Hezbollah condemned Israel's return to war in Gaza but did not suggest it would resume hostilities on the border. The most recent previous rocket fire from Lebanon into Israel was in December. Israel launched strikes in retaliation then as well, but the exchange was contained.

Lebanese officials warned against further escalation. President Joseph Aoun condemned “attempts to drag Lebanon back into a cycle of violence,” according to the country's official National News Agency.

The ceasefire has been shaky from the start. Israel has maintained troops in southern Lebanon past a mid-February deadline to withdraw and has continued to strike at Hezbollah. Aoun said he considered the exchange Saturday to be part of a “failure to adhere to the details of the ceasefire agreement.”

UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, said it was “alarmed by the possible escalation of violence,” which it warned could risk “serious consequences for the region.” U.N. peacekeepers maintain a presence along Lebanon's southern border with Israel and have been caught up in the fighting there multiple times since the war escalated last year.

“We strongly urge all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, especially when civilian lives and the fragile stability observed in recent months are at risk,” UNIFIL said in a statement.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar amid mass protests against the move and Israel's resumption of hostilities in Gaza.

JERUSALEM — As Israeli forces carried out more strikes in a renewed Gaza offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed forward on the home front to oust two senior officials in a development that roiled Israeli politics.

In a late-night Thursday cabinet session, Netanyahu's ministers voted unanimously to dismiss Ronen Bar, the director of the Shin Bet intelligence service who Netanyahu said no longer had his trust. Hours later, on Friday morning, the government scheduled another discussion for Sunday over firing Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who had advised Netanyahu not to fire the spy chief.

Netanyahu's moves to dismiss two of the most prominent and powerful dissenting voices in his government were criticized as unconstitutional by opposition leaders and sparked calls for further protests after large, occasionally chaotic demonstrations already took place this week in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Almost immediately, opposition parties petitioned the supreme court for an injunction on Bar's dismissal pending a judicial review,  and it was granted by the court. The Business Forum, a group of 200 leading Israeli business leaders, threatened to “bring the Israeli economy to a halt” if the government did not obey the court order to temporarily freeze Bar's removal.

Netanyahu was unmoved as the outcry mounted Friday. “There will be no civil war!” he said in a post on X. “The State of Israel is a country governed by law, and according to the law, the Government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

If the court ultimately sides with the government, Bar will leave his post sometime before April 10. But a ruling against the government might pit the supreme court in a direct battle with Netanyahu.

“What's taking shape is a more ominous clash between the government and the court, with mixed signals about whether the prime minister will — or will not — comply with its ruling,” said Shalom Lipner, a former Netanyahu aide who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “After many long months of stage-setting, a constitutional crisis could be fast upon Israel.”

Tensions have been building for months between Netanyahu and his internal security chief, with the two men and their supporters openly blaming each other for the policy and intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to carry out a devastating attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Bar has also been seen as one of the leading voices calling on Netanyahu to prioritize striking a deal with Hamas to recover all Israeli hostages, while Netanyahu and some of his allies, particularly on the political right and the far right, have stressed that the Gaza war must continue until Hamas is wholly eliminated.

Last month, Netanyahu removed Bar from the negotiating team with Hamas, and the prime minister has accused Bar of disobedience and leaking information about the hostage talks — allegations the Shin Bet director has denied.

Further fueling the feud, the Shin Bet, which is responsible for counterintelligence and protecting the integrity of Israeli democracy, opened a probe in February into allegations that three Netanyahu aides were on Qatar's payroll and maintained improper ties with a gulf nation that is not seen as a friendly state. Baharav-Miara, who authorized the Qatar investigation, has warned Netanyahu against firing Bar, saying it would be a conflict of interest and would jeopardize the independence of the Shin Bet.

In an X post that was widely discussed in Israel this week, Netanyahu criticized the Shin Bet investigation as a conspiracy and likened himself to President Donald Trump. “In America and Israel, when a strong right-wing leader wins, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people's will,” Netanyahu wrote in an X post that was shared by Elon Musk. “They won't win in either place!”

At the cabinet meeting late Thursday, Netanyahu accused Bar of disloyalty and leaking information about the hostage negotiations, according to Israeli media reports. Bar, in response, issued a letter to the cabinet saying it was the Shin Bet's duty to work “for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and not for the benefit of personal interests,” and he criticized Netanyahu for blocking a probe into “serious incidents.”

“The urgent national need for such an investigation cannot be subordinated to the personal considerations of those involved in the matter,” Bar said in the letter, which was reviewed by The Washington Post.

Bar's removal is likely to represent a boost for hawkish voices within Netanyahu's government who have been calling for Israel to return to more intense fighting against Hamas. After Netanyahu announced his intention to fire Bar and resumed hostilities in Gaza this week, he brought Jewish Power party leader Itamar Ben Gvir back into his cabinet. In recent weeks, another far-right minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has urged Israel to cut off electricity and water to Gaza, return to fighting in the Strip, and gradually annex land if Hamas harms any hostages.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz appeared to echo Smotrich on Friday by warning that if Hamas did not release all hostages, the Israeli military will seize additional territory in Gaza.

“The more Hamas persists in its refusal, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel,” Katz said in a statement. He added that Israel will use “all measures to apply military and civilian pressure — including the evacuation of the Gazan population southward and the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump's voluntary relocation plan for Gaza residents.”

In Gaza on Friday, Israeli forces destroyed the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, according to footage posted on social media and the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed it struck “terrorists in a Hamas terrorist infrastructure site that previously had served as a hospital” and said the location has not been used as an active hospital for more than a year.

Last year, a Washington Post examination of satellite footage found that the IDF appeared to be using the hospital near the strategic Netzarim Corridor as a base of operations. The hospital previously served as an important cancer treatment center in Gaza before it was forced to close in the early days of the war because of nearby airstrikes and lack of fuel.

In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned Israel's destruction of the hospital, which was built by Turkey and run by local authorities, and called on the international community to “take concrete and deterrent measures against Israel's unlawful attacks.”

Oops, something went wrong

Capping credit card interest rates is starting to look like the hot policy idea of the season for populist lawmakers on both the left and right.

This month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive star from New York, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a MAGA favorite from Florida, teamed up to introduce a bill to limit credit card APRs at 10%. It follows similar legislation from Sens. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont, and Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, which would put in place the same 10% rate ceiling for five years.

The cost of credit has become a more pressing issue in recent years thanks to rising interest rates, which have helped fuel increasing delinquencies: The average APR was about 21.5% at the end of last year, up from 14.7% in 2020, according to the Federal Reserve.

For now, these bills mostly seem to be political signaling exercises that are unlikely to go anywhere soon. Democrats may also see them as a way of challenging President Trump to make good on his campaign-season promise to pass a credit card cap, an idea mostly embraced by progressives in the past. (In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.)

But the bipartisan enthusiasm suggests that limiting what card issuers can charge their customers may have legs down the line. For many voters, it's a pressing pocketbook concern: About half of credit card accounts revolve a balance from month to month, while 13% of cardholders make only the minimum payment due, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

As they've hiked interest rates, credit card companies' margins have hit all-time highs. To some, that's a sign that companies could continue lending profitably to most of their customers even with a rate cap cutting a bit into their profits.

The challenge, as almost any economist will note, is that limiting rates will likely mean less access to credit for Americans with weaker credit scores since lending to them won't be as profitable.

That might be for the best for some households if it saves them from overborrowing. But many could be forced to resort to other, even less affordable types of debt to cover emergency expenses. And even without the aid of a high-APR credit card, some still find ways to make unaffordable purchases on credit, such as through buy now, pay later plans.

The question is how low is too low before restrictions do more harm than good. A 10% rate might be overly strict. But what about a 25% cap? Or 35%?

“At the end of the day, it's a trade-off,” said Breno Braga, an Urban Institute senior fellow who has studied the impact of interest caps. “You want to maximize the number of people that benefit from it and minimize the number of people that suffer from it.”

Usury laws are nothing new. At least 76 countries impose limits on lending rates, according to World Bank researchers, and at least 26 have chosen to place caps on all types of credit. In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright.

Studies on the impact of payday loan limits have yielded conflicting results. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. Others suggest the laws cut back on payday loan use without those drawbacks.

What would happen if the government tried to limit what Visa or Mastercard can charge? In the US, there's at least one recent real-world example we can draw conclusions from: The Military Lending Act, which originally capped the interest rates on payday and other loans for active-duty service members at 36%. In 2015, the law was expanded to cover revolving products like credit cards.

The change had a fairly limited impact on troops' wallets, according to a paper by Braga and his colleagues at Urban. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

The absolute riskiest borrowers appear to have felt the change more. After the reform passed, people with Vantage credit scores under 500 were less likely to have a credit card and saw their borrowing limits lowered. At the same time, their credit ratings and delinquency rates didn't improve, suggesting the group lost access to credit without much benefit.

One reason the 36% cap might not have had much effect overall is that, during the time period studied, relatively few people had credit cards with an APR above 36%. Today, with rates higher, the impact might be wider.

The cap Ocasio-Cortez and Luna have proposed would certainly bite much harder, and likely cut off access to credit for many millions more. Even among superprime borrowers with credit ratings above 720, average APRs are typically higher than 10%. There's also concern that companies might try to skirt a severe limit by charging new fees, though the bill tries to prohibit that.

Still, it's possible to imagine looser limits making some headway in Washington.

In 2019, for instance, a bipartisan bill that would have extended the Military Lending Act's 36% rate cap to all Americans was nearly reported out of committee but derailed by the pandemic. Politically, a bill like that could one day be ready for a comeback.

Viktor Hovland looked like one of the next great stars of the sport when the 2023 PGA Tour season concluded. He had won three tournaments, including the Tour Championship, and finished the year at No. 4 in the Official World Golf Rankings -- just behind Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm.

Hovland couldn't resist the allure of tinkering with his swing coming into 2024, but those changes had the opposite of their intended effect as the 27-year-old has tumbled to 19th in the world over the last year and change.

In that time, Hovland has flashed in the occasional tournament where it's looked like he's turning a corner -- most notably a third-place finish at last year's PGA Championship -- but consistency has been a real issue.

Coming into the 2025 Valspar Championship this week, he had missed three cuts across five events in 2025. On Friday, Hovland made a big move up the leaderboard at Innisbrook, shooting a 4-under 67 to move into a tie for second that presents his first real chance at winning a tournament this season. 

After the round, Hovland was candid about his recent struggles and explained what's prevented him from making confident, consistent swings. 

""It sucks,"" he said. ""You have an ability that you can almost sometimes take for granted. You just wake up every day and you stand over the ball and you expect the ball to start in that direction and go that direction and end up somewhere close to the hole. And then it starts to not do that.

""It's pretty frustrating, and you start thinking things you've never thought before. And this game becomes infinitely more challenging, and it's already really challenging. So, it is really humbling -- and kind of handling those moments, there's a lot of lessons to be learned there. And now that, hopefully, I can regain my ability and see those shots again, hopefully I can be in a better spot where I can handle that situation better.""

Hovland also discussed how he has handled these frustrations.

""I am hard on myself, yeah. But that's also why I'm good,"" he explained. ""If I wasn't hard on myself, I probably wouldn't be out here. And yeah, I know that even with terrible mechanics I can still get out here and shoot a couple of nice scores, but that can also lead to 80 shots at The Players because I just don't have control over what I'm doing. [...] If I'm standing over the ball and I'm expecting it to start there [points left], everything in my golf swing is feeling like it's gonna start there, but it starts there [points right] and goes to the right, you can't play with that. I don't care who you are, you're just not going to be able to make that work.""

Every amateur golfer has experienced this feeling, and there's something both comforting and terrifying about the fact that even a player who once reached No. 3 in the world can face the same challenges. If everything feels like the ball should be going one way, and instead, it's coming off the club face and starting somewhere else, it's impossible to make confident swings consistently -- especially, as Hovland noted, at more difficult courses.

As the weekend wears on at the Valspar, we'll find out whether Hovland is making progress on being more confident in his swing, particularly because the Copperhead course is not the most friendly on the PGA Tour.

For him to pull through with his first win in more than a year, he'll need to carry those positive feels from Friday for two more days. The challenge in a situation like Hovland's is the internal chicken vs. the egg battle of golf. You need confidence to make good swings but also need to make good swings and see good results to have that confidence.

That's why this weekend may be incredibly important for Hovland. If he can put together three straight good days and notch his first win in over a year, perhaps he can carry that confidence and belief forward to become a real threat in big tournaments again. On the flip side, if it goes off the rails on Saturday or Sunday, Hovland could end up back at square one with that Friday 67 just acting as a mirage in the desert.

The QB carousel is in full motion. Already, we've seen signal-callers like Sam Darnold (Seahawks) and Geno Smith (Raiders) find new homes in the NFL, while even Matthew Stafford flirted with the possibility of leaving L.A. before reuniting with the Rams. And we're still spinning. The league is waiting with bated breath for a decision from Aaron Rodgers on his playing future. Once he decides to either sign with a team or retire, that should set off a chain reaction where more QB dominos fall, including with Russell Wilson. 

While Rodgers, Wilson, and -- to a lesser extent -- the NFL Draft prospects have dominated the offseason headlines on the quarterback front, there is also another name that could enter the frenzy: Joe Milton III. 

The New England Patriots selected Milton in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL Draft but he did impress in his brief showing last season. Milton got the start in Week 18 and completed 22 of his 29 passes for 241 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 16 yards and another score en route to New England's 23-16 win over Buffalo.

That performance has seemingly garnered some buzz for Milton on the trade market. Recently, the Boston Globe reported that there is a growing sentiment that the Patriots are entertaining trade offers for Milton. Of course, he is expendable for the Patriots due to the presence of Drake Maye, and the Patriots also signed veteran quarterback Joshua Dobbs, who could serve as the primary backup. 

With that in mind, let's identify a handful of teams that could find themselves in the Milton market. 

If the Browns decide against taking a quarterback in the 2025 NFL Draft with the No. 2 overall pick and opt for the likes of pass rusher Abdul Carter or receiver/corner Travis Hunter, a run at Milton could make some sense. Given his lack of experience, Milton shouldn't be looked at as a bonafide starter for any of these potential trade partners, but is a worthwhile lottery ticket. That's especially true for a team like the Browns. 

Cleveland is currently suffocated by the monster contract of Deshaun Watson, who is expected to miss the 2025 season due to another Achilles injury. They did bring in Kenny Pickett via trade, but that shouldn't preclude them from continuing to search for a long-term option at QB. With Milton, they'd get a player with eye-popping arm talent on the cheap. With him being a former sixth-round pick, Milton has cap hits of less than $1.25 million in each of the next three seasons. That should be widely attractive to Cleveland given Watson has dead cap charges of well over $100,000 million over the next two years. 

It's also worth noting Milton's college roots, playing at the University of Tennessee for three seasons. Browns owner Jimmy Haslam not only went to Tennessee but is still involved with the university so he should be quite familiar with Milton. 

Let's stick in the AFC North, shall we? The Pittsburgh Steelers are another team currently on the hunt for a QB and have primarily been circling Aaron Rodgers. But what if Rodgers decides to go in a different direction? In theory, they could go back to Russell Wilson, who started 11 games for them last season. That said, Wilson could sign with another team at any given moment as well. That leaves them with not a ton of options, especially considering they pick at No. 21 overall at this year's draft. Even if they added another veteran to the room, Milton could be a low-risk acquisition to come in and compete for the starting job over the summer. Given his ability to throw the football a country mile, he'd be fascinating to see with DK Metcalf and George Pickens at his disposal. 

The Giants are another QB-needy team. They were reportedly deep in discussions about possibly acquiring Matthew Stafford before he decided to stay with the Rams and are also one of the teams interested in adding Rodgers. They've also hosted Russell Wilson on a free-agent visit. Judging by the veteran QBs they've had their eye on, Milton may not fit the profile of what they want at the current moment. Still, he's an option to consider. There is a world where Rodgers retires and Wilson heads back to Pittsburgh, leaving them with little options at the position. Even at the NFL Draft, a quarterback worthy of the No. 3 overall pick isn't a slam dunk to be available to them with the Titans and Browns -- two teams that could use a quarterback -- ahead of them. With all that in mind, Milton is at least an option with some upside that could be available at a relatively low cost for Brian Daboll and Joe Schoen. 

It would be WILD to see the Patriots call up their old pal Tom Brady and coordinate a trade that gives the Raiders a quarterback, but this makes sense for Las Vegas even after the trade for Geno Smith. He is currently only signed through the 2025 season, but there is a logical school of thought that the team will extend him in some capacity. However, Smith is still 34 years old and will turn 35 in the middle of next season. Trading for Milton gives them an opportunity to land a young developmental quarterback to work behind Smith over the next few years before handing him the keys to the offense, if all goes according to plan. 

Let's call this the dark horse of the group. As we've seen earlier this offseason, it appears like the Matthew Stafford era is going year-to-year at this point. They do have former Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett -- a 2023 fourth-round pick -- on the roster, but his presence shouldn't stop Les Snead from looking at other options to develop at the position like Milton. Pairing Milton's talent with Sean McVay is a fascinating proposition, especially if they have some runway to mold him behind the scenes over the next few seasons. It's also worth mentioning that L.A. does have some built-in knowledge of Milton thanks to senior offensive assistant Alex Van Pelt, who served as New England's offensive coordinator last year. 

According to ESPN, the Boys are another team we should add to this list. ""One team to potentially watch [in a trade for Milton] is the Dallas Cowboys because they are looking for a good backup,"" Jeremy Fowler said on NFL Live, via Patriots on SI. ""A young backup with upside they may not get in the draft, maybe they get in a trade."" The Cowboys allowed Cooper Rush to walk in free agency for a contract with the Baltimore Ravens, and it does not seem like they're all that interested in bringing Trey Lance back, so perhaps Milton could be a target for them as they search for Dak Prescott's new backup.

Gene Hackman's daughter has reportedly made a plan to bury the Oscar winner's late dog alongside his wife, Betsy Arakawa.

Nearly one month after Hackman, Arakawa and one of their pet dogs died, new sheriff department footage obtained by TMZ revealed how the canine would be buried.

In the footage published on Friday, March 21, a law enforcement officer asked Hackman's daughter Elizabeth if she was interested in cremating the pet's ashes.

“I'm thinking, cremate the dog and bury it with Betsy,” Elizabeth said in the footage. “And if the dog was wearing a collar, can you save that for me?”



The police officer agreed to save a collar for Elizabeth.

Arakawa, in particular, had a fondness for her pets ahead of her sudden death.

“She was devoted to those dogs,” Gruda Veterinary Hospital owner Robert Gruda told USA Today on March 11, remembering her visits to the facility. “She was consistent, predictable. We knew something was wrong when she didn't pick up the food on time. She was an excellent dog owner [and an] excellent caretaker to those dogs. She really doted on them.”

News broke in late February that Hackman and Arakawa had been found dead inside their Santa Fe, New Mexico, house. They were 95 and 65, respectively.

“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy. He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us, he was always just Dad and Grandpa,” Hackman's daughters and granddaughter told Us Weekly in a statement. “We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.”

Hackman and Arakawa are survived by his children, Christopher, Elizabeth and Leslie, whom the actor shared with late ex-wife Faye Maltese, and their granddaughter, Anna.

A medical examiner later confirmed that Hackman died due to hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributing factor. Arakawa, for her part, died as a result of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

Hackman and Arakawa owned three dogs: Zinna, Bear and Nikita. Zinna, an Australian kelpie, also passed away in February. A report from the local animal control agency obtained by the Associated Press noted that Zinna likely died from dehydration and starvation. (Police had found Zinna locked in a crate inside Hackman and Arakawa's home).

Bear and Nikita, meanwhile, survived and were taken into custody by a Santa Fe animal shelter. They also allegedly assisted members of the sheriff's department in finding Hackman and Arakawa's bodies.

Chief Brian Moya revealed earlier this month that one of the dogs ran up to officers and started barking upon arrival for a welfare check.

“They realized [the dog] was trying to say, ‘Hey, come over here! Come over here!'” Moya recalled to USA Today, noting the pet led the officers to a mudroom where Hackman was lying on the floor.

'Severance' Season 2 Finale Almost Had a Very Different Ending with a Huge Detail Missing (Spoilers!) 

Anna Faris reveals how she's holding up after the devastating Los Angeles fires.

Back in January, the 48-year-old Scary Movie actress' ex husband Chris Pratt, with whom she shares 13-year-old son Jack, revealed that she lost her house in the wildfires.

In a new interview, Anna shared an update on how she's doing following the fires.

Keep reading to find out more…“We're one of thousands. And we feel really fortunate that we're safe and have a lot of support,” Anna told E! News about herself and Jack.

She then went on to reveal that she lost several keepsakes from movie sets in the fires, including shoes from her 2008 comedy The House Bunny.

“It's funny with the stuff—not to go on about it, but I did have all of my shoes from the movie, and now they're gone,” Anna shared. “But I know it's just stuff and memories. And thank goodness that it's out so I can look at them again somewhere.”

Despite everything she's lost, Anna said she's done her best to put herself in Jack‘s shoes.

“When we lost our home in the fire, he's handled it so with so much strength and practicality,” Anna said. “That also is confirmation to me that he's strong and he's even keeled.”

The Mom actress then shared some of the other moments that Jack has made her proud.

“When he—and he's only done this a handful of times—but when he asked me for advice, or he reveals to me that he trusts me, I get sort of a flood of emotional gratitude and confirmation that I guess I'm doing something,” Anna said.

“I think, as parents, we're always questioning, you know, ‘What are we doing? Are we giving good guidance? Are we raising kids with a good foundation?'” she continued. “Those indicators to me make me feel like I'm on the right path. And I'm really proud of him.”

Kylie Kelce has no time for haters.

Earlier this week, Kylie, 32, had former First Lady Michelle Obama as a guest on her podcast Not Gonna Lie.

After Kylie shared a clip from their interview on Instagram, a user named Dana reacted to the post by putting the throwing up emoji in the comments section.

During the episode, Kylie, who is currently pregnant with baby No. 4, took a moment to sing her praises for Michelle, 61.

“I'm not going to lie, Mrs. Obama, this is a pretty surreal moment for me,” Kylie said. “I have always been such a fan of the way you carry yourself.""

She continued, ""At 18 was the first election that I was able to vote for your husband. But seeing you as a powerful figure alongside him as a partner was such an outstanding image of female empowerment.” 

During their conversation, Michelle took a moment to praise Kylie for her bravery for having a fourth child. Kylie and husband Jason Kelce are already parents to daughters Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 2.

“You're doing it a fourth time. I just had to stop,” Michelle told Kylie. “I was like, ‘I think I've been lucky with these two.' Barack was like, ‘We should have a third,' and I was like, ‘Dude.'”

She continued, “I'm thinking, ‘We're gonna get a crazy one. It's just the roll of the dice.' So, I admire your courage. You don't know what you're gonna get.”

If you missed it, Michelle recently responded to rumors about her marriage.
