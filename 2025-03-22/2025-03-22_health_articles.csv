Designed for institutions with significant subspecialty expertise, ConsultConnect addresses the two major barriers to adoption in digital pathology: budgeting and long implementation/integration times. First, ConsultConnect has no upfront implementation fees or subscription fees. Instead, there is a minimal annual commitment and simple ""per-consult"" pricing. Second, ConsultConnect offers a highly streamlined and simplified onboarding process, allowing institutions to get up and running with their cloud-based solution in days instead of months.

Digital pathology has long been viewed by institutions as an expense rather than an opportunity. At PathPresenter, we aim to shift that perspective by transforming digital pathology into a profit center while expanding institutions' global reach. With AWS's reliable infrastructure and PathPresenter's expertise, we empower our customers to bridge the gaps in their workflows, making digital pathology a seamless, scalable, and cost-effective solution."" Dr. Rajendra Singh, Co-founder, PathPresenter

ConsultConnect features all the tools required by pathologists and institution administrators to deliver remote second opinion services to referring hospitals globally. Core to the platform is a user-friendly, scanner-agnostic image viewer for pathologists to receive, view, and sign out remote second opinion cases. For administrators, the portal provides tools to easily onboard and manage referring hospitals and incoming cases. The zero-footprint platform is monitored 24/7 by industry-leading security and compliance vendor Vanta for HIPAA compliance.

ConsultConnect has been optimized to run on AWS by PathPresenter and partner CitiusTech. With healthcare-focused expertise in medical imaging, CitiusTech leveraged AWS HealthImaging services to ensure ConsultConnect delivers the very best imaging performance and data integrity, including whole slide DICOM file upload functionality. AWS HealthImaging is a purpose-built, HIPAA-eligible service for medical imaging in the cloud, giving customers the performance, scale, and low total cost of ownership needed for large pathology workloads. AWS services provide robust security measures specifically designed for handling patient data across various healthcare entities. With AWS managed services, PathPresenter is providing low-latency, petabyte-scale digital pathology in the cloud.

Early adopter program

ConsultConnect will be available to select institutions through an early adopter program. For more information on this program and deploying ConsultConnect, see us at the USCAP Annual Meeting in Boston, MA, March 24-26 in booth 509.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Groundbreaking study unveils key mechanism for neuronal identity regulation,https://news-medical.net/news/20250322/Groundbreaking-study-unveils-key-mechanism-for-neuronal-identity-regulation.aspx,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A team of researchers from the Institute for Neurosciences, a joint center of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the Miguel Hernández University (UMH) of Elche, in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University (New York, USA), has identified a mechanism that regulates the production of two different proteins from the same gene. This discovery, recently published in the journal Genes & Development, was carried out in the nematode C. elegans, a small worm widely used in biological research as an animal model. This finding has implications for understanding neuronal identity in vertebrates, as many of the mechanisms discovered in this model are also present in mice, humans, and other species.

The study, led by researcher Eduardo Leyva Díaz, head of the emerging research line Molecular Mechanisms of Neuronal Identity at the Institute for Neurosciences, reveals that the ceh-44 gene (homologous to the CUX1 gene in humans and mice) gives rise to two completely different isoforms. One acts as a transcription factor essential for regulating neuronal genes, while the other encodes a transmembrane protein located in the Golgi apparatus, whose function is still unknown. ""The most surprising aspect is that this genetic organization is conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that it could play a fundamental role in neuronal specification in more complex species"", explains Leyva Díaz.

The identity of a cell determines its morphology and functions throughout its life. In the case of neurons, their structure is particularly unique, as once they are formed during development, they never divide again. This implies that their function must be stably maintained throughout their existence. To achieve this, neurons express a specific set of genes that define their activity within brain circuits. Any alteration in this process can compromise their function and contribute to the development of neurological disorders.

This work sheds light on how neuronal identity is established and maintained through an alternative splicing mechanism. Splicing is an essential process in gene expression, through which non-coding fragments of messenger RNA are removed to generate functional proteins. In some cases, this process allows a single gene to produce different proteins, depending on how the coding RNA fragments are assembled.

The team has identified that the production of the neuronal version of the CEH-44 protein depends on a conserved splicing factor, called UNC-75 in C. elegans and CELF in vertebrates. This mechanism is key to neuronal identity because it enables the selective production of specific proteins in the nervous system. ""We have demonstrated that UNC-75/CELF acts as a fundamental regulator of this process, promoting the production of the neuronal isoform while suppressing the non-neuronal alternative"", explains Leyva Díaz.

A worm key to understand the brain

To develop this research, the experts used the animal model C. elegans, a small nematode widely used in biology due to its genetic tractability and rapid life cycle. Despite its apparent simplicity, this worm has a well-characterized nervous system with 302 neurons, whose development and synaptic connections have been mapped in detail. ""Working with C. elegans allows us to perform precise genetic modifications quickly and reproducibly, facilitating the identification of conserved mechanisms in neuronal identity regulation"", notes Leyva Díaz.

Additionally, its transparency allows the visualization of gene expression in living organisms using fluorescence techniques, which has been key in this study. The team, which collaborated with the laboratory led by neuronal specification expert Oliver Hobert at Columbia University (New York, USA), used CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing tools and advanced microscopy techniques to characterize the mechanism.

The study results open new avenues of research in developmental neuroscience. The next goal of the team is to determine whether this splicing mechanism is conserved in vertebrates and how it may affect the formation of neuronal circuits in the brain: ""We know that CUX1 in humans is essential for the specification of neurons in the upper layers of the cerebral cortex and for the formation of the corpus callosum, but we still do not know how its expression is regulated"", says Leyva Díaz. In this regard, the researcher emphasizes that understanding how neuronal identity is generated and maintained is ""crucial for deciphering the development of the nervous system and could have implications in pathologies where this identity is lost"".

This work was made possible thanks to funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (Maryland, USA) and the GenT Program for the Recruitment of Excellent Doctoral Researchers of the Generalitat Valenciana. The team thanks researcher Guillermina López Bendito from the Institute for Neurosciences for hosting them in her laboratory, providing an ideal environment for the development of this research.",news-medical
