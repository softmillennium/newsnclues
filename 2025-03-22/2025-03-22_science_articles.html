                <p>Scientists have developed a new method to break down plastic waste, using moisture from the air.

By exposing a common type of plastic to an inexpensive catalyst and leaving it exposed to ambient air, researchers broke down 94% of the material in just four hours.

The plastic transformed into terephthalic acid (TPA), a highly valuable building block for polyesters.

Because TPA can be upcycled into more valuable materials, the process offers a safer and cheaper alternative to current plastic recycling methods.

The researchers published their findings Feb. 3 in the journal Green Chemistry .

"The U.S. is the number one plastic polluter per capita, and we only recycle 5% of those plastics," co-corresponding author Yosi Kratish said in a statement.

"What's particularly exciting about our research is that we harnessed moisture from air to break down the plastics, achieving an exceptionally clean and selective process.

By recovering the monomers, which are the basic building blocks of PET [polyethylene terephthalate], we can recycle or even upcycle them into more valuable materials."

Plastic waste is an increasingly important issue.

Over half of the plastic ever made has been produced since 2000, and annual production is projected to double by 2050, according to the European Environment Agency .

To date, only 9% of the plastics ever produced have been recycled.

The remainder, with lifetimes often lasting generations, can have serious environmental and health impacts.

To find a new method to break down some of this waste, the researchers applied a molybdenum catalyst — a silver, ductile metal — and activated carbon to PET, the most common type of polyester plastic.

The researchers then heated the mixture. After a short time, this broke the polyethylene's chemical bonds.

Then, when the team exposed the material to air, the mixture transformed into TPA, a valuable polyester precursor; and acetaldehyde, an industrial chemical that is also valuable and is easy to lift from the mixture.</p></b>

                <p>A color image of the newly discovered black hole light echo candidate, which may be one of the biggest ever found.

Long after the black hole in the center of a galaxy sputters out, you can still see its ghost lingering in surrounding gas clouds aglow with leftover radiation, like wisps of smoke emanating from an already extinguished flame. Astronomers call these cosmic ghosts "light echoes" — and that's what high-school junior Julian Shapiro found while scanning the cosmos for supernova remnants.

"There are these outer regions of gas being ionized by a supermassive black hole, which results in this echo," Shapiro said at a March 20 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society (APS) Global Physics Summit.

The object, which he believes to be a light echo, stands in a field of potential supermassive black holes. Using measurements from the Southern African Large Telescope , he found high contents of oxygen and ionized sulfur sprinkled into the region — both indicators of shocked material.

Shapiro currently pegs the light echo at about 150,000 to 250,000 light-years in diameter — about 1.5 to two times the width of the entire Milky Way galaxy. And if his estimates hold up, he thinks it could be a viable candidate for the largest light echo ever discovered.

"This object covers a large area in the sky, which makes it a bit easier to get in-depth images of," Shapiro said.

According to Sasha Plavin , a black hole researcher at Harvard University who was not involved in the research, echoes like the one Shapiro discovered can help us learn more about how black holes behave in the hearts of galaxies.

Shapiro is excited to continue contributing to black hole science — even if he came across it by accident. "My involvement in this area of research came as a bit of a surprise to me," he said.

"My hope is that this object, in particular, helps expand the knowledge of galaxy activities that we don't have too great of an understanding of."</p></b>

                <p>The article discusses various aspects of monoculars, including their usage, features, and performance.

 
Monoculars are essentially single-sided binoculars and come in different sizes, magnifications, and objective lens diameters. The first number in a monocular's description indicates its magnification strength, while the second number represents the diameter of the objective lens.

 

Choosing the right monocular depends on how it will be used. Bird-watchers may prefer something lightweight and waterproof, whereas stargazers require something better in low light and fog-proof. A 8-10x magnification is recommended for bird-watching, as higher magnifications can cause difficulty in holding the optic steady.

 

Monoculars have their own advantages over binoculars, such as being smaller and more lightweight. However, some users prefer using binocular vision over monoculars due to personal preference.</p></b>

                <p>The great potoo (Nyctibius grandis) has giant eyes that protrude from the sides of its head, providing excellent vision in low-light conditions.

Its mottled gray-brown feathers allow it to remain perfectly still and blend in with tree branches or stumps, making it nearly undetectable by predators.

Native to the forests and tropical lowlands of Central and South America, this nocturnal bird can grow up to 24 inches tall and has a wingspan of more than 28 inches.

Their grey, brown, and white plumage helps them blend seamlessly with tree bark, making them nearly invisible in their surroundings.

By day, great potoos remain silent and still in the trees. At night, they become active hunters.

Great potoos are well-adapted to snatching prey such as flying insects and bats out of the air with their large, flattened beak and mouth.

They also have slits in their eyelids that enable them to see when their eyes are closed.

The "notches" help the birds detect predators and prey even when resting, making them highly alert at all times.

Great potoos emit a loud, moaning growl throughout the night, which has earned them a mythical status in local folklore.

Their calls are used for communication and to defend their territories.

Female great potoos lay a single egg in a natural depression on a tree branch, relying on their camouflage and sight to protect themselves and their offspring.

The incubation period for great potoo eggs is approximately 30 days, with both parents sharing the responsibility of incubating the egg.</p></b>

                <p>Astronomers have discovered a collection of tiny galaxies located roughly 3 million light-years away that includes the smallest and faintest galaxy ever seen.

This galaxy, designated Andromeda XXXV, and its compatriots orbiting our neighbor galaxy, Andromeda, could change how we think about cosmic evolution. That's because dwarf galaxies this small should have been destroyed in the hotter and denser conditions of the early universe. Yet somehow, this tiny galaxy survived without being fried.

"These are fully functional galaxies, but they're about a millionth of the size of the Milky Way," team member and University of Michigan professor Eric Bell said in a statement. "It's like having a perfectly functional human being that's the size of a grain of rice."

Dwarf galaxies themselves are nothing new to scientists. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is orbited by dozens of these satellite galaxies caught in the grip of its more immense galaxies.

There is, however, a great deal about dwarf galaxies that scientists don't know. This is because, being smaller, they are much dimmer than major galaxies, making them harder to spot and tougher to study at large distances.

While astronomers have been able to determine many dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way, identifying dwarf galaxies around our bright galactic neighbors has been incredibly difficult. This means that the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way have been our only source of information about small satellite galaxies.

To discover these paradigm-shifting smaller and dimmer dwarf galaxies, team leader Marcos Arias, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, and his colleagues scoured various massive astronomical datasets. The team was also able to obtain time with the Hubble Space Telescope to aid their search.

This revealed that not only is Andromeda XXXV a satellite galaxy, but it is also small enough to change theories of how galaxies evolve. "It was really surprising," Bell said. "It's the faintest thing you find around, so it's just kind of a neat system. But it's also unexpected in a lot of different ways."

One of the key aspects of galactic evolution is how long their star-forming periods last. This seemed to be the main difference between the Milky Way's dwarf galaxies and the smaller satellite galaxies of Andromeda.

"Most of the Milky Way satellites have very ancient star populations," Arias explained. "They're not forming new stars anymore." In contrast, the stars in Andromeda XXXV are much younger.

"We thought they were basically all going to be fried because the entire universe turned into a vat of boiling oil," Bell said. "We thought that it would completely lose its gas, but apparently that doesn't happen."

Just how Andromeda XXXV resisted being fried is still a mystery. "I don't have an answer," Bell said. "It is also still true that the universe did heat up; we're just learning the consequences are more complicated than we thought."</p></b>

                <p>This week's science news was largely dominated by the return of two NASA astronauts from the International Space Station, whose planned eight-day mission ended up lasting 286 days.

Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams lifted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on June 5, 2024, but not long into the mission helium leaks, along with a number of other issues, were discovered on their Boeing Starliner spacecraft.

Starliner had already suffered years of delays, and although it was later suggested the pair would have been fine to return home on the suspect vessel, the risk to their safety was considered too great.

As such, it wasn't until 5:57 p.m. ET on Tuesday (March 18) that the astronauts finally splashed down near the coast of Florida, after hitching a lift aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.

In a conversation with CNN's Anderson Cooper, they explained how mission extensions are sometimes just part of the job.

"We come prepared, we come committed," Wilmore told Cooper. "That is what your human spaceflight program is: It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those."

Mystery ancestors

A new study details how human ancestors mixed with a mystery population 300,000 years ago.

In a study published Tuesday, researchers presented a new method of modeling genomic data, called "cobraa," that has enabled them to trace the evolution of modern humans (Homo sapiens).

They found that the ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago.

This unknown population contributed 20% to the DNA of modern humans.

Scientists have developed new blood tests that can detect early chemical signatures of cancer.

For diseases like pancreatic cancer, this could lead to earlier diagnosis and a better prognosis.

The test suggested Gormly had colon cancer, which a colonoscopy later confirmed was Stage 2, meaning the cancer had spread through the wall of the colon but not to his lymph nodes.</p></b>

                <p>More than 17,000 children in Gaza have been affected by the conflict since October 7, 2023.

Since then, thousands of children have been forced to flee their homes, leaving many without access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare.

In Gaza, the situation is dire. The health system is collapsing, and hospitals are struggling to treat the wounded.

The lack of electricity, fuel, and medical supplies has made it impossible for doctors to save lives.

The ongoing conflict has also led to a severe shortage of food and medicine in Gaza.

Malnutrition rates have skyrocketed, with over 60,000 children estimated to need treatment by January 2025.

In addition to the physical toll, the psychological trauma is immense. Children are witnessing bombings, injuries, and deaths on a daily basis.

The constant fear and anxiety are taking a devastating toll on their mental health.

Many children have lost loved ones, friends, and neighbors in the conflict.

Some have even witnessed the murder of family members or friends.

For others, the trauma has been so severe that they have become unable to speak or interact with others.

Children are not just innocent bystanders; they are being directly targeted by the violence.

In Gaza, children make up more than 50% of the population, and many have lost their parents or caregivers in the conflict.

The displacement of families has led to a significant increase in child labor, as young people feel forced to work to support their families.

This not only affects their education but also exposes them to further danger and exploitation.

On the Israeli side, children have also been affected by the conflict.</p></b>
