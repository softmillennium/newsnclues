Scientists have developed a new method to break down plastic waste, using moisture from the air. By exposing a common type of plastic to an inexpensive catalyst and leaving it exposed to ambient air, researchers broke down 94% of the material in just four hours. The plastic transformed into terephthalic acid (TPA), a highly valuable building block for polyesters. Because TPA can be upcycled into more valuable materials, the process offers a safer and cheaper alternative to current plastic recycling methods. "The U.S. is the number one plastic polluter per capita, and we only recycle 5% of those plastics," co-corresponding author Yosi Kratish , a research assistant professor of chemistry at Northwestern University, said in a statement . "What's particularly exciting about our research is that we harnessed moisture from air to break down the plastics, achieving an exceptionally clean and selective process. By recovering the monomers, which are the basic building blocks of PET [polyethylene terephthalate], we can recycle or even upcycle them into more valuable materials." Over half of the plastic ever made has been produced since 2000, and annual production is projected to double by 2050, according to the European Environment Agency . To date, only 9% of the plastics ever produced have been recycled. The remainder, with lifetimes often lasting generations, can have serious environmental and health impacts. For example, they wash out to sea to form floating blobs of trash, harm wildlife , and break down into microplastics that can enter the human brain and other parts of our bodies . Related: Will we ever be able to stop using plastic? That meant they didn't have to presort the plastics. It worked on plastic bottles, T-shirts and colored plastics, breaking them down into pure, colorless TPA.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

ANAHEIM, Calif. ‚Äî Long after the black hole in the center of a galaxy sputters out, you can still see its ghost lingering in surrounding gas clouds aglow with leftover radiation, like wisps of smoke emanating from an already extinguished flame. Astronomers call these cosmic ghosts "light echoes" ‚Äî and that's what high-school junior Julian Shapiro found while scanning the cosmos for supernova remnants. "There are these outer regions of gas being ionized by a supermassive black hole, which results in this echo," Shapiro said at a March 20 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society (APS) Global Physics Summit. Shapiro, 17, is a student at The Dalton School in New York City. But in between classes and scoping out potential colleges, he's also an independent astronomer who presents at global conferences like this week's APS meeting. But after zeroing in on one such object, he found its structure didn't match the wispy filaments characteristic of a supernova remnant, nor did it show evidence of a supernova at its center. "It was a real surprise to stumble upon this," Shapiro told Live Science. Related: High school students who came up with 'impossible' proof of Pythagorean theorem discover 9 more solutions to the problem Using measurements from the Southern African Large Telescope , he found high contents of oxygen and ionized sulfur sprinkled into the region ‚Äî both indicators of shocked material. And if his estimates hold up, he thinks it could be a viable candidate for the largest light echo ever discovered. "I really like how carefully [Shapiro] looked into these images," Plavin told Live Science. Plavin is also interested in seeing how this new light echo measures up to others ‚Äî whether it occurred faster or slower than existing examples .</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Don't buy it if: ‚ùå You want to observe for long periods without tripod mounting: The 12x magnification is manageable for short periods, but you will require a very steady hand. The bottom line üîé Python 12x52 Range Master Ultra HD: Excellent glass from renowned German manufacturer Schott, combined with fully multi-coated lenses, makes the optics stunning, and it's clear this is where Python has chosen to allocate its budget. It features high-quality German Schott glass and fully broadband multi-coated lenses. The magnesium body is coated with rubber to aid with grip, though on our review unit this did show signs that it was beginning to lift away from the chassis. We found this helpful during our hands-on review of the Python 12x52 Range Master Ultra HD but did find ourselves resting on a ledge or fence to steady the image. The focus wheel is well weighted and smooth to operate. Overall, it offers exceptional image quality, which is ultimately what you want from a relatively expensive monocular. Swipe to scroll horizontally Attributes Notes Design The size and weight will best suit users with larger hands.

Don't buy it if: ‚ùå You want something for all-weather use: This model is not waterproof or nitrogen-purged (so it is not fog-proof). The bottom line üîé Nikon 5x15 HG: A tiny monocular that is best used indoors or for casual use where you just want to get a bit closer to the action ‚Äî not specifically for one task such as bird-watching. It may not have the highest magnification or rugged all-weather functionality, but we thought the image quality was seriously impressive when we got our hands on it for our Nikon 5x15 HG review. You will be rewarded with sharp, vibrant images even when conditions are difficult ‚Äî in low light, for example. The Nikon 5x15 HG weighs just 2.6 oz (75 g) so it can be used comfortably for long periods and forgotten about in a pocket when not in use. Opticron Oregon 4 PC Oasis 10X42 A fantastic all-rounder that's easy to use single-handed, even while wearing gloves. Our expert review: Specifications Magnification: 10-25x Objective lens diameter: 1.65-inch / 42 mm Field of view: 3.3 degrees (10x) / 2.4 degrees (25x) Eye relief: 0.55-inch / 14 mm Closest focusing distance: 3.3 ft / 1 m Waterproof: Yes Fog-proof: Yes Weight: 10.5 oz / 197 g Dimensions: 6.9 x 12.6-inch / 17.5 x 32 cm Reasons to buy + Very easy to use + Close focus + Waterproof and nitrogen-purged Reasons to avoid - Slightly heavier than comparable models - The neck strap is a little on the short side Buy it if ‚úÖ You want something that's easy to use: One-handed operation is possible and simple ‚úÖ You want good value for money: This is a fairly priced product that provides good-quality views The bottom line üîé Opticron Oregon 4 PC Oasis 10x42: A good all-rounder that copes well in low light. It is pretty rugged and very easy to use, even when wearing gloves. This roof prism design monocular, as we found in our hands-on Opticron Oregon 4 Oasis 10x42 review, is a good all-round performer. It is protected with nonslip rubber armor, so it can handle the odd knock and accidental drop, too ‚Äî something you may find useful if you're sharing with children (or clumsy friends! We especially liked how easy it is to use one-handed, even when wearing gloves. It utilizes BaK-4 fully-coated glass that gives excellent clarity and also works well in low-light conditions. It is waterproof and nitrogen-purged, so it can be used in all weathers, and there is no need to wait for the lenses to de-fog when moving between different temperatures. 10x magnification is a comfortable amount for most users to manage wobble-wise, but it's important to note that there is no monopod/tripod mount, so you don't have this option. Instead, you'll have to rely on leaning against something, such as shelves in hides, for long observing sessions. Image 1 of 5 Don't let the bright design or plasticky appearance mislead you ‚Äî this is a great minocular (Image credit: Jamie Carter) The objective lens is 32 mm in diameter; it doesn't let enough light in for skywatching (Image credit: Jamie Carter) The Nocs Field Tube is very comfortable to hold (Image credit: Jamie Carter) One-handed operation is a breeze. ‚ùå You want an instrument for low light: The small 32 mm aperture doesn't lend itself well to low light work ‚Äî this is a daytime monocular. The bottom line üîé Nocs Field Tube 8x32: Another good all-rounder protected with ribbed, rugged casing. Don't let the brightly colored casing deter you ‚Äî this is a serious travel-friendly monocular. If you're planning on long bird-watching or wildlife-spotting sessions, you might find the 1/4-inch thread handy, though, for regular casual use, the smaller 8x magnification shouldn't cause any issues with image wobble. No neck strap or protective carry case are provided, but given the rugged build and scratch-proof credentials, we didn't mind too much.

The bottom line üîé Bushnell Equinox X650 Night Vision 5x32: This affordable, entry-level monocular provides an opportunity to experience night vision technology without breaking the bank, but don't expect miracles. During our hands-on Equinox X650 review, we found that the unit delivered basic functionality suitable for general identification purposes, but image quality was subpar, with daytime photos often appearing blurred and nighttime images lacking clarity, making them unworthwhile. Overall, the Bushnell Equinox X650 is a lightweight and cost-effective introduction to night vision technology, but its performance limitations, particularly regarding image quality, may not satisfy users who want a more premium unit. Performance Fine for identification and wildlife observation but image clarity is lacking. Functionality Night vision mode for users who want to monitor wildlife after sunset. (Image credit: Matt Morris) There‚Äôs no protection for either end of the monocular. (Image credit: Matt Morris) It very easily fits in the palm.

Buy it if: ‚úÖ Images are everything: Boasting both still and video capture, this is a great monocular for imaging (not all monoculars store photos). Don't buy it if: ‚ùå You want to use a tripod: The Powershot Zoom has no attachment for one, so this is for handheld use only. The bottom line üîé Canon Powershot Zoom Digital Monocular: This is a budget-friendly, entry-level digital monocular that is particularly useful for watching sports, bird-watching and sightseeing. However, be warned ‚Äî the plastic casing lacks waterproofing, limiting its durability in inclement weather. It can capture 12.1 MP photos and record videos in full HD, storing content on a MicroSD card. In our hands-on Canon PowerShot Zoom Digital Monocular review, we found that image quality diminishes when using the 800 mm digital zoom, and the closely spaced controls may hinder usability, especially if you have larger hands. It does, however, have image stabilization, which is a plus. We found bird-watching to be an incredibly rewarding experience when using the Canon. We found the face detection and tracking autofocus modes worked well under good lighting, but they'll struggle in low light, so it's best used during the day.

The Vortex Solo R/T 8x36 Monocular is a compact, durable optical device designed for outdoor enthusiasts. The 36 mm objective lens, combined with BaK-4 prisms and multi-coated optics, ensures excellent light transmission, delivering clear and bright images even in low-light conditions; we were pleasantly surprised in our Vortex Solo R/T 8x36 monocular review. We can only hope the focus wheel will loosen over time. Swipe to scroll horizontally Attributes Notes Design Tough and sturdy waterproof construction Performance Very clear views and good low-light performance Functionality Close focus for backyard wildlife spotting This sparked his interest in cameras and optics, a passion that has now spanned the better part of four decades and led to his being featured in several national photography magazines for competition-winning photos. Matt has had deteriorating eyesight in one eye over the last few years due to being Type-1 diabetic. This has led him to develop a special interest in monoculars and spotting scopes as these are now the only means by which Matt's passion for bird-watching and wildlife spotting can continue. His eyesight is in a state of flux as diabetes takes its toll, further emphasizing the importance for him to find and use quality optical equipment ‚Äî although Matt is happy to point out his right eye is in perfect working order! We asked our contributing expert Matt Morris, who told us: "The ideal way to choose a monocular is to decide where and when and how you‚Äôll be using your monocular. Will you use it for bird-watching, sports viewing or astronomy? These will all determine which monocular is best for you." We asked our expert Matt Morris, who said: "Any monocular of a size which enables it to be quickly and conveniently carried and then put to use in the field. Any higher and you may have trouble holding the optic steady." Stargazing is a little different from terrestrial viewing and bird-watching. As the stars are further away, you need a higher magnification (and a higher objective lens diameter) in order to get the best view. Monoculars don't tend to have the reach of the best binoculars for stargazing, but you can certainly get a decent view with a monocular. Matt Morris told us: "Most monoculars have between 8 and 12x magnification due to their compact size. This is easily enough to allow views of nearby stars." We asked our monocular expert Matt Morris, who said: "Although it‚Äôs not strictly necessary to have a waterproof model, the very nature of the monocular being waterproof means that you can use it in the field and damp misty conditions won‚Äôt affect performance. We also examine the quality of any accessories, such as shoulder straps, lens caps and belt pouches. We then score each monocular on its design, performance and functionality, ultimately giving them an overall rating of five stars.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Great potoos have giant eyes that protrude from the sides of their heads, providing excellent vision in low-light conditions. Why it's awesome: The great potoo is a master of disguise. Its mottled gray-brown feathers and ability to remain perfectly still often cause it to be mistaken for a tree branch or stump, helping it evade detection by predators. By day, great potoos remain silent and still in the trees. Equipped with a large, flattened beak and mouth, these birds are well-adapted to snatching prey such as flying insects and bats out of the air. These "notches" help the birds to sense light and movement through their shut eyelids, so they can detect predators and prey even when resting. Great potoos are also unusual thanks to their distinctive calls. This ghostly call has earned the bird a mythical status in local folklore , with some communities in South America believing the sounds to be children calling for lost parents. These calls are used for communication and to defend their territories. Potoos are monogamous birds, forming lifelong pairs that share the responsibilities of incubation and care for their young.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Astronomers have discovered a collection of tiny galaxies located roughly 3 million light-years away that includes the smallest and faintest galaxy ever seen. Yet somehow, this tiny galaxy survived without being fried. Related: 'The early universe is nothing like we expected': James Webb telescope reveals 'new understanding' of how galaxies formed at cosmic dawn Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is orbited by dozens of these satellite galaxies caught in the grip of its more immense galaxies. There is, however, a great deal about dwarf galaxies that scientists don't know. This is because, being smaller, they are much dimmer than major galaxies, making them harder to spot and tougher to study at large distances. While astronomers have been able to determine many dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way, identifying dwarf galaxies around our bright galactic neighbors has been incredibly difficult. This means that the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way have been our only source of information about small satellite galaxies. Other dwarf galaxies have been spotted around Andromeda before, but these have been large and bright, thus simply confirming the information that astronomers had gathered about dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way. A map showing the Andromeda galaxy and its satellites. The newly discovered Andromeda XXXV companion galaxy is highlighted in bold red text. To discover these paradigm-shifting smaller and dimmer dwarf galaxies, team leader Marcos Arias, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, and his colleagues scoured various massive astronomical datasets. This revealed that not only is Andromeda XXXV a satellite galaxy, but it is also small enough to change theories of how galaxies evolve. But it's also unexpected in a lot of different ways." "Most of the Milky Way satellites have very ancient star populations. They stopped forming stars about 10 billion years ago," Arias explained. "What we're seeing is that similar satellites in Andromeda can form stars up to a few billion years ago ‚Äî around 6 billion years." When that gas is gone, star formation halts, and the galaxy "dies." Thus, Bell described the situation around these small galaxies as a "murder mystery." Did star formation end when dwarf galaxies' gas supplies petered out on their own, or when these gases were gravitationally stripped away by a large galactic host? These galaxies appear to have been pushed," Bell said. "With that, we've learned something qualitatively new about galaxy formation from them." Not only is Andromeda XXXV the dimmest and smallest known satellite galaxy in the Andromeda system, it's about 3 million light-years away, making it very hard to spot. This signaled the death of very small galaxies, and scientists theorize this heat "cooked off" the gas needed for star formation in such collections of stars. "We thought they were basically all going to be fried because the entire universe turned into a vat of boiling oil," Bell said. "We thought that it would completely lose its gas, but apparently that doesn't happen, because this thing is about 20,000 solar masses and yet it was forming stars just fine for a few extra billion years." Just how Andromeda XXXV resisted being fried is still a mystery. "It is also still true that the universe did heat up; we're just learning the consequences are more complicated than we thought." NASA and other space agencies are planning missions that could discover further dwarf galaxies around other large galaxies and help solve this mystery. "We still have a lot to discover," Arias said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This week's science news was largely dominated by the return of two NASA astronauts from the International Space Station, whose planned eight-day mission ended up lasting 286 days. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams lifted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on June 5, 2024, but not long into the mission helium leaks , along with a number of other issues, were discovered on their Boeing Starliner spacecraft. In a conversation with CNN's Anderson Cooper, they explained how mission extensions are sometimes just part of the job . That is what your human spaceflight program is: It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those," Wilmore told Cooper. Related: NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore were carried away on stretchers after return from space. In a study published Tuesday, researchers presented a new method of modeling genomic data, called "cobraa," that has enabled them to trace the evolution of modern humans ( Homo sapiens ). They found that the ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago. This unknown population contributed 20% of our DNA and may have boosted humans' brain function. "The fact that we can reconstruct events from hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago just by looking at DNA today is astonishing, and it tells us that our history is far richer and more complex than we imagined," study co-author Aylwyn Scally , a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement . ‚Äî European hunter-gatherers boated to North Africa during Stone Age, ancient DNA suggests ‚Äî 'Not enough survives to read the king's name': Tomb discovered of unknown ancient Egyptian pharaoh Just like the mountains, lakes on Earth can be ancient, or more than 1 million years old. ‚Äî 'I was astonished': Ancient galaxy discovered by James Webb telescope contains the oldest oxygen scientists have ever seen ‚Äî Scientists create new map showing ice-free Antarctica in more detail than ever before Scientists have developed new blood tests that can detect early chemical signatures of cancer.

Around four years ago, now 77-year-old John Gormly went for what was supposed to be a routine blood test. "I thought [my doctor] was wrong," Gormly, CEO of a construction company near Newport Beach, California, told Live Science. Gormly was one of the first patients to take a newly approved test called Shield, which its makers say can detect colon cancer from a blood sample . After his diagnosis, Gormly had surgery to remove the tumor and was back at work within 10 days. "Liquid biopsies" like the one that detected early cancer for Gormly are now coming to market.

At the time, Ariel was four years old and Kfir, nine months. When we are in direct contact with a child, we can easily access the conception that children should be protected. They should have access to affectionate and responsible caregivers, housing, health, education. It is easy to conceive of the idea that every child, as well as those we know in our daily lives, should be entitled to play and experience the world, without the risk of being raped, without fear of dying or having their assassinated caregivers, family and friends. I proposed this reflection because, for some reason, the level of understanding and empathy we have with our children is often not so simple to access when we talk about children from another social or cultural group. Children victims of climbing violence in Gaza and Israel are as child as the ones you know, value and protect. From this perspective, I put the question here - how is there any attempt to justify what is happening in the Middle East? In situations of violent conflict, children are particularly vulnerable and exposed to risks, including direct violence, murder, separation or loss of caregivers and family members, expulsion from their homes, malnutrition, diseases, psychological and sexual violence, among many others. Since the beginning of Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip following October 7, 2023, it is estimated that around 18,000 Palestinian children have been murdered. The probability of this number is higher is quite high, as due to the countless collapse and the lack of search capacity, many bodies of victims are still missing, buried in rubble. Over the past 17 months, thousands of children have necessarily displaced from their homes, living in precarious and dangerous conditions. Winter in Gaza are quite intense, which has left all its inhabitants, especially children, vulnerable and exposed to cold. Under military offensive, bombing and travel, children are without access to education or basic health conditions. His family moved out of his house fleeing the heavy bombing, keeping in mind that leaving they could find a safer place, and began to live in a shelter. Her mother said that every time she is in a closed place, she has panic seizures and needs to be taken out immediately. Mays also told UNICEF about the lack of water: "Sometimes the truck comes, and each one gets a small amount to drink. Fear, mourning, trauma are present daily, affecting mental and physical health from early childhood. According to a report published by War Child in December 2024, 49% of children expressed a desire to die and 96% feel that death is imminent. Sama Tubail, 8, no longer has a hair on her head. Doctors diagnosed Sama's hair loss as a result of a nervous shock, intensified after the bombing of his neighbor's house in Rafah and the disruption of his entire routine since the military attacks began. I want to die and have my hair back in paradise, God willing." With blocked borders and lack of sufficient humanitarian aid, the continuous increase in hunger and malnutrition has consecutively increasing the number of malnourished children, generating many deaths from a result. Without available hospitals and medical equipment, diseases have represented another major factor of violence. Thousands of children hit in military attacks or affected by a disease cannot access a health center and even when they can, the place often does not have the necessary structure to treat them. In February 2024, over a year ago, UNICEF estimated that about 17,000 children in Gaza were unaccompanied or separated from their caregivers. On the Israeli side there were many losses as well. This was the case of Liel and Yannai Hetzroni, twin brothers, who were only 12 years old and were killed in the Kibutz Beeri. Mila Cohen, just 9 months old, was murdered with a shot in her mother, Sandra, also at Kibibutz Beeri. To these sad stories were added the children Bibas, Ariel and Kfir, who were kidnapped and taken to Gaza Living on October 7, 2023, along with his mother, Shiri. In addition to these terrible cases, many other Israeli children have lost their fathers, mothers, siblings, sisters and friends since October 7, 2023. The situations of Palestinian and Israeli children are clearly different. This cycle has been going on for many decades, and has been producing nothing more than generation after generating traumatized, bereaved and growing fear on the other side. The surviving children become adults who carry all marks of losses. How to cultivate a possibility of a possible future peace agreement between people who live these violent contexts, lose so much and are so traumatized? What was already proven and has been even clearer in the last 17 months is that there is no safe space for anyone in this alleged conflict. The policy of persisting in violence and further intensifying military onslaughts only have the possibility of generating more losses and more insecurities, for all involved in this conflict. Everything we have been following in the last year and a half, including breaking the ceasefire, is not just undermining a possibility of decreasing violence in the present, but is generating a whole generation of people deeply traumatized and undermining any possibility of future resolution.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
