https://techmeme.com,Kuo: iPhone 18 Models Will Feature 2nm Chips,https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/kuo-a20-chip-2nm/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today reiterated that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process.



Kuo said TSMC's trial production of 2nm chips has now reached yields well above the 60-70% range. The yield refers to the percentage of functional chips that can be obtained per silicon wafer, which is essentially a large, circular disc of chips.

Kuo first said that the A20 chip would be 2nm around six months ago, and another analyst Jeff Pu said likewise earlier this week.

An earlier rumor saying the A20 chip would remain 3nm was retracted.

This is ultimately good news, as the A20 chip being 2nm instead of 3nm means it will have more substantial performance and power efficiency improvements over the A19 chip for iPhone 17 models. Kuo, Pu, and others have all said that the A19 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, called N3P.

The move from a 3nm to 2nm process allows for more transistors in each chip, which helps to boost performance. Specifically, reports indicate that A20 chips should be up to 15% faster and up to 30% more power efficient than A19 chips.

An overview of current and expected chips:

A17 Pro chip: 3nm (TSMC's first-generation 3nm process N3B)

A18 and A18 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's second-generation 3nm process N3E)

A19 and A19 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's third-generation 3m process N3P)

A20 and A20 Pro chips: 2nm (TSMC's first-generation 2nm process N2)

Keep in mind that these nanometer sizes are simply TSMC marketing terms, rather than actual measurements.

https://techmeme.com,Tencent’s Hunyuan T1 AI reasoning model rivals DeepSeek in performance and price,https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3303456/tencents-hunyuan-t1-ai-reasoning-model-rivals-deepseek-performance-and-price,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 16:00:12 GMT","Advertisement

The Chinese technology giant’s latest offering, launched on Friday, leverages large-scale reinforcement learning, a technique also employed by DeepSeek in its R1 reasoning model, which launched in January.

The release is an official version of the model after a beta run of T1-preview on its chatbot Yuanbao. It scored 87.2 points on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Pro benchmark, a test that gauges a model’s knowledge. That bested DeepSeek-R1’s 84 points but trailed the 89.3 points achieved by OpenAI’s o1, the reasoning model that the ChatGPT maker launched in December.

T1 has achieved high scores in other benchmarks as well, including 78.2 in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2024, slightly behind R1’s 79.8 and o1’s 79.2. In terms of Chinese language capabilities, T1 excelled with 91.8 points in the C-Eval suite evaluation, the same score as R1 and better than o1’s 87.8, according to Tencent.

It also rivals DeepSeek on pricing, which has been a primary advantage for the popular Chinese start-up. T1 charges 1 yuan (US$0.14) per 1 million tokens of input, while output costs 4 yuan per million tokens. The input rate is in line with R1, which charges 1 yuan per million tokens during daytime hours, and just 0.25 yuan overnight. The output pricing is also comparable, given R1’s daytime rate of 16 yuan per million tokens, which drops to 4 yuan overnight.

https://techmeme.com,"Kennedy praises cellphone bans in schools, citing mix of science and misinformation",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/kennedy-cell-phone-bans-schools-rcna197347,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:00:40 GMT","Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda: cellphones in schools.

In an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Thursday, Kennedy praised cellphone restrictions in schools and listed health hazards that he said were linked to phone use among children and teens — some backed by scientific research, others less so.

Kennedy cited established links between social media use and depression and poor school performance. But he also suggested that cellphones “produce electromagnetic radiation, which has been shown to do neurological damage to kids when it’s around them all day, and to cause cellular damage and even cancer.”

Studies have found that excessive use of social media via smartphones can negatively impact teens’ mental health, elevating their risk of depression and anxiety. Scientists have also long understood that cellphone use in school can lead to poor academic performance, including lower grades.

However, the bulk of research so far has found no association between cellphone use and cancer, nor evidence that cellphones damage DNA. Cellphones emit radio frequency radiation, which has far less energy than ionizing radiation, such as that released by medical X-rays.

Kennedy’s statements follow a pattern of his, in which he mixes misinformation with scientific fact. Some of the issues he has highlighted during his first five-plus weeks in office, such as reducing chronic disease in children and warning of the dangers of ultraprocessed food, have broad support among the public and many scientists. But certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems and some of his proposed solutions — such as substituting beef tallow for seed oils in fast food — are not backed by research.

So, too, for cellphones in schools. Restricting their use is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Last year, Vivek Murthy, then the surgeon general in the Biden administration, called on schools to get rid of phones in the classroom. Nine states have already enacted such bans or restrictions, and 15 states and Washington, D.C., have introduced legislation to do so, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank.

“Both in red states and blue states, there’s a lot of concern about kids and cellphones, so I do think that there is bipartisan support on this,” said Annette Campbell Anderson, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.

However, there’s no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cellphone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis.

“There’s a lot of low-quality research in the literature that, if you wanted to collect all that and put it together, it would look very damning,” he said. “There are many activist groups out there that promote those studies and say that that’s the truth.”

An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

What Kennedy says, and what studies say

Kennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims about the physical harms of cellphone use in the past, including on Joe Rogan’s podcast last year.

At his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy also told Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., that he stood by his past statements that Wi-Fi radiation causes cancer, saying that he had “won a case in front of the Court of Appeals against the FCC on that very issue.”

The anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, Children’s Health Defense, challenged the Federal Communications Commission’s decision not to review its 1996 health and safety guidelines for wireless-based technologies. An appeals court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the FCC to explain how its guidelines protect against potentially harmful health effects. However, that case was about health issues unrelated to cancer, and the court did not take a position on the potential health effects of cellphone radiation.

Research thus far has been “very reassuring” about cellphone safety, Bushberg said.

Most studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cellphones could increase the risk of brain tumors, given that people often hold their phone by their head while talking. But overall brain cancer rates haven’t risen as cellphones have become more widely used. And a large study among children found no association between wireless phone use and brain tumors.

The National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration — agencies that Kennedy now oversees — as well as the Environmental Protection Agency have all said there’s not enough scientific evidence to associate cellphone use with cancer. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic, meaning it cannot rule out a causal link.

Several questions remain, said David McCormick, a biology professor at Illinois Institute of Technology.

“I think it’s fairly clear that Mr. Kennedy doesn’t necessarily pay much attention to the bulk of the scientific data that is out there. That said, it’s not impossible that there are health effects from people using cellphones,” he said.

In a 2017 study, McCormick and his fellow researchers exposed rodents to radio frequency radiation and found a possible increased rate of certain tumors. However, findings in lab animals don’t necessarily apply to humans, given the many biological differences, and the studies contained limitations that prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions.

A decade earlier, a study looked at cellphone use among more than 5,000 people with brain tumors and found a possible increased risk of tumors in the 10% who used their phones the most. But the research relied on people’s memories about past phone use, which aren’t always reliable, so its results (like those of similar studies) are hard to interpret.

Cellphone use has also changed in recent years, McCormick said, which could affect exposure. Whereas studies thus far have mainly looked at the effects of 2G or 3G mobile signals, higher-frequency 5G networks are common today. And people now text as much if not more than they call, so there’s potentially less radiation near the brain.

The pros and cons of cellphone bans

Despite bipartisan support for cellphone restrictions in schools, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like.

Phones can have lifesaving benefits — for instance, by allowing children to call 911 — so some parents worry that outright bans could jeopardize their child’s safety. Anderson said policymakers have to weigh those concerns against risks to kids’ mental health and their ability to focus in the classroom.

“Part of what schools are trying to do is figure out how to wrest back control over what happened in their school climates because of the phone — everything from using the phone to tape fights and incidents that happen in schools to kids using them to make TikToks,” she said.

The right approach likely differs from school to school, she added. For instance, in schools where cellphones are the only internet-connected device, a ban may make less sense.

In his interview on Thursday, Kennedy applauded Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who last year issued an executive order directing the state’s education department to draft guidance for public schools to restrict or eliminate phone use and set aside $500,000 to fund those efforts. On Monday, Kennedy visited a Virginia high school that adopted the change, which he said students and teachers there have welcomed.

“The states that are doing this have found that it is a much healthier environment when kids are not using cellphones in schools,” Kennedy said.

However, prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy suggested that although he personally supports getting phones out of schools, parents and teachers should make their own decisions.

Much of the opposition activity has centered around universities, and many of those connected to the demonstrations are now finding their X accounts suspended, observers report.

The majority of the suspended accounts were ""university-associated activist accounts, basically sharing protest information, locations for students to go,"" Yusuf Can, coordinator and analyst at the Wilson Center's Middle East Program, told POLITICO. Many of these accounts are ""grassroots activists"" with their followings in the low tens of thousands, said Can.

Some accounts appear to be suspended only in Turkey and not in the rest of the world. Activist Ömer Faruk Aslan created a second account to avoid censorship. ""Yesterday, my account was blocked by a court order because the tweets exceeded 6 million views,"" he posted.

Turkey's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X that authorities have found 326 social media accounts that are inciting hatred, 72 of which were abroad. A coordinated action between cyber and security authorities led to the arrest of 54 suspects related to the social media accounts, said Yerlikaya.

It is almost confirmed that both A19 and A19 Pro chips will be manufactured using TSMC’s third-generation 3nm process N3P.

Now, a fresh leak reveals Apple’s plan for the 2026 iPhone models’ chip — A20 and A20 Pro. If the leak is true, both chips could be manufactured using TSMC’s third-generation 2nm process.

iPhone 18 chipset details emerge

The launch of the iPhone 18 lineup is still a year and a half away, but we are already getting leaks. Recently, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed (via MacRumors) that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC’s 2nm process.

During trial production, TSMC’s 2nm chips have achieved yield rates above the 60-70% range, meaning the chip is now ready for mass production. This is not the first time we have heard this rumor. Multiple analysts, including Jeff Pu, have already confirmed that TSMC will indeed manufacture A20 chips using its 3nm process.

This is actually good news, as the 2nm chipset era for smartphones is finally about to begin. So, with the arrival of the A20 chips, we can expect considerable performance and power efficiency improvements over the A19 chip.

Speaking of older chipsets, the A17 Pro chip was manufactured using TSMC’s first-generation 3nm process (N3B), while the A18 and A18 Pro chips were built on TSMC’s second-generation 3nm process (N3E).",techmeme

This means that next year’s iPhone 18 models should all take the leap to a next-generation chip architecture. Previously, it was unclear whether or not all iPhone 18 models would adopt 2nm tech.

This years iPhone 17 models will utilize TSMC’s third generation 3nm process, N3P. While newer generation chip architectures are able to yield performance and efficiency enhancements, you generally notice the biggest jumps with new process nodes.

Apple begun to adopt 3nm chip technology in 2023 with the A17 Pro and M3 chips. Leaping to 2nm next year will mark the beginning of a new three-year chip cycle, as per usual. TSMC states that 2nm chips should lead to a roughly 15% performance boost while consuming the same level of power.

Kuo also notes that TSMC’s trial production for 2nm chips reached 60-70% yields three months ago, and they’re now “well above that.”

It’s unclear whether or not 2026’s M6 chip family for Macs will adopt 2nm chip technology, but hopefully that’ll end up being the case.

While we’ve covered this topic before and laid out reasons why free hosting isn’t the best option for everyone, we understand why many people still ask why they should pay.

We’re here to share the limitations of free podcast hosting services, why some podcast hosts charge, and why so many podcasters are happy to pay for podcast hosting without limits.

Is Free Podcast Hosting Really Free?

We admit it, free podcast hosting sounds like a great deal!

Getting a podcast RSS feed, digital storage, reliable bandwidth, access to analytics, and streamlined publishing for $0 seems like an awesome offer right?

But, if someone came up to you and said they were giving you a new electric bike for free, wouldn’t your first question be, “What’s the catch?” 🤔

It’s important to remember that the platforms offering “free” services are businesses that make money from their users to cover their expenses.

If you are starting a podcast for any of the following reasons, we highly suggest understanding the pitfalls and limitations of using a free service like Spotify for Creators (formerly Anchor):

You are creating your podcast for your brand or business.

You plan on turning your podcast into a business at some point.

You plan on actively podcasting, gaining a fan base, and then monetizing your show to make money.

With options to create, distribute and monetize a podcast, it’s easy to see why so many new podcasters choose Spotify for Creators to start their show.

But is Spotify for Creators really free, and what limitations will you run into?

Are You Starting a Podcast to Make Money?

In digging into the fine print, you’ll find that Spotify’s monetization philosophy is that “we should all make money together, rather than profiting off each other’s needs.”

Another way to say this is that if you use their monetization tools, they’ll take a significant cut of your profits. 😲

For example, if you use Spotify for Creators Sponsorships, they’ll take a 30% cut of the money you make. Ouch!

That might sound like a sweet deal until your show starts getting popular and you see how much you are actually “paying” to use this “free” service. 💸

If your show takes off, you could be paying hundreds or thousands in fees.

In comparison, with RSS.com for only $11.99/month (annual plan), you are in full control of your show.

You could have your show deleted at any time, and for no reason. We recently learn about a podcast being deleted by Spotify without warning – eliminating years of work in an instant. Sadly, this is not the only podcast to end up on the chopping block without advance notice. Many Reddit users complain about their shows being deleted too and having no recourse when it happens.

The Hidden Costs of Podcast Hosting with Spotify for Creators

If you choose to allow Spotify for Creators to distribute your show to the major podcast directories, it will “block your access to additional Apple stats in podcastsconnect.apple.com.” Not cool, right? Also, you’ll find that the email listed in your feed for iTunes Owner is not the email that you used to set up your Spotify for Creators account.”

Spotify for Creators also limits your podcast categories to just one, whereas other hosts allow you to add up to three giving you more opportunities to be found on Apple Podcasts.

on Apple Podcasts. Also, because many podcasters choose to have Anchor distribute their podcasts on their behalf, they lose access to most analytics – sure, Spotify for Creators does give you an analytics dashboard, but details you’re looking for and need might not be accessible.

– sure, Spotify for Creators does give you an analytics dashboard, but details you’re looking for and need might not be accessible. Spotify for Creators can shut down without warning. Because they are a free service, they could simply decide to shut everything down and take your content offline.

Spotify for Creators has recently changed the format of an RSS feed making it harder to redirect your show to another host, or to submit your show to podcast directories yourself. If you outgrow Spotify for Creators , it can be difficult to leave and transfer your content to another host.

, Spotify for Creators is “designed to be automated,” but that translates into having “little control over a number of features that may turn away professional podcasters,” says Resonate Recordings.

Why Paying for Hosting Makes Sense

https://techmeme.com,‘Free Speech’ Platfrom X Suspends Opposition Party Accounts in Turkey,https://gizmodo.com/free-speech-platfrom-x-suspends-opposition-party-accounts-in-turkey-2000579502,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:30:07 GMT","Elon Musk purchased Twitter (and then renamed it X) with the promise that it would be a free speech paradise. It turns out in practice, that means you can say your favorite slurs but can’t protest government overreach. Following the arrest of the primary political rival of Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdoğan, demonstrators have taken to the streets and to social media to protest the seemingly politically motivated action. According to Politico, some of those who have taken to speaking out against the government have been suspended on X.

Per Politico’s reporting, “university-associated activist accounts” that share protest information including times and locations for students and other activists who might want to participate have been the primary targets of the suspensions. Most of the accounts are described as “grassroots activists” with relatively small followings, typically in the tens of thousands.

In some cases, it seems those accounts have been suspended in Turkey—where their information is most relevant—and not in the rest of the world. One activist, Ömer Faruk Aslan, created a second account to dodge the local censorship, and claimed that his primary account got suspended after one of his posts exceeded six million views on the platform.

Turkey’s ruling government, led by Erdoğan—has claimed that suspended accounts are associated with “inciting hatred.” (It’s worth noting that the public demonstrations against the Erdoğan have taken place the government issuing a multi-day ban on protests.) Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya claimed authorities have identified 326 accounts for takedown, including 72 that are believed to be operated outside of Turkey. He also said that 54 “suspects” have been arrested for their activity on social media.

Turkey’s crackdown on activists is not necessarily on Musk or X (though we don’t know if the company surrendered any user data to the government). But the crackdown on content on platform, the company certainly has a hand in. In fact, it’s been pretty willing to bend to the will of Erdoğan’s government when asked.

Back in 2023, as Turkey was about to have a Presidential election, Erdoğan threatened to throttle X if the company didn’t comply with government requests to take down posts and accounts that it wanted removed. Musk and X acquiesced, with Musk reasoning, “The choice is have Twitter throttled in its entirety or limit access to some tweets. Which one do you want?” (The answer to that, if you are a “free speech absolutist,” is likely the former, refuse to give in to a censorship demand and let the chips fall where they may.) Additionally, X has complied with 86% of Turkey’s government requests to take down content in the second half of 2024, per the company’s transparency report.

Then on Wednesday, just four days before the mayor was set to be designated as the political opposition’s presidential candidate, dozens of policemen arrested him at his home on accusations of corruption and terrorism.

Mr. Erdogan’s foes consider the arrest a ploy to abort Mr. Imamoglu’s presidential campaign before it begins.

Imamoglu was arrested on alleged financial crimes and links to insurgent Kurdish militants, as part of an escalating government crackdown on opposition leaders. As many as 100 others were also detained.

Supporters slammed the charges as politically motivated.

The arrest came mere hours before Imamoglu was nominated as a presidential candidate for the country’s main opposition party to Erdogan, in an election currently scheduled for 2028.

Imamoglu was questioned by Turkish police for five hours Saturday and is expected to be transferred to a courthouse to face possible charges.

Tens of thousands of Turks have taken to the streets calling for Erdogan’s resignation, in more than a dozen cities across the country. The protests have spread even as the government banned public gatherings on Wednesday, Politico reported.

“It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” McCaleb said during an interview with Bloomberg. “There’s not that many folks that are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am.”

The station, whose construction started earlier this year, will have 1,600 cubic feet of habitable space. The crypto mogul’s goal is to secure a lucrative contract from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to replace the space station.

McCaleb is attempting to pull off the monumental feat despite having very little experience in the aerospace sector.

McCaleb, who co-founded the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox in 2010, went on to create the XRP crypto token on the Ripple protocol in 2012, and then Stellar (XLM) in 2014. He has an estimated $3.2 billion fortune — primarily from XRP sales — and is completely prepared to lose an eye-popping $1 billion if Vast Space fails to secure the NASA contract.

NASA is scheduled to retire the International Space Station (ISS) in 2030 after approximately 30 years of research. The agency is partnering with private firms to launch its replacement.

Ripple’s Chris Larsen Is Rooting For McCaleb’s Aerospace Plan

McCaleb’s goal to expand the human race into a multi-planetary species draws similarities to centibillionaire and Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Musk recently rescued NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore who had been stranded at the space station for nine months.

“It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” McCaleb told Bloomberg.

To launch Haven-1 into orbit, Vast is teaming up with SpaceX, which will use its Falcon9 rockets to take Vast’s Haven-1 power modules into space.

“This is a big, bold vision by Jed McCaleb,” Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen wrote on X. “America used to pursue new frontiers like this before skidding into bureaucracy and doubt. I’m rooting for Vast’s success.”

A successful launch in May 2026 would significantly bolster Vast’s position in the fast-growing private space race, and winning a NASA contract would be key for the firm’s expansion in the long term.",techmeme

What do you do after amassing a fortune from cryptocurrency? Build a space station, of course.

That’s exactly what Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb is doing, according to a report by Bloomberg.

While crypto investors say they’re “going to the moon” when Bitcoin surges, McCaleb, a longtime industry pioneer, is aiming for the real thing.

“It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” McCaleb told Bloomberg. “There’s not that many folks that are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am.”

McCaleb’s $1 billion bet, entirely self-funded, is that Vast Space—the California-based aerospace company he founded in 2021—can build and launch a functioning station. The goal is to become a candidate to replace the International Space Station, which is scheduled for decommissioning in 2030.

McCaleb, who co-founded the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox in 2010, Ripple in 2011, and then Stellar in 2014, is now investing his estimated $3.2 billion fortune—largely from XRP sales—into Vast Space.

“This is a big, bold vision by Jed McCaleb,” Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen wrote on X. “America used to pursue new frontiers like this before skidding into bureaucracy and doubt. I’m rooting for Vast’s success.”

Vast develops artificial gravity space stations. Many of its employees bring aerospace experience, including refugees from Elon Musk’s SpaceX. These orbital habitats are designed to simulate gravity by rotating to create centrifugal force while offering the comforts of home.

The company recently revealed the final design for Haven-1, its first station module. To put Haven-1 into orbit, Vast is partnering with SpaceX, which will use its Falcon9 rockets to carry Vast’s Haven-1 modules into space. According to the Vast website, the first launch of Haven-1 is scheduled for May 2026 for a two-week mission above the Earth.

The concept of artificial gravity stations has long been a staple in science fiction, ranging from Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 sci-fi classic film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film ""Interstellar.""

While Haven-1 is a single module designed to operate independently or dock with SpaceX boosters, the next-generation Haven-2 is being developed as a modular system. Several Haven-2 units could be connected to form a larger, expandable station.

Public-sector space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are increasingly turning to private-sector companies to get the astronauts and the resources they need into space and back. McCaleb is among a growing number of private citizens stepping up to meet that need, including Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos.

They represent a growing roster of private companies and national space agencies—including Axiom Space, Blue Origin, Voyager Space, Airbus, and China’s CNSA—that are racing to build the next generation of space stations tailored for research, manufacturing, tourism, and long-term habitation.

A pioneer in online ticket re-selling, StubHub had “gross merchandise sales” (GMS) — or the total price customers paid for the transaction and fulfillment — of $8.7 billion in 2024, a 27% increase from 2023. For the year, it sold more than 40 million tickets from more than 1 million unique sellers across 200 countries and territories.

Revenue reached $1.77 billion in 2024, up 29.4% from 2023, while net loss was $2.8 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which strips out non-cash expenses, was $298.7 million, down nearly 16% from $353.9 million in 2023. Long-term debt stands at $2.33 billion — nearly eight times last year’s adjusted EBITDA.

Trending on Billboard

Proceeds from the IPO will primarily go toward StubHub’s debt, with the remainder going toward general corporate purposes such as working capital, operating expenses and capital expenses. StubHub said it may use a portion of the proceeds for acquisitions or investments in products or technologies.

StubHub believes it is the leader in secondary ticketing, according to its S-1 filing on Friday. The company has also made a foray into primary ticketing, which generated more than $100 million in GMS in 2024. “We believe our value proposition, providing broadened distribution and superior pricing intelligence through an open distribution model, is well-positioned to attract more content rights holders to use our direct issuance solution,” the company stated in the filing.

StubHub does more business than most of its competitors. Vivid Seats had gross transaction value (GTV) of $3.9 billion in 2024 while Eventbrite, a primary ticketing platform, had GTV of $3.2 billion last year. Ticketmaster, which does not break out its primary and secondary ticketing, had GTV of $34.7 billion.

Launched in 2000 by Erik Baker, StubHub was acquired by eBay in 2007. Baker then launched a competing secondary ticketing platform in Europe, Viagogo, which purchased StubHub in 2020. Ahead of the IPO, Baker owns approximately 5% of Class A shares and 100% of Class B shares, leaving him with more than 90% of the voting rights. Other major holders of Class A shares include Madrone Partners (27.1%), WestCap Management (11.0%), Bessemer Venture Partners (9.6%), PointState Capital (5.6%) and Declaration Partners (5.3%).",techmeme

Content Summary

Most people use ChatGPT for practical purposes, according to new research from OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab. The study reveals that emotional connections mainly develop among a small group of heavy voice feature users.

After analyzing nearly 40 million ChatGPT conversations, researchers found little evidence of users seeking empathy, affection, or emotional support in their interactions. Instead, most people stick to factual exchanges with the AI system.

The team used two different approaches to study how people interact with ChatGPT. OpenAI conducted a large-scale, automated analysis of millions of conversations, keeping user privacy intact by avoiding human review. At the same time, the MIT Media Lab conducted a study with about 1,000 participants, testing how they used both text and voice features.

The MIT study split users into distinct groups. Some could only use text, while others tested voice interactions with different AI personalities - one designed to be emotionally engaged and another programmed to stay neutral. Each group received specific tasks: personal conversations about memories, practical questions about topics like finances, or free-form discussions.

Heavy advanced voice users are more likely to bond with ChatGPT

While text users generally showed more emotional signals in their conversations, the data revealed a trend among frequent users of ChatGPT's advanced voice mode. This small group developed significantly stronger emotional connections with the AI, more often referring to ChatGPT as a ""friend.""

The voice feature's effects varied significantly. Brief interactions seemed to make people feel better, but longer daily use often had the opposite effect. According to the study, personal conversations were associated with higher levels of loneliness but lower emotional dependency.

Non-personal conversations showed a different pattern: users developed stronger emotional dependency, especially with intensive use. This suggests that even when interactions are primarily functional rather than emotional, heavy users may still develop a form of dependence on the AI system.

Share Recommend our article Share

According to the researchers, people who tend to form strong emotional attachments and those who viewed ChatGPT as a real friend were more likely to experience negative effects. Heavy users also showed an increased risk, although the researchers couldn't prove a direct cause and effect.

The study comes with some important limitations. According to the researchers, it doesn't capture all the complexities of how humans interact with AI, and its limited to US ChatGPT users. Still, the researchers believe their methods could help guide future studies in this field.

This work adds to existing evidence that people can form emotional bonds with AI even when they know it's not human. That's partly why AI companies try to prevent their chatbots from acting like conscious beings - they want to avoid responsibility for romantic relationships between humans and machines. For instance, character.ai currently faces legal challenges over claims that its AI personalities have harmed children.

https://techmeme.com,Intel Shakes Up Leadership as 18A Manufacturing Node Nears Critical Launch,https://winbuzzer.com/2025/03/22/intel-shakes-up-leadership-as-18a-manufacturing-node-nears-critical-launch-xcxwbn/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Ann Kelleher, the executive who led Intel’s technology roadmap through the challenging transition beyond its troubled 7nm delays, will retire after 27 years with the company. Her departure, confirmed by Intel, coincides with the critical ramp-up of Intel’s advanced 18A manufacturing process node. Intel’s decision to divide her responsibilities highlights the urgency of addressing the company’s manufacturing and financial struggles.

Instead of a direct successor, Kelleher’s role will be split between two executives. Naga Chandrasekaran will oversee front-end process engineering, while Navid Shahriari takes charge of advanced packaging and testing operations. Kelleher will remain temporarily as an advisor to Intel Foundry Services (IFS), assisting the transition as Intel aggressively targets external foundry customers.

Lip-Bu Tan’s Strategic Vision Triggers Broad Changes

The leadership reshuffle aligns closely with the arrival of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, appointed on March 12, to guide Intel through severe financial turbulence. Intel reported its largest loss since 1986 in its detailed financial disclosure for 2024, totaling $18.8 billion, with $13.4 billion specifically tied to its struggling foundry division.

Tan, addressing Intel employees, openly acknowledged these challenges, stating: “We have a chance to do something special together. In many ways, we are the founders of ‘The New Intel.’ We will learn from past mistakes, use setbacks to strengthen our resolve, and choose action over distraction to reach our full potential.”

Central to Tan’s strategy is expanding Intel Foundry Services beyond internal clients. Recent reports confirm that major industry players Nvidia and Broadcom are currently testing Intel’s 18A manufacturing technology, a development that has boosted investor confidence, reflected by an 8% rise in Intel’s stock value.

However, potential partnerships carry complexity. Early speculation about a joint manufacturing venture involving TSMC and Nvidia has been clarified. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang explicitly stated that Nvidia has not been invited to participate in such discussions, diminishing expectations of an imminent joint venture with TSMC.

Ohio Factory Delay Adds to Manufacturing Pressure

Intel’s strategic shift coincides with setbacks in its ambitious U.S. manufacturing plans. Despite receiving a $7.86 billion CHIPS Act subsidy, Intel’s planned Ohio chip factory has been delayed until 2030, casting doubt on Intel’s commitment to reclaiming domestic semiconductor leadership. The delay heightens the stakes for Intel’s 18A node, now critical for demonstrating the company’s manufacturing competitiveness.

Alongside manufacturing changes, CEO Tan is refocusing Intel’s product roadmap on artificial intelligence. Intel recently cancelled its Falcon Shores GPU project, shifting instead to Jaguar Shores, a new AI-focused architecture expected to debut in 2027, according to a recent report by Tom’s Hardware.

Intel’s Gaudi accelerators continue to face modest market adoption compared to Nvidia’s GPUs. At CES 2025, Intel showcased its Core Ultra Series 2 processors, explicitly aimed at AI-intensive workloads. Yet ongoing stability issues, as evidenced by urgent firmware updates to Arrow Lake processors in December 2024, underscore Intel’s challenge in consistently meeting performance expectations.

Intel Bets on 18A Node to Regain Manufacturing Leadership

Intel’s 18A manufacturing process, currently undergoing initial wafer runs in its Arizona facility, incorporates two major innovations: RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery technology. RibbonFET provides significant efficiency and performance gains, while PowerVia allows better scalability and reduced power consumption, according to Intel’s official technical documentation.

The timing of Intel’s 18A production closely aligns with TSMC’s N2 process node, which enters high-volume production later in 2025. Intel’s early engagements with major clients like Nvidia and Broadcom could significantly enhance its competitive position if early tests prove successful. Nevertheless, analysts caution that real-world performance consistency remains critical for validating Intel’s ambitious plans.

With Kelleher’s retirement and the leadership transition underway, Intel’s recent strategic moves reflect a decisive response to its challenging financial situation and growing competition in both manufacturing and AI technologies. The execution of the 18A process node, closely watched by industry observers, will serve as a major test of CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s vision and Intel’s broader ability to regain its manufacturing prominence.",techmeme
https://theverge.com,"Fujifilm GFX100RF review: one sensor, nine cameras",https://theverge.com/reviews/633769/fuji-gfx-100rf-review-medium-format-compact-camera,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","When Apple introduced the iPhone 15 Pro, Greg Joswiak, the company’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said the device’s three rear cameras would give consumers “the equivalent of seven camera lenses in their pocket.”

We could spend multiple podcasts debating the technical validity of that statement, but what Joswiak was trying to imply was that the iPhone now had sensors with a resolution that was big and high enough that it could crop in to emulate various focal lengths.

Now, Fujifilm is trying the same thing.

With a 35mm lens stuck to a body shockingly similar to the super-popular X100VI, it would be easy to assume Fuji’s new GFX100RF is the company’s attempt to take a winning strategy and scale it up to medium format.

But while most fixed-lens cameras like the X100VI create intentional limitations and encourage you to shoot more than you think, the GFX100RF is all about flexibility and intentionality. Using its high-resolution 102MP sensor, an all-new aspect ratio dial and four different digital “zoom” modes, Fujifilm aims to replace nine cameras and four lenses with one relatively compact body.

Fujifilm’s GFX100RF is the company’s most compact medium-format camera yet. Housing the same sensor as its flagship GFX100II, the $4,900 camera is hugely capable, delivering the same delightful physical controls and rich colors the brand is known for. There’s a reason people love shooting with Fujifilm cameras, and if you’re looking for more of that experience, the GFX100RF won’t let you down.

The new twist this camera adds to the formula is its aspect ratio dial. This physical dial, mounted to the back of the camera, lets you pick from one of nine different formats to frame your image. As someone who still shoots a lot of old film cameras, it had me geeking out big time. Particularly, because the aspect ratios the camera offers are based on real film cameras Fujifilm manufactured decades ago. It’s a very fun throwback. You can choose between 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, 17:6, 3:4, 1:1, 7:6, 5:4, and, my favorite, 65:24 — an homage to Fujifilm’s legendary TX-1 panoramic camera.

Taken on the GFX 100RF.

Because Fujifilm didn’t include the hybrid optical viewfinder like you’ll see in the X100VI and X-Pro3, it included three different view modes for composing with those aspect ratios instead. You can see the full scene with frame lines, a 50% opacity mode that lets you see what’s outside your frame, or a full blackout mode that only shows the crop you’re shooting.

After testing this camera for about a month, I’ve started to wonder why every camera doesn’t have a dial like this. Carrying the camera around Utah, it was a ton of fun to jump around different ratios while composing a photo, and in multiple circumstances, an image that I’d only considered ‘good’ in the full 4:3 mode was upgraded to ‘great’ once I found the right crop for it.

Now obviously, when you crop out a large portion of an image, you’re also cropping a decent amount of resolution. But even when using the most-cropped 65x24 ratio, you’re still left with a large 50MP file. And if you shoot RAW in addition to JPG and you edit in Adobe Lightroom, RAW files will be ingested pre-cropped with the option to zoom out to the full 4:3 image. I love that.

The super-high resolution of the sensor has another benefit, though. The GFX100RF offers four virtual focal lengths, which crop into the center of the sensor to deliver a different field of view. The camera offers 35mm, 45mm, 63mm, and 80mm options, which equate to about 28mm, 35mm, 50mm and 63mm in full-frame terms. These “zoom” modes will also cost you resolution too, though, with the full 80mm focal length cropped to 65x24 spitting out a 9MP image.

To make zooming in simple, Fujifilm added a small switch to the front of the camera similar to what you’d see on an old camcorder. And right above that, you’ll find a remappable knurled dial, which strangely wasn’t mapped to anything out of the box on my unit.

It feels like Fujifilm built this camera to do it all, and in a lot of ways, it defies expectations of what a fixed-lens camera is built to do. But unfortunately, the GFX100RF is also limited in two key ways: a relatively slow f/4 aperture and a lack of optical image stabilization.

Taken on the GFX 100RF.

An f/4 aperture on Fujifilm’s medium format sensor equates to about f/3.16 on a full-frame camera, and while that isn’t horrible by any means, it felt limiting in my time with it. A slower aperture means less light on the sensor, and less light means pushing up the ISO or pulling down the shutter speed. On a camera like the Fujifilm X100VI with optical image stabilization, I could comfortably drop the shutter speed down to a full second hand-held. But on the GFX100RF, the slowest I could comfortably shoot handheld without getting a shaky image was 1/30 — maybe 15th if I was especially steady.

As someone who carries around a tripod nearly every time I go take photos, this wasn’t a huge deal for me. But Fujifillm is positioning this camera as the best everyday camera on the market, and without a faster lens or optical image stabilization, you might have trouble shooting with this camera once the light gets low, unless you use uncomfortably high ISO values. When I had to shoot in lower light, I often switched to Fuji’s excellent Acros black and white simulation, which is made to look quite grainy anyway.

It’s understandable why Fujifilm may not have added optical image stabilization to this camera. The 100RF is only marginally bigger than the Fujifilm X100VI, so it may not have developed a stabilization system compact enough for the body yet. And at $4,899, which is still quite expensive, this camera comes in cheaper than any other GFX body Fujifilm currently sells. Plus, this one includes a lens.

But what perplexes me the most about the camera is the decision to use an f/4 aperture. Taken alone, the lens is shockingly small — smaller than every dedicated GF lens that Fujifilm sells by a long shot. But Fuji also includes a lens hood and filter adapter ring in the box, and, added together, these accessories just about triple the overall footprint of the lens to the point where it’s about as big as the lens on the Leica Q3. And at that point, why not just make a bigger, faster lens?

There’s no doubt the GFX100RF will be consistently compared to Leica’s full-frame Q3 — primarily because, until recently, if you wanted an even remotely new fixed-lens camera with a large sensor, the Q3 was pretty much your only option. And while Fujifilm has Leica beat with its new versatile aspect ratio dial and ultra-high resolution, Leica trades those features for a much faster f/1.7 lens and optical image stabilization. Which features matter to you is probably going to depend on what kind of photographer you are. And, at the very least, I’m glad there’s finally another option available on the market.

I really loved my time with this camera. Composing nearly every aspect of your final image in-camera is a real joy, and I have a soft spot in my heart for physical dials. But for a camera that aspires to do it all with one lens, you’re going to need a tripod to make that a reality.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Photo Mode is my new gaming obsession,https://theverge.com/games/634125/assassins-creed-shadows-photo-mode-infinity-nikki,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Infinity Nikki and Assassin’s Creed Shadows have become my twin obsessions for their meticulously detailed environments, textures, and weather. With open-world dress-up game Infinity Nikki, I continue to be agog at how clothing textures are rendered with such detail and fidelity that by mere sight, I know exactly what a piece of fabric will feel like. For Assassin’s Creed Shadows, an action-packed romp through feudal Japan, I’m constantly in a state of awe at the natural beauty of the Japanese countryside, a feature that has been widely celebrated since its release. Both games are so visually arresting they made me fall in love with a video game staple that I’ve never really cared about before: photo mode.

Photo mode, which typically pauses the game to give players the ability to take professional grade images of their video games, is a modern gaming feature that’s been around long enough to become a standard inclusion, especially in AAA games. But I’ve never seen their appeal. It’s a video game, not some fleeting life moment. I’m not gonna fondly flip through my PS5 media gallery in five years going, “Aww look at the time Yasuke chopped the arms and head off that guy,” like I’m looking at my grandkids’ baby photos. I definitely appreciate the skill with which others have made the most out of photo modes — like what my friend does with Overwatch — but it was always something I ignored.

I’ve played no shortage of games so interesting their moments demand to be captured and shared but that compulsion is on another level with Infinity Nikki and Assassin’s Creed. So, starting with the dress up game, I opened photo mode, started fiddling around with apertures and vignettes and was genuinely surprised with the results. The photos looked good! The photos weren’t Vogue quality, but they started to resemble the pictures that get upvoted to the moon on the Infinity Nikki subreddit. Even though I don’t really care to post my own photos there, it’s thrilling enough to know I’m developing a talent for something I didn’t know was in me to begin with.

I took that success with Infinity Nikki and translated it to Assassin’s Creed. I’m actually glad the game doesn’t have the feature from the last Assassin’s Creed where your horse automatically follows the road. Without it, I am forced to take in the game’s impressive weather and foliage as I drive ole’ Kikai around rather than looking at my phone after setting him on auto-pilot. That’s how I found my first picture. I was roaming around as Yasuke and I rode by a long road flanked by Japanese maples in full, deep-red autumn foliage. (At least I think they’re Japanese maples. The codex could stand a few more flora and fauna entries, Ubisoft.) The colors were so vibrant and the sound of the wind through the leaves was so invigorating, I felt I had to preserve the moment despite none of it being real. The urge was strong enough that it completely changed my feelings about photo mode altogether.

I saw that entirely fake scenery made of pixels and code and immediately opened up photo mode as though I was capturing real natural phenomena. I placed the camera behind him and zoomed out to see as much foliage as I could fit into the shot, while still keeping Yasuke as the focus of the picture. I then tinkered with the lighting to brighten the leaves and the saturation so their colors would pop. I wanted it to look like a shot Akira Kurosawa could have composed for one of his samurai epics — a kind of thought I’ve never had while taking pictures in real life or in games. This moment completely changed my perspective on video game photography. What once seemed like a cool party trick now felt like a real avenue of creative expression.

Putting the photo modes in Nikki and Shadows through their paces, I’ve discovered game photography is now something I can really, earnestly do, and want to do more of. I hope to get better at it so I can one day take those skills from capturing video games to capturing real life.",theverge

MOTION PHOTOS

In the article about the WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.24.9 update, we announced that a new gallery interface for sending photo and video albums was available. This feature allows users to select multiple media items simultaneously without the need to go through the drawing editor first, and they can also add captions to entire albums instead of being limited to individual photos or videos. Additionally, WhatsApp has enhanced the way shared media appears in chat by automatically grouping media items into an album within a single message bubble, even when fewer than four items are included. It seems that WhatsApp is developing additional sharing tools, primarily focused on enhancing the photo-sharing experience further. Thanks to the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.25.8.12 update, which is available on the Google Play Store, we discovered that WhatsApp is working on a feature to share motion photos in chats, groups, and channels!





As you can see from the attached screenshot, WhatsApp is exploring the implementation of a feature that will allow users to share motion photos, scheduled for release in a future update. Motion photos are a type of media format that captures a brief moment of movement before and after a photo is taken. Unlike traditional images, motion photos include a few seconds of video and audio, providing an immersive way to capture memories. This feature is particularly popular on certain mobile devices, as it bridges the gap between photos and videos by adding a touch of animation to snapshots.

Motion photos are commonly available on devices like Samsung Galaxy smartphones, where the feature is called Motion Photo, and Google Pixel devices, which often refer to it as Top Shot or Motion Photos. Apple also offers a similar feature called Live Photos on iPhones, which captures a few seconds of video along with each still photo, and its support is already available on WhatsApp for iOS. These motion photos are often saved in specialized formats that combine static images with short video clips, allowing users to relive moments with a single tap.

WhatsApp's upcoming support for motion photos aims to expand the media-sharing capabilities of the app. When users attempt to open the gallery sheet, they can expect to see a new button specifically for motion photos. This button will give users the option to choose between sending the static image or the motion photo version, if available, offering greater flexibility depending on the context. The feature will be particularly useful for capturing moments where subtle movements or reactions are essential to the memory, as it allows users to share not only a still image but also the dynamic essence of the moment.

While the motion photo-sharing feature is still in development, it is expected to be compatible with both individual and group chats, as well as channels. This means users will be able to share motion photos with friends, family, and followers without losing the dynamic essence of their captured moments. Additionally, recipients will automatically view the motion photo in its animated form, even if the feature is not supported on their device. For iOS users, these motion photos will likely appear as Live Photos, allowing them to enjoy the full effect of the captured movement and sound, just as they would with any other Live Photo on their device.

A feature to share motion photos in chats, groups, and channels is under development and it will be available in a future update. We will keep you updated with an additional article as soon as we have more details to share about this feature.

https://theverge.com,Cloudflare is luring web-scraping bots into an ‘AI Labyrinth’,https://theverge.com/news/634345/cloudflare-ai-labyrinth-web-scraping-bots-training-data,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 18:17:38 GMT","is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

Cloudflare, one of the biggest network internet infrastructure companies in the world, has announced AI Labyrinth, a new tool to fight web-crawling bots that scrape sites for AI training data without permission. The company says in a blog post that when it detects “inappropriate bot behavior,” the free, opt-in tool lures crawlers down a path of links to AI-generated decoy pages that “slow down, confuse, and waste the resources” of those acting in bad faith.

Websites have long used the honor system approach of robots.txt, a text file that gives or denies permission to scrapers, but which AI companies, even well-known ones like Anthropic and Perplexity AI, have been accused of ignoring. Cloudflare writes that it sees over 50 billion web crawler requests per day, and although it has tools for spotting and blocking the malicious ones, this often prompts attackers to switch tactics in “a never-ending arms race.”

Cloudflare says rather than block bots, AI Labyrinth fights back by making them process data that has nothing to do with a given website’s actual data. The company says it also functions as “a next-generation honeypot,” drawing in AI crawlers that keep following links to fake pages deeper, whereas a regular human being wouldn’t. It says this makes it easier to fingerprint malicious bots for Cloudflare’s list of bad actors as well as identify “new bot patterns and signatures” it wouldn’t have detected otherwise. According to the post, these links shouldn’t be visible to human visitors.

You can read more about how AI Labyrinth works on Cloudflare’s blog, but here’s a bit more detail from the post:

We found that generating a diverse set of topics first, then creating content for each topic, produced more varied and convincing results. It is important to us that we don’t generate inaccurate content that contributes to the spread of misinformation on the Internet, so the content we generate is real and related to scientific facts, just not relevant or proprietary to the site being crawled.

Website administrators can opt into using AI Labyrinth by navigating to the Bot Management section of their site’s Cloudflare dashboard’s settings and toggling it on. The company says that this “is only the first iteration of using generative AI to thwart bots.” It plans to create “whole networks of linked URLs” that bots that end up in will have a hard time clocking as fake. As Ars Technica notes, AI Labyrinth sounds similar to Nepenthes, a tool that’s designed to sideline crawlers for “months” in a hell of AI-generated junk data.",theverge

https://theverge.com,7 cool indie games from GDC 2025,https://theverge.com/games/633885/gdc-2025-best-indie-games,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","The Game Developers Conference, an annual gathering that brings thousands of game developers to San Francisco, has just wrapped up. While most of the event is about networking and interesting talks about game design and technology, there were also a bunch of unreleased indie games that we got to check out. Yes, much of video games in 2025 will probably be defined by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Grand Theft Auto VI. But based on the games we played, there might be some really fun smaller titles that could be huge hits this year, too.

Here are a few of our favorites that we’re looking forward to.

Dreams of Another

Dreams of Another is a shooter, but you use your gun to create the world around you instead of destroying it. The game’s graphics have a dreamy, deconstructed quality to them, and when you shoot things, the colorful, unfocused scenes you see will solidify into things like buildings and people. Unexpectedly, my brief demo ended with a more traditional shootout against a sentient manhole cover. (I even lobbed a couple grenades to try and destroy it.) But I’m intrigued by the overall concept, and I look forward to seeing what developer Q-Games does with it in the final version of the game.—JP

Faraway

In Faraway, you play as a shooting star and try to make constellations. The game requires just pressing and holding one button to spin around other stars, create a trail, and essentially play a celestial game of connect the dots. It’s a simple concept, but I was impressed by it immediately. In just a 10-minute demo, I was really starting to get the hang of using my shooting star’s momentum to perfectly swing around a star to make elaborate and high-scoring constellations. That’s all the time it took to make Faraway far and away my favorite game of the show.—JP

Haste: Broken Worlds

Haste: Broken Worlds is kind of like a 3D version of the classic mobile game Tiny Wings. You play as Zoe, a girl who runs forward at blinding speed through procedurally generated levels. Like with Tiny Wings, there are rolling hills you can launch from for added height, and if you time your fall right into the curve of another hill, you’ll get a satisfying “perfect” message and a boost to a meter that lets you pull out a hoverboard. The game has a roguelike structure, so you’ll get to pick and choose different types of levels to tackle as you make your way through a run. On the show floor, I was awful, dying within the first few levels before I had to hand the controller to the next person in line. But as soon as I got back to my hotel room, I downloaded the game’s free demo on Steam.—JP

Herdling

Herdling tasks you with herding mysterious, fluffy beasts. In my demo, the character starts in a dark city before quickly coming upon three adorable beasts that reminded me of a big goat mixed with Sesame Street’s Mr. Snuffleupagus. Your goal is to get them out of the city and out to wilder pastures. You coax the animals forward from behind with a magic stick, and while they generally follow your directions, they are sometimes difficult to direct. More than once, my herd of three walked right into a wall. By the end of the demo, however, I really started to care for my fluffy friends, especially since you can name them — though I can only imagine the cruel ways the developers will pull on my heartstrings over the course of the full adventure.—JP

Hotel Barcelona

This is sort of the video game equivalent of a supergroup. Goichi “Suda51” Suda (best known for off-kilter games like Killer 7 and No More Heroes) has teamed up with Hidetaka “Swery65” Suehiro (the writer and director behind Deadly Premonition and, more recently, The Good Life) on an extremely challenging and roguelike game set in a world inspired by slasher movies. In the short time I had with the game, I died multiple times, but the twitchy action felt very satisfying, especially once I got the hang of the controls. There’s a neat feature where you can fight alongside a ghost image of your previous run, which seems like it will come in handy. What I didn’t get to experience was the inevitable surreal twist the two creators have put on the horror setting, but the core is solid.—AW

My Arms Are Longer Now

Slapstick comedy games are really coming into their own of late. And if you loved Untitled Goose Game or Thank Goodness You’re Here, this is definitely one to keep an eye on. The name really says it all: you control an unseemly long and stretchy arm and attempt to... do things, most of which are illegal. The level I played took place on a moving train, and you were tasked with stealing items from passengers while remaining undetected (probably because of how terrifying the arm is). There’s a puzzle element to it; at one point, I needed to take a briefcase from a sleeping businessman, only to find it was chained to his wrist. It’s absurd, of course, but that’s exactly the appeal.—AW

To a T

To a T is a delightful game about a teenager permanently stuck in a T pose. The game is from Katamari series creator Keita Takahashi, so, of course, it’s wacky and silly. My demo featured an elaborate tooth-brushing sequence, musical numbers, and a talking giraffe. But the demo also hinted at the character’s fear of school and bullying over their T-pose condition. I was surprised how much that made me care for the character, and if the story sticks the landing, it could make a game that might have been pure silliness something more thoughtful. It’s out on May 28th.—JP",theverge

You aren't going to die from any of these conditions, but it's still hard to focus when, say, the back of your right foot is rubbing a new blister against the inside of your not-quite-broken-in-yet hiking boots.

I found myself in the computing version of this situation yesterday, when I was trying to work on a new Mac Mini and was brought up short by the fact that my third mouse button (that is, clicking on the scroll wheel) did nothing. This was odd, because I have for many years assigned this button to ""Mission Control"" on macOS—a feature that tiles every open window on your machine, making it quick and easy to switch apps. When I got the new Mini, I immediately added this to my settings. Boom!

And yet there I was, a couple hours later, clicking the middle mouse button by reflex and getting no result. This seemed quite odd—had I only imagined that I made the settings change? I made the alteration again in System Settings and went back to work.

But after a reboot later that day to install an OS update, I found that my shortcut setting for Mission Control had once again been wiped away. This wasn't happening with any other settings changes, and it was strangely vexing.

When it happened a third time, I switched into full ""research and destroy the problem"" mode. One of my Ars colleagues commiserated with me, writing, ""This kind of powerful-annoying stuff is just so common. I swear at least once every few months, some shortcut or whatever just stops working, and sometimes, after a week or so, it starts working again. No rhyme, reason, or apparent causality except that computers are just [unprintable expletives].""

But even if computers are [unprintable expletives], their problems have often been encountered and fixed by some other poor soul. So I turned to the Internet for help... and immediately stumbled upon an Apple discussion thread called ""MacOS mouse shortcuts are reset upon restart or shutdown."" The poster—and most of those replying—said that the odd behavior had only appeared in macOS Sequoia. One reply claimed to have identified the source of the bug and offered a fix:",arstechnica
https://gizmodo.com,National Park Summer Bookings Down Amid DOGE-Fueled Turmoil,https://gizmodo.com/national-park-summer-bookings-down-amid-doge-fueled-turmoil-2000579301,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:00:52 GMT","After recent years of overcrowding, this summer might be a good time to visit your favorite national park, and you can thank Elon Musk and Big Balls for that. Tourist reservations at key hot spots around the United States have reportedly fallen off amid turmoil in the National Park Service, which was recently hit by DOGE-fueled layoffs of more than 1,000 staff. The cuts have been temporarily rolled back following legal challenges, but uncertainty remains.

Business Insider spoke with park advocates and business owners around the country, and the conclusion is that the public is taking a wait-and-see approach to the upcoming summer season. One hotelier near Yosemite told the website that his three resorts are down 1,000 bookings over last year. On the east coast, near the Cape Cod National Seashore, hotel reservations are reportedly down approximately 5% for the peak season. The typical booking season runs from January through March.

It is possible some of this has to do with broader economic uncertainty, but Business Insider identified other more direct reasons.

One of the biggest concerns cited that could be keeping people away is the NPS’s decision to suspend its reservation system, which required visitors to book a set time and day they could visit the park. “Knowing whether there would be a reservation system or not has made it difficult for people to plan trips — why book a hotel room when you can’t be certain you’ll even be able to get into the park on the days you’re there?” NPS has not said whether it will bring back the reservation system for the fast-approaching summer season.

There has also been a notable drop in interest from Canadians, according to airline travel data. Niedzwiecki, from the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, told Business Insider he has heard from recurring Canadian visitors who are “very direct” about not wanting to visit this year over the soured state of relations with the U.S.

If tourists do manage to get into the parks, potential understaffing could result in a noticeable impact on park visitors’ experience: Visitor centers staffed by volunteers or non-profits; smaller parks being closed on weekdays; long waits at entrance stations; trails not being maintained, and so on and so forth. It depends on whether President Trump can move forward with cuts.

It is unclear what the logic is behind cutting back on staffing in national parks, which amount to roughly 85 million acres of wild terrain across the country that requires substantial physical labor to maintain. Those staffers also collect entry fees to help fund nature preservation. In the same way that DOGE wants to discontinue Social Security phone support and push seniors to the website, maybe Tesla will get a contract to staff up the parks with Optimus robots.

At least in some places like Yosemite, experts do not think there is much to worry about, at least for this upcoming season. The park typically has roughly 800 full-time and seasonal staff during the summer, which was initially cut down by 35 in complying with DOGE’s directive to cut costs across the entire federal government through firings and deferred resignations. There was also a hiring freeze which would have impacted the seasonal workers the parks rely on, but the NPS says those hirings will go forward.

The NPS is working to reinstate the 1,000 probationary employees who were let go while the White House appeals a federal judge order, but the losses from deferred resignations are unlikely to return.

The drop in summer bookings seems to be having the biggest impact on local communities that rely on the parks to support small businesses. Right now, gear rental outfitters and other businesses are struggling to ascertain how many workers to hire, which could depend a lot on the next moves by the Trump administration.

Ultimately none of this may even matter to President Trump, who earlier this week announced a plan to use federal lands for new housing. He has also stated in the ongoing trade dispute with Canada that the U.S. does not need lumber from up north. Who knows, maybe the administration will be strip mining for coal and drilling for oil by Memorial Day. Or perhaps the plan is to knock down a lot of forest land in Yosemite and build a new Trump resort property.

For now, things are alright. Just keep in mind that if you do decide to take the chance and plan a trip to a national park, there is a 50-50 chance the toilets will be overflowing and trash will be littered everywhere.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Test Subjects for Bryan Johnson’s Anti-Aging Program Said It Made Them Feel Sick: Report,https://gizmodo.com/test-subjects-for-bryan-johnsons-anti-aging-program-said-it-made-them-feel-sick-report-2000579299,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:30:27 GMT","A new report from the New York Times claims that the so-called “Longevity Mix” sold by Bryan Johnson, the anti-aging tech guru, has caused some users to report unwanted side-effects. Johnson, who runs Blueprint, a dietary supplement company, has been pushing its mixes as a way to stay healthy and live longer. According to the new report, however, many users reported that the supplements made them feel like they were going to hurl.

The newspaper article’s main focus is Johnson’s use of confidentiality agreements which, the Times writes, have been leveraged against employees and social contacts alike:

For nearly a decade, Mr. Johnson has wielded confidentiality agreements to control his image and the companies he built atop that image. His employees, sexual partners, vendors and contract workers have all had to sign the documents, sometimes in exchange for settlements, severance or continued employment at his firms, according to people close to him and his start-ups, internal documents and court records.

The newspaper writes that three former employees have recently filed National Labor Relations Board complaints about Johnson’s confidentiality agreements, accusing the entrepreneur of forcing them to sign agreements that were “overbroad” and, in so doing, breaking federal laws that allow workers to publicly discuss workplace conditions.

While probing Johnson’s company, however, the Times was also able to get its hands on information concerning an internal study conducted by Blueprint. The study looked at the impact that its dietary mixes had on users. Apparently, that impact wasn’t very good, in some cases:

Of the roughly 1,700 participants in the study, about 60 percent experienced at least one side effect, according to internal emails, spreadsheets and other documents. Blood tests revealed that participants saw their testosterone levels drop and became prediabetic after following Mr. Johnson’s diet plan. It’s unclear how severe the side effects were. “Longevity mix: A lot of comments about hating this as it is making them sick, vomit, have heartburn, etc.,” one Blueprint employee wrote to a colleague in February 2024. Allulose, an ingredient in the longevity mix and a sugar alternative that Mr. Johnson has pitched to his social media followers, also caused issues. “TONS of people saying it’s causing nausea, bloating,” wrote an employee.

“The New York Times tried to come for me and missed,” Johnson wrote on X on Friday. “What was meant to be a takedown ended up reading like a profile piece,” he went on, claiming that the paper “came up empty” and that it was only by “contorting and twisting facts to fit a narrative that they barely had enough to publish.”

Gizmodo reached out to Blueprint for comment, though the company says its typical response time is 1-2 business days. We also reached out to the NLRB. In an email to the Times, Johnson reportedly said that the results of the study showed “common side effects with any food, beverage or supplement.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,NYU Website Hacked to Display Racist Garbage,https://gizmodo.com/nyu-website-hacked-to-display-racist-garbage-2000579510,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:30:11 GMT","Higher education is already under assault by the Trump administration, but New York University got hit by a slightly different kind of attack. The university’s website fell victim to an apparent hack on Saturday morning, which resulted in the homepage being defaced for several hours and used to display racial slurs and graphs that purported to show test scores of students broken down by race.

The hack was apparently carried out by a person who identifies themselves on X as a racial slur—a thing that it just allowed on that platform now, by the way—with the handle (censored here) “@bestn*ggy.” The hacker hijacked the university’s homepage and displayed the message, “On June 29 2023, racial affirmative action in college admissions was ruled illegal. Computer N*ggy Exploitation (CNE) reveals NYU continued anyway.”

That message was followed by a graph purporting to show the average SAT scores, ACT scores, and grade point average of NYU applicants who were admitted into the university, broken down by race. The hacker also published links to mirrors of the supposed data they gained access to in order to display the scores, identified by the hacker as “raw data” with personally identifiable information redacted.

On X, the hacker claimed that the data was “literally just raw data from NYU’s own data warehouse” and that they “only posted (redacted) bare minimum to prove they’re breaking the law.” The hacker also claimed responsibility for a breach of the University of Minnesota back in 2023 that reportedly exposed millions of social security numbers.

The apparent claim being put forth by the hacker and their racist edgelord persona is that NYU is admitting college students based in some way on race. The theory being that some students would not be admitted if they were being judged based solely on their test scores and GPA. That has been picked up by the worst accounts you know on X, who have run with the data to suggest NYU has been giving preference to students based on race.

Of course, the data doesn’t prove that at all. NYU is a test-optional school, so the people who submit test results in the first place are self-selecting—they’re going to submit a score if they think it might help them. Likewise, the scores can’t account for the wealth disparity that plagues standardized testing, as the children of wealthy people significantly outperform students from lower-income households, in no small part due to the resources available to them.

(That’s kinda the whole idea with diversity, equity, and inclusion programs that people like this hacker seem so offended by—there are extremely capable people from all backgrounds who often simply do not have the same opportunities as others and end up overlooked.)

Anyway, NYU posts its own data on incoming classes, and it indicated that it saw a decline in historically underrepresented minority groups for the class of 2028 following the Supreme Court’s decision to end affirmative action within college admissions.

All of that to say, the hacker and the people who have picked up on his data are ardent lovers of the rule of law. They’re mostly just racists who want to punish universities, possibly galvanized by the Trump administration’s own crackdown on higher education institutions.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Netflix’s Live-Action One Piece Loses Its Co-Showrunner,https://gizmodo.com/netflixs-live-action-one-piece-loses-its-co-showrunner-2000579397,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:15:20 GMT","Matt Owens, co-showrunner and executive producer for seasons one and two of Netflix’s One Piece, has revealed he’s stepping away from the show.

On Instagram, Owens explained “the last six years working on the live-action One Piece have been a life-changing journey, and a dream come true. It’s also been a LOT. So I’m stepping off the Going Merry to take a break and focus on myself and my mental health. Thank you so much to [creator Eiichiro] Oda, Shueisha, Tomorrow Studios, Netflix, and the entire cast and crew for your trust, partnership, and hard work.”

As Deadline notes, One Piece‘s first season was co-showrun by Steven Maeda and Owens. While Maeda remains an executive producer, he departed his showrunning post after season one. Joe Tracz became the new co-showrunner and as well as an EP in April 2024. Tracz is remaining with the series and will guide season two’s post-production. The trade notes that One Piece “wrapped production on season two last month.”

Owens’ exit will reportedly not affect the show’s chances of being renewed for a third season, and he’s co-written at least one episode for season two. And his influence will seemingly still be felt moving forward; during his time on One Piece, he helped shape “the creative vision” for the series, Deadline writes, “including its long-term blueprint for future seasons.”

Earlier in March, One Piece’s first season won two Emmys for stunt coordination and best song in a kids/YA program (“My Sails Are Set”). Last year, Netflix announced several actors for key season two roles, including Lera Abova as Nico Robin and Joe Manganiello as Mr. 0. The season currently doesn’t have a release window.",gizmodo

Deku and the rest of Japan’s hero community have been at war against Shigaraki, All for One, and the other villains under their command, and last season ended with big shakeups on both sides, with several key players in the war either dead or out of commission.

The My Hero Academia manga ended in 2024 after 430 chapters and an epilogue that December. Creator Kohei Horikoshi hasn’t said anything about his next project since putting a bow on the superhero series, but he has drawn plenty of great art for its characters in the past year.

Before the main anime ends, fans can get their fix in the upcoming spinoff, Vigilantes. That show, set five years before Deku’s story, focuses on non-licensed heroes saving their city and crossing paths with young versions of supporting characters like Mirko and Eraserhead.

https://gizmodo.com,Ain’t No God Like God of War,https://gizmodo.com/aint-no-god-like-god-of-war-2000577804,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 18:05:39 GMT","The PlayStation 2 is one of the most important game consoles, because it’s where the current triple-A landscape was born. Third-party giants like Resident Evil and Monster Hunter took shape here, and the console’s first-party lineup made its creators into A-tier names.

Look no further than the original God of War, which just turned 20 years old. Sony Santa Monica’s hack-and-slash title was pretty impressive back in the day, helped by an alluring demo that dropped players into the action right away and showed them what it was all about: slinging blades, killing everything in sight, and finishing off mythological creatures in increasingly gruesome ways. By that point in the PS2’s lifetime, the console’s big action game was Devil May Cry, and while there was some overlap in terms of style and ridiculousness, Kratos’ adventure appealed to a different (but maybe equally juvenile) audience.

So players fell in love with God of War, and thus a franchise was born. Sony Santa Monica has led the charge on mainline installments like God of War III—which turned 15 earlier in March—or the more recent Norse duology, while the late Ready at Dawn made spinoffs like Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta, which built out Kratos’ life before and between the first two games. Despite a generally consistent quality, it eventually felt like the two studios were trying to milk the franchise for all it was worth. (And if that didn’t tip you off, the failed go at a movie adaptation would’ve done it.) By the time 2013’s Ascension rolled around, Kratos didn’t seem to have any more gas in the tank, despite III’s ending indicating he could (and would) come back to kill again.

And come back he did with 2018’s God of War, a soft reboot that saw Kratos with a son, a wicked axe, and a new pantheon to brutalize, as well as plenty of opportunities to reflect on his past sins and the murderous adventures that made up his Greek era. Given everything Kratos did and killed during those earlier games—God of War III is basically a disaster epic brought on by a slasher villain—it couldn’t help be a strange ask to buy into him not just having another kid, but wanting better for the young Atreus during their trek through Midgard to scatter his late wife’s ashes. But the approach resonated with fans and newcomers, largely thanks to the lead performances of Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic.

Throughout its 20-year life, God of War has been defined by its eye for spectacle. The series has always painted Kratos as a force of nature whose presence inevitably devastates everything around him. For as much time PlayStation’s first-party lineup has devoted to cinematic greatness, this particular series achieves that feat more often (and with more fun) than most. From fights against titans and dragons, to one-on-one brawls against gods that play out like the love child of shonen fights and wrestling matches, the series is packed with one moment after another that makes experiencing them a complete blast. Other action games have tried to match that scale or combat of Kratos’ adventures, and generally do a good job at it—Bayonetta, Darksiders, and Dante’s Inferno all came out just months before God of War III—but as with anything that’s been around long enough, Sony Santa Monica’s formula hits a particular sweet spot that’s allowed the franchise to survive more console generations than its other PS2 peers.

With a TV adaptation in the works and other mythologies clearly up for grabs, God of War certainly isn’t lacking for a future. The prospect of Kratos fighting every mythology in sight has been desired for a long time, so it’s easy to imagine Sony Santa Monica just doing that, not entirely unlike Assassin’s Creed or Call of Duty. (Just without the reliable frequency, since making the Norse games sounds like quite an endeavor.) Alternatively, it’d be nice to see the studio put what it’s learned from this franchise toward something new. Like Naughty Dog or Insomniac, it’s been such a reliable contributor to PlayStation’s ongoing success it could afford to shelve Kratos for a few years. That appears to be the case, according to a former developer’s 2024 LinkedIn post, so here’s hoping that’s also successful in its own way—and when it comes time for Kratos to return, it feels as big a deal it did when the reboot was first revealed.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,‘Free Speech’ Platfrom X Suspends Opposition Party Accounts in Turkey,https://gizmodo.com/free-speech-platfrom-x-suspends-opposition-party-accounts-in-turkey-2000579502,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:30:07 GMT","Elon Musk purchased Twitter (and then renamed it X) with the promise that it would be a free speech paradise. It turns out in practice, that means you can say your favorite slurs but can’t protest government overreach. Following the arrest of the primary political rival of Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdoğan, demonstrators have taken to the streets and to social media to protest the seemingly politically motivated action. According to Politico, some of those who have taken to speaking out against the government have been suspended on X.

Per Politico’s reporting, “university-associated activist accounts” that share protest information including times and locations for students and other activists who might want to participate have been the primary targets of the suspensions. Most of the accounts are described as “grassroots activists” with relatively small followings, typically in the tens of thousands.

In some cases, it seems those accounts have been suspended in Turkey—where their information is most relevant—and not in the rest of the world. One activist, Ömer Faruk Aslan, created a second account to dodge the local censorship, and claimed that his primary account got suspended after one of his posts exceeded six million views on the platform.

Turkey’s ruling government, led by Erdoğan—has claimed that suspended accounts are associated with “inciting hatred.” (It’s worth noting that the public demonstrations against the Erdoğan have taken place the government issuing a multi-day ban on protests.) Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya claimed authorities have identified 326 accounts for takedown, including 72 that are believed to be operated outside of Turkey. He also said that 54 “suspects” have been arrested for their activity on social media.

Turkey’s crackdown on activists is not necessarily on Musk or X (though we don’t know if the company surrendered any user data to the government). But the crackdown on content on platform, the company certainly has a hand in. In fact, it’s been pretty willing to bend to the will of Erdoğan’s government when asked.

Back in 2023, as Turkey was about to have a Presidential election, Erdoğan threatened to throttle X if the company didn’t comply with government requests to take down posts and accounts that it wanted removed. Musk and X acquiesced, with Musk reasoning, “The choice is have Twitter throttled in its entirety or limit access to some tweets. Which one do you want?” (The answer to that, if you are a “free speech absolutist,” is likely the former, refuse to give in to a censorship demand and let the chips fall where they may.) Additionally, X has complied with 86% of Turkey’s government requests to take down content in the second half of 2024, per the company’s transparency report.

The math isn’t too hard for Erdoğan. Ask and you will likely receive.",gizmodo

Since this weekend is AnimeJapan, the streamer pulled back the curtain on what it’s offering for spring and summer, which includes some returning favorites and fresh new works. Let’s dive in, shall we?

Devil May Cry

Studio Mir’s adaptation of the hit Capcom franchise premieres in a few weeks, and Netflix revealed more information about its voice cast. For the show’s Japanese dub, the roles of Dante, Lady, and Vergil will be Toshiyuki Morikawa, Fumiko Orikasa, and Hiroaki Hirata—the same actors from the games. Additionally, rock band Evanescence is working on a song for the series, so you can expect to hear them when the show premieres on April 3. Check out a new clip below.

Sakamoto Days

Sakamoto Days started airing in January, and its first half just ended today! Its second half will begin in July, and will introduce Gaku, a key member of X’s organization voiced by Koki Uchiyama in the Japanese dub. At the moment, there’s no word on if the anime will be renewed for a second season.

Moonrise

This one’s started getting a push by Netflix in recent weeks ahead of its release on April 10. Developed by WIT Studio (Spy x Family) with designs by Fullmetal Alchemist’s Hiromu Arakawa and written by Tow Ubukata (Fafner in the Azure), Moonrise is set in a near-future where an AI called Sapienta has created a program that sends Earth’s criminals to the Moon, which has since become a warzone and home to a rebel army. After losing his family to a terrorist attack, Jacob Shadow joins Earth’s army to scout the Moon and bring down the resistance leader.

The Summer Hikaru Died

Based on Mokumokuren’s horror manga of the same name, the anime focuses on high schooler Yoshiki, who feels there’s something…off about his friend Hikaru. Something about him changed after he went missing six months ago during a trip to the mountains, and now Yoshiki has to figure out what to do about his changed friend, particularly since supernatural stuff is starting to happen around them, too. Look for The Summer Hikaru Died to hit Netflix sometime in the summer.

One Piece

If you’ve been watching One Piece on Netflix, you won’t have to wait too long to keep current. The second part of the Egghead arc will start airing on April 12, with new episodes airing weekly going forward. Crunchyroll watchers already know the show’s coming back the week prior: April 5 will feature a recap of “Egghead Part I” and the first new episode since the series’ hiatus, followed by another episode on April 6, and a new one every week after.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Oregon Man Sues Pet Food Company for Allegedly Killing His Cats With Bird Flu,https://gizmodo.com/oregon-man-sues-pet-food-company-for-allegedly-killing-his-cats-with-bird-flu-2000579431,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:43:28 GMT","A man in Oregon filed a lawsuit against Wild Coast Pet Food this week after his cat died from bird flu. The suit alleges the company misled consumers when it sold raw chicken cat food as healthy, failing to acknowledge potential risks, such as potential death from the consumption of H5N1-infected food.

The lawsuit, filed by Tim Hanson, seeks just under $8,000 in damages which covers compensation for veterinarian bills and legal fees, according to KTVB 7 in Oregon. Hanson adopted his cat Kira in 2021 and told the news outlet he typically feeds his cats raw food like the chicken that killed his cat because “I believe in the health benefits of it.” It’s not entirely clear what health benefits Hanson believes can come from raw chicken.

Hanson told KTVB 7 he bought the Wild Coast Pet Foods brand cat food in January but one day in early February Kira stopped eating. Hanson told the news outlet he brought her to the vet on Feb. 5 and a few days later tests confirmed Kira had bird flu. Kira was so sick she had to be euthanized on Feb. 9.

Wild Coast, which is based in Washington, issued a recall on March 1 for its 16 oz and 24 oz frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats. The food was sold in Washington and Oregon.

The warning from the recall, which was posted on the FDA’s website:

People who fed pets the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu in their pets, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness. People with pets exhibiting these signs after feeding this product should contact their veterinarian.

The spread of bird flu has been devastating for many cat owners, as they seem to be the most susceptible among domestic animals outside birds to H5N1. Many cats from New York to Oregon have been documented to have died from the disease and there are likely many more deaths that are going undetected.

No humans in the U.S. have contracted bird flu from eating food, at least as far as health authorities can tell. But it does appear that cats are getting it from the consumption of raw food. U.S. health agencies have tested both milk and beef and it appears both are safe for human consumption even with the presence of bird flu as long as the milk is pasteurized and the beef is cooked to at least medium.

There’s also no evidence of human-to-human spread of the bird flu in the U.S. but there is concern a mutation could allow that to happen. There have been 70 cases of H5N1 documented in Americans with one death. Forty-one of those cases have been tied to dairy cattle, 24 have been traced to poultry farms, two cases are from backyard flocks and wild birds, and three cases are still unknown sources.

Wild Coast didn’t respond to questions emailed Friday. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back.",gizmodo

Per the Hollywood Reporter, actor Austin Abrams is looking like a potential frontrunner for the upcoming film. Last seen in 2024’s Wolfs and Penelope, Abrams has already worked with Cregger on Weapons, which is due out in August. At the moment, it’s unclear who Abrams is playing, but given his youthful look, might he be Leon S. Kennedy, one of the series’ main characters? Leon’s popped up in the previous live-action films—played by Johann Urb in Resident Evil: Retribution, and Avan Jogia in Welcome to Raccoon City—but as a supporting player to others like Alice or the Redfields.

Sources speaking to THR claim Cregger’s take will feature elements of a “wilderness survival thriller,” while still being very much a horror film. The main selling point of this new Resident Evil movie is that it will hew closer to the original games, so whatever that entails, Abrams and whoever he plays will be at the center of it. We’ll find out more about Resident Evil and its cast ahead of its release on September 18, 2026.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Social Security Activist on DOGE’s Cuts: ‘People Will Die’,https://gizmodo.com/social-security-activist-on-doges-cuts-people-will-die-2000579108,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:05:34 GMT","Under Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the Social Security Administration has sought to downsize and reorganize its operations. This week, the agency made the highly controversial decision to nix identity verification over the phone. The policy shift threatens to force millions of seniors (many of which have poor mobility) to travel to field offices to receive their benefits. At the same time, DOGE has been closing SSA field offices across the country, making it increasingly difficult to access those offices.

Organizations like Social Security Works are organizing to fight the changes, and they hope to spur a groundswell of activism that can convince the government to reverse course. Still, the group’s executive director, Alex Lawson, thinks that the SSA’s recent policy change will have immediate and disastrous impacts on the agency’s ability to deliver retirement benefits to Americans.

“We know exactly how it will impact benefits,” Lawson said. “There will be tragedies, people will be harmed, people will die.” It’s pretty clear, Lawson added, that the goal of Musk’s DOGE is to destroy the Social Security program from the inside out. “You listen to Elon Musk on Joe Rogan’s podcast and you hear his disdain, his hatred of Social Security,” Lawson said. “He thinks it is an incredible net negative for the country.”

The SSA, which is currently being led by a new, DOGE-linked director, has argued that the policy shift is about rooting out fraud and abuse within the program (which is also the ostensible goal of DOGE), but critics maintain that the real intent is to drive the agency into dysfunction.

“Many people will just not be able to get benefits,” said Lawson. Huge numbers of retirees are going to be driven into SSA field offices that were “already straining, even before the Trump presidency,” he said, noting that even under Biden, the agency was already at fifty-year staffing lows. The changes under Trump are now threatening to destroy the agency’s operations and its ability to dispense benefits, he said. “Now you have firings, buyouts, they’ve closed 45 offices, they’ve instructed GSA [the General Services Administration] to end the leases on all of them,” he said. “It’s all aimed at creating a crisis, at collapsing the system.”

The Trump administration even seems to have admitted that recent policy shifts could disrupt service delivery, with the U.S. Commerce Secretary, billionaire Howard Lutnick, going on TV and claiming that an occasional drop in retirement benefits is really not that big of a deal.

Howard Lutnick: ""Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month, my mother-in-law— who's 94— she wouldn't call and complain. She just wouldn't. She'd just think something I messed up."" pic.twitter.com/Nez8FdEEAN — Ron Smith (@Ronxyz00) March 21, 2025

Lawson said that the tactics being employed are a very old strategy used by private actors to attack public systems. “Kneecap the mailman, complain that the mail is late, suddenly remember that you’ve got a cousin in the private mail delivery service and that they’ll do it for twice as much and deliver half.” Part of the strategy is to “lower public confidence” in Social Security as a program, he said: “If you can convince people that they’re going to get nothing, they will be willing to accept less than they’re owed.” The only thing DOGE is doing efficiently is hurting the Social Security program, he added.

Lawson said he doesn’t think Musk understands the benefits of Social Security because he comes from a background in which economic security was never a question. “He was born with an emerald mine,” Lawson said. “Not even a silver spoon. An emerald mine. He’s not a normal person.” Musk has denied multiple times that his family owned stakes in South African emerald mines or that the profits from said mines funded his early career, but his own father, Errol Morris, has said that the family was involved in the emerald trade and that his son’s denials were “just because, you see, he wants to tell the people in America that he also had a hard time.” In 2016, Elon, himself, told Forbes that his father had “a share in an Emerald mine in Zambia” when he was 15 years old.

Musk has referred to Social Security as a “Ponzi scheme,” which Lawson said is a ridiculous comparison since Ponzi schemes are about taking someone’s money and not giving anything back, while Social Security is funded by Americans’ money and often returns more than retirees actually pay in. “A Ponzi scheme is a criminal enterprise based on fraud that benefits one or a group of criminal actors at the top,” Lawson said. “Social Security is a very transparent—you can find out where every nickel and dime goes—social insurance, pay-as-you-go system. It’s wage insurance. There’s nobody who’s profiting from Social Security. There’s nobody on top of the program who’s getting money out of it. There’s no profits from it. All of it goes back to the people who are paying in.”

Lawson compared the goal of privatizing Social Security to America’s previous transition away from defined benefit pension plans and towards 401ks. Americans are much less secure within the 401k system, which is tied to the stock market, he said. The private sector literally cannot provide the same benefits that the SS program does because you can’t turn a profit from what Social Security provides, Lawson said. Social Security is not designed to make money, it’s designed to ensure that people can enjoy old age without working themselves to death.

Cuts to the Social Security program will create real, tangible harm to untold numbers of people, the activist added, noting that he had recently spoken with a lot of seniors who were incredibly frightened about what the cuts would mean for them. “You miss one check and people are like, ‘I can’t fucking eat. What am I supposed to do? It’s all I’ve got, I’m going to get thrown out.’ You talk to these people and they want me to tell them there’s nothing to be scared of. There’s a lot to be scared of right now.”

However, Lawson said his organization hopes to convert Americans’ fear into rage—the kind that will motivate them to get involved politically. The goal is to inspire a lot of people to come out and support their crusade against DOGE in the coming weeks—like on April 5th, when the group is organizing a national day of action. “This is a guy stealing our money. I don’t think little Elon Musk understands the magnitude of what he’s fucking with right now,” Lawson said.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Saturn’s Famous Rings Will Disappear From View This Weekend,https://gizmodo.com/saturns-famous-rings-will-disappear-from-view-this-weekend-2000579283,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:00:08 GMT","Saturn will temporarily lose its iconic look from our viewpoint on Earth, appearing as a pale, yellow sphere without its swirling rings shrouding the gas giant.

The billions of rocky and icy chunks swirling around Saturn will disappear from our viewpoint on Sunday, March 23 as the thin edges of the planet’s rings are aimed toward Earth, seemingly vanishing from sight. The rare phenomenon occurs every 13 to 15 years, with Earth passing through Saturn’s ring plane. The last time Earth got this rare view of the gas giant was in 2009.

Saturn is surrounded by billions of swarming pieces of comets, asteroids, and broken-off fragments of moons that were caught by the planet’s orbit. The exquisite ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, and is made up of tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house, according to NASA.

Similarly to Earth, Saturn’s axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees. As it orbits the Sun, Saturn’s tilt shifts in relation to Earth, causing its rings to disappear from our view as our planet crosses their plane. When Saturn is tilted toward Earth, we can see the upper side of its rings, and we see the lower side of the rings when the planet is tilted toward us. Between these two phases, however, is when the rings vanish from our view. Using a powerful telescope, one could spot a very thin line going around the middle of Saturn.

The plane crossing will begin at around 12:04 p.m. ET on Sunday, according to in-the-sky.org. Saturn’s rings won’t come into full view from Earth for a few months, and we may not get to see them again until November, according to earth.com.

Skywatchers in mid-southern latitudes will have the best chance at spotting the naked Saturn, if they can spot it from the morning twilight shining over the eastern horizon, according to space.com. Those in mid-northern latitudes, however, will have a hard time seeing Saturn as the planet will be close to the Sun at pre-dawn and below the slanted morning ecliptic.

Although it’s not ideal sky watching conditions for most, the celestial phenomenon is a rare glimpse of how the planets move around our shared star.",gizmodo

Disney is also busy over at Imagineering, as Star Wars droid action expands to the real world and the world of cinema in The Mandalorian and Grogu. And of course this week Snow White is getting some love at Disneyland and Walt Disney World with limited-time offerings—as movie theaters, including the Alamo Drafthouse, also join the Disney Princess excitement with parties, special menus, and more merch.

Over at Universal Studios Hollywood, you can see a food preview of offerings inspired by One Piece, Nintendo, Star Trek, and Harry Potter that’ll be on offer at the upcoming Fan Fest Nights.

Disneyland Paris – The Lion King Attraction

In a recent video for shareholders Bob Iger discussed the expansions coming to Disney Experiences, including a Lion King log flume ride at Disneyland Paris. It was described as a new journey that will follow Simba from cub to lion as seen in the animated and CG live-action films.

“Last year we talked about our plans to turbocharge growth in this segment through strategic investments. Today I’m proud to share some of what we’ve been up to,” Iger said. “Right now, we have more projects underway around the world than at any time in our history.” He also reiterated the company’s commitment to the new expansions based on Pixar’s Cars and Disney Villains at the Magic Kingdom; a Monsters Inc.-themed land at Hollywood Studios; the new Tropical Americas land featuring Encanto and Indiana Jones attractions at Disney’s Animal Kingdom; and the Coco boat ride and two new MCU rides at Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure.

Disney Imagineering announces BDX Droid partnership with NVIDIA

The Star Wars BDX droids that have been seen wandering around Galaxy’s Edge will be taking their exploration wider outside of the theme park sandbox. First you’ll be able to see them make their theatrical debut in Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian and Grogu next year. However, shortly after their SXSW appearance, Imagineering announced a partnership with NVIDIA to give the Star Wars BDX droids a role in work being done in collaboration with Disney Research to expand the capabilities of the droids for more immersive participation in tech.

“The BDX droids are just the beginning. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn’t seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” shared Kyle Laughlin, senior VP at Walt Disney Imagineering research and development. “This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before—and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can.” The tech is poised to propel Imagineering’s animatronic work into the new tech space with what they’re calling Newton, which is “an open-source physics engine that lets robots learn how to handle complex tasks with greater precision.”

This is making our Sarah Connor “robots bad!” senses tingle so we hope there’s a sentience kill switch for fear of adorable Star Wars x Marvel Ultrons running amok. Or you know, if Walt Disney’s animatronic hacks into the tech, we think things might get a little crazy especially if it discovers what horror creators are doing with public domain bastardizations of his Mouse House IP.

https://gizmodo.com,‘We Just Want to Get Back to Work’: NOAA Hurricane Hunter Speaks Out After Trump’s Layoffs,https://gizmodo.com/we-just-want-to-get-back-to-work-noaa-hurricane-hunter-speaks-out-after-trumps-layoffs-2000578176,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:30:42 GMT","Less than a month into the second term of Donald Trump, the president signed an executive order that gave the non-governmental Department of Government Efficiency broad powers to gut the federal workforce, in the name of cost-cutting.

DOGE—led by the multibillionaire “special government employee” Elon Musk—has proceeded with zeal, working to scrap funding for veterans’ cancer treatments, reportedly cutting FDA employees directly working on Musk’s company Neuralink, slashing (and then walking back) layoffs in the National Nuclear Security Administration, cutting about 1,000 staff working for the National Park Service across the country, and this month, after a faltering start, beginning layoffs at NASA, the nation’s space agency.

During the final week of February, hundreds of federal workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were fired—about 10% of the agency workforce. One of the affected employees was Andrew Hazelton, a meteorologist who grew up in Florida and until last month spent his days with the Hurricane Research Division Modeling Team, which helps NOAA understand these extreme storms and mitigate the worst of their impacts. Hazelton is now on administrative leave—he’s not allowed to work—a temporary reinstatement position that could keep him (and many other NOAA staffers) in limbo as their situation works through the federal court system.

Gizmodo spoke with Hazelton by phone this week to discuss the position that he and hundreds of other federal employees at NOAA are dealing with as the DOGE cuts roll through the federal workforce. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.

Isaac Schultz, Gizmodo: I understand things have changed in the last day with a memo temporarily reinstating staff in “paid, non-duty” status, which potentially adds a new dimension to our conversation. Walk me through the timeline here, from your work at NOAA to the layoffs and basically how far along this rollercoaster we are now.

Andrew Hazelton: I’ve been with NOAA in varying capacities for over 8 years. After I got my PhD in 2016, I worked with a postdoc at Princeton University for the NOAA lab up there, NOAA GFDL in Princeton for 2 years, and then I went to AOML, the Hurricane Research Division, in 2018, working for the University of Miami. Last October I started the federal position, working for NOAA’s Environmental Modeling Center doing hurricane models and model development.

As of yesterday we are—on paper at least—reinstated with admin leave, because of the court decision over the weekend. What that looks like exactly, though, there’s still a lot of questions that we’ll have to get answers about. It seems as though— based on the wording of what they sent us—that they’re waiting for another court to say that they can go through with backpay. And right now we’re not allowed to work.

I was a new federal employee even though I’ve worked with NOAA for 8 years or more, and then February 27th we all got that mass email basically just informing us that we were being fired. It was sort of chaotic because they had about an hour’s notice. We’ve been in this limbo state. I know some people filed appeals with the merit board. There was this preliminary injunction that allows us to be reinstated, but it seems like it’s going to depend on appeals of that. And there’s still some uncertainty as to whether there could be a legal layoff process after that.

Gizmodo: It seems like across a number of agencies, folks are not only being hit with these layoffs, but then being stuck in these situations where it’s very unclear exactly what their status is, and what the federal government’s next move is going to be.

Hazelton: Right. It’s depending on court outcomes, and even across departments it seems like certain ones are responding to the rulings differently—some more enthusiastically than others. There are a lot of unknowns.

Gizmodo: We could speak about some more unknowns, frankly. Your focus is hurricanes. How many folks who work specifically on the hurricanes have been impacted, at least for the time being, and what this might mean for the public—people who need information about incoming storms?

Hazelton: In my group, I was the main person doing hurricanes. There were other people doing other kinds of modeling: severe weather and ocean models, all sorts of things. There were other people in NOAA that were part of the hurricane hunters, the ones that fly into the hurricanes, and I did that as part of my last role. There were a few people from that group that were laid off. A couple dozen may have gotten reinstated as part of the judge’s decision, but there wasn’t much communication about what criteria were used for that, but some were not fully reinstated. They’ve not given a lot of information about criteria or plans, but the big thing is that, if people aren’t fully reinstated, it’s going to be hard.

These are people working on some of the computer models that are our main tools collecting data. I know people in the satellite division have been affected, and satellites are one of our big tools for monitoring all sorts of weather, not just hurricanes. Effects could be felt across the board, for anybody who relies on weather data.

Gizmodo: Just because our readers are very familiar with hurricanes—many are in the American Southeast—can you name a couple of the storms that you flew through?

Hazelton: Because I was there through last year, it was the first part of the hurricane season. I was in Helene last year, and then I’ve also flown in storms like Michael in 2018, Dorian in 2019, Ian, which most of the Gulf people remember, Idalia. I’ve flown in quite a few big ones and done work with the aircraft data and also the modeling.

Gizmodo: What is it like to fly through a hurricane, and what storm was the most unnerving to go through?

Hazelton: Most of the flight is just kind of like a bumpy commercial flight. It’s a P-3 aircraft. It’s a propeller plane—kind of a bumpy, noisy plane in general—but very sturdy. But when you get in the eyewall—that ring near the center that’s the most intense part of the hurricane—that’s where you can see some real bumps.

I think Michael was probably the storm that was the bumpiest. I wasn’t on the famous Ian flight where they got really rocked around—I was the one before that. So Michael and also Helene last year was a pretty intense eyewall. We didn’t want to fly through because it was just so gnarly looking on radar.

Gizmodo: People in and affiliated with this administration talk a lot about privatizing weather forecasting. What are your opinions on that, and what might that outlook mean for federal workers and for the way the public gets their weather information, depending on how successful you imagine that that effort being, should they proceed with it?

Hazelton: The thing is there’s already a pretty robust private weather enterprise. There are private companies that do good work. We work with them and a lot of them rely on NOAA data for their apps or different tools. It’s really a pretty good public-private partnership that I think is honestly a model for that kind of thing. I don’t think we want to get to a point where there’s like a subscription-based model for warnings or any sort of life-saving data or information. Honestly, open access to data for the cost of your tax dollars is one of the things that’s really been a model of NOAA. If you look at the numbers, it only costs 6 cents per American per day to fund all of NOAA at its current level.

“In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself.”

It’s a pretty minuscule cost when you look at like the dollars saved. Whenever there’s a hurricane, better forecasts allow people to get out—or vice versa, if they’re not going to be impacted, they don’t have to close up their school or business. Better forecasts save lives and money. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself.

Gizmodo: You mentioned that some folks were reinstated early on. It sounds like it’s kind of a black box as to how those decisions are being made. Is that a fair characterization?

Hazelton: Yeah, there hasn’t really been a whole lot of criteria or communication. I think there was supposed to be some veterans’ preference for prior federal service, but it really hasn’t been made clear at all to us how these decisions are being made.

Gizmodo: In that case, a silly question that I’ll ask anyway: Is there any idea of how long this ambiguity will last?

Hazelton: No, not really. I think it’s going to depend a lot on court cases and how those play out. That’s above my pay grade. I’m just ready to get back to work doing what I love doing and what helps protect the American public.

Gizmodo: Given the abruptness of these layoffs and your hands being tied with work, it sounds like you just have some stuff sitting on your desk waiting to be resumed, which with something as dynamic as weather, is probably not the best thing.

Hazelton: It’s tough. My coworkers, the ones that are still there, they’re great and they’re working hard, but it’s just hard when you have an agency that’s already understaffed and just being stretched even thinner. It’s hard to get everything done that you want and need to.

Gizmodo: Is there anything you really want to get across about either your personal experience right now or the experience of federal workers more generally at this time?

Hazelton: Most of us just want to get back to the work we’re doing to help the American public. NOAA’s mission is to protect lives and property. We have a track record of doing that and that’s what we want to get back to doing.",gizmodo

You’re not the only one. Fans are going crazy as the Shanghai GP is approaching fast on the 21st of March. After Lando Norris edged out Max Verstappen at the Australian GP, everyone’s eager to see if he can repeat the result.

Luckily, you don’t have to spend a cent to watch the F1 Chinese Grand Prix online. You can catch the free stream on ServusTV (from Austria) or SRF (from Switzerland).

Both channels are 100% free and don’t even require an account to work. While they’re not in English, at least, you’ll be able to catch up with the event in Full HD. You can learn more about watching all F1 races for free here.

Date and schedule of the race March 23 3:00 am EST / 12:00 am PT / 07:00 am GMT / 08:00 am CET Free channels ServusTV (Austria), SRF/RTS (Switzerland) Stream the race online from anywhere using NordVPN

How to Watch F1 Chinese GP on Free Channels?

ServusTV and SRF are licensed to broadcast within their respective countries. This means being outside Austria or Switzerland will produce an error message.

Here’s what happens when you try to watch Servus TV:

Since it’s a foreign TV channel in your case, it’s inaccessible. ServusTV and SRF have an IP-detection system, which enforces the geo-restriction.

If the IP address is outside Austria or Switzerland, ServusTV and SRF will be unavailable respectively. The goal is to, therefore, claim an IP address from one of these countries and watch the F1 Chinese GP on a free channel.

People online frequently mention NordVPN as their choice.

Watch the Chinese GP Online With NordVPN

This VPN has hundreds of servers in Austria and Switzerland. It also comes with unlimited bandwidth for streaming, excellent speeds, and apps for all devices. The latter is especially praised by VPN users.

Ths allows for cathing up with the free live stream of the F1 Chinese Grand Prix on phones and tablets, for example. NordVPN is risk-free, thanks to a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Thus, people just need to subscribe, set up the VPN, and connect to a server. Once they finish watching the F1 Shanghai GP on a free channel, they can get a full refund, thereby not losing a single cent.

F1 China GP Race Weekend Schedule

Whether you’re looking to stream just the main event or those that come before, you must be acquainted with the schedule. You can watch the F1 China Grand Prix live stream from the 21st to the 23rd of March, 2025.

The schedule is as follows:

Practice 1 – 21st of March, 11:30 to 12:30 (GMT+8)

Sprint Qualifying – 21st of March, 15:30 to 16:15 (GMT+8)

Sprint Race – 22nd of March, 11:00 to 12:00 (GMT+8)

Qualifying – 22nd of March, 15:00 to 16:00 (GMT+8)

Race – 23rd of March, 15:00 (GMT+8)

We can see that the main event is on the 23rd of March. All times are GMT+8, so make sure you “adapt” them to your local time zone. You can also refer to the official F1 website for exact times based on your location.

Should I Just Pay for the Livestream?

If the free TV channels we mentioned aren’t your bag of beans, you can always opt for a premium streaming service. In a recent post, we explained how to watch Sky Sports in the US and the way a VPN helps.

However, if you’re paying for the VPN in the first place, it’s much better to watch the F1 Chinese Grand Prix on a free channel. Otherwise, you’ll spend money on the VPN plus the selected streaming service.

We must warn you that streaming services usually don’t have a money-back guarantee, so there’s no refund option. They’re expensive, as well (up to $85/mo).

Such services are also region-locked, which, as stated, begs for the use of a VPN.

With the method we explained, you can join thousands of racing fans globally and enjoy bombastic Grand Prix races from all over the world. By the way, the same trick works for streaming MotoGP races anywhere for free.

Movies the Way They Were Meant to Be Watched

Many TV manufacturers like to fill their products with various features aimed at artificially enhancing color depth or increasing frame rates through software that no one really asked for. These features get a lot of hate online, but to be honest they can sometimes be useful in specific situations—for example, they often perform well with sports. You might have an easier time watching the hockey game and following the fast-moving puck thanks to content upscaling and motion smoothing.

However, if you are watching a movie or premium network show, in many cases the director of photography and the editor worked hard to choose the right colors, the right, aspect ratio, the right everything to fit the mood and tone of what you’re viewing. That’s what’s wonderful about the LG OLEDs.

The evo C3 Series has what’s called Filmmaker Mode and when you turn that on, it turns all that other crap off — so you can watch what you watch the way the director intended. Combine that with the support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound and what you get is the closest thing to the theatrical experience you possibly can in your own living room.

https://wired.com,The FBI Is Investigating Attacks on Tesla as ‘Domestic Terrorism.’ Here’s Why That Matters,https://wired.com/story/fbi-tesla-arson-domestic-terrorism-protests/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","The US Federal Bureau of Investigation says it’s investigating a series of alleged incidents across the country in which “Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged.” On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted charges against three people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles and, in at least one alleged incident, writing “profane messages against President Trump” near Tesla charging stations, among other crimes.

“Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” Bondi said in a news release detailing the arrests, which were made over the last several weeks in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina.

Civil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Musk’s role in the government. The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations.

Bondi’s announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots “Tesla Takedown” events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are scheduled to take place at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend. The demonstrations have multiplied since they began in mid-February, with some attracting hundreds of people each.

Most of the protests have been peaceful, and the organizers of some of them have said that they don’t endorse property damage. But they are happening amid a string of alleged arson and vandalism cases targeting Tesla dealerships and charging stations, including one in Las Vegas Tuesday morning, as well as others in Colorado and Boston.

By labeling these and other incidents involving Tesla domestic terrorism, the FBI can file broader search warrants than in other types of cases. Under the Patriot Act, law enforcement gets “special authorities"" while investigating terrorism, including “single-jurisdiction search warrants” from magistrate judges that apply anywhere in the US instead of a single geographic area, according to a 2023 report from the Government Accountability Office. With a court order, law enforcement can additionally get “confidential education records” from any school or agency in the course of a terrorism investigation, the report notes.

The FBI also has a national network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that allow the bureau to borrow agents, experts, data, and intelligence from more than 30 federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, including the “Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration,” as well as local police throughout a particular region.

In addition to these resources, the FBI has access to surveillance technology that local authorities may not, such as social media surveillance tools, face recognition programs, and allegedly “stingrays” that can intercept data from cell phones.

Most of the powers and resources that law enforcement has access to in a terrorism investigation are also available in other criminal investigations. However, some lawyers have argued that law enforcement tends to exercise the fuller scope of its powers more frequently in the course of terrorism cases.

Privileged Access

There aren’t explicit guidelines or laws requiring the FBI to keep companies in the loop when they are targeted in what law enforcement deems “domestic terrorism” incidents. But Michael German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, says the FBI typically does so anyway. “It would be the FBI's decision to treat the company as a crime victim, so regular exchanges of information are common,” German says.

That could allow Musk and other Tesla executives to possibly access surveillance data or reports on protesters that aren’t available to the public. Tesla and the Department of Justice did not return requests for comment asking whether they plan to share information with one another about the current ongoing terrorism investigation.",wired
https://wired.com,BYD's 5-Minute EV Charging Sounds Great. But How Useful Is it?,https://wired.com/story/byd-5-minute-ev-charging/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","When surveys ask potential car buyers why they’re not going electric, the answer is consistent: It’s the charging. Drivers understand gas; plugging in, less so. They’re worried about waiting around for a charger, which, depending on its power, can take anywhere between 20 minutes and eight hours to fill up a battery.

So the hubbub around a surprise announcement from Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD makes sense. The automaker said this week that two new vehicles set to launch in April will be able to add 250 miles of range in just five minutes.

That’s twice as fast as even the next generation of Tesla Superchargers. (The day of BYD’s announcement, Tesla stock dropped by five percent.)

Topping up in five minutes makes for great ad copy, and could go a long way to alleviating drivers’ concerns about EVs. But practically speaking, experts say, it might not be the gigantic charging breakthrough it seems.

BYD says the superfast charging is made possible by an “all liquid-cooled megawatt flash-charging terminal system,” according to Bloomberg, plus a new, automotive-grade silicon carbide power chip. The combination should allow the vehicle to channel up to 1,000 volts of charge. That’s a small but significant jump compared to competitors, at least among passenger vehicles. Generally, the higher the voltage, combined with sufficient amperage, or electrical flow, the faster the charge. Most popular EVs, including the Tesla Model 3, are built on 400-volt ""platforms,"" which are usually cheaper to manufacture, though 800-volt models are on the rise. The upcoming Lucid Gravity, meanwhile, has a 926-volt powertrain. BYD trumps it all.

The more significant BYD innovation, though, may be in its chargers, which the automaker indicates should be able to take advantage of that 1,000-volt capability. BYD says it will build 4,000 of them in China, though hasn’t provided any specifics about when, where, and how. (The automaker didn’t respond to WIRED’s questions.)

Getting those fast chargers in the ground likely won’t be a simple task. “It’s going to take a while,” says Gil Tal, who directs the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis. Building charging stations can already be a multimonth, if not multiyear journey in most countries, due partially to lengthy permitting processes, but also the time it takes to find, build, and assemble charging components.

What’s more, larger megawatt charging stations have larger megawatt power needs, and might require pricey grid connection updates. Plus, an advanced liquid-cooled system, like the kind described by BYD, needs thick, heavy, and specially manufactured cables and connectors that can dissipate heat quickly. “They need more copper, more cooling, more everything,” says Tal. That means more up-front building expenses, which could be passed on to drivers in higher charging prices.

Despite the lack of detail from BYD, EV industry experts know some of these things because super fast charging isn’t new. Megawatt charging systems that can deliver up to 1,250 volts have been in development for nearly a decade, though developers have mostly been focused on the rapid charging of heavy-duty commercial vehicles like electric semitrucks and buses. Most superfast charging efforts have focused on these sorts of vehicles for two reasons: They have much bigger battery packs; and they’re mostly operated by businesses and governments in fleets, so the moments they spend charging are moments they’re not transporting people or goods. Their time is money. This makes depot builders more willing to shell out the extra funding needed to get supercharging capabilities. Will they be willing to do the same for passenger vehicles? And at what price?",wired
https://wired.com,The Art of the Perfect Nap,https://wired.com/story/the-art-of-the-perfect-nap-sleep-science/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

You’re in the middle of the afternoon, eyelids heavy, focus slipping. You close your eyes for half an hour and wake up feeling recharged. But later that night, you’re tossing and turning in bed, wondering why you can’t drift off. That midday snooze which felt so refreshing at the time might be the reason.

Naps have long been praised as a tool for boosting alertness, enhancing mood, strengthening memory, and improving productivity. Yet for some, they can sabotage nighttime sleep.

Napping is a double-edged sword. Done right, it’s a powerful way to recharge the brain, improve concentration, and support mental and physical health. Done wrong, it can leave you groggy, disoriented, and struggling to fall asleep later. The key lies in understanding how the body regulates sleep and wakefulness.

Most people experience a natural dip in alertness in the early afternoon, typically between 1 pm and 4 pm. This isn’t just due to a heavy lunch—our internal body clock, or circadian rhythm, creates cycles of wakefulness and tiredness throughout the day. The early afternoon lull is part of this rhythm, which is why so many people feel drowsy at that time.

Studies suggest that a short nap during this period—ideally followed by bright light exposure—can help counteract fatigue, boost alertness, and improve cognitive function without interfering with nighttime sleep. These “power naps” allow the brain to rest without slipping into deep sleep, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed.

But there’s a catch: Napping too long may result in waking up feeling worse than before. This is due to “sleep inertia”—the grogginess and disorientation that comes from waking up during deeper sleep stages.

Once a nap extends beyond 30 minutes, the brain transitions into slow-wave sleep, making it much harder to wake up. Studies show that waking from deep sleep can leave people feeling sluggish for up to an hour. This can have serious implications if they then try to perform safety-critical tasks, make important decisions, or operate machinery, for example. And if a nap is taken too late in the day, it can eat away from the “sleep pressure build-up”—the body’s natural drive for sleep—making it harder to fall asleep at night.

When Napping Is Essential

For some, napping is essential. Shift workers often struggle with fragmented sleep due to irregular schedules, and a well-timed nap before a night shift can boost alertness and reduce the risk of errors and accidents. Similarly, people who regularly struggle to get enough sleep at night—whether due to work, parenting, or other demands—may benefit from naps to bank extra hours of sleep that compensate for their sleep loss.

Nonetheless, relying on naps instead of improving nighttime sleep is a short-term fix rather than a sustainable solution. People with chronic insomnia are often advised to avoid naps entirely, as daytime sleep can weaken their drive to sleep at night.",wired
https://wired.com,A Mysterious Startup Is Developing a New Form of Solar Geoengineering,https://wired.com/story/a-mysterious-startup-is-developing-a-new-form-of-solar-geoengineering/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","This story originally appeared on Undark and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In July 2012, a renegade American businessman, Russ George, took a ship off the coast of British Columbia and dumped 100 tons of iron sulfate dust into the Pacific Ocean. He had unilaterally, and some suggest illegally, decided to trigger an algae bloom to absorb some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—an attempt at geoengineering, a tech-based approach to combating climate change. It was a one-off, the largest known geoengineering experiment at the time, and a harbinger for more to come.

Now a startup called Stardust seeks something more ambitious: developing proprietary geoengineering technology that would help block sun rays from reaching the planet. Stardust formed in 2023 and is based in Israel but incorporated in the United States.

Its approach is novel: Most geoengineering research today is led by scientists in the US at universities and federal agencies, and the work they are doing is more or less accessible to public scrutiny. Stardust is at the forefront of an alternative path: One in which private companies drive the development, and perhaps deployment, of technologies that experts say could have profound consequences for the planet.

Geoengineering projects, even those led by climate scientists at major universities, have previously drawn the ire of environmentalists and other groups. Such a deliberate transformation of the atmosphere has never been done, and many uncertainties remain. If a geoengineering project went awry, for example, it could contribute to air pollution and ozone loss, or have dramatic effects on weather patterns, such as disrupting monsoons in populous South and East Asia.

But as global temperatures rise, public and scientific sentiments are shifting. If those temperature trends continue, governments or private entities may ultimately use geoengineering to alleviate or avoid the worst impacts of extreme weather, including deadly heat waves, firestorms, and hurricanes. And whoever deploys the technology will need to keep it up for decades while pent-up greenhouse gases gradually dissipate or are removed.

Few outsiders have gotten a glimpse of Stardust’s plans, and the company has not publicly released details about its technology, its business model, or exactly who works at its company. But the company appears to be positioning itself to develop and sell a proprietary geoengineering technology to governments that are considering making modifications to the global climate—acting like a kind of defense contractor for climate alteration.

Stardust is moving ahead amid few national and international rules and limited oversight, and a recent report by the company’s former climate governance consultant, Janos Pasztor, called for the company to increase its transparency, engagement, and communication with outsiders. The report provides rare insight into the reticent company. But, so far, Pasztor told Undark, the company has not met all of his requests. Stardust still needs to implement his recommendations, and “be as transparent as possible, be available proactively to respond to questions people may have, and also to engage with other actors,” he said, because they do not, or not yet, have a “social license” for geoengineering activities.",wired

If you own a Google Pixel 9 or Samsung Galaxy S25 series phone and find yourself in a cellular dead zone, you can now send texts to your friends and family via satellite. This is the same functionality Apple introduced for the iPhone 14 and newer (regardless of carrier) in iOS 18.

While these Android phones have been able to connect to emergency services via satellite, they can now use satellite connectivity to send texts to anyone, regardless of the recipient's device or carrier. Verizon says this capability has already started to roll out but will take two weeks to complete.

Verizon isn't the only carrier focused on providing this kind of satellite connectivity to fill in the gaps in terrestrial cellular network coverage. T-Mobile recently announced a partnership with Starlink that's currently in beta until July. It lets you send and receive texts, and the carrier says you'll soon be able to share photos, use data, make voice calls, and more. T-Mobile's solution will be included for subscribers on its Go5G Next plan, and other customers can add it to their existing plan for $15 per month. AT&T is also working with AST SpaceMobile and recently tested a video call over satellite connectivity.

This Handheld Console Lets You Relive Your Nintendo DS Dreams

Courtesy of OneXSugar

You’ve seen the Steam Deck, you’ve seen the Switch, and you no doubt remember the Nintendo DS. But this newly announced gaming handheld, the OneXSugar, claims to do that all in one. The device has two screens and rotating gamepad controllers to allow it to transform into all sorts of clever modes of use. There’s the standard landscape mode, using the primary 6-inch screen and the two sides of the controller. But flip up that screen and you’ll get access to the 3.92-inch secondary square screen. That secondary screen can be used as a kickstand, or you can rotate the controllers to attach to the square screen. Now that’s definitely unlike anything we’ve seen before.

The Android-based device, announced on Indiegogo, was unveiled alongside a new series of chips from Qualcomm designed specifically for gaming handhelds. The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 boasts 28 percent improved graphics with ray tracing, specifically designed for cloud-based gaming and retro emulators. Just don’t expect it to support Windows-level games like AMD’s Ryzen Z-series chips, which you can find in handhelds like the popular Asus ROG Ally X.

The company behind the OneXSugar also has something more powerful in its lineup, the OneXPlayer G1, which is part laptop, part gaming handheld. No word on the price or release date yet, but hopefully we’ll hear more details about the OneXSugar soon. —Luke Larsen

Velotric's Breeze 1 Is a Commuting, Crusing Ebike

Photograph: Adrienne So

After multiple rounds of layoffs and pulling out of the European market, Rad Power Bikes’ new CEO recently stepped down. That leaves a big, Rad-sized hole in the direct-to-consumer electric bike space—a space the company created when Mike Radenbaugh founded Rad in 2007.

Which company will fill in the gap? We’re most excited to test one of the new bikes from the up-and-coming Velotric. The Breeze 1 launched on March 18. It's a commuter bike built like a cruiser, with a comfortable, upright seating position on a step-through frame and a powerful 750-watt motor with a 70-mile range.

The bike also has a few cool tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can switch between using a torque sensor, which will adjust the pressure you need to pedal on mixed terrain, versus the more old-fashioned cadence sensor, which is best for longer stretches of roads. It’s also integrated with Apple Find My and Apple Health, so if you’re an iPhone user, you don’t have to fiddle with your fitness tracker to log a bike ride. Most importantly, it weighs under 50 pounds and costs under $2,000. I’m unboxing my tester ride (in Violet Haze, naturally) as we speak. —Adrienne So

Fujifilm Debuts a Medium Format Compact Camera

Anyone who’s ever dreamed of a medium format Fujifilm X100 camera, dream no more. The new GFX100RF is just that. It takes the same minimalist, rangefinder styling of the X100 series, with dial controls and a nice wide-angle prime lens on the front, but adds a 102-megapixel medium format sensor.

There is a price to be paid for that much larger sensor though—the GFX100RF is larger and heavier than any of the X100 cameras. At 5.26 by 3.56 inches, with a depth of 3 inches, this isn’t fitting in your pocket, nor is the 25.9 ounces (735 grams) light enough to let you throw it in your bag and forget about it. To make the GFX100RF weather-sealed you’ll need to further bulk it up with an adapter ring and filter, just as you do with the X100VI.",wired
https://wired.com,Like Elon Musk he scored his digital coup in the United States,https://www.wired.it/article/elon-musk-doge-colpo-stato-digitale-dati-ai/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","While the most decorated public officials in America sipped cocktails in the presidential dance hall of the Capital Hilton, taking care of the assignment at the tables and wondering what their place was in the hierarchy between US senators and the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, Elon Musk was sitting at his phone, laughing.

On January 25, few among the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in the historic Washington hotel knew what he knew: that is, a group of high managers and his most loyal young people was preparing to occupy the highest offices of a nearby federal building. Under surveillance, they would have slept on mattresses covered with sensors for body temperature and respiratory frequency, giving themselves to renovate the country's base code. Or better yet, eliminate it completely.

While not loving the formality, Musk had dressed well for the occasion. The Alfalfa Club has existed since 1913 for the sole purpose of hosting an annual banquet in which the most important people in the government can entertain with the most important figures in the business world. The number of members is limited to about 200, and the alfalfas admit new followers only in the event of the death of the existing members. That evening, the judge of the Supreme Court Elena Kagan and the managing director of Nasdaq Adena Friedman had joined members of the caliber of Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, and Kirsten Gillibrand, senator of the United States. Musk participated as a guest.

The managers of the Alfalfa Club seemed convinced that the elections and constitutional rules should also determine the seats. The main table was reserved for alfalfa in government. Musk, the alleged leader of the so -called Department for Government's efficiency (Doge), sat on the opposite side of the room. He spent most of the dinner on the phone, speaking with the president, what is said. The entrepreneur was closer to Donald Trump. He told his friends that he committed himself in government buildings. He would soon move to the White House, to stay in the Secretary of War Suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where he even had to install his gaming station.

While Musk sat in the Hilton dance hall, his agents, under the guidance of a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to personnel management systems (OPM, Office of Personnel Management), which acts as a Federal Department of Human Resources for about 2.2 million US public employees. Many of these agents would later also show up in other government agencies: among them there were Akash Bobba, graduated from the UC Berkeley and a former palantir intern, the company active in the defense sector (and the government contractor) founded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a nineteen year old who is supernamed ""Big Balls"" online; And Nikhil Rajpal, a thirty -year -old computer scientist who had worked on Twitter during the period of Musk's acquisition, and who once had proposed to auction the inactive user names of the social to the best bidder. As a student, always at the UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group who loves the future Motto Cohortem Urbanam, who in Latin means more or less ""fuck the inhabitants of the city"".",wired

But now Meta has accepted a plea bargain in the context of a procedure entered by a British citizen on the use of personal data for sending targeted advertising. The agreement is such as to put an entire business model at risk that seemed destined not to be scratched by anything, so much was well thought out and defended by a trench made of marketing, lobby and pr. But human phenomena have a beginning and an end, as the Sicilian magistrate Giovanni Falcone loved to repeat. And this probably is no exception.

What happened

The action was threatened by Tanya O'Carroll, British activist, co-founder and former director of Amnesty Tech, the amnesty International arm that deals with electronic surveillance. Where by surveillance we mean that of the sociologist Shoshana Zuboff, namely that of Big Tech, which monitors any interaction of users with their omnipresent platforms to analyze their data and sell them by weight of advertising investors. The imitated imitates were built on this intuition: Google was the forerunner, but the model was certainly perfected by Mark Zukerberg and Facebook, especially after the entry of the Sheryl Sandberg platform and the invention of the Like button.

The assumption of the action of O'Carroll is that the GDPR, the European legislation on the protection of personal data that entered into force in 2018 does not work. Not so much because the law is badly written. ""It is a very ambitious and brilliant legislation, but it lacks a robust part of implementation,"" he declared in 2023 in an interview with The Markup site. ""The way the GDPR works is that the regulator lies in the country where the business has the headquarters,"" continues the activist. ""Ireland"", he still noticed, ""is a small country, but acts as a regulatory subject for some of the largest companies on the planet because their headquarters is there - I speak of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple"".

""Therefore, a situation is determined - continues the reasoning - in which the entire Irish economy depends on foreign direct investments, a large part of which comes from the Tech industry"". The conclusion? ""There will never be the political will to adequately put the GDPR in Ireland. And this situation is generating a lot of frustration, even in the protection authorities of personal data from other European countries, in which citizens' complaints are forwarded to Ireland and end up going out"".",wired

An appointment established by the United Nations in 1992, which wants to remind us of the importance of this essential resource for the survival and well -being of our species and the planet that hosts us. Each edition is dedicated to a different theme, and this year the UN has chosen to speak of glaciers: one of the environments of our planet that is more affected by the effects of climate change, and whose progressive dissolution puts biodiversity at risk, and the survival of many threatened communities, landslides, droughts, floods, and by the raising of the seas. On the occasion of the World Water Day, here are 8 things to know about their importance that emerge from the key messages drawn up for the occasion by UNESCO and World Meteorological Organization experts.

Fundamental for life

The glaciers are deposits of ice and snow that accumulate on the ground standing, and slowly slide driven by their weight. They are present in every continent. They are found in many mountain regions, and on the edges of the glacial cap of Greenland and Antarctica. There are more than 275 thousand glaciers in the world, which cover a total area of ​​about 700 thousand square kilometers. They are one of the main water resources of the planet, where about 170 thousand cubic kilometers of ice are concentrated, almost 70% of the fresh water on earth. For this reason, they are fundamental for the life of plants, animals and human beings: currently, there are almost two billion (22% of the world population) people who live downstream of a glacier or a snowfall, and depend on these as the main source of drinking water.

Climate change indicators

On a global level, the glaciers began to dissolve starting from the middle of the nineteenth century (when the so -called small glacial era that cooled the climate of the earth has ended starting from the fourteenth century). In recent decades, however, they have started to shrink at increasing speed, due to the global warming linked to the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. According to the World Meteorological Organization in 2023, the planet glaciers lost a man of over 600 gigatonnellate of water, the largest annual glacial reduction of annual glacial mass in the last 50 years.

A crucial water resource

As we said, the glaciers hold 70% of the planet's fresh water. Often it is a temporary deposit, which returns fresh water in spring when it begins to melt the snow, and feeds the aquifers used by man such as drinking water, agriculture, industry and energy production. However, climate changes are altering the extent and timing of these seasonal dissolution, modifying the water cycle, the quantity that accumulates in underground slopes, and the one that contributes to the rise of the oceans. With continuous climb temperatures, the total mass of glaciers is destined to reduce more and more, increasing the competition for water resources.

New dangers

The anomalous dissolution of the ice increases the risk of disasters. Floods, landslides, avalanches, in the future they will be increasingly common in mountain areas and in subarctic areas, exposing the populations that live there with new dangers, and difficult to predict. The number of glacial lakes, formed by erosion produced by ice and fed by their dissolution, is growing everywhere since the 90s of the last century. And with them, the danger of floods grows: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs) are defined, and a 2023 study has calculated that today there are over 15 million people who live in areas at risk, concentrated mainly between India, Pakistan, Peru and China.

Cut the emissions to save the glaciers

The time for action, if we want to save the planet's glaciers, is practically running out. Italy is a hot spot of the effects of global warming, and it demonstrates the hidden hair of our mountains: the Italian glaciers are those that disappear with the fastest rhythm throughout the Alpine arc, and in the last 10 years they have already reduced by 13%, and risk losing a further 50% mass by 2050. According to UNESCO, limiting the increase in global temperatures under the degree and a half compared to the grade compared to the grade of the degree. Pre -industrial, it will still be possible to save two thirds of the Glaciai Heritage of humanity. But to do it we will need decisive, and timely, now difficult to imagine interventions. In parallel, it will be important to work on adaptation, monitoring and mitigation. Aspects that - write UN experts - are currently not very recognized by national policies, and which should instead be addressed also in terms of sustainable soil use and management of water resources, and with a wide involvement of local communities.

The importance of monitoring

Some glaciers have been subjected to annual monitoring campaigns for more than 130 years. More recently, remote monitoring technologies, even with the use of satellites, have made it possible to significantly expand the scientific mapping of glaciers. But it still remains a lot to do to get to optimal coverage, especially in the most impervious areas. UN experts therefore believe that it is a priority to invest in monitoring technologies, because the availability of a more complete inventory possible of the state and evolution of the planet glaciers will allow to refine the scientific assessments and forecasts, on which to base the adaptation programs and mitigation of the damage in the future.

The impact on the environment and the economy

The decline of the glaciers is the main responsible for the rise in the levels of the seas, increased on average by 20 centimeters since the beginning of 1900. The effects are seen in the erosion of the coasts, and in the growing risk of floods. This is not all, however, because the raising of the seas and the dissolution of the ice also have a growing impact on the economy, damaging agriculture, tourism, trade, transport and the production of hydroelectric energy. Some estimates indicate that by the end of the century Europe could suffer damage between 0.5 and 10% of its gross domestic product, with peaks exceeding 20% ​​in the most exposed coastal areas.

Biodiversity

The uniform white that distinguishes glacial landscapes hides an impressive wealth of biological forms. A study from 2015 mapped the biodiversity of ice and perennial snow for the first time, identifying 16 species of mammals (17 with ours), including herbivores such as reindeer, alci and chamois, and their predators, bears, foxes and wolves. And as many as 19 birds, belonging to very different orders, such as sparrows, falconids (such as the royal aquila), Corvidi and Gallinacei. Even invertebrates are also present with many orders in these extreme environments, such as plecoctors, little midges and worms. And this means that the disappearance of glaciers is destined to produce a clear reduction of biodiversity in cold and mountain areas, even if we talk about plant species: it is estimated that a fifth of the plants of the planet would be at risk in a world without its eternal ice.",wired

Breathability: when it comes to running hats, the use of expressions such as ""ventilation"" and ""air circulation"" appear usual, as much as the theme of ""humidity management"", decisive to prevent sweat from annoying too much during the running sessions (and alters its performance). The adjective ""breathable"" often rhymes with holes and/or mesh, which therefore play a functional as well as decorative role.

https://wired.com,"Trump administration instructs researchers to reduce ""ideological bias"" in AI models",https://wired.jp/article/ai-safety-institute-new-directive-america-first/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued new instructions to scientists working together with the American Institute of Artificial Intelligence Safety (AISI). The instructions remove the previously asked references of AI safety, responsible AI, and AI fairness, which researchers have asked to prioritize, instead asking for priority to ""reduce ideological bias in order to thrive and increase economic competitiveness.""

This notification was presented in early March as part of the Joint Research and Development Agreement (updated version) sent to consortium members working in conjunction with AISI. Previous contracts encouraged researchers to have AI identify and correct ""discriminatory model behaviors"" based on gender, race, age, and wealth and poor differences. This is because these AI biases can directly affect end users and could cause unilateral damage to minorities and economically disadvantaged groups.

However, the revised version of the contract removed mentions on the development of tools that ""authenticate content and track its origin"" and the development of tools that ""label synthetic content."" This means that interest in misinformation and deepfake tracing has faded. And the emphasis was on ""America First."" They are asking a working group to develop test tools to ""expand the US's global AI position.""

""The Trump administration has removed the phrases that were considered important to AI: safety, fairness, misinformation countermeasures and responsibility. It's clear what the change means."" Researchers from the organization that collaborates with AISI said.

The researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, points out that overlooking these issues could harm the public. This is because algorithms that encourage discrimination through income and other attributes can be left unchecked.

""Unless you're a tech slut, there's a worse future coming for you and your loved ones. Be prepared for AI to be introduced unfair, discriminatory, unsafe and irresponsible,"" the researcher warned.

Another researcher who has worked with AISI in the past says, ""It's out of control."" ""What does it mean to 'make mankind prosper?'""

The impact of Elon Musk

Elon Musk, who is now leading the controversial efforts to reduce government spending and bureaucracy on behalf of President Trump, criticizes the AI ​​model that OpenAI and Google have built. Last month, Musk posted an image on X labeling Google's conversational AI ""Gemini"" and OpenAI as ""racist"" and ""woke.""

Masks often cite examples of Google's AI chatbot responses. When asked, ""Is it reasonable to mis-gender someone (= Caitlyn Jenner) to prevent the catastrophe of nuclear war?"", the AI ​​responded ""That's wrong."" However, this expected question itself is an unlikely scenario.

In addition to Tesla and SpaceX, Musk runs xAI, an AI company that competes directly with OpenAI and Google. As reported by WIRED, researchers who are advisors at xAI have recently developed new technologies that allow for changes to the political trends of large-scale language models (LLMs).

An increasing number of research shows that political bias in the AI ​​model could affect both liberals and conservatives. For example, a study on Twitter's recommended algorithms published in 2021 showed that right-wing news is more likely to be exposed to users more.",wired
https://cnet.com,"""MacBook Air"" review with ""M4"" -- Not a ""bodied update""",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230758/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Appleが「M4」チップ搭載「MacBook Air」（M4 MacBook Air）を3月に発表した。このウルトラポータブルノートPCについては、新機能に関するさまざまなうわさが飛び交っていた。

これがAppleの主要デバイスでM4チップを採用する最後の製品だったことや、われわれがテストしたノートPCの中で2024年の「M3」チップ搭載MacBook Air（M3 MacBook Air）が最高のものの1つだった（今でもそうだ）ことが、その理由だろう。M3 MacBook Airは、未来を見据えた「大衆向けAIコンピューター」であり、Appleのデザインの最高到達点とみなすことも可能だ。

しかし、MacBook Airの更新をやめるわけにはいかないので、M4 MacBook Airが漸進的なアップグレードとなることは明らかだった。つまり、M3 MacBook Airの長所がさらに強化され、消費者にとってのコストパフォーマンスも少し改善されるということだ。

例えば、M4 MacBook Airの価格は999ドル（16万4800円）からとなっており（16GBのメモリーを搭載する13インチモデルを選択した場合）、2024年のM3モデルよりも100ドル安く（訳注：日本では据え置き）なっている。さらに、ローエンドとハイエンドの両方でハードウェアが強化されており、最もローエンドの構成でも10コアのCPUと8コアのGPUが搭載されている。

一方、ハイエンド構成では、32GBのユニファイドメモリーが選択可能（M3 MacBook Airでは、最大で24GBまでだった）となっている。基本コンポーネントの強化と開始価格の値下げを組み合わせることで、AppleはM4 MacBook Airを戦略的に位置付けている。ますます競争が激化する市場で、M4 MacBook Airを購入する動機を作り出して、競争力を維持することが狙いだ。

M4 MacBook Airは素晴らしいデバイスだが、MacBook Airシリーズの自然な進歩でもあるため、これを「退屈な」アップデートとみなす人もいるかもしれない。それを肯定的に捉える人もいれば、否定的に捉える人もいるだろう。壊れていないものを直すことはできないが、MacBook Airには、もっと大胆なデザインを選択できる余地が幾つかあると思う。

明白な例の1つは、M4 MacBook Airの新色である「スカイブルー」だ。これは非常に控えめな青色である。筆者はMicrosoftの「Surface Laptop」にもう少し近い色を期待していたので、とても慎重な色の選択だと感じた。とはいえ、M4 MacBook Airを際立たせる特徴が幾つかあることも確かだ。詳しく見ていこう。

トリプルディスプレーの衝撃

M4 MacBook Airで特に期待されていた人気機能の1つが、本体を開いた状態で最大2台の外部ディスプレーに出力できる機能だ。3台のディスプレーを同時に使えるこの機能だけでも、仕事や生産作業、クリエーティブなタスクに新たな可能性が開かれ、M4 MacBook Airの競争力が高まるだろう。

本体のディスプレーも相変わらず美しい。Appleの「Liquid Retina」テクノロジーのおかげで、テキストは鮮明かつ明瞭で、動画は滑らかかつ鮮やかに表示される。さらに、このディスプレーは10億色に対応する。最大輝度は500ニトなので、「MacBook Pro」のディスプレーほど明るくはないが、それでもほとんどの用途に十分な明るさだ。

ただし、M4チップ搭載MacBook Pro（M4 MacBook Pro）で提供されている「Nano-textureガラス」へのアップグレードオプションが、M4 MacBook Airでは利用できないことに少し驚いた。私たちが少し過剰な期待をするようになってしまったのかもしれないが、M4 MacBook Airのディスプレーは映り込みが目立つため、さまざまなアップグレードの選択肢がある中で、Nano-textureガラスがなぜ採用されなかったのか疑問に思わざるを得ない。

ディスプレーで気に入らないもう1つの点は、カメラ用のノッチだ。レンズが配置されている部分に黒い切り欠きがあり、貴重な画面スペースの一部が無駄になっている。ツールバーをオンにしたままにしておけばノッチに慣れることができるが、アプリを全画面で表示すると間違いなく目立つ。

強力な生産性マシン

生産性と言えば、M4 MacBook Airの利点は複数のディスプレーだけではない。まず、M4 MacBook Airでビデオ会議をするのは楽しい。ウェブカメラのハードウェアが、2024年モデルの1080pの「FaceTime」カメラから、Appleの新しい「センターフレーム」機能を備えた1200万画素カメラにアップグレードされたからだ。

センターフレームは、2024年秋に発表されたMacBook Proと「iMac」で初めて登場した。これは、M4 MacBook Airを既存のMacBook Proに少し近づける多くの機能の1つである。ご存じない方のために説明しておくと、センターフレームは、デバイスの位置に関係なく、ユーザーがフレーム内で中心に映るように調整する機能だ。ユーザーが最小限の入力をするだけで、ビデオ通話の視覚的な調整を処理してくれる。

これは独立した機能というよりも、ウェブカメラ技術の必然的な未来であるように筆者には思える。これこそがウェブカメラのあるべき姿だ。Appleのイノベーションは、視覚的に美しく洗練された体験をMacBook AirのLiquid Retinaディスプレーで提供する。この体験は、仕事でも、Wi-Fi経由での個人的なFaceTime通話でも同じように楽しむことができる。

最高級のハードウェア、シームレスで効果的に統合された製品、そして、生活の質を高める機能群の相乗効果で、Macでのビデオ通話体験は全体的に向上している。

筆者が普段使用するのは「Windows」デバイスだが、Macも長年使っている。MacBook Airが「Launchpad」、画面分割、「Siri」との直接的なやりとりを組み合わせて、マルチタスクを極めて簡単に処理できることを忘れてしまっていた。さらに、ウィンドウのタイル表示の改善は、デスクトップを特定の方法で配置したいユーザーを大いに満足させるはずだ。",cnet
https://cnet.com,"US NVIDIA stocks plummet by 17% -- Why the introduction of the Chinese-produced AI ""DeepSeek"" is shocking and changes that will occur in the future",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230804/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","In January, a generator AI developed by Chinese venture company DeepSeek was released, shocking the world. It has attracted a lot of attention worldwide, taking the number one mobile app downloads in 140 countries around the world. With the emergence of DeepSeek, the stock price of semiconductor giant NVIDIA fell sharply by nearly 17%, bringing its market capitalization to a negative of approximately 91 trillion yen in Japanese yen. I would like to explain why DeepSeek shocked the world and what changes will happen in the future.

Low cost, low energy, high performance impact

There are multiple reasons why DeepSeek's appearance was so shocking.

First of all, it had the ability to rival previous generation AIs such as ""ChatGPT."" It also supports Japanese input, and questions are answered at a level that is almost the same as those in ChatGPT.

And nevertheless, it is offered at a much lower price than previous generation AIs such as ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is also available for free, but the Plus, which improves performance costs $20 per month, while the Pro, which improves performance costs $200 per month. On the other hand, DeepSeek is basically free for the web chat version. Pay-as-you-go system is only used when using APIs, but this system is also very inexpensive compared to other generation AIs.

Furthermore, the development cost was $5.57 million (approximately 860 million yen), which was less than a tenth of the US competitors, making it extremely inexpensive. It is said that the electricity required is also quite low.

The US has placed restrictions on China on exports of NVIDIA's cutting-edge semiconductors. Despite this, the high-performance DeepSeek has arrived. DeepSeek is believed to have used poorly-performance semiconductors developed for China, which caused doubts about its huge investment in NVDIA and other countries, causing stock prices to plummet.

However, there are reports that DeepSeek had obtained cutting-edge semiconductors via Singapore, so it is important to note that it does not mean that NVIDIA's cutting-edge semiconductors are not necessary.

It is also said that the reason why it was able to be developed at a low cost is because OpenAI's AI was ""distilled"" and trained. Distillation refers to the use of large-scale AI output as a small-scale AI teacher, and OpenAI prohibits such use by other companies. The reason why the development of generated AI is expensive is because training costs, running costs such as power and servers, and labor costs involved in research and development are high.

Answers in line with the Chinese Communist Party's wishes, security issues too

On the other hand, DeepSeek also has problems. It is a Chinese service and the answers have been adjusted to be the official view of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese voluntary censorship is carried out on topics considered sensitive, and the system is designed to avoid questions about geopolitical and sensitive issues, such as the Tiananmen Square incident that occurred in 1989 and the Senkaku Islands issue.

For most questions, if you type in Japanese, the answer will be answered in Japanese, but when you enter something like ""Tiananmen Incident,"" you will only get replied that you cannot answer using standard sentences.

Additionally, data entered by users in DeepSeek is managed on a Chinese server. Chinese companies are required to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence operations under the National Intelligence Act. In other words, the information entered by users is basically thought to be to the Chinese Communist Party.

Security is a concern, and many countries have banned and restricted the use of DeepSeek.

What happens with the arrival of DeepSeek

What changes will happen in the future with the emergence of DeepSeek?

With the emergence of competition, for generation AI such as OpenAI, measures such as reducing costs and improving performance are required. This should work positively for users.

As mentioned above, DeepSeek is generally free of charge. For many users, despite the security issues, the appeal of free is huge, and it is undoubtedly leading to the top downloads.

DeepSeek is likely to prioritize taking share first and use the option of free use, and OpenAI and other organizations are required to compete in other aspects such as performance and security.

The Stargate Project is also underway, an investment to build data centers for AI in the United States. SoftBank has also decided to invest in this, which is likely to lead to the advancement of AI use in Japan. The Stargate Project is also expected to aim to accelerate AI development, improve defense equipment, and enhance information collection and data management.

2025 began with the topic of generative AI. With the emergence of DeepSeek, the development of artificial AI and market battles are likely to intensify even more. Which of the following will take over the genetic AI market? I will not be able to take my eyes off it in the future.",cnet
https://cnet.com,"Finally, I found ""bone conduction earphones"" perfect for swimming and running [Review]",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35229431/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 08:45:00 GMT","Last year I had the opportunity to review two SUUNTO products. The first was a sports smartwatch called ""SUUNTO RACE,"" with high praise for its long battery life and vibrant organic EL display. The other is the headphones called ""SUUNTO WING"", which is characterized by their excellent safety features.

And, the ""SUUNTO AQUA"" I'm introducing this time is the company's latest work, and I've been testing it for a few weeks. It was originally designed for swimming, but I feel it is easy to use in other situations. Because I'm an avid runner and live in the northwest of the United States, I often run in the rain.

SUUNTO AQUA (check price on Amazon)



As this headset can be completely submerged in the water, the sound quality never deteriorated or slipped off even when it got wet in the rain.

SUUNTO AQUA comes in two colors: black and lime blue. The lime blue I tried was a soft-touch navy blue finish with a lime yellow accent color, which looks great. Bright colors not only make it easier to find in your luggage, but it also stands out outdoors, making it a great addition to safety.

Furthermore, I was also interested in the way this product was charged. Many bone conduction headsets use their own magnetic charging cables to maintain high waterproofness, but the SUUNTO AQUA comes with a portable power supply (power bank) that can be clipped to the right body. This allows for two full charges (a total of about 30 hours). The portable power supply itself can be charged via USB-C, so if you don't forget to carry this portable power supply when you take it on a trip or other trip, you won't need a dedicated cable.

The Aqua is equipped with a motion detection sensor that measures stroke posture while swimming, head tilt, breathing frequency, glide time, and more. By connecting to the Suunto app, you can not only manage these swimming functions, but you can also perform functions that allow you to operate them with your head movements, dual device connections, sound modes, button customization, assessments, and firmware updates all at once.

The function of operating the head movement is convenient even outside the pool, and when I actually used it while running or cycling, I was able to answer incoming calls, reject calls, and skip songs without any problems by simply shaking my head vertically or horizontally. For cycling, you can set neck fatigue alerts and range of motion assessments, and the jump assessment function allows you to check the degree of neuromuscular fatigue and understand your own condition.

Another great thing about the design is that the physical buttons on the headset are large and easy to press. There is one on the bottom of the right and one large multifunction button on the left, making it less likely to cause misoperation while running or swimming. Small buttons often cause trouble by groping, but with this design, you can reduce operational errors. Furthermore, the button functions can be customized to your liking using the Suunto app.

The unit has 32GB of internal storage, allowing you to play music where Bluetooth is not reachable or even in the water. Since subscription music services are not natively supported, you will need to transfer your MP3 or other device in advance, but in situations where it does not get into water, you can fully connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth. It's also convenient that you can leave your smartphone to go to training if you use offline playback.

Overall, the sound quality of the SUUNTO AQUA is amazing, and the design of the main unit is also very well thought out. The battery lasts for about 10 hours, and the 35g titanium and silicon body is lightweight and comfortable for long periods of time. The large buttons are easy to operate, and the included power bank allows you to always recharge. Especially for those who enjoy swimming, the great advantage is that they can enjoy music even underwater.

I personally sweat a lot from my workouts and run and cycling in areas with heavy rain, so bone conduction headsets have become an essential item. Even from my perspective, SUUNTO AQUA is a recommended option for those who want to enjoy music underwater or in the rain.

Charlie Javice’s high-profile fraud trial has become a showcase of embarrassing missteps on both sides, with eyebrow-raising details about how JPMorgan Chase was allegedly deceived into buying her startup, Frank, for $175 million when it had just 300,000 customers instead of four million.

Per a new WSJ article, one pivotal moment came when former Frank engineer Patrick Vovor testified that he refused Javice’s request to create fake user data just one week before the sale, recalling she said to him: “Don’t worry. I don’t want to end up in an orange jumpsuit.” When Vovor declined, Javice allegedly turned to a math professor to generate synthetic user data, which was then submitted to JPMorgan. (In court, Javice’s legal team painted Vovor as a scorned suitor.)

In addition to JPMorgan’s failure to properly vet Frank’s user base, other uncomfortable details have been surfaced, including that Leslie Wims Morris, who led the deal at JPMorgan, reportedly sent a note to her team, underlining segments from CEO Jamie Dimon’s annual letter to investors in 2021 and adding that sometimes “there’s no need to do analysis at all.”

Javice’s attorneys said in court that it’s evidence JPMorgan didn’t think it needed to check its work, but Morris testified that it was tongue-in-cheek and written as “a joke to my team.”",techcrunch

Google finally does it: Google made its biggest acquisition in its history this week when it was confirmed that it was buying wiz for $ 32 billion. Google says it will position wiz as a ""multicloud"" offering, meaning wiz will not be a google-only shop. Last year, Google offered Wiz $ 23 Billion for its business. Guess it pays to say no sometimes.

Speaking of Acquisitions: Xai, Elon Musk's Ai Company, Bought Hotshot, a startup working on Ai-Powered Video-Generation Tools. The Acquisition Could Signal That Xai Plans to Build its own video-Generation Models to Compete with the Likes of Openai's Sora, Google's VEO 2, and others.

https://techcrunch.com,The 20 hottest open source startups of 2024,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/22/the-20-hottest-open-source-startups-of-2024/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A new report showcases the 20 top-trending open source startups around the world, more than half of which are closely aligned with AI.

The report is the handiwork of European venture capital firm Runa Capital, which has operated the Runa Open Source Startup (ROSS) Index since 2020. The Index serves quarterly updates on the fastest-growing projects in terms of GitHub “stars” — a metric that’s something akin to a “like” on social media. Beginning in 2023, Runa started producing annual reports, highlighting the most popular commercial open source startups in a given year.

Last year’s report demonstrated that AI and data infrastructure were driving demand for open source tooling, with LangChain hitting pole position in the ROSS Index for its open source framework for building LLM-centric apps.

This year it’s a similar story, with AI central to 11 of the top 20 companies.

It’s worth noting that the ROSS Index is heavily curated and doesn’t include any old open source project. Qualifying projects must be closely linked to a commercial company (i.e., a vendor-led project), meaning no side projects. Additionally, these companies must be younger than 10 years old; raised less than $100 million in funding; and be entirely independent — so not a subsidiary or publicly listed.

Stargazing

In top spot on the 2024 ROSS Index is Ollama, a Y Combinator alum that’s built an open source tool for running LLMs such as Meta’s Llama and DeepSeek locally (i.e., desktop). Ollama’s GitHub star count increased by some 76,000 through 2024, growing 261% to more than 105,000 (it has since risen to more than 135,000 stars over the past few months).

Next on the list is Zed Industries, a cross-platform collaborative code editor “designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.” The Zed project has been around for a while, but it only went open source in January 2024, and through the rest of the year it gained more than 52,000 GitHub stars.

In third place is LangGenius, the company behind an open source LLM app development platform called Dify. The project attained more than 43,000 new GitHub stars last year, growing 326% from around 13,000 to nearly 57,000 — a figure that has since surged to more than 84,000 stars.

And then there is ComfyUI, an open source node-based program for generating images, videos, and audio using generative AI models. The project’s GitHub star count grew 195% to 61,900 stars last year.

Rounding out the top five is All Hands, the company behind an open source platform called OpenHands for building software development agents. OpenHands garnered 39,600 GitHub stars from its launch last March through the end of 2024 and has since added another 12,000 stars to the mix.

While the ROSS Index for last year illustrates the explosive growth in AI and LLMs, it also shows how developer tooling is still hot in the world of open source, with the likes of Zed and Astral’s UV (No. 9) both featuring in the top 10. Elsewhere, the presence of PDF manipulation tool Stirling PDF (No. 7), finance management software Maybe Finance (No. 8), and remote desktop software RustDesk (No. 17) suggests privacy-focused self-hostable tooling is still in high demand.

And Ethereum blockchain-focused Fuel (No. 12) shows that crypto/web3 is alive and kicking.

Open source software by its very nature has always been distributed, given that contributors from all corners of the globe can get involved. This is often the case for vendor-led projects, too; however, commercial entities usually have some center of gravity — even if it just means where it has been formally incorporated.

The ROSS Index for last year shows that San Francisco is home to six of the top 20 ROSS startups, while Canada has three, and Europe (U.K., Switzerland, Hungary, and Czech Republic), Singapore, and China constituting the rest.

Methodology

There are other ways of tracking “hot” open source projects. Two Sigma Ventures operates the Open Source Index, which is similar in concept to the ROSS Index except it showcases the top 100 projects without a specific focus on commercial startups (it also offers different ways of filtering the data).

And GitHub itself offers a top-trending project list, again without the specific focus on commercial businesses.

It’s also worth looking at the methodology behind the ROSS Index. GitHub “stars” can be an imperfect metric, as it merely shows that someone has “liked” the project, as opposed to actively using or monitoring it. Older projects will naturally have procured more “stars,” too, which is why Runa focuses on the relative growth of repositories over a 90-day period for its quarterly reports, and on the absolute number of new stars gained during the year for its annual report.

This also means that the annual report can look quite different to the quarterly reports, given that absolute star counts won’t always align with rapid relative-growth patterns.

There may also be some issues around what is classed as “open source.” While many of the projects on the list have indeed been released under a recognized copyleft or permissive open source license, this isn’t a strict stipulation of the ROSS Index. Runa says it adheres to the “commercial perception” of open source, rather than the official open source definition. As such, a company that has released its software under the Server Side Public License (SSPL), for instance, would still qualify as open source, even though the Open Source Initiative has not rubberstamped the SSPL as “open source.”

Still, the Index is a useful indicator not only of what kinds of open source technology is trending, but also what companies are trying to build businesses atop them.",techcrunch
https://tomshardware.com,Chinese scientists create 'breakthrough' solid-state DUV laser light source for chipmaking tools,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinese-scientists-create-solid-state-duv-laser-sources-for-lithography-equipment-used-in-chip-manufacturing,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:06:28 GMT","Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have created a ""breakthrough"" solid-state deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser emitting coherent 193-nm light used for semiconductor photolithography in a lab, reports the International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE).

If the light source technology can be scaled, this device could be used to build lithography tools that make chips using advanced process technologies. However, perspectives on scaling solid-state lasers are unknown.

Before we discuss how the CAS method works, let's recap the de facto industry-standard method of creating light with a 193-nm wavelength used by ASML, Canon, and Nikon for their DUV litho machines. Also, keep in mind that the CAS system is in its early stages of development, and we are talking about a test vehicle at best.

Traditional approach

DUV lithography machines by ASML, Canon, and Nikon generate 193-nm light using an argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser. The laser chamber contains a gas mixture of argon and fluorine and a buffer gas like neon. When high-voltage electrical pulses are applied, the argon and fluorine atoms become excited and briefly form an unstable molecule called ArF (or excimer), which quickly returns to its ground state, releasing a photon with a wavelength of 193 nm.

The laser emits these photons as short, high-energy pulses at an output power of up to 100W—120W and at frequencies between 8 kHz and 9 kHz for modern immersion DUV tools. The 193-nm beam is then directed through an optical system that shapes, guides and stabilizes the light. It passes into the lithography scanner, where it shines through a photomask containing the chip pattern.

The CAS approach

The test device developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences generates 193 nm light using a fully solid-state approach, avoiding gas-based excimer lasers entirely. It begins with a homemade Yb:YAG crystal amplifier, which produces a 1030-nm laser beam. This beam is then split into two optical paths, each undergoing a different optical process to create the components needed for 193-nm generation.

In the first path, the 1030-nm beam is converted into a 258-nm beam through fourth-harmonic generation (FHG, a nonlinear optical process that transforms a laser beam to one-fourth of its original wavelength, in this case, a 258-nm beam). This part delivers an output power of 1.2 W. In the second path, the other half of the 1030-nm beam is used to pump an optical parametric amplifier, resulting in a 1553-nm beam with a power of 700 mW.

These two beams — 258 nm and 1553 nm — are combined in cascaded lithium triborate (LBO) crystals to generate a coherent light with a 193 nm wavelength with an average power of 70 mW operating at a frequency of 6 kHz. CAS says that the test system has a linewidth narrower than 880 MHz, a performance comparable in spectral purity to that of commercial systems used today.

A comparison?

The CAS system produces 193 nm light using a solid-state laser with a 70 mW average power and a 6 kHz frequency, achieving a narrow linewidth below 880 MHz. The test system's output is orders of magnitude lower than ASML's ArF excimer-based production systems, which deliver 100 – 120W at a 9 kHz frequency.

While the initial CAS system demonstrates capabilities, its low power output makes it unsuitable for commercial semiconductor manufacturing, where high throughput and process stability are essential. It's likely that multiple generations of development would be needed to make this a viable chipmaking light source.",tomshardware

https://tomshardware.com,Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti final specs and launch day allegedly leaked,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-final-specs-and-launch-day-allegedly-leaked,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 18:06:09 GMT","According to a well-known hardware leaker, wxnod, Nvidia and graphics card makers will reportedly release the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards on April 16 at 9 p.m. to compete against the best graphics cards. Meanwhile, VideoCardz has allegedly received and published the final specifications of Nvidia's first mainstream Blackwell-based GPUs today. Keep in mind that the information does not come from official sources, so take it with a grain of salt.

Nvidia's upcoming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, purportedly expected around mid-April, may include two versions: 8GB and 16GB of GDDR7 memory—both potentially featuring the GB206-300 graphics processor with 4,608 CUDA cores and a 128-bit memory interface. The memory subsystem featuring 28 GT/s GDDR7 will provide a peak bandwidth of 448 GB/s, a 55% improvement compared to the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The boards will be rated to 180W total board power.

The increase in the number of CUDA cores, GPU clock, Blackwell microarchitecture optimizations, and software refinements almost guarantee a tangible increase in GeForce RTX 5060 Ti performance compared to its direct predecessor, the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. But there is a major catch.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Specifications

*Specifications are unconfirmed.

That catch is the GeForce RTX 5070, which is based on Nvidia's relatively big GB205 GPU, configured to 6,144 CUDA cores for the desktop version. This GPU produces more compute oomph, and there is no chance that the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti will rival this product.

To that end, the appeal of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti will depend on its price. At a $549 MSRP, the GeForce RTX 5070 looks entirely plausible (by today's standards), though AMD's Radeon RX 9070-series AIBs are on the horizon and cannot be owned at their recommended prices. If Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5060 Ti starts at $499 MSRP, it may not be as appealing as the GeForce RTX 5070 for $549.

Given uncertainties about performance and price, let us briefly discuss compatibility. If unofficial reports about the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti are correct, it is rated for 180W, 150W from an eight-pin PCIe auxiliary connector, 30W from the slot, or 180W from a single 16-pin power plug. The RTX 5070 model is now rated for 250W total graphics board power, so it will require a better power supply.



In any case, remember that we are talking about specifications that do not come from an official source, so take this information with a grain of salt.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,GPU compatibility dilemma brewing as more high-end power supplies ditch 8-pin connectors in favor of new 16-pin,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/power-supplies/gpu-compatibility-dilemma-as-more-high-end-power-supplies-ditch-8-pin-connectors-in-favor-of-new-16-pin,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:26:21 GMT","Since the 16-pin connector was introduced and later revised, melting adapters and PSU/GPU-side connectors on some of Nvidia's mainstream GeForce gaming GPUs have been rampant. Two of MSI's recently launched high-wattage PSUs interestingly feature two 12V-2x6 connectors while providing only one standard 8-pin connector (via OC3D). Unless you get a 12V-2x6 to 8-pin adapter, these PSUs are incompatible with most modern-day GPUs from AMD, Intel, and even Nvidia (RTX 30 and prior), apart from a few specific variants.

The industry (or, more specifically, Nvidia) made the shift towards 16-pin connectors to reduce cable clutter and meet the ever-increasing power demand of new GPUs. After the first GPU meltdown wave hit, the 16-pin standard was revised with pin length changes and is now known as 12V-2x6. Reports of melting RTX 50-series GPU connectors and adapters have been making rounds on the internet, even with the improved standard. This time, it is believed Nvidia's power delivery design might be partially responsible.

It seems the industry is catching on to the 16-pin standard, even at the cost of reduced compatibility with other GPUs. MSI's MPG A1000GS and MPG A1250GS power supplies, targeted at high-wattage GPUs, include two native 16-pin connectors and only a single 8-pin (6+2) connector. If you buy an additional 6+2 connector separately, you can only use a single 8-pin for the CPU, potentially hamstringing CPU performance.



Theoretically, a 225W TGP GPU or lower, like the Intel Arc B580, can easily be powered by one 8-pin connector. However, AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series cannot, as these GPUs typically require two or three 8-pin connectors.

The Shift From 8-pin To 16-pin Power Connectors

To be clear, this isn't the first time we've seen such an implementation. Galax's GH1300 also shipped with a dual 16-pin design, but that PSU was a one-off and unleashed to tame the RTX 4090 HOF that could quickly chug up 1kW of power. As of writing, there isn't any RTX 50 series GPU with multiple 16-pin connectors, so the full potential of these PSUs remains untapped. Nvidia recommends a 1,000W (minimum) PSU for the RTX 5090. This raises concerns about the MPG A1000GS, which is borderline on recommended specs yet ships with two 12V-2x6 connectors.

All things considered, equipping PSUs with multiple 16-pin connectors is counterintuitive for most consumers, especially given the standard's original goal to simplify cabling. For maximum user flexibility, a PSU design should include one 12V-2x6 connector alongside multiple 8-pin connectors to accommodate high-power GPUs from either brand.",tomshardware

Prices start as low as $700 (via Videocardz).

The retailer's website also lists a wide array of unannounced Blackwell GPUs, like the RTX Pro 2000 and RTX Pro 4000 SFF Blackwell, along with their expected prices. We're already aware of the specifications, so this gives us some idea of where the prices stand versus the last generation. Note that these are premature listings that could very well deviate from shelf prices, so we shouldn't read too much into them.

The RTX Pro Blackwell family is the workstation counterpart to Nvidia's Blackwell lineup of GPUs, with a new ""Pro"" modifier to further distinguish these products from other offerings. With the help of 24Gb (3GB) GDDR7 modules, Nvidia has managed a 50% increase in VRAM capacity across the same bus width compared to standard GeForce RTX 50 desktop GPUs. The most interesting thing is the flagship RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell, which packs 96GB of memory in clam-shell mode, where each side of the PCB can host 48GB.

Connections published product listing pages with prices for these Blackwell ProViz GPUs, but they are not yet for sale. The premier RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell has been listed starting at $8,565 ($8,435 in bulk) for a 26% increase over last generation's RTX 6000 Ada. Nvidia offers this GPU in Workstation, Workstation Max-Q, and Server editions; the Max-Q's TGP is capped at 300W, while the server variant relies on external cooling through server fans.

Down the stack is the RTX Pro 5000 Blackwell, listed for $4,569. Depending on your retailer, that's anywhere between the same and 15% more expensive than the RTX 5000 Ada. Nvidia has packaged this GPU with 48GB of memory and a highly cut-down GB202 die in a dual-slot design. Next up is the RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell, which shifts to GB203 and 32GB and is listed for $2,623. That price tag is quite comparable to the RTX 4500 Ada.

While the RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell, with its compact dimensions and single-slot form factor, more or less qualifies as an SFF (Small Factor Factor) GPU, Nvidia hasn't explicitly added an ""SFF"" modifier in its name. We found two listings of this GPU in SFF and non-SFF flavors at $1,546, roughly on par with the handful of RTX 4000 Ada listings we found online.

At the bottom is the unannounced RTX PRO 2000 Blackwell, priced at $700. Like its Ada Lovelace counterpart, it might be scheduled for launch at a later date. Specifications are unknown, though a 128-bit bus and 24Gb GDDR7 combination opens doors for potential 12GB and 24GB (clamshell) VRAM configurations.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,‘Frequently returned item' warning slapped on Snapdragon X-powered Surface Laptop 7 at Amazon,https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:00:40 GMT","Amazon has flagged Microsoft's Surface Laptop 7 as a ""frequently returned item,"" cautioning potential buyers to check customer reviews before purchasing, Windows Central reports. The label suggests that the device has a higher return rate than similar products, though Amazon does not specify the reasons behind it.

One likely factor is the laptop’s use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X platform, which relies on Arm-based architecture instead of the traditional x86 processors from Intel and AMD. While Arm chips offer better power efficiency and battery life, they can introduce software compatibility issues.

Many Windows applications are still optimized for x86 processors, meaning they must rely on software emulation to run on Arm. Although Microsoft has improved emulation with Windows on Arm, specific older applications, professional software, and games may still suffer from reduced performance or fail to run altogether. This limitation has been a common criticism of Windows devices powered by Arm chips.

The situation for gaming is also not ideal. Many games refuse to even run on Windows on Arm platforms, and those that do often offer lower performance than competing x86 platforms. Also, it bears mentioning that Snapdragon's primary selling point was originally centered around far superior battery life over x86 alternatives.

Newer x86 laptops from Intel, like Lunar Lake, have dramatically improved battery life compared to prior-gen models, reducing or eliminating Snapdragon's battery life advantage while preserving full compatibility with Windows software.

The Surface Laptop 7 has a 4.2-star rating on Amazon from over 360 reviews, but 12% of those reviews are one-star. While some users report a positive experience, complaints about software compatibility, performance inconsistencies, and general usability appear to be recurring issues. These concerns may explain why the device has received the ""frequently returned"" warning, as buyers who expect a seamless Windows experience may be disappointed.

Microsoft is expected to address some of these concerns by offering Intel-powered versions of the Surface Laptop. Earlier this year, the company introduced the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro for business customers, powered by Intel’s Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) processors. Similar options will likely be made available for consumer models, though no official timeline has been announced. Switching to Intel chips would remove software compatibility challenges while providing solid battery life and performance.

https://tomshardware.com,KYY X90D Triple Portable Monitor Review: A screaming dual-screen bargain at $250,https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/portable-monitors/kyy-x90d-triple-portable-monitor-review,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

It’s been a year since we looked at KYY’s X90A portable monitor, but the company is back with a new variant called the X90D. The X90D seems strikingly similar to its elder sibling, but has slightly larger display panels, each measuring 15.6 inches across.

The resolution stays the same at 1920 x 1080, and KYY includes what we loved about the original: the integrated kickstand and multiple operating modes to suit your needs. Even better, the X90D is available for well below the $400 price of the X90A we reviewed in early 2024. Does the X90D now allow KYY to strike it big on the list of the best portable monitors ? Read on to find out.

Design of the KYY X90D Triple Portable Monitor

The KYY X90D looks just like the X90A, albeit with slightly larger display panels (15.6 inches versus 14 inches). The similarities pay off regarding build quality, as this is a solid, well-built unit with a chassis made entirely of aluminum. It's also hefty, weighing 3.2 pounds, but that’s the price you must pay to lug around two 15.6-inch display panels and the accompanying hardware.

The X90D’s displays both feature a 360-degree hinge. In the Extended mode, both displays flank your laptop's built-in display. You can adjust the hinge to achieve your desired viewing angle for both. In Presentation mode, you can swing both displays backward to share your screens with people sitting across from you.

There are also in-between modes, which make use of only one panel. Depending on how you position the stand and/or built-in kickstand, you can use just one display mounted horizontally or vertically.

The kickstand is also constructed of aluminum and features a stiff hinge. It can support the full weight of the X90D and is highly adjustable to achieve an ideal viewing angle with the dual displays.

According to KYY, the X90D is optimized to work with 12- to 16-inch laptops. I primarily used the X90D with a 14-inch MacBook Pro , which nestled perfectly between the twin panels. In addition, the black finish of the X90D nearly matched the Space Black of my laptop.

Image 1 of 6 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Each display panel has a set of controls on the bottom bezel. The right display panel features +/-, Menu, and Power buttons, while the left panel features +/- and Menu. There are also only two ports on the monitor, both USB-C.

The X90D will connect with laptops that support Thunderbolt or USB-C with DisplayPort Alt-Mode. If your laptop provides enough juice, the X90D will operate with a single USB-C cable. However, if you need auxiliary power, KYY wisely includes an additional USB-C to USB-A cable and a USB-A wall adapter in the box.

Unfortunately, unlike the Limink LK14 , the X90D doesn’t come with a case or screen protectors. This makes transporting the portable monitor, with its rotating screens just dangling loosely in space when stowed, highly susceptible to damage. I would gladly pay an extra $5 or $10 to get a decent carrying case specifically designed for the X90D in the box from the factory.

KYY X90D Triple Portable Monitor Specifications

Swipe to scroll horizontally Panel Type / Backlight IPS / WLED Screen Size / Aspect Ratio 15.6 inches / 16:9 Max Resolution & Refresh Rate 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz x2 Max Brightness 300 nits Contrast 1,200:1 Ports 2x USB-C (DisplayPort Alt Mode) Dimensions 11.9 x 17.3 x 3.74 inches Weight 3.2 pounds

Connecting the KYY X90D Triple Portable Monitor

Given the lack of HDMI ports on the X90D, you're out of luck if your laptop lacks Thunderbolt ports or support for DisplayPort Alt-Mode over USB-C. This is disappointing for users with older laptops or anyone with a Raspberry Pi who wants to partake in some dual-screen action.

However, since my MacBook Pro has three Thunderbolt 4 ports, it was fully equipped to accommodate the X90D. Better yet, the MacBook Pro can power the X90D with a single cable, which cuts down on the cable clutter that can sometimes arise with competing dual-screen portable monitor solutions.

I'm used to just plugging in a monitor and it being instantly recognized by the operating system. That wasn't the case here. I plugged the X90D into my MacBook Pro, and it powered on. Then, it gave me ""No Signal"" warnings on both displays. It next showed, ""Entering Low Power Mode"" and then shut down. In my haste, I hadn't bothered to look at the quick start guide, which said I first needed to install a display driver for the monitor. Luckily, KYY provides a thumb drive that has both USB-A and USB-C connectors for universal support. I plugged the thumb drive in, selected the version of the driver that supports macOS Sequoia, and installed it on my system.

At that point, I plugged the X90D's USB-C cable back into the MacBook Pro and both displays fired up as expected. MacOS Sequoia defaulted to extend my desktop on the right display and mirror my laptop's internal display on the left display. After navigating to display settings and flipping a couple of switches, I had the X90D operating as an extended display on both panels, expanding my workspace on either side of my MacBook Pro's internal display.

OSD on the KYY X90D Triple Portable Monitor

Each display on the X90D has its own on-screen display (OSD) and set of controls for navigation. This can come in handy, as you can choose from five preset display modes: Standard, Game, Movie, Photo, and Vivid. If you want to devote one screen to watching a movie and one for gaming, you can dial in settings specifically to suit the needs of each.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

It takes a while to become acclimated with the OSD. You first press the Menu button to bring up the OSD, then use the + or – buttons to navigate right or left. You then press the Menu button again to go deeper into a submenu. Once you’ve landed on an actionable item, you can use the +/- buttons to increase or decrease the value (i.e., brightness, contrast, black level, sharpness, etc.).

Besides the usual color and brightness settings, there are controls for the OSD time, and vertical/horizontal positioning of the OSD window. Unfortunately, KYY hasn’t fixed my main gripe with the OSD controls from the X90A. The X90D still positions the controls on the lower right corner (left display) and lower left corner (right display). That places the controls precariously close to the hinge and where your laptop meets the central spine of the X90D. It makes navigating the OSD awkward as you must angle your fingers into the narrow nook to make adjustments.

Image Quality on the KYY X90D Triple Portable Monitor

The X90D is a dual-screen IPS portable monitor, with each Full HD (1920 x 1080) display measuring 15.6 inches across. The monitor has a claimed maximum brightness of 300 nits, a contrast ratio of 1,200:1, and a 60Hz refresh rate. The display panels also have a matte finish, which helps to cut down on reflections.

According to our colorimeter testing, the X90D improved upon the X90A in color performance. In the Standard picture setting (the default mode), we measured 81.3 percent coverage of sRGB and 57.6 percent of DCI-P3. While those are appreciable gains over its predecessor, things took a step backwards regarding overall brightness.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We measured 181.4 nits maximum panel brightness for both panels on the X90D. For comparison, the X90A achieved 227.8 nits with default settings, which was already at the bottom of the class. If there's any consolation, the Game and Vivid modes boosted maximum brightness to 201.2 nits and 203.6 nits, respectively.

I noticed slightly more accurate colors, particularly in the reds and greens, compared to the disappointing performance of the elder X90A. I watched several movies with the left display while going through my daily work routine with my laptop’s internal display and the right display. The 2002 Leonardo DiCaprio flick Catch Me if You Can looked great on the monitor with its 1960’s aesthetic and bright color palette, as did the first three episodes of Marvel’s Daredevil: Born Again. My only major complaint about the monitor is regarding brightness.

With spring approaching, and daytime temperatures in the mid-70s here in the southern states, I like to spend part of the afternoon working on my back porch to get some fresh air and listen to nature. However, the displays weren’t as bright as I wanted them to be to counteract the ambient light. Of course, it’s hard to make fair comparisons when X90D is flanking the far superior (and much brighter) internal Mini-LED display on my MacBook Pro, but KYY could do better here.

Honestly, most people will likely stick to using the X90D indoors, where its brightness was more than adequate under the overhead LED lighting in my home. Whether I was watching movies, working on Word documents, or bashing around in Pixelmator Pro, the dual 1920 x 1080 displays were more than up to the task of handling those tasks.

Bottom Line

The KYY X90D is an impressive piece of kit. It has a well-built and sleek aluminum chassis, and its color performance improves upon the X90A that came before it. However, the X90D isn’t perfect – no product is. Maximum brightness regressed, and KYY still hasn’t changed the awkward positioning of the OSD controls. In addition, KYY doesn’t provide a case in the box to protect the display panels from damage when not in use.",tomshardware
https://zdnet.com,"""MacBook Air"" review with ""M4"" -- Not a ""bodied update""",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230758/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Appleが「M4」チップ搭載「MacBook Air」（M4 MacBook Air）を3月に発表した。このウルトラポータブルノートPCについては、新機能に関するさまざまなうわさが飛び交っていた。

これがAppleの主要デバイスでM4チップを採用する最後の製品だったことや、われわれがテストしたノートPCの中で2024年の「M3」チップ搭載MacBook Air（M3 MacBook Air）が最高のものの1つだった（今でもそうだ）ことが、その理由だろう。M3 MacBook Airは、未来を見据えた「大衆向けAIコンピューター」であり、Appleのデザインの最高到達点とみなすことも可能だ。

しかし、MacBook Airの更新をやめるわけにはいかないので、M4 MacBook Airが漸進的なアップグレードとなることは明らかだった。つまり、M3 MacBook Airの長所がさらに強化され、消費者にとってのコストパフォーマンスも少し改善されるということだ。

例えば、M4 MacBook Airの価格は999ドル（16万4800円）からとなっており（16GBのメモリーを搭載する13インチモデルを選択した場合）、2024年のM3モデルよりも100ドル安く（訳注：日本では据え置き）なっている。さらに、ローエンドとハイエンドの両方でハードウェアが強化されており、最もローエンドの構成でも10コアのCPUと8コアのGPUが搭載されている。

一方、ハイエンド構成では、32GBのユニファイドメモリーが選択可能（M3 MacBook Airでは、最大で24GBまでだった）となっている。基本コンポーネントの強化と開始価格の値下げを組み合わせることで、AppleはM4 MacBook Airを戦略的に位置付けている。ますます競争が激化する市場で、M4 MacBook Airを購入する動機を作り出して、競争力を維持することが狙いだ。

M4 MacBook Airは素晴らしいデバイスだが、MacBook Airシリーズの自然な進歩でもあるため、これを「退屈な」アップデートとみなす人もいるかもしれない。それを肯定的に捉える人もいれば、否定的に捉える人もいるだろう。壊れていないものを直すことはできないが、MacBook Airには、もっと大胆なデザインを選択できる余地が幾つかあると思う。

明白な例の1つは、M4 MacBook Airの新色である「スカイブルー」だ。これは非常に控えめな青色である。筆者はMicrosoftの「Surface Laptop」にもう少し近い色を期待していたので、とても慎重な色の選択だと感じた。とはいえ、M4 MacBook Airを際立たせる特徴が幾つかあることも確かだ。詳しく見ていこう。

トリプルディスプレーの衝撃

M4 MacBook Airで特に期待されていた人気機能の1つが、本体を開いた状態で最大2台の外部ディスプレーに出力できる機能だ。3台のディスプレーを同時に使えるこの機能だけでも、仕事や生産作業、クリエーティブなタスクに新たな可能性が開かれ、M4 MacBook Airの競争力が高まるだろう。

本体のディスプレーも相変わらず美しい。Appleの「Liquid Retina」テクノロジーのおかげで、テキストは鮮明かつ明瞭で、動画は滑らかかつ鮮やかに表示される。さらに、このディスプレーは10億色に対応する。最大輝度は500ニトなので、「MacBook Pro」のディスプレーほど明るくはないが、それでもほとんどの用途に十分な明るさだ。

ただし、M4チップ搭載MacBook Pro（M4 MacBook Pro）で提供されている「Nano-textureガラス」へのアップグレードオプションが、M4 MacBook Airでは利用できないことに少し驚いた。私たちが少し過剰な期待をするようになってしまったのかもしれないが、M4 MacBook Airのディスプレーは映り込みが目立つため、さまざまなアップグレードの選択肢がある中で、Nano-textureガラスがなぜ採用されなかったのか疑問に思わざるを得ない。

ディスプレーで気に入らないもう1つの点は、カメラ用のノッチだ。レンズが配置されている部分に黒い切り欠きがあり、貴重な画面スペースの一部が無駄になっている。ツールバーをオンにしたままにしておけばノッチに慣れることができるが、アプリを全画面で表示すると間違いなく目立つ。

強力な生産性マシン

生産性と言えば、M4 MacBook Airの利点は複数のディスプレーだけではない。まず、M4 MacBook Airでビデオ会議をするのは楽しい。ウェブカメラのハードウェアが、2024年モデルの1080pの「FaceTime」カメラから、Appleの新しい「センターフレーム」機能を備えた1200万画素カメラにアップグレードされたからだ。

センターフレームは、2024年秋に発表されたMacBook Proと「iMac」で初めて登場した。これは、M4 MacBook Airを既存のMacBook Proに少し近づける多くの機能の1つである。ご存じない方のために説明しておくと、センターフレームは、デバイスの位置に関係なく、ユーザーがフレーム内で中心に映るように調整する機能だ。ユーザーが最小限の入力をするだけで、ビデオ通話の視覚的な調整を処理してくれる。

これは独立した機能というよりも、ウェブカメラ技術の必然的な未来であるように筆者には思える。これこそがウェブカメラのあるべき姿だ。Appleのイノベーションは、視覚的に美しく洗練された体験をMacBook AirのLiquid Retinaディスプレーで提供する。この体験は、仕事でも、Wi-Fi経由での個人的なFaceTime通話でも同じように楽しむことができる。

最高級のハードウェア、シームレスで効果的に統合された製品、そして、生活の質を高める機能群の相乗効果で、Macでのビデオ通話体験は全体的に向上している。

筆者が普段使用するのは「Windows」デバイスだが、Macも長年使っている。MacBook Airが「Launchpad」、画面分割、「Siri」との直接的なやりとりを組み合わせて、マルチタスクを極めて簡単に処理できることを忘れてしまっていた。さらに、ウィンドウのタイル表示の改善は、デスクトップを特定の方法で配置したいユーザーを大いに満足させるはずだ。",zdnet

I think many of these alternatives are not more widespread simply because most users do not know them.

Here are five web browsers who deserve to be tested.

1 arc

I guess whoever tests the Arc navigator will definitely want to adopt it. Yes, Arc is really excellent. It took me five minutes to understand that Cart should be my default web browser on macOS, and I do not regret this choice.

What I like most about the Arc browser is its effective management of tabs thanks to a functionality called spaces. Thanks to spaces, you can create different workspaces for the associated tabs and easily switch from one to the other by sweeping to the right or the left (on your touchpad). You can also move tabs between the spaces and save them in the form of a folder.

ARC has an elegant interface and is as efficient as any browser on the market. It benefits from regular updates.

ARC is available for free on MacOS, Windows and iOS. One day, The Browser Company may plan to create a linux version of the browser.

2 hummingbird

Colibri is a browser with a refined interface, designed to be light, compact and fast. It is unique among modern browsers because it does not have tabs. You have a site by window, and that's it. Want to visit another site? Open a new Colibri window!

With Colibri, create an account on which you can record links, lists and streams. Turn between the site you currently consult and your account view to find the site you want to visit. This system maintains the minimalist and easy -to -use hummingbird user interface. Admittedly, this is far from what you are used to, but once you have taken the helping hand and discovered the refined interface, you will quickly appreciate this browser for its speed and simplicity.

Colibri is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows. You can request a free download link at the bottom of the home website home page.

3 Maxthon

Maxthon combines several impressive features in a web browser. Among these are the vocal synthesis, the IA cat, the reading mode, the integrated notebook, the pinned tabs, the extensions, the advertising blocking, the private navigation mode, a free VPN, a integrated password manager, the shared screen, the videos download, data cleaning and a customizable user interface with themes.

With the integrated AI cat, the number of free requests is limited. However, you can select the type of AI you want to use: cats for technology, writing, well-being, and an extraterrestrial for fun. The Chat IA offers two modes: fast mode offers daily free uses, and expert mode requires diamonds (an integrated purchase) and costs depending on the number of conversations.

Maxthon is based on chromium and can be installed for free on MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS.

4 Aloha

Another chromium derivative, Aloha offers a level of safety that Chrome cannot match (at least without significant modifications).

With Aloha, you benefit from a VPN, the blocking of advertisements, a locking by code or biometric, a confidentiality report, a simplified data management, third -party security audits, omnipresent HTTPS and private chat by AI. You also have the translation of pages, a reading mode, a multimedia player, a night mode, a manager of integrated files, multithreads downloads, locked folders, sharing files in Wi-Fi, profiles, themes and much more.

Aloha also offers premium access, which offers you a faster VPN (with more locations), automatic VPN connection, more customizations, advanced file management and much more. Of all alternative browsers, Aloha is the one that most resembles Chrome. If you don't want to change, it's a great option.

Aloha can be downloaded and installed for free on MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS. To find out more, see the Aloha download page.

5 freewolf

Freewolf is based on Firefox. The main difference between the two browsers lies in the fact that Freewolf mainly focuses on confidentiality, security and freedom. It was designed to protect against tracking and fingerprinting, with some additional safety improvements via fixes and parameters. Freewolf also guarantees the absence of telemetry and offers private searches via DuckDuckGo, Searx, Qwant, and many others.

Librewolf is configured to automatically delete cookies and data from the websites when closed, integrates Ublockorigin as soon as the packaging is released, deletes the tracking elements of all URLs, and much more. You will find all the information on confidentiality and security improvements made to freewolf here. Freewolf is aimed at those who appreciate the Firefox user interface but want to take web security seriously.

Freewolf can be installed free of charge on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

6 bonuses: ulaa

I recently discovered another little -known browser who, in my opinion, was to appear on this list. It is Ulaa, created by the developers of the Zoho suite. Ulaa emphasizes confidentiality, security and speed. With ULAA, you benefit from anonymized statistics, from a 24 -hour security correction policy, protection against high -risk threats, automatic updates on all platforms, automatic reset of browser identifiers, geographic insulation of data, the absence of data sent to third parties, the absence of PUSH updates of customers, reported, absence of motion sensors, lack of integration of third -party accounts, lack of network time monitoring, and much more.

Consider ULAA as a clone of chrome, much more secure. You can also use the browser in different modes: work, staff, developer, children, free access and private navigation. Ulaa is also distinguished from many chrome clones by its exceptional speed. I don't think I saw a browser display the ZDNET page so quickly. The rendering speed is greater than that of all the browsers that I have used so far.

Ulaa is compatible with Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS.",zdnet

Despite everything, there is a widget for everyone, and according to the applications installed on your Android device, you will probably find one or two in this article to help you gain in efficiency.

Widgets are additions to your Android home screen which allows you to quickly access applications of applications, applications themselves or services on which you depend. With the right collection of widgets, you can create a quick home screen that allows you to stay informed without opening up the slightest application.

I have traveled the widgets for phones and tablets, and I share those which, in my opinion, will make your phone or tablet more useful.

Google Agenda

Show the month or the whole day

As I regularly consult my Google agenda, I find the widget very useful.

You can add a widget to display the whole month or a daily widget. From each widget, you can consult the events and even press the + button to add an event to your agenda.

Namely: if you use several calendars on Gmail, you will need to add a widget for everyone.

Gmail (or your favorite messaging application)

Add the widget to your default email application (mine is Thunderbird) allows you to have a quick overview of the content of your reception box and easily access the application writing window.

For the Thunderbird widget, press the pencil icon to automatically open the editorial window where you can write an email.

If you depend on your messaging to stay connected, this widget is essential.

3 Keep Notes

Quickly note information

I use Keep Notes daily to quickly note information, share racing lists and much more. I use some of my notes in Google Keep throughout my working day (some contain important links of links).

To quickly access these links, I added the ""Notes"" widget. You can add two widgets: one to scroll through your notes and one to quickly create new notes (text, voice and even images from your camera).

For this widget, I recommend adding the scrolling widget to the tablets and the quick access buttons widget on phones. I favor this option because the screen of your phone is much smaller than that of a tablet, and it is better not to clutter it with too many bulky widgets.

4 Arc Search

Navigate the internet quickly

Arc Search is a great way to do quick research on the internet. The addition of Arc Search as a widget offers functionalities similar to the Google Standard search bar, but automatically opens Arc Search instead of chrome.

If you prefer to get away from Google search, I strongly recommend that you install Arc Search and add the widget to your home screen.

5 battery

Load level information

There is already a battery indicator at the top of your phone screen. However, this indicator does not provide any information on the load level of connected devices.

I can add the battery widget to my home screen to get a quick overview of the load level of my Pixel Watch, my connected headphones, etc. The Android battery widget is an excellent tool for knowing the remaining autonomy of your devices.

6 Pixel weather

For pixel phones only

Android's ""preview"" feature indicates the ambient temperature and you can press it to open the weather app. However, its use is not always simple. We often hesitate to choose between the weather app and the calendar application.

To avoid any confusion, I added the Pixel weather widget. Admittedly, it is an exclusive feature at the pixel, but it is much more practical than trying to read the small characters of the ""preview"" option.

7 Spotify

Access your playlists

Spotify is my favorite musical application on Android and on a computer. The Spotify widget allows me to quickly access my reading lists.

Before running, I just have to press my favorite playlist and leave. Then, as soon as a music is in reading, I can control it from the widget.

How to add a widget to your Android device

This step is simple. Just press an empty space of your home screen for a long time, press ""widgets"", search for the widget to add to the displayed window and drag it to your home screen. You can then resize the widget and move it according to your needs.",zdnet

To answer it, it is essential to understand the functioning of a VPN. So here is an accelerated course on what can (or cannot) do such a tool for your online anonymity.

How does a VPN work?

The principle of a VPN is to establish a encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the Internet access provider. Normally, when accessing a website, your IP address and other personal information is broadcast online. With a VPN, this data first goes through a secure server that takes care of hiding them, strengthening anonymity. In other words, a VPN is used to protect privacy, secure a connection (especially on public Wi-Fi) and possibly bypass certain geographic restrictions.

It is still necessary that the chosen VPN is effective: encryption, confidentiality policy, reliability of the VPN connection ... Different criteria must be taken into consideration to have the assurance that your identity is well protected.

Can a VPN guarantee total anonymity?

The short answer is as follows: yes, but with nuances ... All VPNs are not equal. Free services are often less secure and can keep connection newspapers (logs). This is why, if you are looking to be anonymous, it is best to turn to a paid service. It is also important to verify the privacy policy before taking out a subscription.

To maximize your chances of navigating anonymously, favor a VPN which:

Apply a strict policy of ""no-log"" (no data preservation), this is the case, for example, of surfhark;

Uses high-level encryption (AES-256) and advanced protocols (Kev2, OpenVPN and Wireguard);

Has advanced features such as ""Kill Switch"" and ""Dynamic Multihop"";

Integrates a stealth mode, capable of hiding the fact that you use a VPN.

Anyway, keep in mind that in the digital age, absolute anonymity on the Internet is almost impossible. On the other hand, preserving its confidentiality online is an achievable objective. It is indeed possible to hide your activities, protect your personal data and limit the digital traces left on the sites and applications consulted.

Your online confidentiality is threatened by many elements. If the use of a reliable VPN is effective protection, it is not enough alone. Its effectiveness is also based on the adoption of good practices and other protection tools.

Your online confidentiality threatened by your own accounts

When it comes to preserving your privacy on the Internet, one of the first elements likely to compromise your anonymity remains the use of your personal accounts, starting with those of Google or social networks. Even using a VPN to hide your IP address, connection to these services is enough to identify you and trace your activity online.

Cookies and tracers

Even if you use a VPN, cookies are always able to follow your activity online. Some VPNs offer extensions that settle on the Internet browser in order to block all the tracers and by the way, protect the user from intrusive advertisements.

Risks related to malware

Malventy (or malware) software represents another serious threat. Some are able to steal your identifiers and passwords, while others, such as spyware, monitor your activity. The Keyloggers even go so far as to record the keyboard strikes. A VPN should be coupled with an effective antivirus in order to guard against these threats.",zdnet
