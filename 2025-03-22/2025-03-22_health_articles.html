                <p>PathPresenter is pleased to announce ConsultConnect, a solution for digital pathology consultations and remote second opinions.

ConsultConnect addresses two major barriers to adoption in digital pathology: budgeting and long implementation/integration times. It has no upfront implementation fees or subscription fees, with a minimal annual commitment and simple "per-consult" pricing instead.


With AWS's reliable infrastructure and PathPresenter's expertise, ConsultConnect empowers customers to bridge the gaps in their workflows, making digital pathology a seamless, scalable, and cost-effective solution.

ConsultConnect features all the tools required by pathologists and institution administrators to deliver remote second opinion services globally. Core to the platform is a user-friendly, scanner-agnostic image viewer for pathologists to receive, view, and sign out remote second opinion cases.


The zero-footprint platform is monitored 24/7 by industry-leading security and compliance vendor Vanta for HIPAA compliance. ConsultConnect has been optimized to run on AWS by PathPresenter and partner CitiusTech. With healthcare-focused expertise in medical imaging, CitiusTech leveraged AWS HealthImaging services to ensure ConsultConnect delivers the very best imaging performance and data integrity.


AWS HealthImaging is a purpose-built, HIPAA-eligible service for medical imaging in the cloud, giving customers the performance, scale, and low total cost of ownership needed for large pathology workloads.</p></b>

                <p>A team of researchers from the Institute for Neurosciences, a joint center of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the Miguel Hernández University (UMH), has identified a mechanism that regulates the production of two different proteins from the same gene.

This discovery was carried out in the nematode C. elegans, a small worm widely used in biological research as an animal model. The finding has implications for understanding neuronal identity in vertebrates, as many of the mechanisms discovered in this model are also present in mice, humans, and other species.

The study, led by researcher Eduardo Leyva Díaz, reveals that the ceh-44 gene gives rise to two completely different isoforms. One acts as a transcription factor essential for regulating neuronal genes, while the other encodes a transmembrane protein located in the Golgi apparatus, whose function is still unknown.

The most surprising aspect is that this genetic organization is conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that it could play a fundamental role in neuronal specification in more complex species.

The identity of a cell determines its morphology and functions throughout its life. In the case of neurons, their structure is particularly unique, as once they are formed during development, they never divide again.

This implies that their function must be stably maintained throughout their existence. To achieve this, neurons express a specific set of genes that define their activity within brain circuits.

Any alteration in this process can compromise their function and contribute to the development of neurological disorders.

The team has identified that the production of the neuronal version of the CEH-44 protein depends on a conserved splicing factor, called UNC-75 in C. elegans and CELF in vertebrates.

This mechanism is key to neuronal identity because it enables the selective production of specific proteins in the nervous system. We have demonstrated that UNC-75/CELF acts as a fundamental regulator of this process, promoting the production of the neuronal isoform while suppressing the non-neuronal alternative.

A worm key to understand the brain

The experts used the animal model C. elegans, a small nematode widely used in biology due to its genetic tractability and rapid life cycle.

Despite its apparent simplicity, this worm has a well-characterized nervous system with 302 neurons, whose development and synaptic connections have been mapped in detail.

Working with C. elegans allows us to perform precise genetic modifications quickly and reproducibly, facilitating the identification of conserved mechanisms in neuronal identity regulation.

The study results open new avenues of research in developmental neuroscience. The next goal of the team is to determine whether this splicing mechanism is conserved in vertebrates and how it may affect the formation of neuronal circuits in the brain.</p></b>
