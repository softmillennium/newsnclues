Built by pathologists and powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), ConsultConnect aims to provide leading institutions with the fastest, easiest, and most cost-effective way to scale their remote second opinion programs globally. Designed for institutions with significant subspecialty expertise, ConsultConnect addresses the two major barriers to adoption in digital pathology: budgeting and long implementation/integration times. Instead, there is a minimal annual commitment and simple "per-consult" pricing. At PathPresenter, we aim to shift that perspective by transforming digital pathology into a profit center while expanding institutions' global reach. ConsultConnect has been optimized to run on AWS by PathPresenter and partner CitiusTech. With healthcare-focused expertise in medical imaging, CitiusTech leveraged AWS HealthImaging services to ensure ConsultConnect delivers the very best imaging performance and data integrity, including whole slide DICOM file upload functionality. AWS HealthImaging is a purpose-built, HIPAA-eligible service for medical imaging in the cloud, giving customers the performance, scale, and low total cost of ownership needed for large pathology workloads. AWS services provide robust security measures specifically designed for handling patient data across various healthcare entities. With AWS managed services, PathPresenter is providing low-latency, petabyte-scale digital pathology in the cloud. ConsultConnect will be available to select institutions through an early adopter program.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250322/Groundbreaking-study-unveils-key-mechanism-for-neuronal-identity-regulation.aspx'>Groundbreaking study unveils key mechanism for neuronal identity regulation</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 00:00:00 <p>
One acts as a transcription factor essential for regulating neuronal genes, while the other encodes a transmembrane protein located in the Golgi apparatus, whose function is still unknown. In the case of neurons, their structure is particularly unique, as once they are formed during development, they never divide again. To achieve this, neurons express a specific set of genes that define their activity within brain circuits. Any alteration in this process can compromise their function and contribute to the development of neurological disorders. This work sheds light on how neuronal identity is established and maintained through an alternative splicing mechanism. Splicing is an essential process in gene expression, through which non-coding fragments of messenger RNA are removed to generate functional proteins. In some cases, this process allows a single gene to produce different proteins, depending on how the coding RNA fragments are assembled. This mechanism is key to neuronal identity because it enables the selective production of specific proteins in the nervous system. To develop this research, the experts used the animal model C. elegans, a small nematode widely used in biology due to its genetic tractability and rapid life cycle. Despite its apparent simplicity, this worm has a well-characterized nervous system with 302 neurons, whose development and synaptic connections have been mapped in detail. "Working with C. elegans allows us to perform precise genetic modifications quickly and reproducibly, facilitating the identification of conserved mechanisms in neuronal identity regulation", notes Leyva DÃ­az. Additionally, its transparency allows the visualization of gene expression in living organisms using fluorescence techniques, which has been key in this study. The study results open new avenues of research in developmental neuroscience. In this regard, the researcher emphasizes that understanding how neuronal identity is generated and maintained is "crucial for deciphering the development of the nervous system and could have implications in pathologies where this identity is lost".</p></b><br/><br/></div>
