					Local • Independent • Trusted				

A cascade of actions from the Trump administration represents a “grave threat” to health care, social, educational and other critical services in Indian Country, including for Native American communities in the Northwest, tribal leaders say.

In the past two weeks, the Trump administration has announced the cancellation of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities and 25 Bureau of Indian Affairs offices, representing nearly 30% of all agency locations, including one each in Toppenish, Washington, and Lapwai, Idaho, as part of an effort to decrease federal office space.

Additionally, IHS employees were included in the latest buyout offer from the Trump administration, alarming tribal officials and Indigenous community leaders who fear that any employees leaving the understaffed, underfunded agency will force the shutdown of critical health services.

A steady stream of executive orders from the president and cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency — combined with frequent changes of course — have had a destabilizing effect on agencies that serve tribes, including those in the Northwest. Hundreds of employees at the Bureau of Indian Affairs have been fired. Access to important payment systems has been blocked. Congressionally approved grants have been unilaterally terminated.

The chaos intensifies concerns about whether critical health care services for roughly 3 million Native American and Alaska Native tribal citizens can be preserved.


“Significant underfunding cannot be categorized as wasteful,” said Greg Abrahamson, vice-chair of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the chairman of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, who, along with other Northwest tribal leaders, testified before the U.S. House Interior Appropriations Committee on Feb. 27.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Additionally, IHS employees were included in the latest buyout offer from the Trump administration, alarming tribal officials and Indigenous community leaders who fear that any employees leaving the understaffed, underfunded agency will force the shutdown of critical health services.

A steady stream of executive orders from the president and cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency — combined with frequent changes of course — have had a destabilizing effect on agencies that serve tribes, including those in the Northwest. Hundreds of employees at the Bureau of Indian Affairs have been fired. Access to important payment systems has been blocked. Congressionally approved grants have been unilaterally terminated.

The chaos intensifies concerns about whether critical health care services for roughly 3 million Native American and Alaska Native tribal citizens can be preserved.


“Significant underfunding cannot be categorized as wasteful,” said Greg Abrahamson, vice-chair of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the chairman of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, who, along with other Northwest tribal leaders, testified before the U.S. House Interior Appropriations Committee on Feb. 27.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

For tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems.

Corvallis-based Samaritan Health Services has formally notified its bank that it likely violated its bond terms last year due to losses. While CEO Doug Boysen downplayed the notice, he said the finances in Oregon health care appear untenable statewide and it's the system's “duty” to seek growth while contemplating possibilities such as a merger or one or more outside partners.

“All options are on the table,” he told The Lund Report, adding that the system's overriding goal is to make sure residents in the region continue to have access to care.

“It's a really uncertain environment right now and we are looking at all different potential options to make sure that Samaritan is sustainable into the future,” he said. He stressed that no specific plan has been adopted, and no specific conversations with other health systems or companies have taken place.

In a Feb. 25 letter to U.S. Bank, Daniel B. Smith, Samaritan's chief financial officer, wrote that Samaritan's final 2024 income likely won't meet its debt-service terms with the bank, and that would constitute “a nonpayment related default.”

Boysen said the violation would be a technical one. He said the nonprofit system, which includes hospitals, clinics and a coordinated care organization under the Oregon Health Plan, has reserves and does not have a problem making payments. 

That said, Samaritan's situation reflects what he's seeing and hearing all over the state, Boysen said, with payments under Medicare and the Oregon Health Plan remaining flat or even declining. Indeed, he echoes a common refrain among health care industry observers.

“I believe that health care is unsustainable right now in the state of Oregon,” he said. “I do believe if it continues on this track in five to 10 years, the configuration of how health care systems are made up in the state are going to change dramatically.”

Nearly 90,000 low-income residents of the region are served by the InterCommunity Health Network operated by Samaritan. Past sales of organizations overseeing care for the Oregon Health Plan have been controversial.

I believe that health care is unsustainable right now in the state of Oregon.”

For Samaritan, it likely makes sense to follow the “movement in the state” toward growth, which could include finding a larger partner, as he noted hospitals like Mid-Columbia Medical Center in The Dalles, Bay Area Hospital and Legacy Health have done.

“We believe that it's our duty to be thinking about that and talking about that,” he said.

Samaritan North Lincoln Hospital in Lincoln City is one of two critical care hospitals in the county, comprising a large portion of the rural health care safety net. According to figures reported to the Oregon Health Authority, Good Samaritan Medical Center, the flagship hospital in the Samaritan system, suffered an operating loss of  $7.6 million last year, an improvement over the $28.5 million operating loss the previous year.

Samaritan's notice to its bank cited “decreasing payments from health insurance companies, declining payor mix, and increased utilization on its health plans in excess of premiums received, as well as other industry-wide pressures on expenses, such as labor, supplies, and general inflation.”

Under the terms of the bond covenant, Boysen said, Samaritan was required to hire a consulting firm to help it improve its financial picture. Samaritan hired Warbird Healthcare Advisors of Atlanta, a firm that advises health care organizations on everything from analyzing productivity of physician practices to negotiating sales of client organizations.

Samaritan is facing crosswinds that bedevil many rural and small regional health care systems. A February analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform said financial difficulties threaten to close more than 700 rural hospitals — about a third of all rural hospitals in the country — including seven in Oregon. 

It said the primary driver of rural hospital financial problems is that they are losing increasing amounts of money serving patients with private insurance coverage. But hospital systems around the country also lament stagnant Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements even as care expenses continue to rise.

According to figures reported to the Oregon Health Authority, Good Samaritan Medical Center, the flagship hospital in the Samaritan system, suffered an operating loss of $7.6 million last year, an improvement over the $28.5 million operating loss the previous year. Samaritan also operates hospitals in Albany, Newport, Lebanon and north Lincoln County. It also operates two insurance plans.

Boysen said in December he would resign from his job as CEO this year, and that the company would recruit a replacement. He said this week the board has been evaluating candidates and he expects a decision will be announced within the next 45 days.

Since last year, Samaritan, which employs more than 6,000 people, cut 200 jobs systemwide and reduced hours for some employees and temporarily reduced executive pay. In a prepared statement, Samaritan cited pressures ranging from inflation to a national cyber incident caused it to lose money in 2024. Boysen said this week that the cost-cutting measures launched last August are already paying off. 

“Our January financial metrics look like they're heading on a much more positive pathway right now,” he said.

Boysen said the system's proposed absorption of Stayton-based Santiam Memorial Hospital, a financially challenged 40-bed hospital that serves Stayton and surrounding communities, reflects Samaritan's quest for “economies of scale.”

Under the terms of the proposed acquisition, Samaritan said it would build a $15 million medical office building in Stayton and supply the smaller hospital with $10.5 million for capital expenses. It also said it would assume about $25 million of debt Santiam owes to the federal government and Key Bank.

While that purchase is not final, it would expand Samaritan's coverage area deeper eastward into Linn County and eastern Marion County, and buttress the system's already dominant market position in its core region of Lincoln, Benton and Linn Counties. 

One concern raised publicly by commenters on the proposed acquisition is that the deal would mean Santiam patients who are covered by United Heallthcare insurance plans would no longer be in the Santiam network.

“After the merger, where will United Healthcare patients go for care?,” asked Kristin Thompson in her communication with Oregon's Health Care Market Oversight program of the Oregon Health Authority.

As Samaritan weighs its options in the months ahead, Boysen said, it is conscious of the need to make sure residents have access to local health services, even if absorption by a larger partner means they are not provided under the name Samaritan. 

“The core issue for us is that you have this hyper-rising inflation market where our supply expenses, pharmaceutical expenses, all our labor expenses have gone up exponentially over the last three or four years,” he said. “Seventy-five percent of our revenue, our payer mix, is from Medicare and Medicaid (in which) we've seen hardly any increase to the revenue side.

“And there is a point where the math doesn't work.”

SOUTH KINGSTOWN – When nearly the entire team of hematology oncology providers abruptly resigned from South County Hospital last June, their departure was discreetly announced in a newsletter to the medical staff.

That may have been the end of it – except that patients and former medical staff started questioning the hospital's version of events that a divergence of perspectives on how to handle the cancer center's finances created a rift between the institution and the providers. Soon an opposition group formed, which claimed the blame lay with the hospital's top administration.

The opposition group, dubbed Save South County Hospital, held public forums calling on the hospital's top administrators to resign, sent letters to the hospital's board and appealed to state authorities to intervene. It also set up a website to press forward with its public information campaign.

The hospital, for its part, launched an entire landing page on its website dedicated to “addressing the facts” – defending the hospital's administration, explaining departures of physicians and the hospital finances. It also held news conferences, community forums, and question-and-answer sessions in response to Save South County Hospital's efforts.

Now, more than half a year after it all started, the battle for South County Hospital is heating up.

On March 11, the hospital filed a lawsuit against Save South County Hospital and Claudia Swain, a former development executive who managed donor relationships.

The lawsuit claims Swain disclosed confidential information to Save South County Hospital to convince donors to stop financially supporting the hospital.

“Though [Save South County Hospital claims] to advocate for quality care, their actions threaten the very funding that enables us to maintain that standard. By targeting donor contributions, they risk creating the very lapses in care and quality they profess to oppose,” says a news release provided by Matt Moeller, director of marketing and communications at South County Health, the parent organization of South County Hospital.

Save South County Hospital's Director Steven Fera, a former cardiologist at the hospital, denies that any disclosures of confidential information occurred and says that a list of the donors to the hospital are all on publicly available plaques in the hospital lobby.

He chalked off the lawsuit as an attempt to stifle opposition.

“This lawsuit is nothing short of a shameless, desperate stunt designed to choke off dissent and cover up the catastrophic fallout of gross mismanagement at South County Hospital,” Fera said.

In a separate news release sent to media Wednesday, Save South County Hospital announced it is convening a special meeting of members of South County Health's endowment on April 3. At the meeting, which will be open to the public, members will seek to elect nine additional trustees to the hospital's board to “right the hospital's ship.”

But, in an email to the media Thursday, Moeller said the meeting did not meet the criteria to be considered a meeting of South County Health's endowment.

“Any decisions or votes taken at this gathering hold no validity or authority to enact change at [South County Hosptial],” Moeller wrote.

Fera disagrees.

“The meeting has been thoroughly researched by lawyers and is legally able to be held to provide opportunities for new leadership at the hospital,” he said.

South County Hospital has an annual meeting scheduled for April 7, which will include the board of trustees, the health system's executive leadership and members of South County Health's corporations. It is not open to the public.

Tension between South County Hospital's leadership and Save South County Hospital has been building since the beginning of the year. The group held a meeting on Jan. 28 at South Kingstown High School, where former patients, providers and stakeholders spoke. About 300 people attended the event, according to the group.

Earlier in January, a separate group of more than 60 donors, former trustees and staff sent a letter to South County Hospital's Board of Trustees asking the hospital to rehire the hematology oncology providers who resigned, remove CEO Aaron Robinson and pursue a partnership with a larger health system. The letter was unaffiliated with Save South County Hospital, though Fera and Chris VanHemerlrijck, also one of the group's directors, were among its signers.</p>

With one less hospital in the area after the closure of East Ohio Regional Hospital in Martins Ferry, emergency medical response staff say patients could see delays. 


MARTINS FERRY — After weeks of uncertainty, East Ohio Regional Hospital officially closed its doors Thursday night, the impact of which is rippling through the surrounding healthcare landscape. 

Local hospitals are preparing for larger patient loads during an abnormally busy year, while first responders say they expect longer transport and wait times for emergency medical services. 

Cumberland Trail Fire Captain Jeremy Rife said it is normal for his department to take multiple patients to EORH a day as it is one of the closest facilities for them. Now, having to drive patients further to WVU Medicine Barnesville or Reynolds Memorial hospitals will make turnaround times for EMS longer. 

The closure will also have a ripple effect on local hospitals who will be forced to take on more patients than usual, Rife said. 

“I think one of the biggest things is that it's going to overwhelm other hospitals and cause them to possibly have to go on diversion more often and they're just going to have to work a lot harder to get patients through that can no longer go to EORH,” Rife said. 

OR&W Fire Chief R.C. Fellows echoed this concern, noting that a particularly bad flu and COVID season has already been overwhelming hospitals in recent months. 

“The hospitals have been overloaded right now regardless and with taking an ER away from us it's going to really impact all of these hospitals because they're getting more and more patients and we've been busier than we've probably ever seen before,” Fellows said. 

Patients with a preference for EORH or who have established providers there are also being forced to make changes, Rife said. 

“There are a lot of patients that prefer to go to EORH now they're having to switch up where their doctors are and stuff like that and just try to find different options,” Rife said.

Health Department Deputy Commissioner Robert Sproul emphasized that Belmont County is already an area with a shortage of physicians.

“Any time we lose medical services it is a detriment to the county. So it's very sad to see [EORH] close because there's a lot of services, a lot of care that they're providing to the community,” Sproul said. “As a health department our job is to fill the gaps and help the community in any way we can.” 

Sproul said the county leaned on EORH for things like infectious disease reporting and general medical services, much of which will now be diverted across the Ohio River. He said he hopes Wheeling-area hospitals can sustain the increase in patient load. 

He also noted how difficult it is to get a hospital up and running again after a closure, which EORH has already seen once before in its troubled past. 

“Anytime we lose these services, it's hard to get it back. The first time [EORH] closed, look how long it took to reopen. The worry is, how long will it take for another entity to move into that facility to provide care to the county again? That is a concern,” Sproul said. “It's just a sad day, that's for sure.” 

A statement from WVU Medicine – which has Wheeling, Reynolds Memorial, Barnesville and Weirton hospitals in its fold – extended “good thoughts and prayers to fellow caregivers and support staff” at EORH. 

The statement said WVU Medicine's hospitals are prepared to take on the additional patient load – and potentially offer jobs to some of the laid off EORH healthcare staff. 

“Our hospitals and clinics in eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia stand ready to care for East Ohio's patients, and we encourage the hospital team members to explore opportunities to join our team at WVUMedicine.org/Careers,” the statement read. 

The Ohio Department of Transportation said counties will soon work to remove EORH from highway signs indicating that it is the nearest hospital.

HONOLULU (Island News) -- "I'm originally from New Jersey. I've been on island for about six and a half years," said Keri Anacker.

Anacker is a school psychologist, who spent years in grad school for her specialist degree.

Now she works at a number of public schools assessing students for special education, then comes up with plans to help them.

Local lawmakers want to spend millions to attract and keep new healthcare professionals in Hawaii through a bill that forgives loans used when studying for their profession.

In her move to the islands, she brought more than just her belongings.

"I accumulated I want to say about a little under $30,000 in student loans," stated Anacker.

She said she would pay a little each month, but planned on paying for ten years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Instead, she signed up for a Hawaii program that nearly wiped it all away.

"I got awarded the money 2024. I had about $26,000 in student loan debt and they sent a check to my loan servicer for $25,500," said Anacker.

She is one of the nearly 900 healthcare workers, who took part in the loan repayment program over the past two years.

Now lawmakers want to set more money aside to help hundreds more Hawaii healthcare professionals.

"$30 million, that is $15 million in each of the next two years, which pays for the loans that people take out when they study to become doctors, nurses, physician assistants, social workers. This pays back the amount of money they took out in loans up to $50,000," said Rep. Gregg Takayama.

The program is a popular one, with more than 1,300 people on the wait list, but it does come with an important requirement.

"As part of forgiving of their student loans, they have to agree to serve at least two years in a rural area, which in Hawaii is almost all of Hawaii. So we get back committed healthcare workers to serve in our community. That meets a real shortage we have of healthcare workers all across the board," added Takayama.

The House bill survived crossing over to the other side of the State Legislature, but now will be heard by the Senate Ways and Means committee, which reviews all bills with a financial impact.

For new healthcare workers like Anacker, the program has made a difference in her Hawaii career.

"Although this program didn't help bring me here, it's definitely helped to retain and keep me here," stated Anacker.

She is a such a fan of the program. She's also reached out to other current and former students, to let them know about the loan repayment program and encourage them to come to Hawaii.

"I'm hoping to bring more people to the island because of it. So I'm hoping to even recruit, more healthcare workers and mental health workers like myself," added Anacker.

OREGON, USA — Oregon Health & Science University and UnitedHealthcare have reached a "good-faith agreement" on a new contract, according to a statement from the hospital system on Friday. About 74,000 people in Oregon will be looking for a new doctor at the end of March if the two sides do not finalize the deal.

Health care providers like OHSU have contracts with insurance providers, agreeing to reimbursement rates that the insurance company will pay for medical services. But United's contract with OHSU ends on March 31, and if they don't negotiate a new one by April 1, OHSU's doctors will be "out of network" for patients with United insurance.

That means United patients can still go to an OHSU doctor, but it will cost them significantly more, and OHSU says patients might not even be able to stay in the hospital. If patients remain on March 31, OHSU said on its website that it will make sure they are stable, but on April 1, patients may be asked to leave and find a hospital that's still in United's network.

All United patients will need to find a new doctor within United's network — but an appointment, particularly with a specialist, is likely months away.

OHSU said that patients can ask United for "continuity of care" service by April 30, but it is up to United whether they approve it.

In a statement banner posted on OHSU's site Friday evening, the hospital system signaled that they may be close to a deal:

"We are pleased to share that OHSU, Adventist Health Portland and Hillsboro Medical Center have each reached a good-faith agreement with UnitedHealthcare and and are working to finalize contracts before the expiration deadline."

Both United and OHSU declined interviews with KGW.

OHSU has said that "operational and financial issues" with United are disrupting care. OHSU added that United denies more than 56% of claims compared to an industry standard of 5% to 10%, and that it takes an average of 307 days — almost an entire year — to resolve claims.

United has not responded to those claims, but they have said they are contending with "unreasonable price hikes" under OHSU's proposed contract, claiming that if they agree to what OHSU wants, a C-section would cost $9,000 more than it does today; outpatient surgery would cost $3,000 more; and an ER visit would cost $1,100 more.

OHSU responded to an email from KGW regarding the claims, saying they haven't reviewed the cost claims and can't verify how United calculated those figures.

Meanwhile, both sides say they're still at the negotiating table, so it's possible they could reach a deal before April 1.

Becky Hultberg, president and CEO of the Hospital Association of Oregon said in part:

"We have seen increased friction between insurers and providers since the pandemic. It really comes down to basic math. Hospitals aren't being paid enough to cover the cost of caring for patients."

"Over the past few years, some insurers have pocketed record profits, at a time when about half of Oregon's community hospitals have been consistently operating in the red. This is a serious issue that all Oregonians should care about because no organization — or household, for that matter — can operate indefinitely in the red," said Hultberg.

WICHITA FALLS, Texas (KAUZ) - High school students got an up-close and personal look at the many career paths available in healthcare, thanks to a collaboration between the North Central Area Education Center, MSU Texas and Vernon College.

“We want them to be able to see the campus, touch the materials, interact with the students and the faculty so that they can just really get a good idea about if this is the direction it's going, what's it going to look like,” community base educator Paige Rask said.

This healthcare high school tour is sparking the interest of high school students in the area, long before they set foot in a formal college classroom setting.

“A lot of times students go in knowing I want to help somebody. That's what I want to do long term. I want to help somebody, but many times they don't know all of the different programs that we have to offer and so this gives them exposure to every single one of them, whether it's radiology, social work, dental hygiene, athletic training, all of them. I'll say for respiratory therapy we actually had some cadaver pig lungs that we had. We have a healthy set and we had one that was exposed to cigarette smoke. It allows the students to see what kind of damage can actually be done to the lungs,“ director of interdisciplinary education Randy Case said.

“In dental hygiene they got to clean teeth, they go through the sterilization, they look at even making models and taking x-rays and so each department really brought its own and let them really get a good idea about what they would see, feel, and interact with as a student,“ Rask said.

During the tour, each department added its own touch with unique activities in each profession.

For some students it wasn't just about exploration, it was discovering new and valuable skills, like working on a team.

“Everyone's a team, even though there's so many different ways that you can be a health care provider,“ Windthorst High school student Lane Hale said. 

“Just communication is a big key, a big part of it. Teamwork, like they said earlier, but just listening and observing bigger patients and everything,” Iowa Park High school Trinitey Sousa said.

At its core, this event offered more than just exposure as students were being guided, leading students to take meaningful step into their future.

“What we really hope that this does is just help inspire students to get excited to possibly open their minds up to different opportunities and they knew that were even available. Really give them a good idea about what not only does it look like in college, but what it could look like as their career,“ Rask said.
