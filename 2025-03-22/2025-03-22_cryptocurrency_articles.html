According to Milk Road, a cryptocurrency investor has made a substantial purchase during a market dip, as highlighted in a recent tweet. This move suggests a strategic approach to capitalize on lower prices, potentially indicating an expectation of future market recovery. Such actions are typical in trading strategies that focus on buying low to sell high, reflecting confidence in the market's potential rebound. Traders should monitor these trends for potential signals of market sentiment shifts.

        Share    

On March 20, investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano stated on Fox News, “There's a global race going on–Russia, Abu Dhabi, El Salvador, Bhutan–all these other countries are trying to buy Bitcoin… the same way that there was a space race there's now a Bitcoin race.” 

The idea of a Bitcoin “race” is now a reality as world leaders actively discuss the urgency of either establishing digital asset reserves or embracing cryptocurrency as legal tender. 

El Salvador, in 2021, became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, purchasing over 2,000 Bitcoin as part of a national reserve to foster financial inclusion and economic growth. The move has been both celebrated and criticized due to Bitcoin's volatility. Similarly, in 2022, the Central African Republic became the second country to adopt Bitcoin, viewing the cryptocurrency as a tool to improve economic development and financial inclusion in one of the world's least developed nations. 

Both countries' actions reflect growing interest in Bitcoin as an alternative financial strategy. It's hard-capped at 21 million, and in 10 years, most of it will be mined.

The theory is that the countries considering Bitcoin a valuable reserve asset will strive to establish as much ownership of the total BTC supply as possible. 

Proponents believe scarcity and growing demand will drive Bitcoin's value, making large BTC holders influential. 

One of the most prominent Bitcoin evangelists, Michael Saylor, said that 78% of the U.S. was bought for $40 million at some point. The former CEO of MicroStrategy referred to various land acquisitions, such as the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 to illustrate why the U.S. government should buy Bitcoin now when it's “cheap.”

In a recent speech, Saylor called the next decade “a digital gold rush” and compared Bitcoin to the Manhattan Project, dubbing it “digital energy.” 

“Today, Bitcoin represents the digital capital network, controlling 99% of power within the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” he said. “The U.S. government recognizes only Bitcoin as legitimate digital capital. To secure the future of cyberspace and maintain global financial dominance, America must adopt Bitcoin strategically. Only Bitcoin—and U.S. Treasuries—have the liquidity and global trust required to serve as reliable reserve assets worldwide.” 

No wonder Saylor has been vocally supportive of government officials pushing to increase the U.S.'s BTC stockpile. 

President Donald Trump, Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, and Bo Hines, the Executive Director of the President's Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, have all expressed a desire to increase the U.S.'s Bitcoin reserve.

We want “as much as we can get.” – @BoHines on Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/Sy86En8N1Q

Like Saylor, Pompliano (among the most vocal crypto advocates in the U.S.) considers the Trump administration's focus on Bitcoin dominance important.

Speaking about the future price of Bitcoin, Pompliano said during a Fox News appearance that he doesn't know when BTC will hit one million. However, he is seemingly confident that, like gold, its value will increase from where it currently is today. 

At last check, Bitcoin is trading at just above $84,000. 

“I think people are drastically underestimating how maniacal they are going to be about buying Bitcoin,” Pompliano said. “Everyone thinks it's cute that they put 200,000 Bitcoin over here and now we have this reserve — they are going to continue to buy Bitcoin.”

Apart from the U.S., Pompliano named Russia, El Salvador, Bhutan, and the United Arab Emirates. Indeed, all of these countries reportedly have Bitcoin holdings, but not necessarily all of them explicitly expressed their desire to buy more. 

It is not quite clear how much crypto Russia holds. However, it is known that Russia has large-scale mining operations while local companies use crypto for international trade and dodging Western sanctions. 

Pompliano neglected to mention several leading Bitcoin holders, including China, which is the second biggest BTC owner after the U.S. 

The United Kingdom and Ukraine currently follow China, according to BitBo's Bitcoin Treasuries page. 

All these countries have different strategies:

More than that, some corporations, most notably Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and asset manager BlackRock, are among the world's biggest Bitcoin holders, capable of competing with leading nations in terms of Bitcoin dominance. Both firms own or manage around 500,000 Bitcoins (over 2% of the total supply). As of March 2025, no country holds even half that amount. 

European countries have been cautious and innovative in their interactions with blockchain solutions. For instance, Estonia is one of the world's pioneers in adopting blockchain for elections and healthcare data management. However, the EU countries take a conservative stance when it comes to crypto reserves. High volatility and low liquidity are the main reasons for rejecting Bitcoin's reserve establishment. 

Similar reasons are cited by Switzerland, South Korea, Japan, and other countries that seem unbothered by America's passion for winning in the Bitcoin musical chairs game. Germany went so far to sell thousands of Bitcoin.

Crypto.news asked Genius Group, a company using Bitcoin as a corporate reserve, how they time the market. 

“As fundamental believers in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, we don't try to time the market, but rather buy and hold with the intention of never selling,” a spokesperson responded.

Let's assume the so-called Bitcoin race exists, as Pompliano described it. If we compare it to space or the Manhattan Project, we must ask ourselves: Were the countries that didn't have spacecraft or atomic weapons in the 20th century left with nothing?

Mokena Village Hall on Monday, Oct. 8, 2018, in Mokena (Alex Ortiz)

A Mokena resident won back more than $100,000 that was lost in an overseas cryptocurrency scam thanks to a Mokena police detective and Will County prosecutors.

The investigation of the scam began Sept. 11, 2024, when a Mokena resident reported losing more than $150,000 from an online scam involving cryptocurrency, according to a statement from the Mokena Police Department.

“The victim advised that in July of 2024, they responded to an online job ad presented as a commission-based, remote work opportunity aimed at optimizing app developers,” police said.

The victim was directed to set up a cryptocurrency exchange account and transferred funds “across the accounts as directed” by fraudsters for the next few months, police said.

The investigation revealed a “portion of the funds” were held on a cryptocurrency wallet controlled by a person with a Nigerian passport and using an internet protocol address out of Cambodia, police said.

The financial institution hosting the cryptocurrency wallet had more than $101,000, police said.

Police investigators and prosecutors worked to freeze and seize the funds so they could be returned to the victim, police said.

Mokena Police Chief Brian Benton thanked the work of Mokena Police Detective Darin McVicker, who worked “vigorously to locate the lost money and to seek out those responsible for committing this fraud.”

Benton also thanked Assistant State's Attorneys Mike Casson and Dant Faulk for their assistance in the investigation.

“While it is unfortunate that we were unable to arrest those responsible for committing these crimes, we are glad we were able to return a significant amount of the lost money,” Benton said.

Mokena Police Chief Brian Benton, a former police chief in Joliet, issued a statement Friday thanking detectives and prosecutors for recovering a large amount of money stolen from a Mokena resident in a cryptocurrency scam. (Eric Ginnard)

Oops, something went wrong

Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) Reserve and the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The former will hold Bitcoin -- no surprises there. The latter will hold four more of the largest cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA).

The fact that the U.S. is stockpiling crypto is exciting news for crypto investors. But are these good cryptocurrency investments? Let's take a closer look at each one.

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and has also been the most successful. At the time of writing, its market cap is $1.7 trillion, larger than that of every other cryptocurrency combined. Over the last three years (as of March 19), Bitcoin's price has increased by 98%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 27% return.

While Bitcoin was intended as a decentralized digital currency, transactions are too slow and expensive for it to work as a payment method. Processing times generally range from 10 minutes to over an hour, depending on network congestion, and fees are around $1 per transaction.

Despite that, Bitcoin has caught on as a digital store of value, or "digital gold." The supply is capped at 21 million Bitcoin, adding an element of scarcity to it. If you're looking for a way to hedge against inflation or add cryptocurrency to your portfolio, Bitcoin is worth considering.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it became popular through introducing smart contracts. A smart contract is a program built into a cryptocurrency's blockchain network to record transactions.

Developers can use smart contracts to launch decentralized apps (dApps). This gives Ethereum a wide range of uses, including decentralized finance (DeFi) services, such as crypto lending platforms, blockchain gaming, and launching new crypto tokens.

Because Ethereum was the first to offer smart contracts, it has a large lead in terms of market share. According to DefiLlama, Ethereum currently has $46 billion in total value locked into its DeFi applications, the most of any blockchain.

On a negative note, Ethereum's performance lags behind other smart contract blockchains. The average transaction fee is $0.19 as of March 19, compared to $0.00025 for rival Solana. Ethereum has also lost 34% of its value over the last three years. You're better off avoiding Ethereum until it proves that it can reverse this downward trend.

XRP is the native cryptocurrency for Ripple, a blockchain designed as a cross-border payment solution. The current system of choice for international payments, the ​​Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), can take three to five days for international banking transfers. Fees generally cost $15 to $50, depending on the banks involved.

On the Ripple blockchain, transactions process within four to five seconds for a fee of 0.00001 XRP, a fraction of a cent. In addition to being used for its minimal transaction fees, XRP is also a bridge currency used to facilitate international transfers.

With a real-world use case, XRP is one of the stronger crypto investments currently available. Over the last three years, it has topped every other cryptocurrency on this list with its 187% return. Its biggest headwind since 2020 has been a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but on March 19, RippleLabs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had dropped the lawsuit.

Solana is a competitor to Ethereum, as it also provides developers with a platform to launch dApps. The difference is Solana's unique proof-of-history system for validating transactions, which makes it a far more efficient blockchain.

As mentioned above, the average transaction fee on Solana is just $0.00025. It processes over 4,000 transactions per second (tps). In comparison, Ethereum processes about 17 tps, because it hasn't developed a fast method to validate transactions like Solana has.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Solana is a high-risk, volatile investment. But it's up 39% over the last three years, and its speed and low costs should continue attracting developers to the Solana ecosystem.

Cardano is another Ethereum competitor that supports smart contracts and allows for the development of dApps. It helped popularize the proof-of-stake system, where people who own a cryptocurrency can pledge their tokens to be part of the transaction validation process and earn rewards. The proof-of-stake system has minimal energy requirements, and even Ethereum adopted it in 2022.

One of the unique things about Cardano is the developers' dedication to using peer review and evidence-based research. This hasn't always been to its benefit, though. Cardano's development has been notoriously slow. For example, it didn't introduce smart contracts until 2021.

Cardano's price has decreased by 18% in the last three years. As with Ethereum, it's best to see if Cardano can build any forward momentum before committing your money to it.

Just because the U.S. government will be stocking up on these five cryptocurrencies doesn't mean you should invest in all of them. Cryptocurrency is a risky, unproven asset class. Two of the cryptos on this list, Ethereum and Cardano, have lost value over the last three years. Even though the others have done well, they're still highly volatile.

As far as crypto investments go, Bitcoin is the safest option, relatively speaking. It's the most well-known cryptocurrency, and it has been the largest since the very beginning. If you're looking for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, XRP and Solana are two standout projects. With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, you could have a solid crypto portfolio that covers multiple use cases.

No matter which cryptos you choose, be careful about your asset allocation. Because of the risk involved, cryptocurrency shouldn't be more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio. Use the rest to invest in stocks, bonds, and other stable assets.

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $305,226!*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you'd have $41,382!*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you'd have $517,876!*

Right now, we're issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

The bitcoin price has flat-lined through March, stuck at around $85,000 per bitcoin, despite a huge, prescient bitcoin price prediction setting the market alight.

Now, as the Federal Reserve could be gearing up to open the “floodgates,” a senior White House official has revealed the U.S. could use its gold reserves to buy bitcoin.

“If we actually realize the gains on [the U.S. gold holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more bitcoin,” Bo Hines, White House executive director of the president's council of advisers on digital assets, said in an interview with the Crypto in America podcast, adding there's been “countless ideas” and the "best ideas” will be enacted by Trump.

"I'll actually point you to senator [Cynthia] Lummis' Bitcoin Act of 2025, in which she believes that we can identify the real true value of some of these gold certificates,” Hines said.

Lummis reintroduced her Bitcoin Act this year, proposing the U.S. buy 1 million bitcoin, around 5% of the total bitcoin supply, over five years through the sale of Fed gold certificates.

Earlier this week, speaking during a bitcoin and crypto conference, Hines said the U.S. wants "as much [bitcoin] as we can get.”

“It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what president Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines said, referring to Trump's executive order that prevents the sale of bitcoin and crypto that U.S. has seized.

Trump also addressed the conference, promising in a pre-recorded message that he will make the U.S. “the undisputed bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world … Pioneers like you will be able to improve our banking and payment system and promote greater privacy, safety, security and wealth for American consumers and businesses alike," Trump said. "You will unleash an explosion of economic growth."

Trump's comments, piling praise on bitcoin and crypto technology, companies and investors, have reassured the market that he remains committed to crypto.

“Bitcoin is rewriting the rules of wealth creation and economic freedom for all—a truth president Trump recognized at the Digital Assets Summit by vowing to make the U.S. a ‘bitcoin superpower,'” Cory Klippsten, the chief executive of bitcoin-only app Swan Bitcoin, said via email.

“Nation-state adoption is inevitable, but the real revolution lies in empowering individuals to shape a more fair and prosperous future.”

The recent bitcoin price stagnation has been blame on macro economic factors, though many crypto market watchers remain confident the down turn is a temporary correction rather than the beginning of a long-term trend.

“The bitcoin bearish price action is being driven by exogenous factors like trade wars, uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies as well as geopolitics. The world is going through major structural changes, and we believe both bitcoin and gold will outperform other asset classes in the coming months,” Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at Switzerland-based hedge fund Tyr Capital, said in emailed comments.

"Zooming out bitcoin is still performing relatively well and will most probably be well supported around the $75,000 level. We still expect to see new record highs above $125,000 in 2025.</p>

According to Cas Abbé, when considering purchasing cryptocurrencies, traders should focus on projects with robust technology, well-structured tokenomics, and verified founders. Strong technological foundations can facilitate mass adoption, while balanced tokenomics with non-aggressive vesting schedules prevent large token dumps, maintaining price stability. Additionally, projects with doxxed and trustworthy founders increase investor confidence. (Source: Twitter @cas_abbe)

The Securities and Exchange Commission's years-long crusade against the crypto industry appears to be over.

The final chapter closed on Wednesday, when Ripple announced that the SEC had officially dropped its four-year-old lawsuit against the company. The suit, filed on Jay Clayton's last day as SEC chair, accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through the sale of its XRP token without registering it as a security. 

Crypto companies and exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, Binance, and OpenSea all previously saw lawsuits or investigations dropped, resolved or put on hold. Ripple is now taking a victory lap. 

"Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back — and won on essential legal questions — throwing a major wrench into the SEC's plans to destroy crypto in the U.S. through enforcement," Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told CNBC in an emailed statement. "The SEC has now abandoned its appeal in our case. In a fitting irony, Ripple was the first major case they brought and will now be the last one they walk away from."

XRP was created in 2012 as one of the first non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies. It was started by the founders of the company Ripple, and became the platform's native currency. Like bitcoin, XRP can be bought and sold by retail investors. XRP jumped about 11% after Wednesday's announcement. 

Ripple spent $150 million battling the government in a bruising legal standoff with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose approach to crypto was widely viewed as hostile. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is "not necessarily a security on its face," undercutting the foundation of the SEC's case.

The win wasn't just a turning point for Ripple. It signaled to the crypto industry that the tide was turning, and built momentum for a movement that helped return President Donald Trump, a former crypto critic, to the White House. A year after the judge's ruling, Trump, as Republican nominee, delivered a keynote at the annual Bitcoin Conference, and announced that he was "laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world." 

Ripple and its crypto peers were major contributors to Trump's campaign. The president has spent his first two months in office paying them back. 

On Friday, the SEC hosted its first major crypto roundtable, signaling a new approach of regulation through engagement, rather than enforcement. Leading the effort is Hester Peirce, who is helming the regulator's newly established Crypto Task Force. 

Peirce's message to the industry is that the SEC is no longer an adversary, but is instead trying to give crypto a clear, lawful framework.

In a major policy reversal, the SEC rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 — a controversial rule that required banks to treat crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. Introduced in 2022 and championed by Gensler, the rule was widely viewed as a major barrier to institutional adoption of bitcoin and other digital assets. 

"Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun," Peirce wrote on in a post on X after the change was announced in January.  

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that month, CEOs from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America signaled that the thaw in Washington could lead to renewed crypto engagement. 

And at the White House, David Sacks, Trump's AI and crypto czar, stood beside the president as he signed an executive order on digital assets. Sacks had recently attended the Crypto Ball as part of the inauguration, where he declared, "The war on crypto is over."

Coinbase's lawsuit was dismissed in February. Then came Kraken. The SEC pulled back from its Wells Notice against Robinhood's crypto division. The investigation into Binance is on hold.

Ripple's legal team long argued that the SEC's strategy wasn't about upholding the law, but about using it as a blunt instrument. The regulator sent subpoenas to foreign regulators that worked with Ripple, demanded troves of documents from business partners and even sued CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen personally. Those charges have also been dropped.

"While this chapter is closed, the fight for clear, fair, and transparent crypto regulation continues," Alderoty told CNBC. "Ripple will continue to lead that fight."

Cryptocurrency and blockchain continue to captivate with promises to revolutionize finance, culture, and now philanthropy. In 2024, digital currency donations surpassed $1 billion, as reported by The Giving Block, fueled by a booming crypto market and clearer regulations. However, the true significance lies not just in the figure but in what this phenomenon reveals about our societal values. 

Crypto philanthropy reflects our trust in technology, our skepticism towards traditional institutions, and our evolving understanding of generosity. Does this trend herald progress or illuminate deeper societal currents?

Blockchain's allure in charitable giving lies in its transparency. Traditional philanthropy often leaves donors uncertain about the fate of their contributions, undermined by opaque processes. A public, immutable ledger, exemplified by initiatives like GiveTrack, offers reassurance. In 2024, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) collectively accounted for 90% of crypto donations, allowing donors to trace every transaction, as reported by The Giving Block. This is less about cost-effectiveness than about certainty—a means to restore confidence in an era wary of intermediaries.

The wealth generated by cryptocurrency further enhances its appeal. Market volatility has attracted benefactors eager to share their gains. Vitalik Buterin's $1 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) donation to India's COVID-19 relief effort in 2021 and the Pineapple Fund's distribution of 5,057 BTC, valued at $86 million in 2017, to various causes exemplify this trend. The $1 billion milestone in 2024 underscores this momentum. Such acts resonate not only as acts of generosity but also as demonstrations of technology's potential to convert digital success into tangible good, a narrative that captivates our imagination.

While crypto philanthropy offers a promising vision, it faces the challenge of delivering tangible results. The $1 billion milestone in 2024 serves as a reminder that promises alone are not enough. It is crucial to ensure that these donations are effectively utilized and have a meaningful impact on society. This challenge requires collaboration between donors, charities, and technology experts to create a sustainable and effective philanthropic ecosystem. 

Yet, this enthusiasm encounters limitations. For instance, the SHIB donation caused a price drop, reducing the aid provided despite its bold announcement. The Pineapple Fund's contributions, while substantial, were dependent on Bitcoin's fluctuations—some recipients benefited significantly, while others received less. Even with the total donations reaching a billion dollars in 2024, the practical impact remains inconsistent. The spectacle of cryptocurrency giving inspires, but its outcomes often depend on unpredictable markets, raising questions about its reliability.

Furthermore, the culture of cryptocurrency—dynamic and risk-oriented—diverges from philanthropy's traditional demands. Established figures like Warren Buffett, committed to decades of giving through the Giving Pledge, embody endurance. In contrast, cryptocurrency donations often align with tax advantages or public recognition rather than sustained support. The environmental impact of Bitcoin's energy consumption further complicates the matter—can philanthropy derived from such a source be considered unequivocally virtuous? Our fascination with the novel may overshadow enduring priorities.

What, then, drives our fixation? Crypto philanthropy reveals a profound reliance on technology as a solution. Disillusioned with the pace of conventional systems—whether governmental or charitable—we turn to blockchain for immediacy and transparency. The Giving Block notes that regulatory clarity in 2024 attracted more participants, leading to an increase in donations. This reflects a desire for control—a system we can oversee rather than entrust to others.

This trend also reveals a broader mistrust. Our insistence on transparency stems from disillusionment with established frameworks. While crypto giving doesn't yet surpass traditional philanthropy in scope, it compensates for perceived shortcomings. Initiatives like Gitcoin, which experiment with methods to fund grassroots projects, suggest a potential redefinition of impact—yet their reach remains limited. The $1 billion in donations in 2024 don't signify triumph but rather an aspiration: to create a form of generosity that aligns with our digital age. We're enamored with innovation, sometimes at the expense of proven consistency.

What does this signify? Crypto philanthropy occupies an ambiguous space—neither a definitive failure nor a complete success, but rather a lens on our priorities. It raises questions: Can generosity match the speed of technology? Must it bear a digital imprint to hold value? Those advancing this cause should temper their boldness with pragmatism. True impact doesn't lie in the tools employed but in the lives improved. Traditional philanthropy offers lessons in persistence; crypto provides audacity. A synthesis might yet emerge, but for now, our enthusiasm exceeds our evidence. The paradox lies here: in amassing over $1 billion, we reveal a society eager to redefine good yet still grappling with what that entails.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>



 According to Bo Hines, a senior White House advisor on crypto who spoke on the Crypto in America Podcast, the US could leverage its gold holdings to fund its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). 

Hines suggested that the Trump administration would explore creative ways of funding the SBR without further burdening the American taxpayer, News.Az reports citing foreign media.

His sentiments seem to be an attempt to pacify Americans, many of whom, according to a recent survey, oppose the SBR. The Data for Progress advocacy group poll showed 51% of American voters disapprove of the idea, placing it last on the list of priority areas for federal funding. 

America's budget-neutral means of financing its SBR

Hines explained that his think tank had received countless ideas on how to fund the SBR. He, however, hinted that the one(s) it would settle on would have to be budget-neutral. On that account, the US could use the gains from its gold certificates to acquire more Bitcoin. 

The crypto council head honcho also held that the certificates were massively undervalued compared to actual gold values. Therefore, getting their correct valuation, as Senator Cynthia Lummins' Bitcoin Act 2025 proposes, would give America the finances it needs to build its BTC stash. 

He said, “If we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.”

How does revaluing the gold certificates work? 

Lummins' push and, therefore, Hines' stance have merit, too. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, the Fed banks holding gold certificates value them at $42.22 per troy ounce. That figure pales in comparison to the $3,037, which is a similar unit of the precious metal fetches in the market. 

America owns about 8,133 metric tons of gold, which comes to 260.8 million troy ounces (using the formula, 1 metric ton = 32,150.7 troy ounces). Gold's current price gives you a market value of roughly $792 billion ($3,037*260.8M). Meanwhile, the book value is slightly over  $11 billion ($42.22*260.8M), bringing potential gains to over $780 billion ($792B – $11B). 

As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold's prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Such a windfall would provide the US with enough liquidity to set up the SBR without tapping into taxpayers' funds. 

Overcoming challenges and exploring alternatives to revaluing gold certificates

While the financial advantages are clear, questions remain about revalued gold certificates' scalability. Such a shift could induce pushback from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department itself, since it would risk impacting monetary policy and inflation expectations.

Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue.

Revaluing gold certificates is a strong possibility, but other budget-neutral approaches are worth contemplating. The U.S. could, for instance, consider issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds, as El Salvador has, or allocate some of the confiscated assets from criminal crypto activities toward funding the reserve.

Other experts have proposed tokenizing segments of federal assets and allowing private investors to contribute to the SBR via decentralized finance (DeFi) methods.

Excitement has swelled in the crypto community following Bitcoin‘s recent upward move to key resistance levels. While the move may have sparked optimism, many investors' reactions toward BTC were negative as they continued to bet on a sustained decline, creating a bearish outlook for the asset.

As Bitcoin's price struggles to break through key resistance levels, a worrying shift has been cited among big investors or whales. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data platform reveals rising pessimism among these investors as they bet on an extension of the ongoing correction.

BTC recently saw a brief surge to the $87,000 level even as volatility grows in the broader crypto market. However, the upward move was met with strong resistance as whale holders massively opened short positions after the upswing. “Whales Enter Short Positions on Bitcoin as Leverage Increases,” the platform stated.

Despite the brief move to the $87,000 mark, these big investors have chosen to close their long positions and open more shorts. Given the ongoing volatility of the market, this shift has raised questions about BTC's prospects in the short term.

Whale participation often influences price trajectory, which could cause Bitcoin to continue dropping in the upcoming weeks. However, if buying pressure intensifies at critical support zones and creates a strong defense, BTC may move in an upward direction.

Furthermore, Alphractal points to a rise in market leverage. After examining the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest/Market Cap Ratio, the platform noted that the metric is rising again, reflecting growing leverage. According to the platform, this increase in market leverage might set off a fresh round of volatility, resulting in further mass liquidations.

On-chain data have also revealed substantial sell pressure among Bitcoin large investors, triggering concerns about potential downside risks. Leading market intelligence and data analytics platform IntoTheBlock, outlined a decrease in whale balances as the market fluctuates.

Looking at the chart, BTC whales seem to have been trending downward for almost a year. However, data from March suggests a potential reversal as whales now hold about 62,000 more BTC than they did at the beginning of the month, signaling renewed accumulation.

The renewed accumulation by BTC whales raises the likelihood of a price reversal from the ongoing downtrend. This price reversal could be part of a larger trend as Captain Faibik, a crypto analyst and investor predicts an impending surge to its current all-time high. His prediction is supported by a key chart pattern, particularly the Falling Wedge formation. 

Captain Faibik believes that BTC could consolidate within the key pattern for the next 10 to 15 days before undergoing a huge bullish breakout. When this breakout happens, Bitcoin's price will rally significantly to the $109,000 mark, reigniting the bull market.
