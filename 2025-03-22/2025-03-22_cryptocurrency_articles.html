                <p>Some might say you've really made it when you have a certain number of social media followers, or a large-digit number in your bank account, but I think the true measure of success is when skilled manicurists make complex nail art in your honor.

By that standard, Formula 1 has hit the big time. If you're not familiar with nail art, it's a step (or 20) above the classic manicure. Nail artists use specialized gels and polishes to create 3-D sculptural effects on the tips of their clients' fingers.

Nail art can be abstract, using magnetic polishes or chrome powders to make exciting patterns and textures, or it can be figurative, with designs based on themes like food, video games, fashion brands, or animals. Or cars.

Lisa Kim was kind enough to send me some photos of her latest work and answer my questions about creating it. The Australian artist began doing manicure art during COVID and is now in her third year of designing and applying custom sets.

She told me she'd never done a car-themed set before, but when a client came in with a request for F1 nails, she was delighted by the challenge. "I wanted to incorporate as many car-racing elements into it as possible," she says.

"I wanted to include as many teams onto the 10 fingers as I could and hand-sculpt as much as possible," she says. "I sculpted with 3-D sculpting gel, using models of Ferrari F1 cars from 2010–2015 as inspiration."

Then she added a racing flag, tires with the LV [Louis Vuitton] logo painted around them, as LV is the year's main sponsor, as well as the racing helmets, spanners, and screwdrivers. All pretty detailed for someone who says she wasn’t even an F1 fan when the request came in.

"I did have to Google a bit for research," she admitted, but added that she's a fan now. While this was Kim's first F1 request, she says she tends to see more racing-themed nails when the F1 season starts, and she thinks it's a trend that will stick around.

For now, Kim says she really only gets racing nail requests from women, "Although I do want more male clients!" If you're considering a custom set of your own, there is a cost.</p></b>

                <p>Amazon looks to expand into used vehicles following successful voyages into the new car sales market.

Online shopping for cars isn't a new concept, but it could become even more mainstream if Amazon decides to add used auto sales to its portfolio.


"We're adding more dealers, and we're excited to add not just new inventory for those dealers but also used inventory," said Fan Jin in talks with Automotive News. Jin is the director of Amazon Autos and revealed that the online superstore is "getting into used cars soon" following the Hyundai new car sales pilot program.

The case for online car sales is stronger than ever; it only makes sense for Amazon to get in on the action


The car sales world changed dramatically in 2020, as COVID-19 made online sales mandatory as opposed to a convenient option. If Amazon is considering moving into used car sales, they clearly have gleaned data that indicates it's worthwhile.

But even teraflops of data and advertising power notwithstanding, online car purchases are already popular. Outfits like Autotrader, CarGurus, et al make substantial amounts of money doing exactly what Amazon is looking into.

There are still hurdles for Amazon as it tries to onboard dealers. For new vehicles, OEMs will be dipping their toes in carefully to ensure the brand is protected and presented well. Used vehicles will be less involved, but dealers will be closely watching their bottom line to ensure whatever traffic they're getting from Amazon's service recoups the cost of the service while paying dividends.

No dealer is looking for "just another listing service"—and Amazon Autos' scope seems to go a bit beyond that. Either way, Amazon's expansion will likely demand the competition steps things up, because rivals that offer less won't be around for long if they can't offer similar services.</p></b>

                <p>Internal combustion engines are incredibly complicated machines that many of us interact with on a daily basis, but don't completely understand.

Unlike gasoline-burning engines, diesel engines don't require a spark to burn fuel and operate. Most automotive diesel engines don't have any spark plugs; instead, diesel engines rely on compression to ignite the fuel. The combustion chamber inside each cylinder in a diesel engine facilitates combustion by housing air at extremely high pressures, which when compressed by the piston and combined with diesel fuel, heats up and ignites the fuel.

Most diesel engines have an oil separator that prevents volatile derelict oil from entering the combustion chamber, mitigating the likelihood of dangerous blow-by. Regular maintenance and inspection of key components such as turbochargers, fuel injectors, and air intake systems can preemptively catch a failing component that could lead to runaway.

Older, high-mileage diesel engines are at higher risk for engine runaway, but can be fortified against it by using aftermarket inline devices that shut off the engine's air supply at excessive engine speeds. Some older diesel engines have a tube to ventilate extreme crankcase pressure which helps prevent flammable oils from leaving the crankcase and entering the combustion chamber.

The only way to stop diesel engines experiencing runaway is by either completely cutting off the fuel source, or the air source. Turning off the ignition and/or removing the key will have no effect on the runaway reaction.</p></b>

                <p>On the opening weekend of the Porsche Cup Brazil came to a halt early when a scary solo crash sent rookie driver, Heverton Cardoso, airborne during his qualification session for the Sprint Challenge. Cardoso lost control entering the top of Autodromo Velocitta's corkscrew corner and hit a barrier while sliding sideways; this lifted the No. 36 GT3 car, and his momentum sent him flying.

Driver OK! An impressive shunt in the Porsche Cup Brasil 🫣

The right side tires barely grazed the track surface as it flew across the corner, starting its first rotation. Upside down, Cardoso flew through the air before hitting the ground on the lid of his car and bouncing back up into the sand barrels. He had at least five more points of contact with the ground before skidding to a stop, alternating from hitting the surface with the nose and the vehicle's roof mostly.

The Porsche Cup medical team quickly attended to Cardoso and was able to exit the vehicle and head to the medical center with assistance.

                <p>Will Power was the winner of the season-opening Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.

The IndyCar series has a new broadcast partner, Fox Sports, which is broadcasting all races live on its main network for the first time in the history of the series.


Fox's first IndyCar broadcast aired earlier this month and drew a few complaints from viewers about issues with graphics packages, such as missing information for international viewers and blocking sponsor decals. However, the network moved quickly to address these problems.

The network told RACER that it is working on resolving technical glitches causing issues with the international feed. Fox also updated its graphics package, replacing problematic heads-up display graphics and illustrations of drivers' faces with more conventional headshots.


Pam Miller, a producer who has been with Fox since 2011 and produced racing for CBS and ESPN before joining NASCAR in 2011, says that the network is focused on highlighting key differences between IndyCar and other racing series. She notes that personalities and technology are major areas of focus.

Miller emphasizes that the network wants to make the drivers relatable and help fans know who they want to cheer for by May and the Indy 500. The goal is to create a more cohesive brand identity for IndyCar that sets it apart from other racing series.

Fox's broadcast of the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg saw a significant increase in viewership, with 1.4 million people tuning in to watch the race on Fox, which is a 45% increase over the previous number on NBC.

This makes it the most-watched IndyCar race outside of the Indianapolis 500 since 2011. Every single IndyCar race will be broadcast live on Fox's main network for the rest of the season.</p></b>

                <p>California Senate Bill 712 aims to expand emissions exemptions to vehicles at least 35 years old.

The bill requires the car to be insured as a collector car, and one of its biggest backers is Jay Leno.

Being a classic car enthusiast in California is a double-edged sword, with many benefits but also challenges.

One challenge is forever idling in traffic, and getting an old car through emissions regulations can be tough.

A solution for the latter problem may be on the horizon, as California Senate Bill 712 aims to provide a smog-testing exemption for cars built in 1990 and earlier.

The bill requires vehicles to be insured as collector cars to qualify for the exemption.

Jay Leno has been outspoken about the need to relax emissions regulations for classic cars and is a major supporter of the bill.

California already had such an exemption in place back when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, which was rolled over to pre-1976 regulation in 2005.

The average age of a car in the United States is between 12 and 14 years old, so cars that are more than 30 years old are only a small segment of what's on the road.

Especially if insured as collector cars, these vehicles do not have a measurable environmental impact due to low mileage.

A vehicle that's at least 35 years old is already exempt from certain portions of the existing emissions test; the proposed bill just extends things to full exemption.

Classic car enthusiasm supports a host of industries in California, everything from big-dollar restomod companies to mom-and-pop upholstery shops.

About 14 percent of businesses in the Specialty Equipment Marketing Association (SEMA) are based in California, and California-based enthusiasts order replacement and refurbished parts from other shops all across the U.S.

It's estimated that classic car enthusiasm is a multi-billion-dollar slice of the economy.

In neighboring states like Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona, emissions regulations are more relaxed with exemptions built in for collector cars.</p></b>

                <p>Tesla is in trouble, with its electric vehicle sales dropping fast.

Tesla's sales in Europe have taken a serious hit, particularly in Germany where they fell 76% in February compared to last year. In France, they were down 26%.

The drop in sales could also affect a deal Tesla made with carmakers like Toyota and Stellantis. Tesla sells carbon credits to these companies, helping them meet strict pollution rules in Europe.

Last year, Tesla made $2.76 billion from selling carbon credits, a 54% jump from the previous year. However, if Tesla isn't selling enough cars, it won't have enough credits to sell.

Chinese automakers like BYD are making cheaper electric cars with newer tech and features, posing a challenge to Tesla's market share.

BYD has even passed Tesla as the world's top EV seller at the end of 2023. 

Tesla's sales have now started dropping in China too, with a reported 28.7% drop across January and February year-over-year.

Some Tesla customers are stepping away from the brand because of Elon Musk's behavior and politics. Protests have been held at dealerships, orders have been canceled, and there has been social media backlash.

A slowdown in Tesla's sales could hurt the broader shift to EVs, as fewer people might switch from gas cars to electric ones.

Several automakers are making reliable and affordable electric cars that compete with Tesla. Honda, Acura, Hyundai, and Kia are among brands that have been putting out EVs like the Prologue, ZDX, Ioniq 5, and EV6.

Ford's Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning have become increasingly popular choices, while Volkswagen's ID.4 is another hot pick.</p></b>

                <p>In Falls Creek, Pennsylvania, a collection of classic Square Body trucks and rare muscle cars has emerged.

A car enthusiast, Dennis Collins, discovered the collection after a 210-mile road trip with his crew. The collection consisted of 10 vehicles on an old property, including seven Square Body pickups, one New Body Style (NBS) truck, and two iconic muscle cars.


The oldest truck in the collection is a 1971 Chevrolet Cheyenne equipped with a 350 cubic-inch V8 engine and features like power steering and brakes. Sharing space with the trucks was a rare 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle convertible with a California smog setup, indicating its West Coast origins.


Tucked near the back of the site, the team discovered an all-black 1985 GMC Sierra, a rugged four-wheel-drive pickup with a manual transmission. However, the highlight of the collection is a 1991 GMC Jimmy, one of the last models of its kind, with only 110 miles on the odometer.


The lineup also included a stunning 1963 Chevrolet Impala convertible, adding a touch of classic American muscle to the mix. Many of these trucks and cars appear to have been sitting for decades, their value and rarity hidden until now.


Vehicles like the Silverado are believed to have been idle since 1993 or 1994. Collections like this one celebrate America's rich automotive history and serve as a reminder of the enduring legacy of Square Body trucks.</p></b>

                <p>The Tesla Takedown movement and resulting protests have remained peaceful, but there have been instances of anti-Tesla vandalism.

Despite attempts to disguise their appearances, several alleged vandals have already been arrested. Authorities tracked them down quickly, in part because of automatic license plate readers being ubiquitous these days. 

A big reason authorities were able to track the vandals was because they gave away a lot of information on social media than they may have intended. One person allegedly left fingerprints behind at the scene, which made it easy for law enforcement to catch them.

In South Carolina, someone spray-painted "Fu*k Trump" and "Long Live Ukraine" on several chargers before throwing Molotov cocktails made out of beer bottles at them, setting a few on fire. 

Authorities found footage of what appeared to be a white male wearing a grey sweater, a black mask, black shorts, and black shoes on a camera near the scene. They then used license plate readers to identify the van he got into.

They searched for his name on social media, which gave them a phone number that matched with a man they tracked further by searching for his name on another mobile payment app. Transactions listed as rent gave authorities an address, allowing them to apply for a warrant to search his apartment and vehicle.

In Colorado, someone spray-painted "NAZI" and "FU*K MUSK" on a Tesla showroom sign, vandalized multiple vehicles and threw a Molotov cocktail at a Cybertruck. 

A license plate reader identified the car leaving a nearby parking lot around the time the vandal would have left the dealership. Authorities followed the car to another Tesla showroom where the driver was seen wearing the same outfit seen in previous surveillance footage.

The most egregious case took place in Oregon, where someone threw Molotov cocktails and later fired an AR-15 style rifle at a Tesla showroom. 

Authorities tracked him down with the help of license plate readers, but also found his fingerprints on wine bottles used to make the Molotov cocktails.</p></b>

                <p>Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb is investing his estimated $3.2 billion fortune into Vast Space, a California-based aerospace company he founded in 2021.

 
McCaleb's vision is to build a functioning space station to replace the International Space Station, which is scheduled for decommissioning in 2030.

 
Vast develops artificial gravity space stations that simulate gravity by rotating to create centrifugal force while offering comforts of home.

 
The company recently revealed the final design for Haven-1, its first station module, and is partnering with SpaceX to carry the modules into space using Falcon9 rockets.

 
Haven-1's first launch is scheduled for May 2026 for a two-week mission above the Earth. The concept of artificial gravity stations has long been a staple in science fiction.

 
Vast is also developing Haven-2, a modular system that could be connected to form a larger, expandable station.

 
Public-sector space agencies are increasingly turning to private companies like Vast to get astronauts and resources into space.

 
A growing number of private citizens, including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos, are stepping up to meet the need for space-based capabilities.</p></b>

                <p>The adage "Win on Sunday, sell on Monday" justified automakers' NASCAR efforts in the 1950s. But is boosting car sales still the reason manufacturers invest in motor racing? With sky-high budgets to compete in Formula 1, any additional sales attributable to a Sunday win likely aren't enough to cover the massive costs.

Automakers unable to stomach the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual spending it takes to field a competitive F1 team have plenty of other racing series to compete in. However, even sales linked to success in one of these still may not net enough of a profit to cover the expense of competition. 

Genesis

"The potential benefits can outweigh the costs," says James Picariello, senior automotive analyst at BNP Paribas, about F1 racing. Most F1 teams operate out of the U.K., a country that legally requires companies to disclose certain financial and accounting information to the public.

Thanks to this, we know the true costs of fielding a modern F1 team. For instance, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 spent north of $530 million during the 2023 season but ultimately ended the year with more than $104 million in profits. 

TRACKING NEW TECH: Government regulations and consumer demand limit just how much of a race car's mechanicals make their way to an automaker's road cars, but competition continues to drive innovations that go beyond the track.

Manufacturers may approach racing as a place to test proofs of concept or the general reliability of new technologies or ideas. 

Chevrolet

Compared with F1, the tens of millions of dollars it costs to field a two-car team in the FIA World Endurance Championship's (WEC) Hypercar class and the International Motor Sports Association's (IMSA) GTP class is a relative pittance.

Though the potential profits from top-level endurance racing are a fraction of those from a large global series like F1, so are the possible losses. For automakers, some of which have multibillion-dollar marketing budgets, operating an endurance-racing team at a potential small loss can be a risk worth taking to increase brand exposure and awareness.

Evidently, Genesis thinks so. In December, Genesis Magma Racing revealed the GMR-001 LMDh-spec endurance racer that will compete in both WEC's and IMSA's flagship classes starting in the 2026 and '27 seasons, respectively. 

Along with promoting the upcoming Magma line of performance vehicles, the effort aims to increase overall awareness of the barely 10-year-old luxury brand. "Motorsport is known for raising brand awareness," says Genesis chief brand officer Luc Donckerwolke.

Cadillac reentered endurance racing 25 years ago. Come 2026, a GM/Cadillac effort will contest Formula 1.

Since 2023, F1 has enforced a $135 million cap covering almost every aspect of the development and manufacturing of a team's car, the salaries of most team personnel, and garage equipment costs. The sport holds engines to a separate $95 million max. 

Starting in 2026, those caps will rise to $215 million and $130 million. There are no limits on driver salaries or marketing budgets.

Thanks to generous sponsorship deals, ample prize money, and revenue sharing, F1 teams can operate in the black. "We sold approximately 700 to 12 million General Motors vehicles through our IMSA racing platform in 2024," says Meagan Quinn, a marketing manager for GM who works on Cadillac Racing.

Though IMSA does not share attendance figures, association president John Doonan claims 11 of 12 events in the 2024 season had record attendance.</p></b>

                <p>Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth earlier this week after their Boeing Starliner departed the International Space Station empty last year.

The pair of NASA astronauts only received an extra $1,430 for the nine-month ordeal, but at least a pod of dolphins gave them a warm welcome home.

NASA doesn't give overtime, weekend or holiday pay to its astronauts on the ISS. It's not like the space agency can operate a weekly or daily commute to low Earth orbit so spacefarers can spend the weekend lounging at home on the couch.

However, NASA pays a $5 per diem for incidental expenses. As a result, Wilmore and Williams received an extra $1,430 for their extra 286 days in space, according to the New York Times.

The Astronaut Spirit Will Never Die

NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is helped out of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft onboard the SpaceX recovery ship MEGAN after he and fellow NASA astronauts Nick Hague and Suni Williams, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov landed on the water on March 18, 2025 off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida.

While Wilmore and Williams were rationing their clothes, engineers were attempting to figure out how to make the Boeing Starliner safe to return crewed. The spacecraft suffered from failing thrusters that could cause a loss of control in orbit.

The wait drastically lengthened the eight-day mission.

NASA astronauts are paid $152,258 a year, compensation that doesn't quite match the position of someone who could step foot on the Moon.</p></b>

                <p>When Swedish UFO film “Watch the Skies” hits U.S. cinemas this May, audiences won’t be able to tell that it wasn’t made in English.

The film is the first full theatrical release to showcase “visual dubbing” technology from AI firm Flawless, which enables actors’ performances to be digitally lip-synced with foreign-language dubs.


“Watch the Skies” follows rebellious teenager Denise, who teams up with a club of UFO watchers to solve the mystery of her missing father. The film was shot in Swedish, and released there under the title "UFO Sweden." However, for its U.S. release, the original cast have re-recorded their performances in English, with Flawless using its TrueSync machine learning technology to digitally alter their lip movements so that they sync up with the English dialogue.

The filmmakers stress that the use of the technique has “full endorsement from SAG,” the actors’ union, which went on strike in 2023 amid concerns over the “threat” posed by AI to the profession.

“A lot of filmmakers and a lot of actors will be afraid of this technology at first, but we have the creative control, and to act out the film in English was a real exciting experience,” said Danell, adding that, “It’s still our movie, it’s still the actors’ performance, and that’s the key part.”

What is TrueSync? 
In a 2023 presentation, Flawless co-founder Scott Mann explained that the company’s TrueSync technology uses deep learning to create a volumetric 3D representation of the actors’ faces throughout a film, which can then be altered to match the dubbed dialogue.



TrueSync was previously used on the 2022 film “Fall” to remove swearing for a PG-13 edit, while another of the company’s products, DeepEditor, enables an actor’s performance to be extracted from one scene and applied to another scene, without the need for reshoots.

The company has partnered with distributor XYZ Films to release a slate of features localized using TrueSync, including “Run Lola Run” director Tom Tykwer’s upcoming “The Light,” horror feature “Vincent Must Die,” and South Korean film “Smugglers.”</p></b>

                <p>Michael Kehoe was ready to buy his first car in 1980, and he chose a 1980 Chevy Corvette over a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am.

He had saved money working at his dad's business, J&J Sheet Metal in Warren, where he started working in middle school and high school.

The Corvette had been owned by a GM executive for about six months before Kehoe bought it, and it had only 2,500 miles on it when he purchased it.

It was an ultra-modern car in 1980 with mirrored T-tops and a four-speed stick shift, and undercoating it cost $65.

Kehoe sold the car three years after buying it to pay for the first year of tuition at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry.

He became an orthodontist after graduating from dental school and opened Kehoe Orthodontics, retiring in December 2020.


Kehoe received a phone call last summer from his brother about a Craigslist post that turned out to be his old Corvette.

His brother was certain the post was about the Corvette Michael once owned, and it was verified to be his car after some digging.


Kehoe repurchased the car in August of 2021 for the same price he sold it for in 1983, and he was overjoyed to have it back.


The sentimental value of the car is priceless to Kehoe, who has a scrapbook of its history.

The Corvette has had five owners and been driven only 94,000 miles.</p></b>

                <p>British Businessman Reuben Singh Holds World’s Only Complete Record-Breaking Bugatti Collection.

Reuben Singh, a British entrepreneur, has assembled all four world-record Bugatti hypercars into one collection. The collection includes the W16 Mistral, which is the fastest open-top car ever built, along with the Veyron 16.4 Super Sport, Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse, and Chiron Super Sport 300+. Each of these vehicles holds a distinct world speed record.

Based near Nottingham, Singh's collection extends far beyond Bugattis, with over 3,000 cars, including iconic models like the Bugatti Divo, Ferrari F12 Berlinetta, Lamborghini Huracan, Pagani Huayra, and Porsche 918 Spyder. The Bugatti collection is rare because each car is reportedly the exact vehicle used to break its respective world speed record.

In 2025, Bugatti plans to release the Tourbillon range, which may capture Singh's attention and lead him to add another milestone vehicle to his lineup, solidifying his status as a titan in supercar collecting.</p></b>

                <p>A severe car crash involving a Lamborghini Urus and a Ford Mustang occurred on I-95 in Broward County, Florida.

The collision left the exotic crossover severely damaged, raising questions about the events leading up to the accident and the aftermath.

Footage shared by NBC Miami revealed the devastating impact on the Lamborghini Urus, which had collided with a guardrail, leaving it nearly unrecognizable.


Details about the crash remain scarce as NBC Miami did not provide specifics about the incident. Speculation suggests that some form of contact occurred between the Lamborghini and the Mustang, but the circumstances—whether speeding, road rage, or involvement of other vehicles—are unknown.

The lack of clarity leaves room for various theories about how such a dramatic accident unfolded.


This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of cautious driving, especially during the warm summer months when road conditions can vary, and traffic incidents are more frequent. Drivers are urged to stay alert, drive defensively, and be mindful of their surroundings to avoid similar accidents.

Factors such as aggressive driving, impaired judgment due to alcohol, and fatigue from long-distance travel contribute to the risk of accidents, making vigilance essential for road safety.


As the investigation continues, the focus remains on understanding the cause of the crash and preventing future occurrences. The collision on I-95 highlights the vulnerability of even the most robust and expensive vehicles when involved in high-speed impacts.

The incident underscores the need for all drivers to prioritize safety and exercise caution on the roads.</p></b>

                <p>Honda is buying hybrid batteries from Toyota.

The deal allows Honda to sidestep import tariffs on components sourced from China and Japan, which include a 10% levy on Chinese imports that took effect this month and an expected jump from 2.5% to 25% on Japanese-built vehicles.


Toyota's new $14 billion North Carolina battery plant will supply Honda with 400,000 Toyota-built hybrid battery packs per year starting in April 2025.

This partnership makes sense for both automakers: Honda needs a stable, tariff-free battery supply to expand its hybrid lineup, while Toyota gets a major customer to help justify its massive investment.


Honda aims to grow hybrid sales and secure production by having a U.S.-based battery source; the CR-V Hybrid is a strong contender.

The deal isn't an alliance in the traditional sense; Honda is simply purchasing batteries from Toyota without a reciprocal agreement in place.


Tariffs are forcing carmakers to adapt: Volkswagen and Porsche weigh U.S. production, Volvo delayed the launch of the EX30 to dodge a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs, while GM and Stellantis have cut production at plants in Canada and Mexico.

The partnership helps justify Toyota's $14 billion U.S. battery investment; for Honda, it's a way to avoid price hikes and maintain competitiveness.


Honda sold over 308,000 hybrids in the U.S. last year and needs a stable supply chain to expand its hybrid lineup.</p></b>

                <p>The first-gen Riviera is widely considered the best of the lot, and the hidden headlights that arrived for 1965 make that year the pick of the first-gen cars.

This is a Gran Sport model, fitted with the most powerful V-8 on offer.

At the 1964 New York auto show, Buick showed off a refreshed version of its already stunning Riviera coupe. Formerly fitted with fixed quad headlights up front, the lights were now hidden behind clamshell covers, such that the car presented a cleaner appearance with a wide, unbroken grille.

This 1965 Buick Riviera is the very same car that sat in Buick's display at the 1964 auto show, and it's up for sale on Bring a Trailer. It's a Gran Sport model, which means a bump in power thanks to two four-barrel carburetors, and it's been recently refinished in its original Verde Green.

One noted Riviera fan was Leonard Nimoy, who bought his first car—an early 1963 model—and regularly drove it to the set during the filming of Star Trek. William Shatner had a Corvette, of course, just like the Apollo astronauts, but the man who played Spock wanted something that had a little more restraint along with V-8 performance.

This example had the same owner for four decades, a Naval fighter pilot who is said to have cared for it the way you'd expect. A comprehensive cosmetic refinishing in 2023 refreshed the paint and chromework, and also replaced the Gran Sport badging out back.

The car has Bilstein shock absorbers, and while a Riviera is more luxury coupe than sports car, it should ride and handle quite well for a car from this period. The brakes are four-wheel drums.

Being a Gran Sport, this Riv's got the most powerful engine available, a 425-cubic-inch V-8 with the aforementioned twin carburetors. From the factory, it was good for 360 horsepower and a stout 465 pound-feet of torque.

The car wears its original 15-inch Rally wheels. With a power driver's seat, power windows, and cruise control, this Riviera is a nicely optioned driver. As a single-year example, it'll be collectible, but more so it's just a fantastic looking machine that's set up to cruise as well as it did in the mid-sixties. It's the kind of car that might even get a smile out of Spock.</p></b>

                <p>Bitcoin's price stands at $84,150 per coin after not budging over a seven-day period, according to CoinGecko data.

It's up 0.2% on the day, but totally flat on the week.

American Bitcoin investors had been fast cashing out of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, but that all changed this week, Farside Investors data shows.

Every day this week, money has flooded back into the new vehicles, with over half a billion entering the funds by Wednesday.

About $734 million worth of funds reentered Bitcoin ETFs this week as investor sentiment has changed.

Data shows that Bitcoin's volatility is at a six-month high due to worries about the U.S. economy and geopolitical tensions.

The SEC made a statement that applies to Bitcoin mining: proof-of-work mining operations do not need to register their actions.

According to the regulator, as a miner's "expectation to receive rewards is not derived from any third party's managerial or entrepreneurial efforts," the activity does not come under the SEC's jurisdiction.

BlackRock Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said that calling Bitcoin a "risk-on" asset was not exactly accurate.</p></b>

                <p>President Trump announced the creation of a new government agency called D.O.G.E., which is an acronym for Delivering on Government Efficiency.

The agency's initialism, DOGE, appears to be a cheeky reference to the ticker for Dogecoin (DOGE), a high-market-cap meme coin beloved by Elon Musk.

Musk has said that he owns a “bunch” of Dogecoin, and he has tweeted and spoken about the coin routinely over the past years.

He even called himself the “Dogefather” in 2021 and mentioned the coin while hosting Saturday Night Live.

The meme, which is famous for its Shiba Inu mascot, was invented in 2013 by a pair of software engineers.

Dogecoin's value climbed amid Musk’s support for Trump on the campaign trail, and then skyrocketed after Trump’s win and amid the official announcement of DOGE leadership.

Musk's DOGE push has proven to be divisive amongst ardent fans of the Doge meme and Dogecoin.

The agency is led by Elon Musk, who has been vocal about his desire to slash government spending.

DOGE claims to have terminated more than 5,600 government contracts worth $20 billion, and also claims to have scrapped 7,616 grants worth roughly $18 billion for various agencies.

In early March, Musk's team caused a major uproar when it successfully pushed for President Trump to order the Department of Education to terminate nearly 50% of its workforce.

Experts expect the cuts to complicate the maintenance of the federal financial aid system.

The department's resources for fielding thousands of student and teacher harassment and discrimination complaints have also been largely stripped.

DOGE has received access to Treasury Department records on millions of Americans’ personal data, including bank account numbers and Social Security numbers.

A federal judge moved to block DOGE’s digging in early February, however.

A court battle over the extra-governmental department's access to the sensitive information is still brewing.</p></b>

                <p>Reflecting more general market anxiety, Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have seen dramatic falls as of February 28, 2025.

Investors increasingly seek alternatives offering tangible use cases and long-term growth potential. Among these, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out as a unique initiative since it positions itself as a significant participant in the crypto market by using real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing.

Solana has shown notable volatility. On February 24, it dropped below $150 and reached its lowest price for the year—$137.77. This slump persisted until SOL dropped to $126 before rebounding to $145.

Worries over network disruptions, security flaws, and more general economic issues exacerbated Solana’s problems, along with a 36.28% monthly drop.

Once driven by community buzz, Shiba Inu has also witnessed a sharp fall. Its price dropped 24%, from $0.000019 to almost $0.000013.

As transaction volumes drop and investor interest declines, this bearish trend emphasizes SHIB’s reliance on speculation rather than utility. The company’s inability to sustain critical support levels further questions its long-term survival.

While Solana and Shiba Inu battle market demands, Rexas Finance is becoming one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies in 2025.

Built on a firm foundation of real-world asset tokenization, RXS allows investors to hold fractional shares of real estate, commodities, and other valuable assets via blockchain technology.

Experts estimate that the RWA tokenizing market will surpass $50 billion by the end of the year, establishing Rexas Finance as a leader in this rapidly expanding field.

RXS has attracted notable investor interest and demand by offering actual economic value and fixing conventional financial inefficiencies.

Launched in September 2024, the RXS presale has been unprecedentedly successful, rising 567% from its starting price of $0.03 to its present price of $0.20.

Sales of over 453 million tokens have generated $46.89 million, and Stage 12—its last presale stage—is now 90.90% complete.

Analysts credit RXS’s success to its concrete use cases, elevating it beyond speculative value. Unlike many crypto initiatives that depend on hype, Rexas Finance provides a complete ecosystem, including staking, yield farming, and distributed governance.

Its adaptability makes it one of the most well-rounded blockchain initiatives to watch in 2025.

The Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot let companies and individuals quickly develop and use their tokens, hastening the acceptance of blockchain-based asset ownership.

Furthermore, the Rexas Launchpad is an indispensable financial venue for developing blockchain initiatives. 

Rexas Finance’s ability to be a natural participant in the DeFi and startup funding scene has helped to define it.

The project has also created buzz with its $1 million RXS token giveaway, in which 20 participants would receive $50,000 worth of RXS apiece.</p></b>

                <p>Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform that facilitates lending and borrowing, offering sustainable financial solutions within the DeFi sector.

Through the platform, users can either supply assets to earn passive income or borrow funds by securing collateral, fostering long-term stability as increased borrowing activity boosts liquidity usage while rewarding lenders with competitive returns.


A standout feature of Mutuum Finance is its mtTokens system, which allows users to generate passive income without relying on traditional staking models that can dilute token value. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, which automatically accumulate interest over time—growing in redemption value without requiring active trading.

Mutuum Finance also incorporates a buy-and-distribute mechanism using platform fees to repurchase MUTM tokens, ensuring continuous buy pressure. These tokens are then redistributed to mtTOKEN holders, incentivizing participation and reinforcing sustained demand as the platform expands.


The Mutuum Finance presale has been highly successful, already raising over $4.25 million, with 55% of Phase 3 sold out. The current token price stands at $0.02, but with each presale stage featuring structured price increases, early investors are securing entry at the lowest available rates before widespread market exposure.

The upcoming phase will introduce a 25% price hike, making this one of the last opportunities to acquire MUTM at a discounted rate. With the launch price set at $0.06, investors who enter now could see an immediate 3x return upon listing—even before potential post-launch momentum takes effect.


Dogecoin, which began as a meme coin, gained significant adoption due to its strong community and expanding real-world use cases. Mutuum Finance offers an even stronger value proposition—a structured financial model that drives continuous demand through its lending ecosystem.

Additionally, the Mutuum Finance team is actively developing an overcollateralized stablecoin that will enhance liquidity and expand borrowing options. This additional utility is expected to attract more users, further strengthening MUTM’s market demand while reinforcing price stability.


With a well-structured DeFi model, strong presale momentum, and rising investor interest, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of the most promising tokens of 2024. The low entry point of $0.02 combined with a guaranteed 3x return at launch makes it an attractive opportunity for investors seeking both short-term gains and long-term growth.</p></b>

                <p>Wordle is a daily word game that first emerged in 2021.

The gist of Wordle is to deduce one five-letter word every day by process of elimination, with the daily word being the same for everyone.


To start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green.

Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard.


Wordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets. The game refreshes at midnight local time.

If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.


You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down.

It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.


The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024.


If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle.

You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games, so if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.


Paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.

Yesterday's Wordle answer for Friday, March 21 — NUDGE

We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.

                <p>Cosmos (ATOM) has made significant strides in enhancing interoperability, further cementing its role as a key player in the decentralized ecosystem.

The rollout of Interchain Enhanced Protocols (IEP) introduced more sophisticated tools aimed at facilitating seamless interaction between blockchains within its ecosystem. This update builds upon the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, making cross-chain transfers faster, more secure, and scalable.

BinoFi is revolutionizing how it's accessed and traded with its hybrid exchange model, which blends the best features of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. What sets BinoFi apart is its ability to resolve longstanding issues in crypto trading, such as liquidity fragmentation and high transaction fees.

Its cross-chain trading capability enables users to trade assets across multiple networks without relying on wrapped tokens or third-party bridges. Combined with AI-powered analytics, users can make better-informed trading decisions, enhancing their profitability. Security is another pillar of BinoFi's popularity, with its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets ensuring funds remain safe while giving users full custody of their assets.

BinoFi's presale has been nothing short of a phenomenon, recently crossing the 20-million token mark at $0.02 per token. With early adopters looking at an launch price of $0.30, investor enthusiasm is peaking. When projections hold true, early participants could enjoy returns of over 1,400%, right out the gate.

Cosmos and BinoFi are leading the charge toward an interconnected future. Cosmos continues to act as the bridge for blockchain networks, expanding the boundaries for developers and institutions alike. At the same time, BinoFi is transforming how digital assets are traded, making it easier, safer, and more profitable to participate in the crypto ecosystem.

For investors, both projects offer something unique. Cosmos provides a foundation for the future of blockchain interoperability, while BinoFi delivers a glimpse into the next generation of trading platforms. Together, they represent the evolving opportunities in a fast-changing industry.</p></b>

                <p>Amour : Vous vous sentirez en sécurité et en confiance avec votre partenaire. De plus, vous saurez lui faire partager vos envies et un projet de vie pourrait voir le jour à plus ou moins long terme. Célibataire, votre situation vous convient plutôt bien et vous ne faites pas grand-chose pour la faire évoluer.

Travail-Argent : De bonnes influences astrales vont concerner le secteur de vos finances. Cela ne veut pas dire que vous allez gagner le gros lot mais plutôt que les obstacles vont disparaître, ce qui vous permettra de gérer votre budget avec plus de facilité. Côté travail, ne comptez pas sur le soutien de vos collègues.

Santé : Votre tonus sera en dents de scie mais c'est dû principalement à votre façon de vivre. Vous avez tendance à abuser de vos forces et à repousser vos limites. Il est temps de ralentir le rythme pour pouvoir souffler.</p></b>
