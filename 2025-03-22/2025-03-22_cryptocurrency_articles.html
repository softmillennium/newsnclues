"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links." Some might say you've really made it when you have a certain number of social media followers, or a large-digit number in your bank account, but I think the true measure of success is when skilled manicurists make complex nail art in your honor. If you're not familiar with nail art, it's a step (or 20) above the classic manicure. Nail artists use specialized gels and polishes to create 3-D sculptural effects on the tips of their clients' fingers. Take a look around at any racetrack and you‚Äôll see fans and engineers sporting checkered flags or the general paint schemes of their favorite teams, but when I saw Lisa Kim's recent set of Formula 1 nails, I knew F1 fandom had reached a new level. Kim was kind enough to send me some photos of her latest work and answer my questions about creating it. "I wanted to make it a nail set you've never seen before. I sculpted with 3-D sculpting gel, using models of Ferrari F1 cars from 2010‚Äì2015 as inspiration. All pretty detailed for someone who says she wasn‚Äôt even an F1 fan when the request came in. For now, Kim says she really only gets racing nail requests from women, "Although I do want more male clients!" Kim says the pictured client's nails took about 10 hours from start to finish, and with an hourly rate of $110-$140 AUD per hour depending on complexity, showcasing your team loyalty won‚Äôt come cheap. Personally, I love seeing these inroads of motorsport fandom into fashion and crafting culture. Pair Kim‚Äôs nails with the crocheted Ferrari sweater recently covered by Road and Track (with a hat-tip to yours truly, thanks very much) and you‚Äôll be dressed to impress on the pit walk.

Internal combustion engines are incredibly complicated machines that many of us interact with on a daily basis, but don't completely understand. If one of those events doesn't occur, you call the shop to fix it. Read more: Porsche Taycan Turbos Have Lost Up To $100,000 Value In 4 Years The combustion chamber inside each cylinder in a diesel engine facilitates combustion by housing air at extremely high pressures, which when compressed by the piston and combined with diesel fuel, heats up and ignites the fuel. This is why diesel engine blocks are almost always made of heavy cast iron, since cast iron has superior compressive strength and the ability to withstand intense thermal cycling. These glow plugs are important tools that allow diesels to start right up, even in extremely cold temperatures. Modern diesel engines are designed to house glow plugs inside the cylinders right next to the intake and exhaust valves and use electricity from a vehicle's battery to heat up and glow hence the name glow plug. They reach optimal start-up temperatures in under four seconds, and computers control them to create the perfect temperature to induce combustion of the diesel fuel. Depending on operating conditions, some advanced diesel engine glow plugs can remain active while the engine is running to optimize the combustion process. The Unique Operation Of Diesel Engines Makes Runaway Possible a semitruck with flames coming out of its smoke stacks when it experienced runaway - Texas Adventurer/ YouTube It causes the engine speed to uncontrollably increase in a self-perpetuating combustion cycle, since diesels only need air, fuel, and compression to fire. Turbocharged engines, whether fueled by diesel or gasoline, can experience a phenomenon called blow-by. Some blow-by is normal, but excessive blow-by is a sign of serious engine, more specifically piston ring wear or damage, especially on high-mileage engines. Since virtually all diesel engines are turbocharged, blow-by is virtually an ever-present possibility, and it also happens to be one potential cause of diesel runaway. Diesel runaway, though rare, most commonly occurs under a few different circumstances that are primarily classified as fueling failures. Most turbochargers are internally lubricated by engine oil, and a blown seal inside a turbodiesel engine's turbocharger can cause motor oil to be unintentionally and uncontrollably drawn into the turbocharger intake. Failed diesel fuel-injection systems can also lead to the dangerous phenomenon. I was recently introduced to the enthralling animated deep dives into chemical and work safety disasters published by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board on YouTube. Man agricultural machinery mechanic diagnoses tractor engine operation using digital tablet. Diesel engine runaway is a rare occurrence, especially among the advanced modern turbodiesel engines that are now produced and sold on both the private and commercial market. Modern diesels often mitigate the likelihood of dangerous blow-by by using an oil separator that prevents volatile derelict oil from entering the combustion chamber. Regular maintenance and inspection of key components such as turbochargers, fuel injectors, and air intake systems can preemptively catch a failing component that could lead to runaway. Older, high-mileage diesel engines are at higher risk for engine runaway, but can be fortified against it by using a couple different techniques. There are aftermarket inline devices that shut off the engine's air supply at excessive engine speeds, thus halting the positive feedback loop that causes runaway. Some older diesel engines have a tube to ventilate extreme crankcase pressure which helps prevent flammable oils from leaving the crankcase and entering the combustion chamber. There are also some off-the-shelf oil treatment and stabilizer additives that can help to lubricate piston rings in diesel engines. Sometimes engines experiencing runaway can suffer catastrophic damage like seized bearings or broken rods that may stop the reaction without human intervention. Stopping a diesel engine experiencing runaway is a simple yet daunting task that can rapidly become impeded by fire, heat, or by fear of the terrifying reaction. The easiest way to stop a runaway is usually by choking it out, or finding a way to cut off the air supply.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

He had at least five more points of contact with the ground before skidding to a stop, alternating from hitting the surface with the nose and the vehicle's roof mostly.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/exclusive-inside-foxs-big-plan-193900846.html'>Exclusive: Inside Fox's Big Plan to Blow Up IndyCar</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 19:39:00 <p>
That commitment starts with the network's three-man booth, which carries over familiar analysts Townsend Bell and James Hinchcliffe from NBC's recent coverage of the series. The big change is at play-by-play, where Fox brought in F1 broadcaster and Drive to Survive staple Will Buxton. The move was a surprise to fans, but as Buxton tells Road & Track, it was a long time coming "I got to do a couple of races when NBC had the rights to both Formula 1 and IndyCar," Buxton says. My first forays, my first explorations out to the States back in 2012, when I was still working with Speed Channel, were done with the primary focus of shifting to IndyCar. I had this sudden realization that I get to complete the triple crown this year, having done the Monaco Grand Prix, having done Le Mans as a pit reporter, and now the 500. I know that the emotions will be absolutely huge." It will also be Buxton's first time calling an oval race. It's something I'm tremendously excited about and very much looking forward to." For Bell and Hinchcliffe, calling IndyCar is nothing new. Doing so with Fox is a different story, though. Both analysts see the network's interest in new ideas as a major differentiator. "It's a fresh set of eyes," Bell says. "It's been fun for me, and with [Hinchcliffe] and [Buxton], because we've thrown out ideas, which we've always done. Invariably, if it's an established network like NBC or a smaller one, sometimes 5 percent, 1 percent of those ideas see the light of day. It seems like in the past few months almost 100 percent of those ideas have been properly evaluated and considered. At least, I don't know, 50 percent of them have already been implemented. The "FoxTrax" glowing puck that the network debuted nearly 30 years ago was not universally loved, but it sent a message that the then-young network's sports division was willing to do things differently. Decades later, IndyCar is being broadcast differently, too. "The biggest thing is coming in with a clean slate," Hinchcliffe adds. For me, [NBC was like] walking into a well-oiled machine. With Fox coming in, it's like [Bell] said, a fresh pair of eyes." "It's the openness, to hearing ideas and trying things out. There's little inside baseball stuff to make this run smoother, all the way to things like [Buxton] coming up with this idea to warm up on couches from the paddock, which they've implemented as well. The three on-air stars are new to Fox, but producer Pam Miller is not. She has been with Fox since the network got a NASCAR deal in 2011, following time producing racing of all sorts on CBS and ESPN. As Miller tells R&T, the network is focused on highlighting key differences: With those key items in mind, the Fox team can build a more cohesive brand identity for IndyCar that sets it apart from other racing series. With two and a half months of regular IndyCar racing before the flagship Indianapolis 500, Fox is thinking about how to promote both the series on its own and its relationship with that tentpole event. "The Josef Newgarden ad started the cadence, making sure everyone knows that he's won it twice in a row. You'll see us evolve with our technology over the next few weeks. You'll see us tell stories about Indy, you'll see us tell stories about how the traditions happened, what the traditions are. Educating the fans each week, in all our different shows, leading up to Indy. It's the biggest sporting event in the world, and we want people to understand that and be excited for it. That's going to be the cadence and our goal each week as we move towards May." Fox's first IndyCar broadcast aired earlier this month. Like just about everything that airs on live television, it drew a few complaints. International viewers were missing some graphics during the race. Illustrated headshots of drivers, a controversial staple on Fox's NASCAR and NFL broadcasts, were as constant on the broadcast as they were out of place. Even series drivers joked about the off-key illustrations. Not every problem is going to be fixed quickly, but the network moved quickly on all three of these. Not only did that post showed updates to the problematic heads-up display graphic, it demonstrated that the much-maligned illustrations had already been replaced by more conventional headshots. In a major departure from every other major racing series in the country, every single IndyCar race is set to be broadcast live on Fox's main network throughout the rest of the season. If Fox can keep up this momentum, it will be the most-watched season of open-wheel racing in decades.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/lenos-law-aims-relax-smog-180000038.html'>'Leno's Law' Aims to Relax Smog Rules for California Classic Cars</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 18:00:00 <p>
On one hand, there are seemingly endless shows and meets, the weather is great, and there's always another barn find just waiting to be dug up out of the cobwebs and brought back to glory. On the other hand, forever idling in traffic isn't great, and getting an old car through emissions regulations can be tough. California Senate Bill 712, set to go before the state's transportation committee next month, aims to provide a smog-testing exemption for cars built in 1990 and earlier. In fact, SB-712 has picked up the nickname ‚ÄúLeno's Law,‚Äù as Jay Leno has been outspoken about the need to relax emissions regulations for classic cars. The average age of a car in the United States is between 12 and 14 years old, so cars that are more than 30 years old are only a small segment of what's on the road. Especially if insured as a collector car, as few of these machines are doing the kind of mileage that would have a measurable environmental impact. A vehicle that's at least 35 years old is already exempt from certain portions of the existing emissions test; the proposed bill just extends things to full exemption. At the same time, classic car enthusiasm supports a host of industries in California, everything from big-dollar restomod companies to mom-and-pop upholstery shops. About 14 percent of businesses in the Specialty Equipment Marketing Association (SEMA) are based in California, and California-based enthusiasts order replacement and refurbished parts from other shops all across the U.S. In neighboring Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona, a host of emissions regulations are more relaxed and often have exemptions built in for collector cars. In Nevada, for instance, there are special registration categories for collector vehicles, and many of them are exempt from emissions testing if driven less than 5000 miles per year. Broadly, SB-712 appeals to common sense that would make life a lot easier for classic car owners in California. It can be tricky to get a European- or Japanese-market import through the emissions tests as they are written, and some shops will simply turn away older cars, as their technicians may not be trained on older smog compliance equipment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission. Tesla is in trouble, and this time, it's not just about Elon Musk's latest headline-making moment. The company's electric vehicle sales are dropping fast, and that could put billions of dollars in revenue from a different part of the business at risk (along with its ability to compete in the EV market), as reported by Futurism. Tesla sells carbon credits to these companies, helping them meet strict pollution rules in Europe. If the company loses billions in carbon credit revenue, it might try to make up for it by raising prices or cutting costs in ways that hurt customers, like slower repairs or fewer upgrades. On that note, Chinese automakers like BYD (Build Your Dreams), Nio, and XPeng are making cheaper electric cars with newer tech and features. Some models come with better driver-assist systems and fast charging, which is a big deal for buyers. BYD even passed Tesla as the world's top EV seller at the end of 2023, proving how much things are shifting ‚Äî and Tesla's sales have now started dropping in China too, with a reported 28.7% drop across January and February year-over-year. Lately, Tesla has been dealing with protests at dealerships, more canceled orders, and a wave of social media backlash. Some longtime fans have said they're done supporting the company because of Musk On top of that, a slowdown in Tesla's sales could hurt the broader shift to EVs. Fewer people might switch from gas cars to electric ones, which isn't great for efforts to cut pollution and address rising global temperatures. Plenty of other automakers are making reliable and affordable electric cars. For budget-friendly options, BYD and UK's MG Motor are rolling out lower-cost models that are gaining traction, though they may not be available in all markets.

Despite attempts to disguise their appearances, several of the alleged vandals have already been arrested. Based on recently unsealed court records, it sounds like a big reason they were able to do that was because automatic license plate readers are so ubiquitous these days, 404 Media reports. But the alleged vandals also reportedly gave away a lot more information on social media than they may have intended. Still, without the license plate readers and other security cameras, it's unlikely that law enforcement would have been able to piece together enough information to make arrests as quickly as they did.

Eventually, they figured out what it was ‚Äî a cardboard carrier for Holland 1839 beer. They also found footage of someone wearing the same outfit getting into a white van in the parking lot of an outlet mall. Using an open source search that included social media, authorities were able to obtain a phone number that, in turn, matched with a man they were able to track further by searching for his name on another "mobile payment app," presumably Venmo or something similar. There, they found what appeared to be the same sweatshirt worn by the Tesla vandal, as well as a receipt for Holland Lager 1839. Another high-profile instance of anti-Tesla vandalism took place in Colorado, where, over several days, someone spray painted "NAZI" and "FU*K MUSK" on a Tesla showroom sign, vandalized multiple vehicles and threw a Molotov cocktail at a Cybertruck. The vandal walked to the Tesla lot and was dressed in all black with a hood up and mask on, which should have made them incredibly difficult to find. A license plate reader identified both the car and its owner. The driver didn't commit any crimes that time, but authorities arrested her anyway, believing they had enough evidence to tie her to previous instances of vandalism. Still, even generally well-informed people may not realize just how much of their movement can actually be tracked, even without law enforcement having access to their phone's location data. Even a relatively small amount of information can give away far more than you ever intended. Cops don't always follow the rules, and all it would take is a willing accomplice with the right access for an abuser to track a victim to their new address. A first name and a job can be all someone needs from a dating app to find your last name, and once someone has your name, they can find your social media accounts and possibly even where you live.

At the very least, be sure to lock down your social media accounts and stop posting publicly on Venmo.

But is boosting car sales still the reason manufacturers invest in motor racing? However, factor in potential vehicle sales from brand exposure in racing with the earnings from sponsorship deals, potential prize money, and‚Äîin some series‚Äîrevenue-sharing models, and motorsports involvement can help an automaker stay in the black. Most F1 teams operate out of the U.K., a country that legally requires companies to disclose certain financial and accounting information to the public. Thanks to this, we know the true costs of fielding a modern F1 team. For instance, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 spent north of $530 million during the 2023 season but ultimately ended the year with more than $104 million in profits. TRACKING NEW TECH: Government regulations and consumer demand limit just how much of a race car's mechanicals make their way to an automaker's road cars, but competition continues to drive innovations that go beyond the track. Manufacturers may approach racing as a place to test proofs of concept or the general reliability of new technologies or ideas, be it in the form of a powertrain setup, thermal management, or a tire compound. Compared with F1, the tens of millions of dollars it costs to field a two-car team in the FIA World Endurance Championship's (WEC) Hypercar class and the International Motor Sports Association's (IMSA) GTP class is a relative pittance. Though the potential profits from top-level endurance racing are a fraction of those from a large global series like F1, so are the possible losses. For automakers, some of which have multibillion-dollar marketing budgets, operating an endurance-racing team at a potential small loss can be a risk worth taking to increase brand exposure and awareness. AT ALL COSTS: Since 2023, F1 has enforced a $135 million cap covering almost every aspect of the development and manufacturing of a team's car, the salaries of most team personnel, and garage equipment costs. The sport holds engines to a separate $95 million max. There are no limits on driver salaries or marketing budgets. Thanks to generous sponsorship deals, ample prize money, and revenue sharing, F1 teams can operate in the black. "We sold approximately 700 to 800 General Motors vehicles through our IMSA racing platform in 2024," says Meagan Quinn, a marketing manager for GM who works on Cadillac Racing. "If somebody tells us they're in the market right now, a dealer reaches out to them immediately," Quinn adds. Meanwhile, NBC Sports said last year that viewership of its IMSA broadcasts grew 37 percent in five years, with the network claiming more than 12 million viewers last season. To Doonan, who before joining IMSA served as the director of motorsports for Mazda in North America, the continued enthusiasm for motorsports‚Äîincluding the growing interest in endurance racing‚Äîfrom automakers and fans alike is little surprise.

Wilmore, Williams and everyone else in the Astronaut Corps knew what they signed up for when they applied to join NASA. The space agency might be five decades removed from the Apollo era, but astronauts are still thrilled to live in space. They were willing to make sacrifices that engineers on the ground weren't to get their Boeing spacecraft fully functional.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Decrypt‚Äôs Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. When Swedish UFO film ‚ÄúWatch the Skies‚Äù hits U.S. cinemas this May, audiences won‚Äôt be able to tell that it wasn‚Äôt made in English. The film is the first full theatrical release to showcase ‚Äúvisual dubbing‚Äù technology from AI firm Flawless, which enables actors‚Äô performances to be digitally lip-synced with foreign-language dubs. ‚ÄúWatch the Skies‚Äù follows rebellious teenager Denise, who teams up with a club of UFO watchers to solve the mystery of her missing father. However, for its U.S. release, the original cast have re-recorded their performances in English, with Flawless using its TrueSync machine learning technology to digitally alter their lip movements so that they sync up with the English dialogue. ‚ÄúFlawless and their technology gives us the opportunity to release the film for a much larger audience,‚Äù said writer-director Victor Danell in a making-of featurette. ‚ÄúA lot of filmmakers and a lot of actors will be afraid of this technology at first, but we have the creative control, and to act out the film in English was a real exciting experience,‚Äù said Danell, adding that, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still our movie, it‚Äôs still the actors‚Äô performance, and that‚Äôs the key part.‚Äù In a 2023 presentation, Flawless co-founder Scott Mann explained that the company‚Äôs TrueSync technology uses deep learning to create a volumetric 3D representation of the actors‚Äô faces throughout a film, which can then be altered to match the dubbed dialogue. TrueSync was previously used on the 2022 film ‚ÄúFall‚Äù to remove swearing for a PG-13 edit, while another of the company‚Äôs products, DeepEditor, enables an actor‚Äôs performance to be extracted from one scene and applied to another scene, without the need for reshoots. The company has partnered with distributor XYZ Films to release a slate of features localized using TrueSync, including ‚ÄúRun Lola Run‚Äù director Tom Tykwer‚Äôs upcoming ‚ÄúThe Light,‚Äù horror feature ‚ÄúVincent Must Die,‚Äù and South Korean film ‚ÄúSmugglers.‚Äù</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Michael Kehoe was ready to buy his first car in 1980, and he was trying to decide between a 1980 Chevy Corvette and a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am. He had just graduated high school and had the cash for his first vehicle, and chose the Corvette. After having to sell it for tuition, he never forgot about the car, and finally found it. ‚ÄúMy dad owned J&J Sheet Metal in Warren,‚Äù said Kehoe, who grew up in Sterling Heights. Kehoe got the Corvette red car that had been owned by a GM exec, who drove it for about six months before he bought it. ‚ÄúIt had 2,500 miles when I bought the car,‚Äù Kehoe said. Selling the car wasn‚Äôt easy, as he described handing over the keys as being a devastating experience. After 11 years of schooling, he became on Orthodontist, opening Kehoe Orthodontics, and retiring in December 2020. Michael was sleeping when the call came in, but he jumped out of bed and checked. After some digging, it was verified to be Michael Kehoe‚Äôs Corvette. ‚ÄúI repurchased the car in August of 2021 for the same price I sold it for in 1983.

As an internationally-recognized Honda driver, Senna was conscripted to star in a series of commercials for the Japanese market, including this recently-uncovered ad for the then-brand-new fourth-generation Honda Prelude. I'm sure it was part of his contract with Honda to promote Honda products, but did he have to get so dang sexy with it? The baggy pleated pants and matching oversized turtleneck is pure early-1990s fashion, and Senna's elegantly disheveled hair tousles with carefree ease. The clean-cut Brazilian ace gives a wry smile and the smallest hint of a wink to let you know he's got his eye on you. His carefree laissez-faire lean on the trunk lid isn't begging, but it is a little slutty. This isn't an ad for a Prelude, this is one of the fastest men on earth doing his damnedest to convince you that driving a Honda is sexy. Look, I like the Prelude a lot, but Senna didn't have to get all bedroom eyes with it. And the new Prelude was a pretty big deal, so Honda wanted to throw everything it had at the promotion of its new mid-tier sports coupe. With new electronic four-wheel steering and a 2.2-liter engine, yeah, it was almost as impressive to drive as it was to look at. With 197 horsepower in the uprated VTEC Si model, the Prelude was a quick and attractive little thing, much like Senna himself.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Read the full story on Modern Car Collector Lamborghini Urus Destroyed in Crash Involving a Mustang on I-95 Footage shared by NBC Miami revealed the devastating impact on the Lamborghini Urus, which had collided with a guardrail, leaving it nearly unrecognizable and destined for a parts yard like Copart. The luxury SUV, known for its high price tag and performance, now faces a significant insurance claim. In stark contrast, the Mustang appeared almost untouched from certain angles, though closer inspection showed flaring on the driver‚Äôs side fender, indicating more extensive damage along the vehicle's side. The lack of clarity leaves room for various theories about how such a dramatic accident unfolded. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of cautious driving, especially during the warm summer months when road conditions can vary, and traffic incidents are more frequent. Drivers are urged to stay alert, drive defensively, and be mindful of their surroundings to avoid similar accidents. Factors such as aggressive driving, impaired judgment due to alcohol, and fatigue from long-distance travel contribute to the risk of accidents, making vigilance essential for road safety. In conclusion, the crash involving a Lamborghini Urus and a Ford Mustang on I-95 in Broward County serves as a sobering example of the potential consequences of reckless driving.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Honda is making an unexpected move to navigate the shifting landscape of U.S. tariffs ‚Äî buying hybrid batteries from longtime rival Toyota. The deal, reported by the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, allows Honda to sidestep hefty import tariffs on components sourced from China and Japan while giving Toyota‚Äôs new $14 billion North Carolina battery plant an early win. But with the Trump administration‚Äôs new tariffs ‚Äî including a 10% levy on Chinese imports that took effect this month and an expected jump from 2.5% to 25% on Japanese-built vehicles ‚Äî Honda is under pressure to rethink its supply chain. Honda, which sold over 308,000 hybrids in the U.S. last year, is planning to expand its hybrid lineup and needs a stable, tariff-free battery supply. Toyota, meanwhile, gets a major customer to help justify its massive battery investment in North Carolina. While details on which Honda models will use Toyota-supplied batteries remain unclear, the popular CR-V Hybrid is a strong contender. Honda is simply purchasing batteries from Toyota without a reciprocal deal in place. Toyota‚Äôs North Carolina plant, covering over seven million square feet, will be a key supplier not just for its own hybrid and EV models but also for a competitor. Signage is pictured outside the headquarters of Japanese automaker Toyota in Tokyo on May 10, 2023.YUICHI YAMAZAKI/Getty Images Honda and Toyota aren‚Äôt the only manufacturers reconfiguring supply chains to avoid tariffs. If tariffs continue to escalate, we could see further collaboration between automakers that once saw each other strictly as rivals.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/1965-buick-riviera-bring-trailer-150000325.html'>1965 Buick Riviera on Bring a Trailer Is a Former Auto-Show Model</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 15:00:00 <p>
Back in the 1960s, Buick built genuinely beautiful cars. This is a Gran Sport model, fitted with the most powerful V-8 on offer. At the 1964 New York auto show, Buick showed off a refreshed version of its already stunning Riviera coupe. Formerly fitted with fixed quad headlights up front, the lights were now hidden behind clamshell covers, such that the car presented a cleaner appearance with a wide, unbroken grille. Now, you can get your hands on the exact model that dropped jaws when the covers came off in NYC. This 1965 Buick Riviera is the very same car that sat in Buick's display at the 1964 auto show, and it's up for sale on Bring a Trailer (which, like Car and Driver, is part of Hearst Autos). It's a Gran Sport model, which means a bump in power thanks to two four-barrel carburetors, and it's been recently refinished in its original Verde Green. One noted Riviera fan was Leonard Nimoy, who bought his first car‚Äîan early 1963 model‚Äîand regularly drove it to the set during the filming of Star Trek. William Shatner had a Corvette, of course, just like the Apollo astronauts, but the man who played Spock wanted something that had a little more restraint along with V-8 performance. This example had the same owner for four decades, a Naval fighter pilot who is said to have cared for it the way you'd expect. A comprehensive cosmetic refinishing in 2023 refreshed the paint and chromework, and also replaced the Gran Sport badging out back. Underneath, the suspension has been gone through with replacement bushings and ball joints. From the factory, it was good for 360 horsepower and a stout 465 pound-feet of torque. A three-speed automatic handles shifting duties, and the car wears its original 15-inch Rally wheels.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The asset jumped briefly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that everything was under control and that President Trump's tariffs would have a "transitory" effect on inflation. Bitcoin had been dipping‚Äîjust like stocks‚Äîwhenever President Trump abruptly announced tariffs over the past month. American Bitcoin investors had been fast cashing out of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, but that all changed this week, Farside Investors data shows. Note that the positive sentiment hasn't extended to all crypto ETFs, as Ethereum funds are collectively nursing a now 13-day losing streak (including Friday's fresh data)‚Äîeven as Bitcoin funds show green over the last six days. Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt that volatility‚Äîin the short-term, at least‚Äîwas likely here to stay. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it would put right the previous administration's "mess" by being clearer on rules for the digital asset industry, made a statement that applies to Bitcoin mining: proof-of-work mining operations do not need to register their actions as they "do not involve the offer and sale of securities."

In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, the firm's Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said that calling the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap a "risk-on" asset was not exactly accurate.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/291957/elon-musk-and-doge-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-department-of-government-efficiency'>Elon Musk and DOGE: What You Need to Know About the Department of Government Efficiency</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 13:49:57 <p>
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is helming a new U.S. government initiative aimed at lowering the federal budget deficit. DOGE is a U.S. government initiative that Elon Musk first tweeted about in August. Musk originally intended to run the agency alongside fellow billionaire and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. However, Ramaswamy stepped back from DOGE in January, amid reports he planned to run for Ohio governor. While the project initially appeared to be a joke‚Äîcreated as a gag, and unsurprisingly pumping the price of Dogecoin whenever mentioned by Musk‚ÄîTrump threw his support behind DOGE‚Äôs push to curtail government spending, saying that the once-fictitious department would actually become a real-life U.S. government-affiliated entity. ‚ÄúTogether, [Musk and Ramaswamy] will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies‚Äîessential to the 'Save America' movement," Trump said in a statement. Rather, Musk's meme-linked brainchild will exist ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of the government system, Trump said. That means DOGE will likely not receive government funds. It also means that the project's ability to directly control U.S. government agency budgets will be minimal, although DOGE‚Äôs directives could be implemented by Trump's supporters in Congress. He will not receive compensation for his work, according to a Twitter post that Musk published. Indeed, this will be tedious work, make lots of enemies & compensation is zero. The initiative is staffed and shepherded by at least 30 people, ProPublica reported. Meanwhile, billionaire Marc Andreessen of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz has been recruited to act as DOGE‚Äôs ‚Äúkey networker for talent recruitment,‚Äù the Washington Post reported, citing an anonymous source. Those advisors include Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the paper reported, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia is also consulting for DOGE. DOGE‚Äôs mandate is to streamline the U.S. government by issuing reports that provide advice and guidance on trimming government regulations and spending, according to Trump. We‚Äôre going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook," Musk said in October at a rally for Trump at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The quasi-department plans to accomplish that task by pushing its cost-cutting proposals through Congress. Musk and Ramaswamy could also present their ideas directly to Trump, who has the power to circumvent Congress and issue executive orders that would call for the implementation of DOGE directives. While critics have expressed doubts as to how much change DOGE will be able to effect, it has become increasingly likely that its budget-slashing measures will get at least some play in Congress. However, he has since backtracked on his grandiose claims, saying in January that cutting $2 trillion from the federal government was actually unlikely. Under Musk, the initiative has slapped an agency tracking U.S. students‚Äô academic progress with $900 million in cuts, along with slashing more than $100 million for funding DEI initiatives spearheaded by the Education Department. An NBC News report in February said that DOGE will use AI tools to evaluate federal employees to determine whether or not they should keep their jobs. The faux department's initialism, DOGE, appears to be a cheeky reference to the ticker for Dogecoin (DOGE), a high-market-cap meme coin beloved by Elon Musk. The meme, which is famous for its Shiba Inu mascot, was invented in 2013 by a pair of software engineers. Musk has said that he owns a ‚Äúbunch‚Äù of Dogecoin, and he has tweeted and spoken about the coin routinely over the past years. Dogecoin's value climbed amid Musk‚Äôs support for Trump on the campaign trail, and then skyrocketed after Trump‚Äôs win and amid the official announcement of DOGE leadership. The coin hit a three-year-high price in December and has helped spur other notable meme coins to surge in value, as well. DOGE's deep cuts to federal government agencies‚Äô workforce have continued in recent weeks. As of this writing, the initiative claims to have terminated more than 5,600 government contracts worth $20 billion, and also claims to have scrapped 7,616 grants worth roughly $18 billion for the Department of Education, Environmental Protection Agency, USAID and the Department of State, among other agencies, according to the DOGE website. In early March, Musk's team caused a major uproar when it successfully pushed for President Trump to order the Department of Education to terminate nearly 50% of its workforce. Beyond the staffing cuts, DOGE has courted controversy elsewhere. DOGE has received access to Treasury Department records on millions of Americans‚Äô personal data, including bank account numbers and Social Security numbers, the Washington Post reported in early February. The publication also reported that DOGE has fed sensitive information into AI software to guide its federal spending cut proposals. A federal judge in early February moved to block DOGE‚Äôs digging, however. And for a few weeks after the order was issued, DOGE workers were no longer allowed to wield their influence over the Treasury system, while all records that the team copied so far were ordered to be destroyed. However, a federal judge in early March sided against the complaint, fueling the DOGE team‚Äôs hopes that it might continue using government data for its cost-slashing initiatives. Outside of the courts, challenges to DOGE's work have also emerged. Notably, President Donald Trump allegedly told Cabinet secretaries in early March that they‚Äînot DOGE‚Äîwould have final say on staffing decisions across federal agencies. Meanwhile, other lawmakers have also taken aim at reigning in DOGE.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Reflecting more general market anxiety, Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have seen dramatic falls as of February 28, 2025. Investors increasingly seek alternatives offering tangible use cases and long-term growth potential. Among these, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out as a unique initiative since it positions itself as a significant participant in the crypto market by using real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing. With its original value offer, RXS should surpass SHIB and SOL in 2025. On February 24, it dropped below $150 and reached its lowest price for the year‚Äî$137.77. Worries over network disruptions, security flaws, and more general economic issues exacerbated Solana‚Äôs problems, along with a 36.28% monthly drop. Once driven by community buzz, Shiba Inu has also witnessed a sharp fall. As transaction volumes drop and investor interest declines, this bearish trend emphasizes SHIB‚Äôs reliance on speculation rather than utility. The company‚Äôs inability to sustain critical support levels further questions its long-term survival. While Solana and Shiba Inu battle market demands, Rexas Finance is becoming one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies in 2025. Built on a firm foundation of real-world asset tokenization, RXS allows investors to hold fractional shares of real estate, commodities, and other valuable assets via blockchain technology, unlike meme currencies or network-reliant initiatives. Analysts credit RXS‚Äôs success to its concrete use cases, elevating it beyond speculative value. Unlike many crypto initiatives that depend on hype, Rexas Finance provides a complete ecosystem, including staking, yield farming, and distributed governance. Its adaptability makes it one of the most well-rounded blockchain initiatives to watch in 2025. Furthermore, the Rexas Launchpad is an indispensable financial venue for developing blockchain initiatives. The Launchpad gives early-stage funding prospects so RXS holders can access high-potential projects before they find general use. Given the presale‚Äôs incredible momentum, analysts estimate a notable price swing once RXS becomes generally available for trading. Although Solana and Shiba Inu still face market challenges, Rexas Finance is one initiative with a better 2025 growth ceiling.

With a structured DeFi framework, an expanding community, and impressive presale traction, many are wondering: Could MUTM rise to prominence like other top-performing assets? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform that facilitates lending and borrowing, offering sustainable financial solutions within the DeFi sector. Through the platform, users can either supply assets to earn passive income or borrow funds by securing collateral. This dual utility fosters long-term stability, as increased borrowing activity boosts liquidity usage while rewarding lenders with competitive returns. A standout feature of Mutuum Finance is its mtTokens system, which allows users to generate passive income without relying on traditional staking models that can dilute token value. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, which automatically accumulate interest over time‚Äîgrowing in redemption value without requiring active trading. Mutuum Finance also incorporates a buy-and-distribute mechanism using platform fees to repurchase MUTM tokens, ensuring continuous buy pressure. These tokens are then redistributed to mtTOKEN holders, incentivizing participation and reinforcing sustained demand as the platform expands. With the launch price set at $0.06, investors who enter now could see an immediate 3x return upon listing‚Äîeven before potential post-launch momentum takes effect. Dogecoin, which began as a meme coin, gained significant adoption due to its strong community and expanding real-world use cases. Additionally, the Mutuum Finance team is actively developing an overcollateralized stablecoin that will enhance liquidity and expand borrowing options. This additional utility is expected to attract more users, further strengthening MUTM‚Äôs market demand while reinforcing price stability. Once MUTM is listed on major platforms, its market reach will expand significantly, potentially triggering a strong price surge. The low entry point of $0.02 combined with a guaranteed 3x return at launch makes it an attractive opportunity for investors seeking both short-term gains and long-term growth.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As ever, there's a new game of Wordle to enjoy. In case you need some help with it, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Saturday's puzzle (#1,372). Wordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. Wordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once. How to play Wordle more than once a day If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. In addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. Before today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed: Every day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle. This should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. There are no repeated letters in today's Wordle answer. This is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. Don't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself. Not to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Meanwhile, BinoFi‚Äôs record presale and hybrid exchange innovation have made it a standout investment opportunity. The rollout of Interchain Enhanced Protocols (IEP) introduced more sophisticated tools aimed at facilitating seamless interaction between blockchains within its ecosystem. This update builds upon the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, making cross-chain transfers faster, more secure, and scalable. While Cosmos focuses on connecting the blockchain world, BinoFi is revolutionizing how it‚Äôs accessed and traded. What sets BinoFi apart is its ability to resolve longstanding issues in crypto trading, such as liquidity fragmentation and high transaction fees. Its cross-chain trading capability enables users to trade assets across multiple networks without relying on wrapped tokens or third-party bridges. Its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets ensure funds remain safe while giving users full custody of their assets. The platform also eliminates gas fees for transactions, a feature that has been especially appealing to traders who seek efficiency without added costs. With early adopters looking at an launch price of $0.30, investor enthusiasm is peaking. When projections hold true, early participants could enjoy returns of over 1,400%, right out the gate. This meteoric interest reflects trust in BinoFi‚Äôs ambitious roadmap and its potential to dominate the crypto exchange market. March 2025 serves as a reminder that innovation in blockchain isn‚Äôt slowing down. Together, they represent the evolving opportunities in a fast-changing industry, making 2025 an exciting year for seasoned investors and newcomers alike.
