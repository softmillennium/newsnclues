https://livescience.com,Science news this week: 'Stranded' astronauts return and mystery human ancestor,https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/science-news-this-week-stranded-astronauts-return-and-mystery-human-ancestor,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 04:01:00 GMT","This week's science news was largely dominated by the return of two NASA astronauts from the International Space Station, whose planned eight-day mission ended up lasting 286 days.

Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams lifted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on June 5, 2024, but not long into the mission helium leaks , along with a number of other issues, were discovered on their Boeing Starliner spacecraft.

Starliner had already suffered years of delays, and although it was later suggested the pair would have been fine to return home on the suspect vessel , the risk to their safety was considered too great. As such, it wasn't until 5:57 p.m. ET on Tuesday (March 18) that the astronauts finally splashed down near the coast of Florida , after hitching a lift aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.

While much of the attention on them focused on the duo being ""stranded"" in space, it's not a sentiment the pair shared. In a conversation with CNN's Anderson Cooper, they explained how mission extensions are sometimes just part of the job .

""We come prepared, we come committed. That is what your human spaceflight program is: It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those,"" Wilmore told Cooper. ""We don't feel abandoned. We don't feel stuck. We don't feel stranded.""

They found that the ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago. This unknown population contributed 20% of our DNA and may have boosted humans' brain function.

""The fact that we can reconstruct events from hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago just by looking at DNA today is astonishing, and it tells us that our history is far richer and more complex than we imagined,"" study co-author Aylwyn Scally , a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement .

Astronomers studying the largest-ever map of the cosmos have found hints that our best understanding of the universe is due a major rewrite. The analysis, which looked at nearly 15 million galaxies and quasars spanning 11 billion years of cosmic time, found that dark energy — the presumed-to-be constant force driving the accelerating expansion of our universe — could be weakening.

Or at least this is what the data, collected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), suggest when combined with information taken from star explosions, the cosmic microwave background and weak gravitational lensing. If the findings hold up, it means that one of the most mysterious forces controlling the fate of our universe is even weirder than first thought — and that something is very wrong with our current model of the cosmos .

Science spotlight

Scientists have developed new blood tests that can detect early chemical signatures of cancer. For diseases like pancreatic cancer, that could lead to earlier diagnosis and a better prognosis. (Image credit: CSA Images via Getty Images)

Around four years ago, now 77-year-old John Gormly went for what was supposed to be a routine blood test. But the results were life-changing.

The test suggested Gormly had colon cancer, which a colonoscopy later confirmed was Stage 2, meaning the cancer had spread through the wall of the colon but not to his lymph nodes.

""I thought [my doctor] was wrong,"" Gormly, CEO of a construction company near Newport Beach, California, told Live Science. ""I go, 'Nah, I don't feel anything.' But there it was. It was real; the colonoscopy showed it.""

Gormly was one of the first patients to take a newly approved test called Shield, which its makers say can detect colon cancer from a blood sample . After his diagnosis, Gormly had surgery to remove the tumor and was back at work within 10 days.

""Liquid biopsies"" like the one that detected early cancer for Gormly are now coming to market. Could they lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment?

By exposing a common type of plastic to an inexpensive catalyst and leaving it exposed to ambient air, researchers broke down 94% of the material in just four hours.

The plastic transformed into terephthalic acid (TPA), a highly valuable building block for polyesters. Because TPA can be upcycled into more valuable materials, the process offers a safer and cheaper alternative to current plastic recycling methods. The researchers published their findings Feb. 3 in the journal Green Chemistry .

""The U.S. is the number one plastic polluter per capita, and we only recycle 5% of those plastics,"" co-corresponding author Yosi Kratish , a research assistant professor of chemistry at Northwestern University, said in a statement . ""What's particularly exciting about our research is that we harnessed moisture from air to break down the plastics, achieving an exceptionally clean and selective process. By recovering the monomers, which are the basic building blocks of PET [polyethylene terephthalate], we can recycle or even upcycle them into more valuable materials.""

Plastic waste is an increasingly important issue. Over half of the plastic ever made has been produced since 2000, and annual production is projected to double by 2050, according to the European Environment Agency .

To date, only 9% of the plastics ever produced have been recycled. The remainder, with lifetimes often lasting generations, can have serious environmental and health impacts. For example, they wash out to sea to form floating blobs of trash, harm wildlife , and break down into microplastics that can enter the human brain and other parts of our bodies .

To find a new method to break down some of this waste, the researchers applied a molybdenum catalyst — a silver, ductile metal — and activated carbon to PET, the most common type of polyester plastic. The researchers then heated the mixture. After a short time, this broke the polyethylene's chemical bonds.

Then, when the team exposed the material to air, the mixture transformed into TPA, a valuable polyester precursor; and acetaldehyde, an industrial chemical that is also valuable and is easy to lift from the mixture.

When they tested the method on mixed plastics, the researchers found that it had an effect only on the polyester materials. That meant they didn't have to presort the plastics. It worked on plastic bottles, T-shirts and colored plastics, breaking them down into pure, colorless TPA.

""It worked perfectly,"" Kratish said. ""When we added extra water, it stopped working because it was too much water. It's a fine balance. But it turns out the amount of water in air was just the right amount.""

The team's next steps will be to adapt the process to large-scale industrial applications.",livescience

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Long after the black hole in the center of a galaxy sputters out, you can still see its ghost lingering in surrounding gas clouds aglow with leftover radiation, like wisps of smoke emanating from an already extinguished flame. Astronomers call these cosmic ghosts ""light echoes"" — and that's what high-school junior Julian Shapiro found while scanning the cosmos for supernova remnants.

""There are these outer regions of gas being ionized by a supermassive black hole, which results in this echo,"" Shapiro said at a March 20 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society (APS) Global Physics Summit.

Shapiro, 17, is a student at The Dalton School in New York City. But in between classes and scoping out potential colleges, he's also an independent astronomer who presents at global conferences like this week's APS meeting.

Originally, Shapiro began sifting through the DECaPS2 survey — an inventory of the southern galactic plane from the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile — to find the debris of exploding stars in supernova remnants and planetary nebulas .

But after zeroing in on one such object, he found its structure didn't match the wispy filaments characteristic of a supernova remnant, nor did it show evidence of a supernova at its center. ""It was a real surprise to stumble upon this,"" Shapiro told Live Science.

Related: High school students who came up with 'impossible' proof of Pythagorean theorem discover 9 more solutions to the problem

The object, which he believes to be a light echo, stands in a field of potential supermassive black holes. Using measurements from the Southern African Large Telescope , he found high contents of oxygen and ionized sulfur sprinkled into the region — both indicators of shocked material. All of these signs suggest that the object is the afterglow of a now-dormant black hole, which once spewed radiation that ionized the surrounding gas, causing it to emit light even after the black hole quieted down.

An epic echo

Shapiro currently pegs the light echo at about 150,000 to 250,000 light-years in diameter — about 1.5 to two times the width of the entire Milky Way galaxy. And if his estimates hold up, he thinks it could be a viable candidate for the largest light echo ever discovered.

""This object covers a large area in the sky, which makes it a bit easier to get in-depth images of,"" Shapiro said.

According to Sasha Plavin , a black hole researcher at Harvard University who was not involved in the research, echoes like the one Shapiro discovered can help us learn more about how black holes behave in the hearts of galaxies.

""I really like how carefully [Shapiro] looked into these images,"" Plavin told Live Science. ""These galactic events are always of interest, and I think these echoes are a great way of studying them.""

Plavin is also interested in seeing how this new light echo measures up to others — whether it occurred faster or slower than existing examples . ""Putting this discovery in a wider context could be useful in the future,"" he said.

As Shapiro continues studying the light echo, he hopes to learn more about its composition with measurements of its different regions. But in the meantime, he's excited to continue contributing to black hole science — even if he came across it by accident.

""My involvement in this area of research came as a bit of a surprise to me,"" he said. ""But I hope this object, in particular, helps expand the knowledge of galaxy activities that we don't have too great of an understanding of.""",livescience

This galaxy, designated Andromeda XXXV, and its compatriots orbiting our neighbor galaxy, Andromeda, could change how we think about cosmic evolution.

That's because dwarf galaxies this small should have been destroyed in the hotter and denser conditions of the early universe. Yet somehow, this tiny galaxy survived without being fried.

""These are fully functional galaxies, but they're about a millionth of the size of the Milky Way,"" team member and University of Michigan professor Eric Bell said in a statement. ""It's like having a perfectly functional human being that's the size of a grain of rice.""

Meet Andromeda XXXV

Dwarf galaxies themselves are nothing new to scientists. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is orbited by dozens of these satellite galaxies caught in the grip of its more immense galaxies.

There is, however, a great deal about dwarf galaxies that scientists don't know. This is because, being smaller, they are much dimmer than major galaxies, making them harder to spot and tougher to study at large distances.

While astronomers have been able to determine many dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way, identifying dwarf galaxies around our bright galactic neighbors has been incredibly difficult. This means that the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way have been our only source of information about small satellite galaxies.

This task is somewhat less challenging around the closest major galaxy to the Milky Way, Andromeda. Other dwarf galaxies have been spotted around Andromeda before, but these have been large and bright, thus simply confirming the information that astronomers had gathered about dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way.

To discover these paradigm-shifting smaller and dimmer dwarf galaxies, team leader Marcos Arias, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, and his colleagues scoured various massive astronomical datasets. The team was also able to obtain time with the Hubble Space Telescope to aid their search.

This revealed that not only is Andromeda XXXV a satellite galaxy, but it is also small enough to change theories of how galaxies evolve.

""It was really surprising,"" Bell said. ""It's the faintest thing you find around, so it's just kind of a neat system. But it's also unexpected in a lot of different ways.""

A cosmic murder mystery

One of the key aspects of galactic evolution is how long their star-forming periods last. This seemed to be the main difference between the Milky Way's dwarf galaxies and the smaller satellite galaxies of Andromeda.

""Most of the Milky Way satellites have very ancient star populations. They stopped forming stars about 10 billion years ago,"" Arias explained. ""What we're seeing is that similar satellites in Andromeda can form stars up to a few billion years ago — around 6 billion years.""

Star formation requires a steady supply of gas and dust to collapse and birth stellar bodies. When that gas is gone, star formation halts, and the galaxy ""dies.""



Thus, Bell described the situation around these small galaxies as a ""murder mystery."" Did star formation end when dwarf galaxies' gas supplies petered out on their own, or when these gases were gravitationally stripped away by a large galactic host?

In the case of the Milky Way, it appears that the gas for star formation petered out on its own; however, for the smaller galaxies around Andromeda, it appears they were ""killed"" by their parent galaxy.



""It's a little dark, but it's either did they fall or did they get pushed? These galaxies appear to have been pushed,"" Bell said. ""With that, we've learned something qualitatively new about galaxy formation from them.""

Not only is Andromeda XXXV the dimmest and smallest known satellite galaxy in the Andromeda system, it's about 3 million light-years away, making it very hard to spot. The ellipse within the inset shows where this companion galaxy was discovered. (Image credit: CFHT/MegaCam/Principal investigator: Alan W. McConnachie; Image Processing: Marcos Arias)

What is even more curious is the extended period of star formation experienced by Andromeda XXXV. To understand why, it is necessary to travel back in time to the the birth of the first galaxies.

Why isn't Andromeda XXXV a 'deep fried' galaxy?

The earliest epoch of the universe was marked by incredibly hot and dense conditions. This inflationary period, begun by the Big Bang, continued, and the universe dispersed and cooled. This allowed the first atoms of hydrogen to take shape, birthing the first stars, which gathered in the first galaxies.

These stars and galaxies blasted out energy as did the first feeding black holes reheating the cosmos. This signaled the death of very small galaxies, and scientists theorize this heat ""cooked off"" the gas needed for star formation in such collections of stars.

Yet, somehow, Andromeda XXXV survived!

A timeline of the universe showing when the first galaxies formed (Image credit: NASA, ESA, and A. Feild (STScI))

""We thought they were basically all going to be fried because the entire universe turned into a vat of boiling oil,"" Bell said. ""We thought that it would completely lose its gas, but apparently that doesn't happen, because this thing is about 20,000 solar masses and yet it was forming stars just fine for a few extra billion years.""

Just how Andromeda XXXV resisted being fried is still a mystery.



""I don't have an answer,"" Bell said. ""It is also still true that the universe did heat up; we're just learning the consequences are more complicated than we thought.""

NASA and other space agencies are planning missions that could discover further dwarf galaxies around other large galaxies and help solve this mystery. But there's a good chance that the solution will open up new questions just as the discovery of Andromeda XXXV has.

""We still have a lot to discover,"" Arias said. ""There are so many things that we still need to learn — even about what's near to us — in terms of galaxy formation, evolution, and structure before we can reverse engineer the history of the universe and understand how we came to be where we are today.""

The team's research was published March 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

The bottom line 🔎 Nikon 5x15 HG: A tiny monocular that is best used indoors or for casual use where you just want to get a bit closer to the action — not specifically for one task such as bird-watching. ★★★★

This pocketable monocular offers clear and sharp images with 5x magnification — enough to get a little closer to the action, and you certainly won't need to use a tripod. Because of the low magnification, we wouldn't recommend it for a specific purpose like bird-watching or wildlife spotting — it's more of a handy companion to whip out when you need it. That said, its close focus of 24 inches (61 cm) makes it perfect to take to a museum or art gallery to see finer details in artifacts or paintings.

Although this is a fairly expensive model, the performance and quality of the product reflect the price tag. It may not have the highest magnification or rugged all-weather functionality, but we thought the image quality was seriously impressive when we got our hands on it for our Nikon 5x15 HG review. You will be rewarded with sharp, vibrant images even when conditions are difficult — in low light, for example.

The Nikon 5x15 HG weighs just 2.6 oz (75 g) so it can be used comfortably for long periods and forgotten about in a pocket when not in use. We took it to the theatre to watch a show and were seriously impressed by the quality and clarity of the image.

Buy it if ✅ You want something that's easy to use: One-handed operation is possible and simple



✅ You want good value for money: This is a fairly priced product that provides good-quality views

Don't buy it if: ❌ You want the best accessories: We found the neck strap to be on the small side.



❌ You're looking for top-flight performance: As with most products, you'll have to fork out a little more cash if you want the very best.

The bottom line 🔎 Opticron Oregon 4 PC Oasis 10x42: A good all-rounder that copes well in low light. It is pretty rugged and very easy to use, even when wearing gloves. ★★★★

This roof prism design monocular, as we found in our hands-on Opticron Oregon 4 Oasis 10x42 review, is a good all-round performer. It is reasonably priced and is rugged enough to cope in most environments. It is protected with nonslip rubber armor, so it can handle the odd knock and accidental drop, too — something you may find useful if you're sharing with children (or clumsy friends!).

We especially liked how easy it is to use one-handed, even when wearing gloves. It utilizes BaK-4 fully-coated glass that gives excellent clarity and also works well in low-light conditions. We had no trouble getting closer to the details in churches, for example, and encountered no problems when using it at twilight.

It is waterproof and nitrogen-purged, so it can be used in all weathers, and there is no need to wait for the lenses to de-fog when moving between different temperatures.

10x magnification is a comfortable amount for most users to manage wobble-wise, but it's important to note that there is no monopod/tripod mount, so you don't have this option. Instead, you'll have to rely on leaning against something, such as shelves in hides, for long observing sessions.

Buy it if: ✅ You want something to use in all weather conditions: It has an IPX7 waterproof rating and is fogproof.



✅ You might want to use it with a tripod: Thanks to a 1/4-inch thread on the bottom, the option is there.

Don't buy it if: ❌ You're prone to losing accessories: The lens cap and eyecup shield don't have attachments.



❌ You want an instrument for low light: The small 32 mm aperture doesn't lend itself well to low light work — this is a daytime monocular.

The bottom line 🔎 Nocs Field Tube 8x32: Another good all-rounder protected with ribbed, rugged casing. The oversized focus wheel makes one-handed operation easy, although it doesn't perform well once the sun starts to go down. ★★★★

Don't let the brightly colored casing deter you — this is a serious travel-friendly monocular. Though some might not like the plasticky aesthetic, it actually helps to keep the unit lightweight and adds to the hardwearing design of this monocular.

The lenses are multi-coated and scratch-resistant, which is reassuring given that the lens caps are quite easy to lose because they aren't attached.

Due to the relatively small 32 mm objective lens, this isn't a monocular that likes to be used after sunset; for that, you'd want something with a minimum of a 42 mm objective lens.

If you're planning on long bird-watching or wildlife-spotting sessions, you might find the 1/4-inch thread handy, though, for regular casual use, the smaller 8x magnification shouldn't cause any issues with image wobble.

We were impressed with how easy it was to focus during our hands-on Nocs Field Tube 8x32 review, thanks to the oversized focusing wheel. This is easy to operate with gloves on, or if you have cold or wet hands.

No neck strap or protective carry case are provided, but given the rugged build and scratch-proof credentials, we didn't mind too much.

Buy it if: ✅ You want something for daytime and nighttime: You can use this monocular to observe nighttime wildlife activity, but don't expect to take high-quality photos.



✅ You want to use it for occasional star gazing: The focus range and light handling are more than sufficient for this purpose.

Don't buy it if: ❌ You want something that feels high quality: The overall feel and construction of the unit are lacking.



❌ You want excellent image quality: We struggled to obtain usable imagery from the camera.

The bottom line 🔎 Bushnell Equinox X650 Night Vision 5x32: This affordable, entry-level monocular provides an opportunity to experience night vision technology without breaking the bank, but don't expect miracles. ★★★ ½

The Bushnell Equinox X650 Night Vision 5x32 monocular is an entry-level device offering night vision capabilities at an affordable price point. It has a 32 mm objective lens and a built-in infrared (IR) illuminator, providing a night viewing distance of up to 650 feet (198 m). The monocular can capture photo and video content onto a MicroSD card, but we thought the quality of the images was lackluster.

During our hands-on Equinox X650 review, we found that the unit delivered basic functionality suitable for general identification purposes, but image quality was subpar, with daytime photos often appearing blurred and nighttime images lacking clarity, making them unworthwhile. The device also struggled with bright lights at night, causing it to switch between day and night modes unpredictably.

Overall, the Bushnell Equinox X650 is a lightweight and cost-effective introduction to night vision technology, but its performance limitations, particularly regarding image quality, may not satisfy users who want a more premium unit. We thought it delivered a satisfactory performance overall, but it doesn't excel in any particular area.

Buy it if: ✅ Images are everything: Boasting both still and video capture, this is a great monocular for imaging (not all monoculars store photos).



✅ You're a twitcher: This compact unit is great for identifying birds (and other wildlife) from a distance.

Don't buy it if: ❌ You want to use a tripod: The Powershot Zoom has no attachment for one, so this is for handheld use only.



❌ You've got large hands: The buttons are packed tightly together, so you must often reposition the unit to access all of the controls.

The bottom line 🔎 Canon Powershot Zoom Digital Monocular: This is a budget-friendly, entry-level digital monocular that is particularly useful for watching sports, bird-watching and sightseeing. ★★★ ½

The Canon PowerShot Zoom Digital Monocular is a compact, lightweight device that combines monocular functionality with digital imaging.

It offers optical zoom at 100 mm and 400 mm, with a digital enhancement reaching 800 mm. Its compact size and light weight make it highly portable and pocketable, weighing just over 5 oz (145 g) and measuring just over four inches (103 mm) in length. However, be warned — the plastic casing lacks waterproofing, limiting its durability in inclement weather. There are also no covers for either the objective lens or the viewfinder.

It can capture 12.1 MP photos and record videos in full HD, storing content on a MicroSD card. Connectivity options include Bluetooth and wireless pairing with smartphones via Canon's Camera Connect app, facilitating remote viewing and fast image transfer.

In our hands-on Canon PowerShot Zoom Digital Monocular review, we found that image quality diminishes when using the 800 mm digital zoom, and the closely spaced controls may hinder usability, especially if you have larger hands. It does, however, have image stabilization, which is a plus. We found bird-watching to be an incredibly rewarding experience when using the Canon.

We found the face detection and tracking autofocus modes worked well under good lighting, but they'll struggle in low light, so it's best used during the day.

✅ You want bright, high-contrast images: The multi-coated BaK4 glass produces beautifully clear images.

Don't buy it if: ❌ You want an extended focus range: The focus range is quite limited, with only a quarter-turn from close focus to infinity. This makes fine focusing difficult.

The bottom line 🔎 Vortex Solo R/T 8x36 monocular: A capable performer with a lightweight, tough design. Image clarity is good, as are its low-light capabilities. We hope the stiffness of the focus wheel improves over time. ★★★

The Vortex Solo R/T 8x36 Monocular is a compact, durable optical device designed for outdoor enthusiasts. It features a rugged, waterproof rubber armor exterior, so it is suitable for all weather conditions. The 36 mm objective lens, combined with BaK-4 prisms and multi-coated optics, ensures excellent light transmission, delivering clear and bright images even in low-light conditions; we were pleasantly surprised in our Vortex Solo R/T 8x36 monocular review.

With an 8x magnification, the monocular offers a substantial 393-foot field of view at 1,000 yards, facilitating easy tracking of moving subjects. The built-in MRAD-based ranging reticle is particularly beneficial for precise distance estimation, enhancing its utility for activities like target shooting.

We did find that the focus mechanism is notably stiff, requiring users to adjust focus away from the eye, which impedes quick viewing.

Overall, the Vortex Solo R/T 8x36 Monocular is a well-built, versatile tool, offering high-quality optics and practical features for a variety of outdoor applications. We can only hope the focus wheel will loosen over time.

Contributing experts

Matt Morris Matt Morris is a keen astronomer, wildlife watcher and photographer living in Somerset, UK. He started stargazing and bird-watching at the age of 10 with his father, who took him to bird hides and nature reserves around England. This sparked his interest in cameras and optics, a passion that has now spanned the better part of four decades and led to his being featured in several national photography magazines for competition-winning photos. Matt has had deteriorating eyesight in one eye over the last few years due to being Type-1 diabetic. This has led him to develop a special interest in monoculars and spotting scopes as these are now the only means by which Matt's passion for bird-watching and wildlife spotting can continue. His eyesight is in a state of flux as diabetes takes its toll, further emphasizing the importance for him to find and use quality optical equipment — although Matt is happy to point out his right eye is in perfect working order!

Frequently Asked Questions

What do the numbers mean when buying a monocular? The numbers in a monocular are the same as a pair of binoculars. The first number is the magnification strength, and the second number is the diameter of the objective lens. So, a 10x42 monocular will have a magnification of 10x and an objective lens diameter of 42 mm. The higher the magnification, the further the monocular can see, and the wider the objective lens, the more light it lets in.

How do I choose a monocular? We asked our contributing expert Matt Morris, who told us: ""The ideal way to choose a monocular is to decide where and when and how you’ll be using your monocular. Will you use it for bird-watching, sports viewing or astronomy? These will all determine which monocular is best for you."" Once you've determined what you'll be using your monocular for, you can then narrow down your search. For example, bird-watchers will want something lightweight and waterproof, whereas stargazers will need something that is better in low light and fog-proof.

Are monoculars better than binoculars? Monoculars aren't necessarily better than the best binoculars, but they are usually smaller and more lightweight as they are essentially just a single side of a binocular. Some users prefer using binocular vision, others prefer the convenience of a smaller optic. It's a personal preference!

What size monocular is best for bird-watching? We asked our expert Matt Morris, who said: ""Any monocular of a size which enables it to be quickly and conveniently carried and then put to use in the field. Around 8–10x magnification is perfect. Any higher and you may have trouble holding the optic steady.""

What magnification is best for stargazing? Stargazing is a little different from terrestrial viewing and bird-watching. As the stars are further away, you need a higher magnification (and a higher objective lens diameter) in order to get the best view. Monoculars don't tend to have the reach of the best binoculars for stargazing, but you can certainly get a decent view with a monocular. Matt Morris told us: ""Most monoculars have between 8 and 12x magnification due to their compact size. This is easily enough to allow views of nearby stars.""

How much does a monocular cost? There are monoculars as low as $75, but we've found the minimum entry point for a capable optic is around $100.

How far can you see with a monocular? Ultimately it depends on the magnification, but you'll be able to see objects up to 1,000 yards away with an 8x or 10x monocular.

Can I see planets with a monocular? You'll be able to see a brighter view of the planets than you can with the naked eye, but you won't be able to get detailed views — for that, you'll need one of the best telescopes. For your best chance of spotting some planets, go for a higher magnification or use a pair of the best binoculars for stargazing.

Do I need a waterproof monocular? We asked our monocular expert Matt Morris, who said: ""Although it’s not strictly necessary to have a waterproof model, the very nature of the monocular being waterproof means that you can use it in the field and damp misty conditions won’t affect performance. The waterproofing tends to include beefier armor and body protection, further increasing the usability of the optic."" Furthermore, if you're using your monocular for stargazing, it's more important for your optic to be fog-proof rather than waterproof.

How we tested the best monoculars

Image 1 of 3 Our reviewers test the monoculars in a range of environments and lighting conditions. (Image credit: Matt Morris) They are tested in different temperatures (Image credit: Jamie Carter) And with and without wearing spectacles (Image credit: Matt Morris)

To ensure that each monocular gets a proper hands-on review, they are taken out and used as they would be in ""real life"". They are taken to different environments, such as bird hides and on nature walks in various weather conditions, and also tested indoors — for example, for getting a closer look at artifacts in museums and churches.

They are tried with and without spectacles and used for extensive observing sessions to test their comfort with prolonged use. We also examine the quality of any accessories, such as shoulder straps, lens caps and belt pouches.

We then score each monocular on its design, performance and functionality, ultimately giving them an overall rating of five stars.",livescience
https://livescience.com,Great potoo: The 'tree stump' bird with a haunting growl and can see with its eyes closed,https://www.livescience.com/animals/birds/great-potoo-the-tree-stump-bird-with-a-haunting-growl-and-can-see-with-its-eyes-closed,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","Great potoos have giant eyes that protrude from the sides of their heads, providing excellent vision in low-light conditions.

Name: Great potoo (Nyctibius grandis)

Where it lives: Central and South America

What it eats: Large insects, bats and small birds

Why it's awesome: The great potoo is a master of disguise. Its mottled gray-brown feathers and ability to remain perfectly still often cause it to be mistaken for a tree branch or stump, helping it evade detection by predators.

Native to the forests and tropical lowlands of Central and South America, this nocturnal bird can grow to 24 inches (60 centimeters) tall and has a wingspan of more than 28 inches (70 cm). Its grey, brown and white plumage helps it blend seamlessly with the bark of the trees it lands on, making it nearly undetectable by other animals.

By day, great potoos remain silent and still in the trees. But at night, they become active hunters. Their large, owl-like eyes, which protrude from the sides of their heads, provide excellent vision in low-light conditions. Equipped with a large, flattened beak and mouth, these birds are well-adapted to snatching prey such as flying insects and bats out of the air.

Great potoos also have slits in their eyelids, which enable them to see when their eyes are closed. These ""notches"" help the birds to sense light and movement through their shut eyelids, so they can detect predators and prey even when resting.

Great potoos are also unusual thanks to their distinctive calls. Throughout the night, they emit a loud, moaning growl. This ghostly call has earned the bird a mythical status in local folklore , with some communities in South America believing the sounds to be children calling for lost parents. These calls are used for communication and to defend their territories.

Potoos are monogamous birds, forming lifelong pairs that share the responsibilities of incubation and care for their young. Female great potoos lay a single egg in a natural depression on a tree branch, so they rely on their camouflage and sight to protect themselves and their offspring.

The incubation period for great potoo eggs is approximately 30 days, with both parents sharing the responsibility of incubating the egg. Due to their elusive nature, not much is known about their lifespan – but they are believed to live for around 12 to 14 years, like other bird species.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,"In the failure of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, children are already the greatest victims",https://theconversation.com/no-fracasso-do-cessar-fogo-entre-israel-e-hamas-criancas-ja-sao-as-maiores-vitimas-252874,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:31:45 GMT","After a few weeks of ceasefire in Gaza, Israel resumed the violent offensive, reaching hundreds of civilians again. On the first day of resumption of air attacks, more than 400 people died. Among them, at least 174 were children. According to Defense for Children International, it was one of the days with the highest child mortality rates in the history of Gaza. The offensives continued to terrestrial attacks on the following days, which have so far left more than 500 Palestinians killed, more than half of the victims women and children. A few weeks earlier, in late February, the bodies of two Israeli children, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, were returned to Israel, along with their mother's body, Shiri Bibas, and their deaths were confirmed. The three were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. At the time, Ariel was four years old and Kfir, nine months.

Reflection

Now, before following this article, I suggest that you stop a little and think of some child you know. Children, nephews, godchildren, children of friends, a child you saw pass on the street today. Just think of a child who is somehow part of your life. When we are in direct contact with a child, we can easily access the conception that children should be protected. They should have access to affectionate and responsible caregivers, housing, health, education. It is easy to conceive of the idea that every child, as well as those we know in our daily lives, should be entitled to play and experience the world, without the risk of being raped, without fear of dying or having their assassinated caregivers, family and friends.

I proposed this reflection because, for some reason, the level of understanding and empathy we have with our children is often not so simple to access when we talk about children from another social or cultural group. Children victims of climbing violence in Gaza and Israel are as child as the ones you know, value and protect. From this perspective, I put the question here - how is there any attempt to justify what is happening in the Middle East?

Total Vulnerability

In situations of violent conflict, children are particularly vulnerable and exposed to risks, including direct violence, murder, separation or loss of caregivers and family members, expulsion from their homes, malnutrition, diseases, psychological and sexual violence, among many others. Although there are laws related to International Humanitarian Law and the Convention on the Law of Children who provide for the protection of children and adolescents in these contexts, the risks and violence faced by them has been increasingly worse. According to UNICEF, 2024 marked one of the worst years in the history of the organization for children in conflict zones. The report points to Palestine as one of the locations in which this violence intensified over the past year. In March of the same year, the United Nations stated that more children have died in Gaza since 2023 than in conflicts around the world in the previous four years.

Since the beginning of Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip following October 7, 2023, it is estimated that around 18,000 Palestinian children have been murdered. The probability of this number is higher is quite high, as due to the countless collapse and the lack of search capacity, many bodies of victims are still missing, buried in rubble. Violence against children in Gaza goes beyond the scary amount of children's deaths.

Exodos

Over the past 17 months, thousands of children have necessarily displaced from their homes, living in precarious and dangerous conditions. The fact of moving multiple times, still generates the feeling that there is no safe place to take refuge. Winter in Gaza are quite intense, which has left all its inhabitants, especially children, vulnerable and exposed to cold. Under military offensive, bombing and travel, children are without access to education or basic health conditions.

This is the case of Mays, 14 years old. His family moved out of his house fleeing the heavy bombing, keeping in mind that leaving they could find a safer place, and began to live in a shelter. But it was in this shelter that Mays lost his two sisters, hit in a bombing. Last year she reported to UNICEF that the laughter of the sisters is the last thing that remembers that night. Mays also had leg injuries, which had to have implanted pins, and had partial paralysis on his face. Her mother said that every time she is in a closed place, she has panic seizures and needs to be taken out immediately. Mays also told UNICEF about the lack of water: ""Sometimes the truck comes, and each one gets a small amount to drink. Otherwise we have to drink the water we use to wash.""

Psychological violence is another very impactful factor in the lives of children and adolescents in Gaza. Fear, mourning, trauma are present daily, affecting mental and physical health from early childhood. According to a report published by War Child in December 2024, 49% of children expressed a desire to die and 96% feel that death is imminent.

Sama Tubail, 8, no longer has a hair on her head. Doctors diagnosed Sama's hair loss as a result of a nervous shock, intensified after the bombing of his neighbor's house in Rafah and the disruption of his entire routine since the military attacks began. During an interview with CNN, Sama stated that she is sad because she wants to comb her hair again. Turning to her mother, Om-Mohammed, she said ""Mom, I'm tired, I want to die. Why does my hair not grow? I want to die and have my hair back in paradise, God willing.""

Children also live the risks related to the lack of structure and basic goods. With blocked borders and lack of sufficient humanitarian aid, the continuous increase in hunger and malnutrition has consecutively increasing the number of malnourished children, generating many deaths from a result. In January 2025, the UN estimated that more than 60,000 children would need treatment for malnutrition in Gaza.

Without available hospitals and medical equipment, diseases have represented another major factor of violence. Thousands of children hit in military attacks or affected by a disease cannot access a health center and even when they can, the place often does not have the necessary structure to treat them. The collapse of the health system, the constant mass displacements and the lack of basic structures also generate the spread of diseases such as the polio outbreak that occurred in 2024.

Landing statistics

To these huge violence and insecurities, the loss of mothers, fathers and family members is added. In February 2024, over a year ago, UNICEF estimated that about 17,000 children in Gaza were unaccompanied or separated from their caregivers.

On the Israeli side there were many losses as well. Children were violently murdered during the October 7 attacks. This was the case of Liel and Yannai Hetzroni, twin brothers, who were only 12 years old and were killed in the Kibutz Beeri. Also twins Shahar and Arbel Siman Tov were murdered at Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his 2 -year -old brother Omer and his parents, Tamar and Yonatan. Mila Cohen, just 9 months old, was murdered with a shot in her mother, Sandra, also at Kibibutz Beeri.

To these sad stories were added the children Bibas, Ariel and Kfir, who were kidnapped and taken to Gaza Living on October 7, 2023, along with his mother, Shiri. For over a year, the whereabouts of the three was uncertain, and the demand for their return mobilized Israeli society and thousands of people around the world. A few weeks ago, the death of children and mother was confirmed after Hamas sends their bodies as part of the ceasefire agreement involving the return of hostages and the return of the victims' bodies. The confirmation of the death of Shiri and children paralyzed Israel.

In addition to these terrible cases, many other Israeli children have lost their fathers, mothers, siblings, sisters and friends since October 7, 2023. Many have survived, including Hamas captivity, but have to deal with the trauma of living the attacks.

The situations of Palestinian and Israeli children are clearly different. Bringing cases on both sides do not have the connotation of comparing or normalizing what is happening in Gaza, the severity of context and the depth of human rights violation. The intention is exactly, emphasizing the lack of purpose of the perpetration of the cycle of violence. This cycle has been going on for many decades, and has been producing nothing more than generation after generating traumatized, bereaved and growing fear on the other side. As children and babies on all sides are deliberately murdered, the speech that perpetration and intensification of the use of violence serves to protect someone completely loses the purpose. Who is being protected?

To violate children, in addition to representing a deep attack on human rights, is also to perpetuate the cycle of violence. The surviving children become adults who carry all marks of losses. How to cultivate a possibility of a possible future peace agreement between people who live these violent contexts, lose so much and are so traumatized?

What was already proven and has been even clearer in the last 17 months is that there is no safe space for anyone in this alleged conflict. The policy of persisting in violence and further intensifying military onslaughts only have the possibility of generating more losses and more insecurities, for all involved in this conflict. Everything we have been following in the last year and a half, including breaking the ceasefire, is not just undermining a possibility of decreasing violence in the present, but is generating a whole generation of people deeply traumatized and undermining any possibility of future resolution.",theconversation
