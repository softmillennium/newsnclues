Prepare yourselves, My Hero Academia watchers: the final season will kick off sometime in October.

During this weekend’s AnimeJapan in Tokyo, Toho released a small teaser announcing the release month for season eight. In it, the series’ respective main hero and villain, Deku and Tomura Shigaraki, have split narration on their goals and whose story this has been all along. Deku and the rest of Japan’s hero community have been at war against Shigaraki, All for One, and the other villains under their command, and last season ended with big shakeups on both sides, with several key players in the war either dead or out of commission.

The My Hero Academia manga ended in 2024 after 430 chapters and an epilogue that December. Creator Kohei Horikoshi hasn’t said anything about his next project since putting a bow on the superhero series, but he has drawn plenty of great art for its characters in the past year.

Before the main anime ends, fans can get their fix in the upcoming spinoff, Vigilantes. That show, set five years before Deku’s story, focuses on non-licensed heroes saving their city and crossing paths with young versions of supporting characters like Mirko and Eraserhead. It’s set to premiere April 7, so you definitely won’t be short on My Hero material throughout 2025.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Looking for free channels to live stream the F1 Chinese Grand Prix? After Lando Norris edged out Max Verstappen at the Australian GP, everyone’s eager to see if he can repeat the result. Both channels are 100% free and don’t even require an account to work. You can learn more about watching all F1 races for free here. ServusTV and SRF are licensed to broadcast within their respective countries. This means being outside Austria or Switzerland will produce an error message. Here’s what happens when you try to watch Servus TV: ServusTV and SRF have an IP-detection system, which enforces the geo-restriction. If the IP address is outside Austria or Switzerland, ServusTV and SRF will be unavailable respectively. The goal is to, therefore, claim an IP address from one of these countries and watch the F1 Chinese GP on a free channel. This VPN has hundreds of servers in Austria and Switzerland. Ths allows for cathing up with the free live stream of the F1 Chinese Grand Prix on phones and tablets, for example. Whether you’re looking to stream just the main event or those that come before, you must be acquainted with the schedule. All times are GMT+8, so make sure you “adapt” them to your local time zone. You can also refer to the official F1 website for exact times based on your location. If the free TV channels we mentioned aren’t your bag of beans, you can always opt for a premium streaming service. In a recent post, we explained how to watch Sky Sports in the US and the way a VPN helps. We must warn you that streaming services usually don’t have a money-back guarantee, so there’s no refund option. Such services are also region-locked, which, as stated, begs for the use of a VPN. With the method we explained, you can join thousands of racing fans globally and enjoy bombastic Grand Prix races from all over the world.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The station, whose construction started earlier this year, will have 1,600 cubic feet of habitable space. He has an estimated $3.2 billion fortune — primarily from XRP sales — and is completely prepared to lose an eye-popping $1 billion if Vast Space fails to secure the NASA contract. NASA is scheduled to retire the International Space Station (ISS) in 2030 after approximately 30 years of research. The agency is partnering with private firms to launch its replacement. Musk recently rescued NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore who had been stranded at the space station for nine months. “It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” McCaleb told Bloomberg.

The university’s website fell victim to an apparent hack on Saturday morning, which resulted in the homepage being defaced for several hours and used to display racial slurs and graphs that purported to show test scores of students broken down by race. That message was followed by a graph purporting to show the average SAT scores, ACT scores, and grade point average of NYU applicants who were admitted into the university, broken down by race. The apparent claim being put forth by the hacker and their racist edgelord persona is that NYU is admitting college students based in some way on race. The theory being that some students would not be admitted if they were being judged based solely on their test scores and GPA. That has been picked up by the worst accounts you know on X, who have run with the data to suggest NYU has been giving preference to students based on race. Of course, the data doesn’t prove that at all. NYU is a test-optional school, so the people who submit test results in the first place are self-selecting—they’re going to submit a score if they think it might help them. (That’s kinda the whole idea with diversity, equity, and inclusion programs that people like this hacker seem so offended by—there are extremely capable people from all backgrounds who often simply do not have the same opportunities as others and end up overlooked.) Anyway, NYU posts its own data on incoming classes, and it indicated that it saw a decline in historically underrepresented minority groups for the class of 2028 following the Supreme Court’s decision to end affirmative action within college admissions. They’re mostly just racists who want to punish universities, possibly galvanized by the Trump administration’s own crackdown on higher education institutions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Matt Owens, co-showrunner and executive producer for seasons one and two of Netflix’s One Piece, has revealed he’s stepping away from the show. On Instagram, Owens explained “the last six years working on the live-action One Piece have been a life-changing journey, and a dream come true. As Deadline notes, One Piece‘s first season was co-showrun by Steven Maeda and Owens. While Maeda remains an executive producer, he departed his showrunning post after season one. Tracz is remaining with the series and will guide season two’s post-production. The trade notes that One Piece “wrapped production on season two last month.” Owens’ exit will reportedly not affect the show’s chances of being renewed for a third season, and he’s co-written at least one episode for season two. And his influence will seemingly still be felt moving forward; during his time on One Piece, he helped shape “the creative vision” for the series, Deadline writes, “including its long-term blueprint for future seasons.” Earlier in March, One Piece’s first season won two Emmys for stunt coordination and best song in a kids/YA program (“My Sails Are Set”).

Apple is preparing to debut its next-generation chipsets, the A19 and A19 Pro, with the upcoming iPhone 17 lineup. It is almost confirmed that both A19 and A19 Pro chips will be manufactured using TSMC’s third-generation 3nm process N3P. Now, a fresh leak reveals Apple’s plan for the 2026 iPhone models’ chip — A20 and A20 Pro. If the leak is true, both chips could be manufactured using TSMC’s third-generation 2nm process. The launch of the iPhone 18 lineup is still a year and a half away, but we are already getting leaks. Recently, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed (via MacRumors) that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC’s 2nm process. During trial production, TSMC’s 2nm chips have achieved yield rates above the 60-70% range, meaning the chip is now ready for mass production. Multiple analysts, including Jeff Pu, have already confirmed that TSMC will indeed manufacture A20 chips using its 3nm process. This is actually good news, as the 2nm chipset era for smartphones is finally about to begin. Speaking of older chipsets, the A17 Pro chip was manufactured using TSMC’s first-generation 3nm process (N3B), while the A18 and A18 Pro chips were built on TSMC’s second-generation 3nm process (N3E).</p></b><br/><br/></div>

is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Cloudflare, one of the biggest network internet infrastructure companies in the world, has announced AI Labyrinth, a new tool to fight web-crawling bots that scrape sites for AI training data without permission. The company says in a blog post that when it detects “inappropriate bot behavior,” the free, opt-in tool lures crawlers down a path of links to AI-generated decoy pages that “slow down, confuse, and waste the resources” of those acting in bad faith. Websites have long used the honor system approach of robots.txt, a text file that gives or denies permission to scrapers, but which AI companies, even well-known ones like Anthropic and Perplexity AI, have been accused of ignoring. Cloudflare writes that it sees over 50 billion web crawler requests per day, and although it has tools for spotting and blocking the malicious ones, this often prompts attackers to switch tactics in “a never-ending arms race.” Cloudflare says rather than block bots, AI Labyrinth fights back by making them process data that has nothing to do with a given website’s actual data. The company says it also functions as “a next-generation honeypot,” drawing in AI crawlers that keep following links to fake pages deeper, whereas a regular human being wouldn’t. We found that generating a diverse set of topics first, then creating content for each topic, produced more varied and convincing results. As Ars Technica notes, AI Labyrinth sounds similar to Nepenthes, a tool that’s designed to sideline crawlers for “months” in a hell of AI-generated junk data.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Meanwhile, VideoCardz has allegedly received and published the final specifications of Nvidia's first mainstream Blackwell-based GPUs today. Keep in mind that the information does not come from official sources, so take it with a grain of salt. Nvidia's upcoming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, purportedly expected around mid-April, may include two versions: 8GB and 16GB of GDDR7 memory—both potentially featuring the GB206-300 graphics processor with 4,608 CUDA cores and a 128-bit memory interface. The boards will be rated to 180W total board power. The increase in the number of CUDA cores, GPU clock, Blackwell microarchitecture optimizations, and software refinements almost guarantee a tangible increase in GeForce RTX 5060 Ti performance compared to its direct predecessor, the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/aint-no-god-like-god-of-war-2000577804'>Ain’t No God Like God of War</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 18:05:39 <p>
Look no further than the original God of War, which just turned 20 years old. Sony Santa Monica’s hack-and-slash title was pretty impressive back in the day, helped by an alluring demo that dropped players into the action right away and showed them what it was all about: slinging blades, killing everything in sight, and finishing off mythological creatures in increasingly gruesome ways. By that point in the PS2’s lifetime, the console’s big action game was Devil May Cry, and while there was some overlap in terms of style and ridiculousness, Kratos’ adventure appealed to a different (but maybe equally juvenile) audience. So players fell in love with God of War, and thus a franchise was born. (And if that didn’t tip you off, the failed go at a movie adaptation would’ve done it.) By the time 2013’s Ascension rolled around, Kratos didn’t seem to have any more gas in the tank, despite III’s ending indicating he could (and would) come back to kill again. Given everything Kratos did and killed during those earlier games—God of War III is basically a disaster epic brought on by a slasher villain—it couldn’t help be a strange ask to buy into him not just having another kid, but wanting better for the young Atreus during their trek through Midgard to scatter his late wife’s ashes. The series has always painted Kratos as a force of nature whose presence inevitably devastates everything around him. From fights against titans and dragons, to one-on-one brawls against gods that play out like the love child of shonen fights and wrestling matches, the series is packed with one moment after another that makes experiencing them a complete blast. Other action games have tried to match that scale or combat of Kratos’ adventures, and generally do a good job at it—Bayonetta, Darksiders, and Dante’s Inferno all came out just months before God of War III—but as with anything that’s been around long enough, Sony Santa Monica’s formula hits a particular sweet spot that’s allowed the franchise to survive more console generations than its other PS2 peers. The prospect of Kratos fighting every mythology in sight has been desired for a long time, so it’s easy to imagine Sony Santa Monica just doing that, not entirely unlike Assassin’s Creed or Call of Duty. That appears to be the case, according to a former developer’s 2024 LinkedIn post, so here’s hoping that’s also successful in its own way—and when it comes time for Kratos to return, it feels as big a deal it did when the reboot was first revealed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Since the 16-pin connector was introduced and later revised, melting adapters and PSU/GPU-side connectors on some of Nvidia's mainstream GeForce gaming GPUs have been rampant. Unless you get a 12V-2x6 to 8-pin adapter, these PSUs are incompatible with most modern-day GPUs from AMD, Intel, and even Nvidia (RTX 30 and prior), apart from a few specific variants. This time, it is believed Nvidia's power delivery design might be partially responsible. Theoretically, a 225W TGP GPU or lower, like the Intel Arc B580, can easily be powered by one 8-pin connector. However, AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series cannot, as these GPUs typically require two or three 8-pin connectors. To be clear, this isn't the first time we've seen such an implementation. Galax's GH1300 also shipped with a dual 16-pin design, but that PSU was a one-off and unleashed to tame the RTX 4090 HOF that could quickly chug up 1kW of power. This raises concerns about the MPG A1000GS, which is borderline on recommended specs yet ships with two 12V-2x6 connectors. All things considered, equipping PSUs with multiple 16-pin connectors is counterintuitive for most consumers, especially given the standard's original goal to simplify cabling. For maximum user flexibility, a PSU design should include one 12V-2x6 connector alongside multiple 8-pin connectors to accommodate high-power GPUs from either brand.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

That’s exactly what Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb is doing, according to a report by Bloomberg. While crypto investors say they’re “going to the moon” when Bitcoin surges, McCaleb, a longtime industry pioneer, is aiming for the real thing. “It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” McCaleb told Bloomberg. McCaleb’s $1 billion bet, entirely self-funded, is that Vast Space—the California-based aerospace company he founded in 2021—can build and launch a functioning station. “This is a big, bold vision by Jed McCaleb,” Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen wrote on X. “America used to pursue new frontiers like this before skidding into bureaucracy and doubt. Many of its employees bring aerospace experience, including refugees from Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The concept of artificial gravity stations has long been a staple in science fiction, ranging from Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 sci-fi classic film "2001: A Space Odyssey" to Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film "Interstellar." The Haven-1 primary structure qualification article has arrived at our Mojave, CA test site. While Haven-1 is a single module designed to operate independently or dock with SpaceX boosters, the next-generation Haven-2 is being developed as a modular system. Several Haven-2 units could be connected to form a larger, expandable station. McCaleb is among a growing number of private citizens stepping up to meet that need, including Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos. Dragon missions create opportunities for humanity to build a future in space. A successful launch in May will strengthen Vast’s place in the emerging private space race, and securing a NASA contract would be essential for the company’s long-term viability.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Since this weekend is AnimeJapan, the streamer pulled back the curtain on what it’s offering for spring and summer, which includes some returning favorites and fresh new works. Studio Mir’s adaptation of the hit Capcom franchise premieres in a few weeks, and Netflix revealed more information about its voice cast. Additionally, rock band Evanescence is working on a song for the series, so you can expect to hear them when the show premieres on April 3. Sakamoto Days started airing in January, and its first half just ended today! Its second half will begin in July, and will introduce Gaku, a key member of X’s organization voiced by Koki Uchiyama in the Japanese dub. SAKAMOTO DAYS SEASON 1 PART 2, THIS JULY 👓 Slide back into the action with Koki Uchiyama joining the cast as Gaku!#AnimeJapan2025 #AJ2025 #NetflixAnime pic.twitter.com/sIGupeqlEa — Netflix Anime (@NetflixAnime) March 22, 2025 This one’s started getting a push by Netflix in recent weeks ahead of its release on April 10. Developed by WIT Studio (Spy x Family) with designs by Fullmetal Alchemist’s Hiromu Arakawa and written by Tow Ubukata (Fafner in the Azure), Moonrise is set in a near-future where an AI called Sapienta has created a program that sends Earth’s criminals to the Moon, which has since become a warzone and home to a rebel army. Based on Mokumokuren’s horror manga of the same name, the anime focuses on high schooler Yoshiki, who feels there’s something…off about his friend Hikaru.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Chinese technology giant’s latest offering, launched on Friday, leverages large-scale reinforcement learning, a technique also employed by DeepSeek in its R1 reasoning model, which launched in January. The release is an official version of the model after a beta run of T1-preview on its chatbot Yuanbao. It scored 87.2 points on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Pro benchmark, a test that gauges a model’s knowledge. T1 has achieved high scores in other benchmarks as well, including 78.2 in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2024, slightly behind R1’s 79.8 and o1’s 79.2. In terms of Chinese language capabilities, T1 excelled with 91.8 points in the C-Eval suite evaluation, the same score as R1 and better than o1’s 87.8, according to Tencent. It also rivals DeepSeek on pricing, which has been a primary advantage for the popular Chinese start-up. The input rate is in line with R1, which charges 1 yuan per million tokens during daytime hours, and just 0.25 yuan overnight. The output pricing is also comparable, given R1’s daytime rate of 16 yuan per million tokens, which drops to 4 yuan overnight. Tencent claimed to be the first in the industry to adopt a hybrid architecture combining Google’s Transformer and Mamba, developed by Carnegie Mellon University and Princeton University. Compared with pure Transformer architecture, the hybrid approach “significantly reduces training and inference costs” by cutting memory usage, according to the Chinese tech giant.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nvidia's newly announced RTX Pro Blackwell GPU listings have gone live at Connections, a US-based IT retailer targeting enterprise customers. The retailer's website also lists a wide array of unannounced Blackwell GPUs, like the RTX Pro 2000 and RTX Pro 4000 SFF Blackwell, along with their expected prices. Note that these are premature listings that could very well deviate from shelf prices, so we shouldn't read too much into them. The RTX Pro Blackwell family is the workstation counterpart to Nvidia's Blackwell lineup of GPUs, with a new "Pro" modifier to further distinguish these products from other offerings. With the help of 24Gb (3GB) GDDR7 modules, Nvidia has managed a 50% increase in VRAM capacity across the same bus width compared to standard GeForce RTX 50 desktop GPUs. The premier RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell has been listed starting at $8,565 ($8,435 in bulk) for a 26% increase over last generation's RTX 6000 Ada.

While the RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell, with its compact dimensions and single-slot form factor, more or less qualifies as an SFF (Small Factor Factor) GPU, Nvidia hasn't explicitly added an "SFF" modifier in its name. We found two listings of this GPU in SFF and non-SFF flavors at $1,546, roughly on par with the handful of RTX 4000 Ada listings we found online. Like its Ada Lovelace counterpart, it might be scheduled for launch at a later date.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/games/634125/assassins-creed-shadows-photo-mode-infinity-nikki'>Photo Mode is my new gaming obsession</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 15:00:00 <p>
With open-world dress-up game Infinity Nikki, I continue to be agog at how clothing textures are rendered with such detail and fidelity that by mere sight, I know exactly what a piece of fabric will feel like. For Assassin’s Creed Shadows, an action-packed romp through feudal Japan, I’m constantly in a state of awe at the natural beauty of the Japanese countryside, a feature that has been widely celebrated since its release. Both games are so visually arresting they made me fall in love with a video game staple that I’ve never really cared about before: photo mode. Photo mode, which typically pauses the game to give players the ability to take professional grade images of their video games, is a modern gaming feature that’s been around long enough to become a standard inclusion, especially in AAA games. It’s a video game, not some fleeting life moment. I’m not gonna fondly flip through my PS5 media gallery in five years going, “Aww look at the time Yasuke chopped the arms and head off that guy,” like I’m looking at my grandkids’ baby photos. I definitely appreciate the skill with which others have made the most out of photo modes — like what my friend does with Overwatch — but it was always something I ignored. I’ve played no shortage of games so interesting their moments demand to be captured and shared but that compulsion is on another level with Infinity Nikki and Assassin’s Creed. I took that success with Infinity Nikki and translated it to Assassin’s Creed. Without it, I am forced to take in the game’s impressive weather and foliage as I drive ole’ Kikai around rather than looking at my phone after setting him on auto-pilot. The codex could stand a few more flora and fauna entries, Ubisoft.) The urge was strong enough that it completely changed my feelings about photo mode altogether. I saw that entirely fake scenery made of pixels and code and immediately opened up photo mode as though I was capturing real natural phenomena. I wanted it to look like a shot Akira Kurosawa could have composed for one of his samurai epics — a kind of thought I’ve never had while taking pictures in real life or in games. This moment completely changed my perspective on video game photography. Putting the photo modes in Nikki and Shadows through their paces, I’ve discovered game photography is now something I can really, earnestly do, and want to do more of.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

My new favorite external battery is the one with *two* hideaway cables.

I bought my wife the $110 Anker A1695 “InstaCord” and experienced instant jealousy; and not just because of its retractable cord. It’s the second cable that blew my mind, hidden inside its strong carry handle, plus the fact both are bidirectional. Either can charge the battery, either can charge my laptop; I get passthrough power if I use both!

The lawsuit, filed by Tim Hanson, seeks just under $8,000 in damages which covers compensation for veterinarian bills and legal fees, according to KTVB 7 in Oregon. Hanson adopted his cat Kira in 2021 and told the news outlet he typically feeds his cats raw food like the chicken that killed his cat because “I believe in the health benefits of it.” It’s not entirely clear what health benefits Hanson believes can come from raw chicken. Wild Coast, which is based in Washington, issued a recall on March 1 for its 16 oz and 24 oz frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats. People who fed pets the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu in their pets, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness. People with pets exhibiting these signs after feeding this product should contact their veterinarian. The spread of bird flu has been devastating for many cat owners, as they seem to be the most susceptible among domestic animals outside birds to H5N1. Many cats from New York to Oregon have been documented to have died from the disease and there are likely many more deaths that are going undetected. U.S. health agencies have tested both milk and beef and it appears both are safe for human consumption even with the presence of bird flu as long as the milk is pasteurized and the beef is cooked to at least medium. There’s also no evidence of human-to-human spread of the bird flu in the U.S. but there is concern a mutation could allow that to happen. There have been 70 cases of H5N1 documented in Americans with one death.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Information on Zach Cregger’s Resident Evil reboot has been slowly trickling out in recent months, and now we may have our first casting.

Per the Hollywood Reporter, actor Austin Abrams is looking like a potential frontrunner for the upcoming film. Last seen in 2024’s Wolfs and Penelope, Abrams has already worked with Cregger on Weapons, which is due out in August. At the moment, it’s unclear who Abrams is playing, but given his youthful look, might he be Leon S. Kennedy, one of the series’ main characters? Leon’s popped up in the previous live-action films—played by Johann Urb in Resident Evil: Retribution, and Avan Jogia in Welcome to Raccoon City—but as a supporting player to others like Alice or the Redfields.

Sources speaking to THR claim Cregger’s take will feature elements of a “wilderness survival thriller,” while still being very much a horror film. The main selling point of this new Resident Evil movie is that it will hew closer to the original games, so whatever that entails, Abrams and whoever he plays will be at the center of it. We’ll find out more about Resident Evil and its cast ahead of its release on September 18, 2026.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The newspaper article’s main focus is Johnson’s use of confidentiality agreements which, the Times writes, have been leveraged against employees and social contacts alike: His employees, sexual partners, vendors and contract workers have all had to sign the documents, sometimes in exchange for settlements, severance or continued employment at his firms, according to people close to him and his start-ups, internal documents and court records. The newspaper writes that three former employees have recently filed National Labor Relations Board complaints about Johnson’s confidentiality agreements, accusing the entrepreneur of forcing them to sign agreements that were “overbroad” and, in so doing, breaking federal laws that allow workers to publicly discuss workplace conditions. While probing Johnson’s company, however, the Times was also able to get its hands on information concerning an internal study conducted by Blueprint. Blood tests revealed that participants saw their testosterone levels drop and became prediabetic after following Mr. Johnson’s diet plan. “Longevity mix: A lot of comments about hating this as it is making them sick, vomit, have heartburn, etc.,” one Blueprint employee wrote to a colleague in February 2024. Allulose, an ingredient in the longevity mix and a sugar alternative that Mr. Johnson has pitched to his social media followers, also caused issues. “TONS of people saying it’s causing nausea, bloating,” wrote an employee. “What was meant to be a takedown ended up reading like a profile piece,” he went on, claiming that the paper “came up empty” and that it was only by “contorting and twisting facts to fit a narrative that they barely had enough to publish.” Gizmodo reached out to Blueprint for comment, though the company says its typical response time is 1-2 business days.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Amazon has flagged Microsoft's Surface Laptop 7 as a "frequently returned item," cautioning potential buyers to check customer reviews before purchasing, Windows Central reports. While Arm chips offer better power efficiency and battery life, they can introduce software compatibility issues. Although Microsoft has improved emulation with Windows on Arm, specific older applications, professional software, and games may still suffer from reduced performance or fail to run altogether. This limitation has been a common criticism of Windows devices powered by Arm chips. Also, it bears mentioning that Snapdragon's primary selling point was originally centered around far superior battery life over x86 alternatives. Newer x86 laptops from Intel, like Lunar Lake, have dramatically improved battery life compared to prior-gen models, reducing or eliminating Snapdragon's battery life advantage while preserving full compatibility with Windows software. While some users report a positive experience, complaints about software compatibility, performance inconsistencies, and general usability appear to be recurring issues. These concerns may explain why the device has received the "frequently returned" warning, as buyers who expect a seamless Windows experience may be disappointed. Similar options will likely be made available for consumer models, though no official timeline has been announced. Switching to Intel chips would remove software compatibility challenges while providing solid battery life and performance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While most of the event is about networking and interesting talks about game design and technology, there were also a bunch of unreleased indie games that we got to check out. Yes, much of video games in 2025 will probably be defined by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Grand Theft Auto VI. But based on the games we played, there might be some really fun smaller titles that could be huge hits this year, too. Here are a few of our favorites that we’re looking forward to. The game’s graphics have a dreamy, deconstructed quality to them, and when you shoot things, the colorful, unfocused scenes you see will solidify into things like buildings and people. (I even lobbed a couple grenades to try and destroy it.) In Faraway, you play as a shooting star and try to make constellations. The game requires just pressing and holding one button to spin around other stars, create a trail, and essentially play a celestial game of connect the dots. You play as Zoe, a girl who runs forward at blinding speed through procedurally generated levels. The game has a roguelike structure, so you’ll get to pick and choose different types of levels to tackle as you make your way through a run. In my demo, the character starts in a dark city before quickly coming upon three adorable beasts that reminded me of a big goat mixed with Sesame Street’s Mr. Snuffleupagus. You coax the animals forward from behind with a magic stick, and while they generally follow your directions, they are sometimes difficult to direct. More than once, my herd of three walked right into a wall. There’s a neat feature where you can fight alongside a ghost image of your previous run, which seems like it will come in handy. Slapstick comedy games are really coming into their own of late. The name really says it all: you control an unseemly long and stretchy arm and attempt to... do things, most of which are illegal. The level I played took place on a moving train, and you were tasked with stealing items from passengers while remaining undetected (probably because of how terrifying the arm is). The game is from Katamari series creator Keita Takahashi, so, of course, it’s wacky and silly. My demo featured an elaborate tooth-brushing sequence, musical numbers, and a talking giraffe.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have created a "breakthrough" solid-state deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser emitting coherent 193-nm light used for semiconductor photolithography in a lab, reports the International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE). If the light source technology can be scaled, this device could be used to build lithography tools that make chips using advanced process technologies. Before we discuss how the CAS method works, let's recap the de facto industry-standard method of creating light with a 193-nm wavelength used by ASML, Canon, and Nikon for their DUV litho machines. Also, keep in mind that the CAS system is in its early stages of development, and we are talking about a test vehicle at best. DUV lithography machines by ASML, Canon, and Nikon generate 193-nm light using an argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser. When high-voltage electrical pulses are applied, the argon and fluorine atoms become excited and briefly form an unstable molecule called ArF (or excimer), which quickly returns to its ground state, releasing a photon with a wavelength of 193 nm. The laser emits these photons as short, high-energy pulses at an output power of up to 100W—120W and at frequencies between 8 kHz and 9 kHz for modern immersion DUV tools. Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. CAS says that the test system has a linewidth narrower than 880 MHz, a performance comparable in spectral purity to that of commercial systems used today. The test system's output is orders of magnitude lower than ASML's ArF excimer-based production systems, which deliver 100 – 120W at a 9 kHz frequency. While the initial CAS system demonstrates capabilities, its low power output makes it unsuitable for commercial semiconductor manufacturing, where high throughput and process stability are essential. It's likely that multiple generations of development would be needed to make this a viable chipmaking light source.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/national-park-summer-bookings-down-amid-doge-fueled-turmoil-2000579301'>National Park Summer Bookings Down Amid DOGE-Fueled Turmoil</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 13:00:52 <p>
After recent years of overcrowding, this summer might be a good time to visit your favorite national park, and you can thank Elon Musk and Big Balls for that. Tourist reservations at key hot spots around the United States have reportedly fallen off amid turmoil in the National Park Service, which was recently hit by DOGE-fueled layoffs of more than 1,000 staff. The cuts have been temporarily rolled back following legal challenges, but uncertainty remains. One hotelier near Yosemite told the website that his three resorts are down 1,000 bookings over last year. It is possible some of this has to do with broader economic uncertainty, but Business Insider identified other more direct reasons. “Knowing whether there would be a reservation system or not has made it difficult for people to plan trips — why book a hotel room when you can’t be certain you’ll even be able to get into the park on the days you’re there?” NPS has not said whether it will bring back the reservation system for the fast-approaching summer season. There has also been a notable drop in interest from Canadians, according to airline travel data. If tourists do manage to get into the parks, potential understaffing could result in a noticeable impact on park visitors’ experience: Visitor centers staffed by volunteers or non-profits; smaller parks being closed on weekdays; long waits at entrance stations; trails not being maintained, and so on and so forth. It depends on whether President Trump can move forward with cuts. It is unclear what the logic is behind cutting back on staffing in national parks, which amount to roughly 85 million acres of wild terrain across the country that requires substantial physical labor to maintain. Those staffers also collect entry fees to help fund nature preservation. At least in some places like Yosemite, experts do not think there is much to worry about, at least for this upcoming season. Right now, gear rental outfitters and other businesses are struggling to ascertain how many workers to hire, which could depend a lot on the next moves by the Trump administration. Ultimately none of this may even matter to President Trump, who earlier this week announced a plan to use federal lands for new housing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/portable-monitors/kyy-x90d-triple-portable-monitor-review'>KYY X90D Triple Portable Monitor Review: A screaming dual-screen bargain at $250</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tomshardware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 13:00:00 <p>
It’s been a year since we looked at KYY’s X90A portable monitor, but the company is back with a new variant called the X90D. The X90D seems strikingly similar to its elder sibling, but has slightly larger display panels, each measuring 15.6 inches across. The similarities pay off regarding build quality, as this is a solid, well-built unit with a chassis made entirely of aluminum. It's also hefty, weighing 3.2 pounds, but that’s the price you must pay to lug around two 15.6-inch display panels and the accompanying hardware. In the Extended mode, both displays flank your laptop's built-in display. You can adjust the hinge to achieve your desired viewing angle for both. There are also in-between modes, which make use of only one panel. The kickstand is also constructed of aluminum and features a stiff hinge. Each display panel has a set of controls on the bottom bezel. There are also only two ports on the monitor, both USB-C. If your laptop provides enough juice, the X90D will operate with a single USB-C cable. However, if you need auxiliary power, KYY wisely includes an additional USB-C to USB-A cable and a USB-A wall adapter in the box. This makes transporting the portable monitor, with its rotating screens just dangling loosely in space when stowed, highly susceptible to damage. Swipe to scroll horizontally Panel Type / Backlight IPS / WLED Screen Size / Aspect Ratio 15.6 inches / 16:9 Max Resolution & Refresh Rate 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz x2 Max Brightness 300 nits Contrast 1,200:1 Ports 2x USB-C (DisplayPort Alt Mode) Dimensions 11.9 x 17.3 x 3.74 inches Weight 3.2 pounds Given the lack of HDMI ports on the X90D, you're out of luck if your laptop lacks Thunderbolt ports or support for DisplayPort Alt-Mode over USB-C. This is disappointing for users with older laptops or anyone with a Raspberry Pi who wants to partake in some dual-screen action. However, since my MacBook Pro has three Thunderbolt 4 ports, it was fully equipped to accommodate the X90D. I'm used to just plugging in a monitor and it being instantly recognized by the operating system. I plugged the X90D into my MacBook Pro, and it powered on. Then, it gave me "No Signal" warnings on both displays. It next showed, "Entering Low Power Mode" and then shut down. In my haste, I hadn't bothered to look at the quick start guide, which said I first needed to install a display driver for the monitor. Luckily, KYY provides a thumb drive that has both USB-A and USB-C connectors for universal support. At that point, I plugged the X90D's USB-C cable back into the MacBook Pro and both displays fired up as expected. After navigating to display settings and flipping a couple of switches, I had the X90D operating as an extended display on both panels, expanding my workspace on either side of my MacBook Pro's internal display. This can come in handy, as you can choose from five preset display modes: Standard, Game, Movie, Photo, and Vivid. It takes a while to become acclimated with the OSD. You then press the Menu button again to go deeper into a submenu. Once you’ve landed on an actionable item, you can use the +/- buttons to increase or decrease the value (i.e., brightness, contrast, black level, sharpness, etc. The X90D is a dual-screen IPS portable monitor, with each Full HD (1920 x 1080) display measuring 15.6 inches across. The display panels also have a matte finish, which helps to cut down on reflections. While those are appreciable gains over its predecessor, things took a step backwards regarding overall brightness. We measured 181.4 nits maximum panel brightness for both panels on the X90D. The 2002 Leonardo DiCaprio flick Catch Me if You Can looked great on the monitor with its 1960’s aesthetic and bright color palette, as did the first three episodes of Marvel’s Daredevil: Born Again. My only major complaint about the monitor is regarding brightness. With spring approaching, and daytime temperatures in the mid-70s here in the southern states, I like to spend part of the afternoon working on my back porch to get some fresh air and listen to nature. Of course, it’s hard to make fair comparisons when X90D is flanking the far superior (and much brighter) internal Mini-LED display on my MacBook Pro, but KYY could do better here. Honestly, most people will likely stick to using the X90D indoors, where its brightness was more than adequate under the overhead LED lighting in my home. Whether I was watching movies, working on Word documents, or bashing around in Pixelmator Pro, the dual 1920 x 1080 displays were more than up to the task of handling those tasks. However, the X90D isn’t perfect – no product is.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Most people use ChatGPT for practical purposes, according to new research from OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab. The study reveals that emotional connections mainly develop among a small group of heavy voice feature users. After analyzing nearly 40 million ChatGPT conversations, researchers found little evidence of users seeking empathy, affection, or emotional support in their interactions. The team used two different approaches to study how people interact with ChatGPT. ✓ Weekly ✓ Free ✓ Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty This small group developed significantly stronger emotional connections with the AI, more often referring to ChatGPT as a "friend." Brief interactions seemed to make people feel better, but longer daily use often had the opposite effect. According to the study, personal conversations were associated with higher levels of loneliness but lower emotional dependency. Non-personal conversations showed a different pattern: users developed stronger emotional dependency, especially with intensive use. This suggests that even when interactions are primarily functional rather than emotional, heavy users may still develop a form of dependence on the AI system. Heavy users also showed an increased risk, although the researchers couldn't prove a direct cause and effect. Still, the researchers believe their methods could help guide future studies in this field. This work adds to existing evidence that people can form emotional bonds with AI even when they know it's not human. For instance, character.ai currently faces legal challenges over claims that its AI personalities have harmed children.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

DOGE—led by the multibillionaire “special government employee” Elon Musk—has proceeded with zeal, working to scrap funding for veterans’ cancer treatments, reportedly cutting FDA employees directly working on Musk’s company Neuralink, slashing (and then walking back) layoffs in the National Nuclear Security Administration, cutting about 1,000 staff working for the National Park Service across the country, and this month, after a faltering start, beginning layoffs at NASA, the nation’s space agency. One of the affected employees was Andrew Hazelton, a meteorologist who grew up in Florida and until last month spent his days with the Hurricane Research Division Modeling Team, which helps NOAA understand these extreme storms and mitigate the worst of their impacts. Hazelton is now on administrative leave—he’s not allowed to work—a temporary reinstatement position that could keep him (and many other NOAA staffers) in limbo as their situation works through the federal court system. Isaac Schultz, Gizmodo: I understand things have changed in the last day with a memo temporarily reinstating staff in “paid, non-duty” status, which potentially adds a new dimension to our conversation. Walk me through the timeline here, from your work at NOAA to the layoffs and basically how far along this rollercoaster we are now. Andrew Hazelton: I’ve been with NOAA in varying capacities for over 8 years. After I got my PhD in 2016, I worked with a postdoc at Princeton University for the NOAA lab up there, NOAA GFDL in Princeton for 2 years, and then I went to AOML, the Hurricane Research Division, in 2018, working for the University of Miami. Last October I started the federal position, working for NOAA’s Environmental Modeling Center doing hurricane models and model development. And right now we’re not allowed to work. I was a new federal employee even though I’ve worked with NOAA for 8 years or more, and then February 27th we all got that mass email basically just informing us that we were being fired. It was sort of chaotic because they had about an hour’s notice. I know some people filed appeals with the merit board. There was this preliminary injunction that allows us to be reinstated, but it seems like it’s going to depend on appeals of that. Gizmodo: It seems like across a number of agencies, folks are not only being hit with these layoffs, but then being stuck in these situations where it’s very unclear exactly what their status is, and what the federal government’s next move is going to be. It’s depending on court outcomes, and even across departments it seems like certain ones are responding to the rulings differently—some more enthusiastically than others. Gizmodo: We could speak about some more unknowns, frankly. Hazelton: In my group, I was the main person doing hurricanes. A couple dozen may have gotten reinstated as part of the judge’s decision, but there wasn’t much communication about what criteria were used for that, but some were not fully reinstated. They’ve not given a lot of information about criteria or plans, but the big thing is that, if people aren’t fully reinstated, it’s going to be hard. I know people in the satellite division have been affected, and satellites are one of our big tools for monitoring all sorts of weather, not just hurricanes. Effects could be felt across the board, for anybody who relies on weather data. Gizmodo: Just because our readers are very familiar with hurricanes—many are in the American Southeast—can you name a couple of the storms that you flew through? So Michael and also Helene last year was a pretty intense eyewall. We didn’t want to fly through because it was just so gnarly looking on radar. Gizmodo: People in and affiliated with this administration talk a lot about privatizing weather forecasting. Hazelton: The thing is there’s already a pretty robust private weather enterprise. I don’t think we want to get to a point where there’s like a subscription-based model for warnings or any sort of life-saving data or information. If you look at the numbers, it only costs 6 cents per American per day to fund all of NOAA at its current level. “In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself.” It’s a pretty minuscule cost when you look at like the dollars saved. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself. Gizmodo: You mentioned that some folks were reinstated early on. Hazelton: Yeah, there hasn’t really been a whole lot of criteria or communication. I think there was supposed to be some veterans’ preference for prior federal service, but it really hasn’t been made clear at all to us how these decisions are being made. Gizmodo: In that case, a silly question that I’ll ask anyway: Is there any idea of how long this ambiguity will last? I think it’s going to depend a lot on court cases and how those play out. I’m just ready to get back to work doing what I love doing and what helps protect the American public. Gizmodo: Given the abruptness of these layoffs and your hands being tied with work, it sounds like you just have some stuff sitting on your desk waiting to be resumed, which with something as dynamic as weather, is probably not the best thing. My coworkers, the ones that are still there, they’re great and they’re working hard, but it’s just hard when you have an agency that’s already understaffed and just being stretched even thinner. Gizmodo: Is there anything you really want to get across about either your personal experience right now or the experience of federal workers more generally at this time? NOAA’s mission is to protect lives and property.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/social-security-activist-on-doges-cuts-people-will-die-2000579108'>Social Security Activist on DOGE’s Cuts: ‘People Will Die’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 12:05:34 <p>
Under Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the Social Security Administration has sought to downsize and reorganize its operations. At the same time, DOGE has been closing SSA field offices across the country, making it increasingly difficult to access those offices. “We know exactly how it will impact benefits,” Lawson said. “You listen to Elon Musk on Joe Rogan’s podcast and you hear his disdain, his hatred of Social Security,” Lawson said. “He thinks it is an incredible net negative for the country.” “Many people will just not be able to get benefits,” said Lawson. Huge numbers of retirees are going to be driven into SSA field offices that were “already straining, even before the Trump presidency,” he said, noting that even under Biden, the agency was already at fifty-year staffing lows. “Now you have firings, buyouts, they’ve closed 45 offices, they’ve instructed GSA [the General Services Administration] to end the leases on all of them,” he said. The Trump administration even seems to have admitted that recent policy shifts could disrupt service delivery, with the U.S. Commerce Secretary, billionaire Howard Lutnick, going on TV and claiming that an occasional drop in retirement benefits is really not that big of a deal. Lawson said that the tactics being employed are a very old strategy used by private actors to attack public systems. “Kneecap the mailman, complain that the mail is late, suddenly remember that you’ve got a cousin in the private mail delivery service and that they’ll do it for twice as much and deliver half.” Part of the strategy is to “lower public confidence” in Social Security as a program, he said: “If you can convince people that they’re going to get nothing, they will be willing to accept less than they’re owed.” The only thing DOGE is doing efficiently is hurting the Social Security program, he added. Lawson said he doesn’t think Musk understands the benefits of Social Security because he comes from a background in which economic security was never a question. “He was born with an emerald mine,” Lawson said. He’s not a normal person.” Musk has denied multiple times that his family owned stakes in South African emerald mines or that the profits from said mines funded his early career, but his own father, Errol Morris, has said that the family was involved in the emerald trade and that his son’s denials were “just because, you see, he wants to tell the people in America that he also had a hard time.” In 2016, Elon, himself, told Forbes that his father had “a share in an Emerald mine in Zambia” when he was 15 years old. Musk has referred to Social Security as a “Ponzi scheme,” which Lawson said is a ridiculous comparison since Ponzi schemes are about taking someone’s money and not giving anything back, while Social Security is funded by Americans’ money and often returns more than retirees actually pay in. “Social Security is a very transparent—you can find out where every nickel and dime goes—social insurance, pay-as-you-go system. All of it goes back to the people who are paying in.” Lawson compared the goal of privatizing Social Security to America’s previous transition away from defined benefit pension plans and towards 401ks. Cuts to the Social Security program will create real, tangible harm to untold numbers of people, the activist added, noting that he had recently spoken with a lot of seniors who were incredibly frightened about what the cuts would mean for them. “You miss one check and people are like, ‘I can’t fucking eat. There’s a lot to be scared of right now.” I don’t think little Elon Musk understands the magnitude of what he’s fucking with right now,” Lawson said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It took me five minutes to understand that Cart should be my default web browser on macOS, and I do not regret this choice. What I like most about the Arc browser is its effective management of tabs thanks to a functionality called spaces. ARC is available for free on MacOS, Windows and iOS. You have a site by window, and that's it. With Colibri, create an account on which you can record links, lists and streams. Turn between the site you currently consult and your account view to find the site you want to visit. This system maintains the minimalist and easy -to -use hummingbird user interface. Admittedly, this is far from what you are used to, but once you have taken the helping hand and discovered the refined interface, you will quickly appreciate this browser for its speed and simplicity. Colibri is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows. Maxthon combines several impressive features in a web browser. However, you can select the type of AI you want to use: cats for technology, writing, well-being, and an extraterrestrial for fun. The Chat IA offers two modes: fast mode offers daily free uses, and expert mode requires diamonds (an integrated purchase) and costs depending on the number of conversations. Another chromium derivative, Aloha offers a level of safety that Chrome cannot match (at least without significant modifications). Of all alternative browsers, Aloha is the one that most resembles Chrome. If you don't want to change, it's a great option. To find out more, see the Aloha download page.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/the-art-of-the-perfect-nap-sleep-science/'>The Art of the Perfect Nap</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 12:00:00 <p>
THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. You close your eyes for half an hour and wake up feeling recharged. Naps have long been praised as a tool for boosting alertness, enhancing mood, strengthening memory, and improving productivity. Done wrong, it can leave you groggy, disoriented, and struggling to fall asleep later. This isn’t just due to a heavy lunch—our internal body clock, or circadian rhythm, creates cycles of wakefulness and tiredness throughout the day. The early afternoon lull is part of this rhythm, which is why so many people feel drowsy at that time. Studies suggest that a short nap during this period—ideally followed by bright light exposure—can help counteract fatigue, boost alertness, and improve cognitive function without interfering with nighttime sleep. These “power naps” allow the brain to rest without slipping into deep sleep, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed. But there’s a catch: Napping too long may result in waking up feeling worse than before. Once a nap extends beyond 30 minutes, the brain transitions into slow-wave sleep, making it much harder to wake up. Studies show that waking from deep sleep can leave people feeling sluggish for up to an hour. This can have serious implications if they then try to perform safety-critical tasks, make important decisions, or operate machinery, for example. And if a nap is taken too late in the day, it can eat away from the “sleep pressure build-up”—the body’s natural drive for sleep—making it harder to fall asleep at night. People with chronic insomnia are often advised to avoid naps entirely, as daytime sleep can weaken their drive to sleep at night.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/reviews/633769/fuji-gfx-100rf-review-medium-format-compact-camera'>Fujifilm GFX100RF review: one sensor, nine cameras</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 12:00:00 <p>
We could spend multiple podcasts debating the technical validity of that statement, but what Joswiak was trying to imply was that the iPhone now had sensors with a resolution that was big and high enough that it could crop in to emulate various focal lengths. But while most fixed-lens cameras like the X100VI create intentional limitations and encourage you to shoot more than you think, the GFX100RF is all about flexibility and intentionality. Using its high-resolution 102MP sensor, an all-new aspect ratio dial and four different digital “zoom” modes, Fujifilm aims to replace nine cameras and four lenses with one relatively compact body. There’s a reason people love shooting with Fujifilm cameras, and if you’re looking for more of that experience, the GFX100RF won’t let you down. This physical dial, mounted to the back of the camera, lets you pick from one of nine different formats to frame your image. As someone who still shoots a lot of old film cameras, it had me geeking out big time. You can choose between 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, 17:6, 3:4, 1:1, 7:6, 5:4, and, my favorite, 65:24 — an homage to Fujifilm’s legendary TX-1 panoramic camera. Because Fujifilm didn’t include the hybrid optical viewfinder like you’ll see in the X100VI and X-Pro3, it included three different view modes for composing with those aspect ratios instead. You can see the full scene with frame lines, a 50% opacity mode that lets you see what’s outside your frame, or a full blackout mode that only shows the crop you’re shooting. After testing this camera for about a month, I’ve started to wonder why every camera doesn’t have a dial like this. Carrying the camera around Utah, it was a ton of fun to jump around different ratios while composing a photo, and in multiple circumstances, an image that I’d only considered ‘good’ in the full 4:3 mode was upgraded to ‘great’ once I found the right crop for it. Now obviously, when you crop out a large portion of an image, you’re also cropping a decent amount of resolution. But even when using the most-cropped 65x24 ratio, you’re still left with a large 50MP file. And if you shoot RAW in addition to JPG and you edit in Adobe Lightroom, RAW files will be ingested pre-cropped with the option to zoom out to the full 4:3 image. These “zoom” modes will also cost you resolution too, though, with the full 80mm focal length cropped to 65x24 spitting out a 9MP image. And right above that, you’ll find a remappable knurled dial, which strangely wasn’t mapped to anything out of the box on my unit. But unfortunately, the GFX100RF is also limited in two key ways: a relatively slow f/4 aperture and a lack of optical image stabilization. An f/4 aperture on Fujifilm’s medium format sensor equates to about f/3.16 on a full-frame camera, and while that isn’t horrible by any means, it felt limiting in my time with it. On a camera like the Fujifilm X100VI with optical image stabilization, I could comfortably drop the shutter speed down to a full second hand-held. But on the GFX100RF, the slowest I could comfortably shoot handheld without getting a shaky image was 1/30 — maybe 15th if I was especially steady. As someone who carries around a tripod nearly every time I go take photos, this wasn’t a huge deal for me. But Fujifillm is positioning this camera as the best everyday camera on the market, and without a faster lens or optical image stabilization, you might have trouble shooting with this camera once the light gets low, unless you use uncomfortably high ISO values. It’s understandable why Fujifilm may not have added optical image stabilization to this camera. And at $4,899, which is still quite expensive, this camera comes in cheaper than any other GFX body Fujifilm currently sells. Taken alone, the lens is shockingly small — smaller than every dedicated GF lens that Fujifilm sells by a long shot. And at that point, why not just make a bigger, faster lens? There’s no doubt the GFX100RF will be consistently compared to Leica’s full-frame Q3 — primarily because, until recently, if you wanted an even remotely new fixed-lens camera with a large sensor, the Q3 was pretty much your only option. Composing nearly every aspect of your final image in-camera is a real joy, and I have a soft spot in my heart for physical dials.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

How old is the TV in your living room? There’s been some massive improvements in smart TV tech even in just the last couple years. Amazon has a number of deals right now on LG smart TVs with a tremendous limited time offer on the 65-inch Class OLED evo C3 Series Smart TV. That might not sound like a lot, but at that price point it’s shaving the cost to you down to just $1,197. Movies the Way They Were Meant to Be Watched Many TV manufacturers like to fill their products with various features aimed at artificially enhancing color depth or increasing frame rates through software that no one really asked for. These features get a lot of hate online, but to be honest they can sometimes be useful in specific situations—for example, they often perform well with sports. You might have an easier time watching the hockey game and following the fast-moving puck thanks to content upscaling and motion smoothing. The evo C3 Series has what’s called Filmmaker Mode and when you turn that on, it turns all that other crap off — so you can watch what you watch the way the director intended. Combine that with the support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound and what you get is the closest thing to the theatrical experience you possibly can in your own living room.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

You aren't going to die from any of these conditions, but it's still hard to focus when, say, the back of your right foot is rubbing a new blister against the inside of your not-quite-broken-in-yet hiking boots. I found myself in the computing version of this situation yesterday, when I was trying to work on a new Mac Mini and was brought up short by the fact that my third mouse button (that is, clicking on the scroll wheel) did nothing. This was odd, because I have for many years assigned this button to "Mission Control" on macOS—a feature that tiles every open window on your machine, making it quick and easy to switch apps. I made the alteration again in System Settings and went back to work. But after a reboot later that day to install an OS update, I found that my shortcut setting for Mission Control had once again been wiped away. When it happened a third time, I switched into full "research and destroy the problem" mode. I swear at least once every few months, some shortcut or whatever just stops working, and sometimes, after a week or so, it starts working again. No rhyme, reason, or apparent causality except that computers are just [unprintable expletives]." But even if computers are [unprintable expletives], their problems have often been encountered and fixed by some other poor soul. So I turned to the Internet for help... and immediately stumbled upon an Apple discussion thread called "MacOS mouse shortcuts are reset upon restart or shutdown."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/kennedy-cell-phone-bans-schools-rcna197347'>Kennedy praises cellphone bans in schools, citing mix of science and misinformation</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 11:00:40 <p>
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda: cellphones in schools. In an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Thursday, Kennedy praised cellphone restrictions in schools and listed health hazards that he said were linked to phone use among children and teens — some backed by scientific research, others less so. Scientists have also long understood that cellphone use in school can lead to poor academic performance, including lower grades. However, the bulk of research so far has found no association between cellphone use and cancer, nor evidence that cellphones damage DNA. Kennedy’s statements follow a pattern of his, in which he mixes misinformation with scientific fact. But certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems and some of his proposed solutions — such as substituting beef tallow for seed oils in fast food — are not backed by research. Restricting their use is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Nine states have already enacted such bans or restrictions, and 15 states and Washington, D.C., have introduced legislation to do so, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank. However, there’s no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cellphone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis. “There’s a lot of low-quality research in the literature that, if you wanted to collect all that and put it together, it would look very damning,” he said. The anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, Children’s Health Defense, challenged the Federal Communications Commission’s decision not to review its 1996 health and safety guidelines for wireless-based technologies. Research thus far has been “very reassuring” about cellphone safety, Bushberg said. Most studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cellphones could increase the risk of brain tumors, given that people often hold their phone by their head while talking. But overall brain cancer rates haven’t risen as cellphones have become more widely used. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic, meaning it cannot rule out a causal link. Several questions remain, said David McCormick, a biology professor at Illinois Institute of Technology. But the research relied on people’s memories about past phone use, which aren’t always reliable, so its results (like those of similar studies) are hard to interpret. Cellphone use has also changed in recent years, McCormick said, which could affect exposure. Whereas studies thus far have mainly looked at the effects of 2G or 3G mobile signals, higher-frequency 5G networks are common today. And people now text as much if not more than they call, so there’s potentially less radiation near the brain. Despite bipartisan support for cellphone restrictions in schools, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like. Phones can have lifesaving benefits — for instance, by allowing children to call 911 — so some parents worry that outright bans could jeopardize their child’s safety. For instance, in schools where cellphones are the only internet-connected device, a ban may make less sense. On Monday, Kennedy visited a Virginia high school that adopted the change, which he said students and teachers there have welcomed. However, prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy suggested that although he personally supports getting phones out of schools, parents and teachers should make their own decisions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/byd-5-minute-ev-charging/'>BYD's 5-Minute EV Charging Sounds Great. But How Useful Is it?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 11:00:00 <p>
They’re worried about waiting around for a charger, which, depending on its power, can take anywhere between 20 minutes and eight hours to fill up a battery. So the hubbub around a surprise announcement from Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD makes sense. The automaker said this week that two new vehicles set to launch in April will be able to add 250 miles of range in just five minutes. (The day of BYD’s announcement, Tesla stock dropped by five percent.) Topping up in five minutes makes for great ad copy, and could go a long way to alleviating drivers’ concerns about EVs. BYD says the superfast charging is made possible by an “all liquid-cooled megawatt flash-charging terminal system,” according to Bloomberg, plus a new, automotive-grade silicon carbide power chip. That’s a small but significant jump compared to competitors, at least among passenger vehicles. The more significant BYD innovation, though, may be in its chargers, which the automaker indicates should be able to take advantage of that 1,000-volt capability. BYD says it will build 4,000 of them in China, though hasn’t provided any specifics about when, where, and how. Getting those fast chargers in the ground likely won’t be a simple task. “It’s going to take a while,” says Gil Tal, who directs the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis. Building charging stations can already be a multimonth, if not multiyear journey in most countries, due partially to lengthy permitting processes, but also the time it takes to find, build, and assemble charging components. Plus, an advanced liquid-cooled system, like the kind described by BYD, needs thick, heavy, and specially manufactured cables and connectors that can dissipate heat quickly. That means more up-front building expenses, which could be passed on to drivers in higher charging prices. Megawatt charging systems that can deliver up to 1,250 volts have been in development for nearly a decade, though developers have mostly been focused on the rapid charging of heavy-duty commercial vehicles like electric semitrucks and buses. Will they be willing to do the same for passenger vehicles?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This story originally appeared on Undark and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In July 2012, a renegade American businessman, Russ George, took a ship off the coast of British Columbia and dumped 100 tons of iron sulfate dust into the Pacific Ocean. Now a startup called Stardust seeks something more ambitious: developing proprietary geoengineering technology that would help block sun rays from reaching the planet. Geoengineering projects, even those led by climate scientists at major universities, have previously drawn the ire of environmentalists and other groups. Such a deliberate transformation of the atmosphere has never been done, and many uncertainties remain. If a geoengineering project went awry, for example, it could contribute to air pollution and ozone loss, or have dramatic effects on weather patterns, such as disrupting monsoons in populous South and East Asia. But as global temperatures rise, public and scientific sentiments are shifting. If those temperature trends continue, governments or private entities may ultimately use geoengineering to alleviate or avoid the worst impacts of extreme weather, including deadly heat waves, firestorms, and hurricanes. And whoever deploys the technology will need to keep it up for decades while pent-up greenhouse gases gradually dissipate or are removed. But, so far, Pasztor told Undark, the company has not met all of his requests.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Saturn will temporarily lose its iconic look from our viewpoint on Earth, appearing as a pale, yellow sphere without its swirling rings shrouding the gas giant. The billions of rocky and icy chunks swirling around Saturn will disappear from our viewpoint on Sunday, March 23 as the thin edges of the planet’s rings are aimed toward Earth, seemingly vanishing from sight. The rare phenomenon occurs every 13 to 15 years, with Earth passing through Saturn’s ring plane. The exquisite ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, and is made up of tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house, according to NASA. Similarly to Earth, Saturn’s axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees. As it orbits the Sun, Saturn’s tilt shifts in relation to Earth, causing its rings to disappear from our view as our planet crosses their plane. Between these two phases, however, is when the rings vanish from our view. Saturn’s rings won’t come into full view from Earth for a few months, and we may not get to see them again until November, according to earth.com. Those in mid-northern latitudes, however, will have a hard time seeing Saturn as the planet will be close to the Sun at pre-dawn and below the slanted morning ecliptic. Although it’s not ideal sky watching conditions for most, the celestial phenomenon is a rare glimpse of how the planets move around our shared star.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

If you own a Google Pixel 9 or Samsung Galaxy S25 series phone and find yourself in a cellular dead zone, you can now send texts to your friends and family via satellite. Verizon isn't the only carrier focused on providing this kind of satellite connectivity to fill in the gaps in terrestrial cellular network coverage. T-Mobile recently announced a partnership with Starlink that's currently in beta until July. T-Mobile's solution will be included for subscribers on its Go5G Next plan, and other customers can add it to their existing plan for $15 per month. AT&T is also working with AST SpaceMobile and recently tested a video call over satellite connectivity. This Handheld Console Lets You Relive Your Nintendo DS Dreams But this newly announced gaming handheld, the OneXSugar, claims to do that all in one. The device has two screens and rotating gamepad controllers to allow it to transform into all sorts of clever modes of use. That secondary screen can be used as a kickstand, or you can rotate the controllers to attach to the square screen. Now that’s definitely unlike anything we’ve seen before. The Android-based device, announced on Indiegogo, was unveiled alongside a new series of chips from Qualcomm designed specifically for gaming handhelds. The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 boasts 28 percent improved graphics with ray tracing, specifically designed for cloud-based gaming and retro emulators. Just don’t expect it to support Windows-level games like AMD’s Ryzen Z-series chips, which you can find in handhelds like the popular Asus ROG Ally X. The bike also has a few cool tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can switch between using a torque sensor, which will adjust the pressure you need to pedal on mixed terrain, versus the more old-fashioned cadence sensor, which is best for longer stretches of roads. It’s also integrated with Apple Find My and Apple Health, so if you’re an iPhone user, you don’t have to fiddle with your fitness tracker to log a bike ride. I’m unboxing my tester ride (in Violet Haze, naturally) as we speak. Anyone who’s ever dreamed of a medium format Fujifilm X100 camera, dream no more. At 5.26 by 3.56 inches, with a depth of 3 inches, this isn’t fitting in your pocket, nor is the 25.9 ounces (735 grams) light enough to let you throw it in your bag and forget about it. To make the GFX100RF weather-sealed you’ll need to further bulk it up with an adapter ring and filter, just as you do with the X100VI.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Much of the opposition activity has centered around universities, and many of those connected to the demonstrations are now finding their X accounts suspended, observers report. The majority of the suspended accounts were "university-associated activist accounts, basically sharing protest information, locations for students to go," Yusuf Can, coordinator and analyst at the Wilson Center's Middle East Program, told POLITICO. Many of these accounts are "grassroots activists" with their followings in the low tens of thousands, said Can. Some accounts appear to be suspended only in Turkey and not in the rest of the world. Activist Ömer Faruk Aslan created a second account to avoid censorship. "Yesterday, my account was blocked by a court order because the tweets exceeded 6 million views," he posted. Turkey's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X that authorities have found 326 social media accounts that are inciting hatred, 72 of which were abroad. A coordinated action between cyber and security authorities led to the arrest of 54 suspects related to the social media accounts, said Yerlikaya.

In January, a generator AI developed by Chinese venture company DeepSeek was released, shocking the world. It has attracted a lot of attention worldwide, taking the number one mobile app downloads in 140 countries around the world. There are multiple reasons why DeepSeek's appearance was so shocking. First of all, it had the ability to rival previous generation AIs such as "ChatGPT." It also supports Japanese input, and questions are answered at a level that is almost the same as those in ChatGPT. And nevertheless, it is offered at a much lower price than previous generation AIs such as ChatGPT. ChatGPT is also available for free, but the Plus, which improves performance costs $20 per month, while the Pro, which improves performance costs $200 per month. Pay-as-you-go system is only used when using APIs, but this system is also very inexpensive compared to other generation AIs. Furthermore, the development cost was $5.57 million (approximately 860 million yen), which was less than a tenth of the US competitors, making it extremely inexpensive. DeepSeek is believed to have used poorly-performance semiconductors developed for China, which caused doubts about its huge investment in NVDIA and other countries, causing stock prices to plummet. It is also said that the reason why it was able to be developed at a low cost is because OpenAI's AI was "distilled" and trained. Distillation refers to the use of large-scale AI output as a small-scale AI teacher, and OpenAI prohibits such use by other companies. The reason why the development of generated AI is expensive is because training costs, running costs such as power and servers, and labor costs involved in research and development are high. Answers in line with the Chinese Communist Party's wishes, security issues too On the other hand, DeepSeek also has problems. Additionally, data entered by users in DeepSeek is managed on a Chinese server. With the emergence of competition, for generation AI such as OpenAI, measures such as reducing costs and improving performance are required. As mentioned above, DeepSeek is generally free of charge. The Stargate Project is also expected to aim to accelerate AI development, improve defense equipment, and enhance information collection and data management.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35229431/'>Finally, I found "bone conduction earphones" perfect for swimming and running [Review]</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 08:45:00 <p>
Last year I had the opportunity to review two SUUNTO products. The first was a sports smartwatch called "SUUNTO RACE," with high praise for its long battery life and vibrant organic EL display. And, the "SUUNTO AQUA" I'm introducing this time is the company's latest work, and I've been testing it for a few weeks. SUUNTO AQUA comes in two colors: black and lime blue. The lime blue I tried was a soft-touch navy blue finish with a lime yellow accent color, which looks great. Many bone conduction headsets use their own magnetic charging cables to maintain high waterproofness, but the SUUNTO AQUA comes with a portable power supply (power bank) that can be clipped to the right body. This allows for two full charges (a total of about 30 hours). The portable power supply itself can be charged via USB-C, so if you don't forget to carry this portable power supply when you take it on a trip or other trip, you won't need a dedicated cable. The Aqua is equipped with a motion detection sensor that measures stroke posture while swimming, head tilt, breathing frequency, glide time, and more. By connecting to the Suunto app, you can not only manage these swimming functions, but you can also perform functions that allow you to operate them with your head movements, dual device connections, sound modes, button customization, assessments, and firmware updates all at once. The function of operating the head movement is convenient even outside the pool, and when I actually used it while running or cycling, I was able to answer incoming calls, reject calls, and skip songs without any problems by simply shaking my head vertically or horizontally. Small buttons often cause trouble by groping, but with this design, you can reduce operational errors. The unit has 32GB of internal storage, allowing you to play music where Bluetooth is not reachable or even in the water. Since subscription music services are not natively supported, you will need to transfer your MP3 or other device in advance, but in situations where it does not get into water, you can fully connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth. I personally sweat a lot from my workouts and run and cycling in areas with heavy rain, so bone conduction headsets have become an essential item. Even from my perspective, SUUNTO AQUA is a recommended option for those who want to enjoy music underwater or in the rain.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

I will start this article by specifying that the choice of widgets is personal, and that what can be useful to me is not necessarily so for you. Despite everything, there is a widget for everyone, and according to the applications installed on your Android device, you will probably find one or two in this article to help you gain in efficiency. Receive a selection of strategic advice and concrete tips every week in your mailbox with our newsletter practical guides. With the right collection of widgets, you can create a quick home screen that allows you to stay informed without opening up the slightest application. I have traveled the widgets for phones and tablets, and I share those which, in my opinion, will make your phone or tablet more useful. If you depend on your messaging to stay connected, this widget is essential. I use Keep Notes daily to quickly note information, share racing lists and much more. To quickly access these links, I added the "Notes" widget. You can add two widgets: one to scroll through your notes and one to quickly create new notes (text, voice and even images from your camera). I favor this option because the screen of your phone is much smaller than that of a tablet, and it is better not to clutter it with too many bulky widgets. Arc Search is a great way to do quick research on the internet. If you prefer to get away from Google search, I strongly recommend that you install Arc Search and add the widget to your home screen. There is already a battery indicator at the top of your phone screen. However, this indicator does not provide any information on the load level of connected devices. To avoid any confusion, I added the Pixel weather widget. The Spotify widget allows me to quickly access my reading lists. Before running, I just have to press my favorite playlist and leave. Just press an empty space of your home screen for a long time, press "widgets", search for the widget to add to the displayed window and drag it to your home screen. You can then resize the widget and move it according to your needs.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Far far from being "any" caps, the best models take care of the wearer's care trying as much as possible to offer the comfort that each runner deserves. Below, a list of the main factors not to be missed: Breathability: when it comes to running hats, the use of expressions such as "ventilation" and "air circulation" appear usual, as much as the theme of "humidity management", decisive to prevent sweat from annoying too much during the running sessions (and alters its performance). The adjective "breathable" often rhymes with holes and/or mesh, which therefore play a functional as well as decorative role.

Normally, when accessing a website, your IP address and other personal information is broadcast online. In other words, a VPN is used to protect privacy, secure a connection (especially on public Wi-Fi) and possibly bypass certain geographic restrictions. Different criteria must be taken into consideration to have the assurance that your identity is well protected. The short answer is as follows: yes, but with nuances ... All VPNs are not equal. Free services are often less secure and can keep connection newspapers (logs). It is also important to verify the privacy policy before taking out a subscription. To maximize your chances of navigating anonymously, favor a VPN which: Has advanced features such as "Kill Switch" and "Dynamic Multihop"; On the other hand, preserving its confidentiality online is an achievable objective. It is indeed possible to hide your activities, protect your personal data and limit the digital traces left on the sites and applications consulted. Can we be followed online despite a VPN? Its effectiveness is also based on the adoption of good practices and other protection tools. When it comes to preserving your privacy on the Internet, one of the first elements likely to compromise your anonymity remains the use of your personal accounts, starting with those of Google or social networks.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation says it’s investigating a series of alleged incidents across the country in which “Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged.” On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted charges against three people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles and, in at least one alleged incident, writing “profane messages against President Trump” near Tesla charging stations, among other crimes. “Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” Bondi said in a news release detailing the arrests, which were made over the last several weeks in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina. Civil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Musk’s role in the government. The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations. Bondi’s announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots “Tesla Takedown” events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are scheduled to take place at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend. The demonstrations have multiplied since they began in mid-February, with some attracting hundreds of people each. With a court order, law enforcement can additionally get “confidential education records” from any school or agency in the course of a terrorism investigation, the report notes. In addition to these resources, the FBI has access to surveillance technology that local authorities may not, such as social media surveillance tools, face recognition programs, and allegedly “stingrays” that can intercept data from cell phones. There aren’t explicit guidelines or laws requiring the FBI to keep companies in the loop when they are targeted in what law enforcement deems “domestic terrorism” incidents.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230758/'>"MacBook Air" review with "M4" -- Not a "bodied update"</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 07:00:00 <p>
Appleが「M4」チップ搭載「MacBook Air」（M4 MacBook Air）を3月に発表した。このウルトラポータブルノートPCについては、新機能に関するさまざまなうわさが飛び交っていた。

これがAppleの主要デバイスでM4チップを採用する最後の製品だったことや、われわれがテストしたノートPCの中で2024年の「M3」チップ搭載MacBook Air（M3 MacBook Air）が最高のものの1つだった（今でもそうだ）ことが、その理由だろう。M3 MacBook Airは、未来を見据えた「大衆向けAIコンピューター」であり、Appleのデザインの最高到達点とみなすことも可能だ。

しかし、MacBook Airの更新をやめるわけにはいかないので、M4 MacBook Airが漸進的なアップグレードとなることは明らかだった。つまり、M3 MacBook Airの長所がさらに強化され、消費者にとってのコストパフォーマンスも少し改善されるということだ。

例えば、M4 MacBook Airの価格は999ドル（16万4800円）からとなっており（16GBのメモリーを搭載する13インチモデルを選択した場合）、2024年のM3モデルよりも100ドル安く（訳注：日本では据え置き）なっている。さらに、ローエンドとハイエンドの両方でハードウェアが強化されており、最もローエンドの構成でも10コアのCPUと8コアのGPUが搭載されている。

一方、ハイエンド構成では、32GBのユニファイドメモリーが選択可能（M3 MacBook Airでは、最大で24GBまでだった）となっている。基本コンポーネントの強化と開始価格の値下げを組み合わせることで、AppleはM4 MacBook Airを戦略的に位置付けている。ますます競争が激化する市場で、M4 MacBook Airを購入する動機を作り出して、競争力を維持することが狙いだ。

M4 MacBook Airは素晴らしいデバイスだが、MacBook Airシリーズの自然な進歩でもあるため、これを「退屈な」アップデートとみなす人もいるかもしれない。それを肯定的に捉える人もいれば、否定的に捉える人もいるだろう。壊れていないものを直すことはできないが、MacBook Airには、もっと大胆なデザインを選択できる余地が幾つかあると思う。

明白な例の1つは、M4 MacBook Airの新色である「スカイブルー」だ。これは非常に控えめな青色である。筆者はMicrosoftの「Surface Laptop」にもう少し近い色を期待していたので、とても慎重な色の選択だと感じた。とはいえ、M4 MacBook Airを際立たせる特徴が幾つかあることも確かだ。詳しく見ていこう。

トリプルディスプレーの衝撃

M4 MacBook Airで特に期待されていた人気機能の1つが、本体を開いた状態で最大2台の外部ディスプレーに出力できる機能だ。3台のディスプレーを同時に使えるこの機能だけでも、仕事や生産作業、クリエーティブなタスクに新たな可能性が開かれ、M4 MacBook Airの競争力が高まるだろう。

本体のディスプレーも相変わらず美しい。Appleの「Liquid Retina」テクノロジーのおかげで、テキストは鮮明かつ明瞭で、動画は滑らかかつ鮮やかに表示される。さらに、このディスプレーは10億色に対応する。最大輝度は500ニトなので、「MacBook Pro」のディスプレーほど明るくはないが、それでもほとんどの用途に十分な明るさだ。

ただし、M4チップ搭載MacBook Pro（M4 MacBook Pro）で提供されている「Nano-textureガラス」へのアップグレードオプションが、M4 MacBook Airでは利用できないことに少し驚いた。私たちが少し過剰な期待をするようになってしまったのかもしれないが、M4 MacBook Airのディスプレーは映り込みが目立つため、さまざまなアップグレードの選択肢がある中で、Nano-textureガラスがなぜ採用されなかったのか疑問に思わざるを得ない。

ディスプレーで気に入らないもう1つの点は、カメラ用のノッチだ。レンズが配置されている部分に黒い切り欠きがあり、貴重な画面スペースの一部が無駄になっている。ツールバーをオンにしたままにしておけばノッチに慣れることができるが、アプリを全画面で表示すると間違いなく目立つ。

強力な生産性マシン

生産性と言えば、M4 MacBook Airの利点は複数のディスプレーだけではない。まず、M4 MacBook Airでビデオ会議をするのは楽しい。ウェブカメラのハードウェアが、2024年モデルの1080pの「FaceTime」カメラから、Appleの新しい「センターフレーム」機能を備えた1200万画素カメラにアップグレードされたからだ。

センターフレームは、2024年秋に発表されたMacBook Proと「iMac」で初めて登場した。これは、M4 MacBook Airを既存のMacBook Proに少し近づける多くの機能の1つである。ご存じない方のために説明しておくと、センターフレームは、デバイスの位置に関係なく、ユーザーがフレーム内で中心に映るように調整する機能だ。ユーザーが最小限の入力をするだけで、ビデオ通話の視覚的な調整を処理してくれる。

これは独立した機能というよりも、ウェブカメラ技術の必然的な未来であるように筆者には思える。これこそがウェブカメラのあるべき姿だ。Appleのイノベーションは、視覚的に美しく洗練された体験をMacBook AirのLiquid Retinaディスプレーで提供する。この体験は、仕事でも、Wi-Fi経由での個人的なFaceTime通話でも同じように楽しむことができる。

最高級のハードウェア、シームレスで効果的に統合された製品、そして、生活の質を高める機能群の相乗効果で、Macでのビデオ通話体験は全体的に向上している。

筆者が普段使用するのは「Windows」デバイスだが、Macも長年使っている。MacBook Airが「Launchpad」、画面分割、「Siri」との直接的なやりとりを組み合わせて、マルチタスクを極めて簡単に処理できることを忘れてしまっていた。さらに、ウィンドウのタイル表示の改善は、デスクトップを特定の方法で配置したいユーザーを大いに満足させるはずだ。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

本体のディスプレーも相変わらず美しい。Appleの「Liquid Retina」テクノロジーのおかげで、テキストは鮮明かつ明瞭で、動画は滑らかかつ鮮やかに表示される。さらに、このディスプレーは10億色に対応する。最大輝度は500ニトなので、「MacBook Pro」のディスプレーほど明るくはないが、それでもほとんどの用途に十分な明るさだ。

ただし、M4チップ搭載MacBook Pro（M4 MacBook Pro）で提供されている「Nano-textureガラス」へのアップグレードオプションが、M4 MacBook Airでは利用できないことに少し驚いた。私たちが少し過剰な期待をするようになってしまったのかもしれないが、M4 MacBook Airのディスプレーは映り込みが目立つため、さまざまなアップグレードの選択肢がある中で、Nano-textureガラスがなぜ採用されなかったのか疑問に思わざるを得ない。

ディスプレーで気に入らないもう1つの点は、カメラ用のノッチだ。レンズが配置されている部分に黒い切り欠きがあり、貴重な画面スペースの一部が無駄になっている。ツールバーをオンにしたままにしておけばノッチに慣れることができるが、アプリを全画面で表示すると間違いなく目立つ。

強力な生産性マシン

生産性と言えば、M4 MacBook Airの利点は複数のディスプレーだけではない。まず、M4 MacBook Airでビデオ会議をするのは楽しい。ウェブカメラのハードウェアが、2024年モデルの1080pの「FaceTime」カメラから、Appleの新しい「センターフレーム」機能を備えた1200万画素カメラにアップグレードされたからだ。

センターフレームは、2024年秋に発表されたMacBook Proと「iMac」で初めて登場した。これは、M4 MacBook Airを既存のMacBook Proに少し近づける多くの機能の1つである。ご存じない方のために説明しておくと、センターフレームは、デバイスの位置に関係なく、ユーザーがフレーム内で中心に映るように調整する機能だ。ユーザーが最小限の入力をするだけで、ビデオ通話の視覚的な調整を処理してくれる。

これは独立した機能というよりも、ウェブカメラ技術の必然的な未来であるように筆者には思える。これこそがウェブカメラのあるべき姿だ。Appleのイノベーションは、視覚的に美しく洗練された体験をMacBook AirのLiquid Retinaディスプレーで提供する。この体験は、仕事でも、Wi-Fi経由での個人的なFaceTime通話でも同じように楽しむことができる。

最高級のハードウェア、シームレスで効果的に統合された製品、そして、生活の質を高める機能群の相乗効果で、Macでのビデオ通話体験は全体的に向上している。

筆者が普段使用するのは「Windows」デバイスだが、Macも長年使っている。MacBook Airが「Launchpad」、画面分割、「Siri」との直接的なやりとりを組み合わせて、マルチタスクを極めて簡単に処理できることを忘れてしまっていた。さらに、ウィンドウのタイル表示の改善は、デスクトップを特定の方法で配置したいユーザーを大いに満足させるはずだ。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On January 25, few among the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in the historic Washington hotel knew what he knew: that is, a group of high managers and his most loyal young people was preparing to occupy the highest offices of a nearby federal building. Under surveillance, they would have slept on mattresses covered with sensors for body temperature and respiratory frequency, giving themselves to renovate the country's base code. Or better yet, eliminate it completely. Musk participated as a guest. The main table was reserved for alfalfa in government. The entrepreneur was closer to Donald Trump. He would soon move to the White House, to stay in the Secretary of War Suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where he even had to install his gaming station. While Musk sat in the Hilton dance hall, his agents, under the guidance of a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to personnel management systems (OPM, Office of Personnel Management), which acts as a Federal Department of Human Resources for about 2.2 million US public employees. Many of these agents would later also show up in other government agencies: among them there were Akash Bobba, graduated from the UC Berkeley and a former palantir intern, the company active in the defense sector (and the government contractor) founded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a nineteen year old who is supernamed "Big Balls" online; And Nikhil Rajpal, a thirty -year -old computer scientist who had worked on Twitter during the period of Musk's acquisition, and who once had proposed to auction the inactive user names of the social to the best bidder. As a student, always at the UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group who loves the future Motto Cohortem Urbanam, who in Latin means more or less "fuck the inhabitants of the city".</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But now Meta has accepted a plea bargain in the context of a procedure entered by a British citizen on the use of personal data for sending targeted advertising. The agreement is such as to put an entire business model at risk that seemed destined not to be scratched by anything, so much was well thought out and defended by a trench made of marketing, lobby and pr. But human phenomena have a beginning and an end, as the Sicilian magistrate Giovanni Falcone loved to repeat. The action was threatened by Tanya O'Carroll, British activist, co-founder and former director of Amnesty Tech, the amnesty International arm that deals with electronic surveillance. Where by surveillance we mean that of the sociologist Shoshana Zuboff, namely that of Big Tech, which monitors any interaction of users with their omnipresent platforms to analyze their data and sell them by weight of advertising investors. Not so much because the law is badly written. "It is a very ambitious and brilliant legislation, but it lacks a robust part of implementation," he declared in 2023 in an interview with The Markup site. "Ireland", he still noticed, "is a small country, but acts as a regulatory subject for some of the largest companies on the planet because their headquarters is there - I speak of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple". "Therefore, a situation is determined - continues the reasoning - in which the entire Irish economy depends on foreign direct investments, a large part of which comes from the Tech industry". And this situation is generating a lot of frustration, even in the protection authorities of personal data from other European countries, in which citizens' complaints are forwarded to Ireland and end up going out".</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/giornata-mondiale-dell-acqua-ghiacciai-importanza-cose-da-sapere/'>World water day, 8 things to know about the importance of glaciers</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 05:50:00 <p>
Each edition is dedicated to a different theme, and this year the UN has chosen to speak of glaciers: one of the environments of our planet that is more affected by the effects of climate change, and whose progressive dissolution puts biodiversity at risk, and the survival of many threatened communities, landslides, droughts, floods, and by the raising of the seas. The glaciers are deposits of ice and snow that accumulate on the ground standing, and slowly slide driven by their weight. They are found in many mountain regions, and on the edges of the glacial cap of Greenland and Antarctica. There are more than 275 thousand glaciers in the world, which cover a total area of ​​about 700 thousand square kilometers. For this reason, they are fundamental for the life of plants, animals and human beings: currently, there are almost two billion (22% of the world population) people who live downstream of a glacier or a snowfall, and depend on these as the main source of drinking water. In recent decades, however, they have started to shrink at increasing speed, due to the global warming linked to the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Often it is a temporary deposit, which returns fresh water in spring when it begins to melt the snow, and feeds the aquifers used by man such as drinking water, agriculture, industry and energy production. With continuous climb temperatures, the total mass of glaciers is destined to reduce more and more, increasing the competition for water resources. Floods, landslides, avalanches, in the future they will be increasingly common in mountain areas and in subarctic areas, exposing the populations that live there with new dangers, and difficult to predict. The number of glacial lakes, formed by erosion produced by ice and fed by their dissolution, is growing everywhere since the 90s of the last century. And with them, the danger of floods grows: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs) are defined, and a 2023 study has calculated that today there are over 15 million people who live in areas at risk, concentrated mainly between India, Pakistan, Peru and China. In parallel, it will be important to work on adaptation, monitoring and mitigation. Aspects that - write UN experts - are currently not very recognized by national policies, and which should instead be addressed also in terms of sustainable soil use and management of water resources, and with a wide involvement of local communities. Some glaciers have been subjected to annual monitoring campaigns for more than 130 years. More recently, remote monitoring technologies, even with the use of satellites, have made it possible to significantly expand the scientific mapping of glaciers. Some estimates indicate that by the end of the century Europe could suffer damage between 0.5 and 10% of its gross domestic product, with peaks exceeding 20% ​​in the most exposed coastal areas. The uniform white that distinguishes glacial landscapes hides an impressive wealth of biological forms. A study from 2015 mapped the biodiversity of ice and perennial snow for the first time, identifying 16 species of mammals (17 with ours), including herbivores such as reindeer, alci and chamois, and their predators, bears, foxes and wolves. Even invertebrates are also present with many orders in these extreme environments, such as plecoctors, little midges and worms. And this means that the disappearance of glaciers is destined to produce a clear reduction of biodiversity in cold and mountain areas, even if we talk about plant species: it is estimated that a fifth of the plants of the planet would be at risk in a world without its eternal ice.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Italy, renewables have reached 41.2% of the national needs, but the integrated national plan for energy and climate (PNIEC) places a challenging objective: to arrive by 2030 near 60%. Beyond the numerical details, the direction is clear: to advance in the transition to a more green energy basket, strategic funding, adequate political choices, international projects and initiatives, collective culture and - perhaps even before all this - technologies and innovations that allow both to optimize the efficiency of generation and storage and to exploit and manage the energy resources we have.

It is on this last point that, to put together visionary companies and ideas, more than a thousand Italian and international realities (from over 50 different states) have met in early March in Rimini for Key 2025 - The Energy Transition Expo, the fair dedicated to the future of energy that acts as a reference for Europe, Africa and the Mediterranean basin, organized by IEG (Italian Exhibition Group) and already scheduled in Rimini for the 2026 edition from 4 to March 6th.

But, if someone came up to you and said they were giving you a new electric bike for free, wouldn’t your first question be, “What’s the catch?” 🤔 It’s important to remember that the platforms offering “free” services are businesses that make money from their users to cover their expenses. If you are starting a podcast for any of the following reasons, we highly suggest understanding the pitfalls and limitations of using a free service like Spotify for Creators (formerly Anchor): You plan on turning your podcast into a business at some point. You plan on actively podcasting, gaining a fan base, and then monetizing your show to make money. But is Spotify for Creators really free, and what limitations will you run into?

On Friday (March 21), secondary ticketing marketplace StubHub filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the SEC that the company hopes will value it at $16.5 billion. A pioneer in online ticket re-selling, StubHub had “gross merchandise sales” (GMS) — or the total price customers paid for the transaction and fulfillment — of $8.7 billion in 2024, a 27% increase from 2023. Revenue reached $1.77 billion in 2024, up 29.4% from 2023, while net loss was $2.8 million. Long-term debt stands at $2.33 billion — nearly eight times last year’s adjusted EBITDA. Proceeds from the IPO will primarily go toward StubHub’s debt, with the remainder going toward general corporate purposes such as working capital, operating expenses and capital expenses. StubHub believes it is the leader in secondary ticketing, according to its S-1 filing on Friday. “We believe our value proposition, providing broadened distribution and superior pricing intelligence through an open distribution model, is well-positioned to attract more content rights holders to use our direct issuance solution,” the company stated in the filing. StubHub does more business than most of its competitors. Vivid Seats had gross transaction value (GTV) of $3.9 billion in 2024 while Eventbrite, a primary ticketing platform, had GTV of $3.2 billion last year.

More key details of the sprawling expansions coming to Disney Parks were unveiled by CEO Bob Iger himself this week, including a look at the Lion King ride for Disneyland Paris. Over at Universal Studios Hollywood, you can see a food preview of offerings inspired by One Piece, Nintendo, Star Trek, and Harry Potter that’ll be on offer at the upcoming Fan Fest Nights. “Last year we talked about our plans to turbocharge growth in this segment through strategic investments. First you’ll be able to see them make their theatrical debut in Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian and Grogu next year. However, shortly after their SXSW appearance, Imagineering announced a partnership with NVIDIA to give the Star Wars BDX droids a role in work being done in collaboration with Disney Research to expand the capabilities of the droids for more immersive participation in tech. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn’t seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” shared Kyle Laughlin, senior VP at Walt Disney Imagineering research and development. “This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before—and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can.” The tech is poised to propel Imagineering’s animatronic work into the new tech space with what they’re calling Newton, which is “an open-source physics engine that lets robots learn how to handle complex tasks with greater precision.” This is making our Sarah Connor “robots bad!” senses tingle so we hope there’s a sentience kill switch for fear of adorable Star Wars x Marvel Ultrons running amok. Or you know, if Walt Disney’s animatronic hacks into the tech, we think things might get a little crazy especially if it discovers what horror creators are doing with public domain bastardizations of his Mouse House IP. Candy-dipped “poison” apples are coming to Disney Parks just in time for the film’s release! The apple picking style lunchbox and character thermos are an excellent combo; they’re available for purchase at Drafthouse locations near you. AMC has collector’s popcorn buckets, awesome travel tumblers, and more: We got to try a few of the items seen above that will be available at Fan Fest Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood and they’re a fantastic combo of tasty and franchise authentic.

WhatsApp is currently working on introducing a feature to share motion photos in chats, groups, and channels, for a future update of the app. This feature is under development, so it's not ready for beta testers. However, it's possible to discover a preview in this article. WhatsApp is working on a feature to initiate call-like sessions with the Meta AI chatbot! WABetaInfo Channel Stay updated with the latest news by following our channel on WhatsApp and receiving push notifications with image preview! In the article about the WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.24.9 update, we announced that a new gallery interface for sending photo and video albums was available. Additionally, WhatsApp has enhanced the way shared media appears in chat by automatically grouping media items into an album within a single message bubble, even when fewer than four items are included. It seems that WhatsApp is developing additional sharing tools, primarily focused on enhancing the photo-sharing experience further. Thanks to the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.25.8.12 update, which is available on the Google Play Store, we discovered that WhatsApp is working on a feature to share motion photos in chats, groups, and channels! As you can see from the attached screenshot, WhatsApp is exploring the implementation of a feature that will allow users to share motion photos, scheduled for release in a future update. Unlike traditional images, motion photos include a few seconds of video and audio, providing an immersive way to capture memories. This feature is particularly popular on certain mobile devices, as it bridges the gap between photos and videos by adding a touch of animation to snapshots. Apple also offers a similar feature called Live Photos on iPhones, which captures a few seconds of video along with each still photo, and its support is already available on WhatsApp for iOS. These motion photos are often saved in specialized formats that combine static images with short video clips, allowing users to relive moments with a single tap. While the motion photo-sharing feature is still in development, it is expected to be compatible with both individual and group chats, as well as channels. This means users will be able to share motion photos with friends, family, and followers without losing the dynamic essence of their captured moments. Additionally, recipients will automatically view the motion photo in its animated form, even if the feature is not supported on their device. For iOS users, these motion photos will likely appear as Live Photos, allowing them to enjoy the full effect of the captured movement and sound, just as they would with any other Live Photo on their device. A feature to share motion photos in chats, groups, and channels is under development and it will be available in a future update. Please, let us know on X: we love hearing your feedback! In addition, we have set up a Discord Server where you can chat with other people, get help and advice, and stay up to date with the latest announcements from WABetaInfo.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This years iPhone 17 models will utilize TSMC’s third generation 3nm process, N3P. While newer generation chip architectures are able to yield performance and efficiency enhancements, you generally notice the biggest jumps with new process nodes. Apple begun to adopt 3nm chip technology in 2023 with the A17 Pro and M3 chips. Leaping to 2nm next year will mark the beginning of a new three-year chip cycle, as per usual. TSMC states that 2nm chips should lead to a roughly 15% performance boost while consuming the same level of power. Kuo also notes that TSMC’s trial production for 2nm chips reached 60-70% yields three months ago, and they’re now “well above that.” It’s unclear whether or not 2026’s M6 chip family for Macs will adopt 2nm chip technology, but hopefully that’ll end up being the case.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan entered this year facing a knot of political problems with little precedent in his two decades at the summit of power in Turkey.

Voters were angry about persistently high inflation. His political party’s popularity had sunk. And his opponents had coalesced around the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, who made it clear that he was gunning for the presidency.

Then on Wednesday, just four days before the mayor was set to be designated as the political opposition’s presidential candidate, dozens of policemen arrested him at his home on accusations of corruption and terrorism.

Mr. Erdogan’s foes consider the arrest a ploy to abort Mr. Imamoglu’s presidential campaign before it begins.

Norwegian Robotics Company 1x is capitalizing on this, announcing that it will test its humanoid robot, neo gamma, in “a few hundred to a few thousand” homes by the end of the year. Wayve Rides the Wave: Way, which launched in 2017 and has raised more than $ 1.3 billion over the past couple years, plans to license its self-driving software to automotive and fleet partners, such as Uber.

Instead of a direct successor, Kelleher’s role will be split between two executives. Naga Chandrasekaran will oversee front-end process engineering, while Navid Shahriari takes charge of advanced packaging and testing operations. Tan, addressing Intel employees, openly acknowledged these challenges, stating: “We have a chance to do something special together. In many ways, we are the founders of ‘The New Intel.’ We will learn from past mistakes, use setbacks to strengthen our resolve, and choose action over distraction to reach our full potential.” Central to Tan’s strategy is expanding Intel Foundry Services beyond internal clients. Recent reports confirm that major industry players Nvidia and Broadcom are currently testing Intel’s 18A manufacturing technology, a development that has boosted investor confidence, reflected by an 8% rise in Intel’s stock value. Early speculation about a joint manufacturing venture involving TSMC and Nvidia has been clarified. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang explicitly stated that Nvidia has not been invited to participate in such discussions, diminishing expectations of an imminent joint venture with TSMC. Intel’s strategic shift coincides with setbacks in its ambitious U.S. manufacturing plans. Despite receiving a $7.86 billion CHIPS Act subsidy, Intel’s planned Ohio chip factory has been delayed until 2030, casting doubt on Intel’s commitment to reclaiming domestic semiconductor leadership. Alongside manufacturing changes, CEO Tan is refocusing Intel’s product roadmap on artificial intelligence. Intel’s 18A manufacturing process, currently undergoing initial wafer runs in its Arizona facility, incorporates two major innovations: RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery technology. Nevertheless, analysts caution that real-world performance consistency remains critical for validating Intel’s ambitious plans. The execution of the 18A process node, closely watched by industry observers, will serve as a major test of CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s vision and Intel’s broader ability to regain its manufacturing prominence.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Index serves quarterly updates on the fastest-growing projects in terms of GitHub “stars” — a metric that’s something akin to a “like” on social media. This year it’s a similar story, with AI central to 11 of the top 20 companies. It’s worth noting that the ROSS Index is heavily curated and doesn’t include any old open source project. Additionally, these companies must be younger than 10 years old; raised less than $100 million in funding; and be entirely independent — so not a subsidiary or publicly listed. In top spot on the 2024 ROSS Index is Ollama, a Y Combinator alum that’s built an open source tool for running LLMs such as Meta’s Llama and DeepSeek locally (i.e., desktop). Ollama’s GitHub star count increased by some 76,000 through 2024, growing 261% to more than 105,000 (it has since risen to more than 135,000 stars over the past few months). In third place is LangGenius, the company behind an open source LLM app development platform called Dify. The project attained more than 43,000 new GitHub stars last year, growing 326% from around 13,000 to nearly 57,000 — a figure that has since surged to more than 84,000 stars. The project’s GitHub star count grew 195% to 61,900 stars last year. Open source software by its very nature has always been distributed, given that contributors from all corners of the globe can get involved. This is often the case for vendor-led projects, too; however, commercial entities usually have some center of gravity — even if it just means where it has been formally incorporated. The ROSS Index for last year shows that San Francisco is home to six of the top 20 ROSS startups, while Canada has three, and Europe (U.K., Switzerland, Hungary, and Czech Republic), Singapore, and China constituting the rest. There are other ways of tracking “hot” open source projects. And GitHub itself offers a top-trending project list, again without the specific focus on commercial businesses. GitHub “stars” can be an imperfect metric, as it merely shows that someone has “liked” the project, as opposed to actively using or monitoring it. Older projects will naturally have procured more “stars,” too, which is why Runa focuses on the relative growth of repositories over a 90-day period for its quarterly reports, and on the absolute number of new stars gained during the year for its annual report. This also means that the annual report can look quite different to the quarterly reports, given that absolute star counts won’t always align with rapid relative-growth patterns. There may also be some issues around what is classed as “open source.” While many of the projects on the list have indeed been released under a recognized copyleft or permissive open source license, this isn’t a strict stipulation of the ROSS Index. As such, a company that has released its software under the Server Side Public License (SSPL), for instance, would still qualify as open source, even though the Open Source Initiative has not rubberstamped the SSPL as “open source.” Still, the Index is a useful indicator not only of what kinds of open source technology is trending, but also what companies are trying to build businesses atop them.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Brief

Charlie Javice’s high-profile fraud trial has become a showcase of embarrassing missteps on both sides, with eyebrow-raising details about how JPMorgan Chase was allegedly deceived into buying her startup, Frank, for $175 million when it had just 300,000 customers instead of four million.

Per a new WSJ article, one pivotal moment came when former Frank engineer Patrick Vovor testified that he refused Javice’s request to create fake user data just one week before the sale, recalling she said to him: “Don’t worry. I don’t want to end up in an orange jumpsuit.” When Vovor declined, Javice allegedly turned to a math professor to generate synthetic user data, which was then submitted to JPMorgan. (In court, Javice’s legal team painted Vovor as a scorned suitor.)

In addition to JPMorgan’s failure to properly vet Frank’s user base, other uncomfortable details have been surfaced, including that Leslie Wims Morris, who led the deal at JPMorgan, reportedly sent a note to her team, underlining segments from CEO Jamie Dimon’s annual letter to investors in 2021 and adding that sometimes “there’s no need to do analysis at all.”

Javice’s attorneys said in court that it’s evidence JPMorgan didn’t think it needed to check its work, but Morris testified that it was tongue-in-cheek and written as “a joke to my team.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.jp/article/ai-safety-institute-new-directive-america-first/'>Trump administration instructs researchers to reduce "ideological bias" in AI models</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 00:00:00 <p>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued new instructions to scientists working together with the American Institute of Artificial Intelligence Safety (AISI). The instructions remove the previously asked references of AI safety, responsible AI, and AI fairness, which researchers have asked to prioritize, instead asking for priority to "reduce ideological bias in order to thrive and increase economic competitiveness." This notification was presented in early March as part of the Joint Research and Development Agreement (updated version) sent to consortium members working in conjunction with AISI. This means that interest in misinformation and deepfake tracing has faded. Researchers from the organization that collaborates with AISI said. The researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, points out that overlooking these issues could harm the public. This is because algorithms that encourage discrimination through income and other attributes can be left unchecked. Another researcher who has worked with AISI in the past says, "It's out of control." Elon Musk, who is now leading the controversial efforts to reduce government spending and bureaucracy on behalf of President Trump, criticizes the AI ​​model that OpenAI and Google have built. Masks often cite examples of Google's AI chatbot responses. However, this expected question itself is an unlikely scenario. As reported by WIRED, researchers who are advisors at xAI have recently developed new technologies that allow for changes to the political trends of large-scale language models (LLMs). An increasing number of research shows that political bias in the AI ​​model could affect both liberals and conservatives. For example, a study on Twitter's recommended algorithms published in 2021 showed that right-wing news is more likely to be exposed to users more.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/kuo-a20-chip-2nm/'>Kuo: iPhone 18 Models Will Feature 2nm Chips</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 00:00:00 <p>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today reiterated that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. Kuo said TSMC's trial production of 2nm chips has now reached yields well above the 60-70% range. The yield refers to the percentage of functional chips that can be obtained per silicon wafer, which is essentially a large, circular disc of chips. Kuo first said that the A20 chip would be 2nm around six months ago, and another analyst Jeff Pu said likewise earlier this week. An earlier rumor saying the A20 chip would remain 3nm was retracted. This is ultimately good news, as the A20 chip being 2nm instead of 3nm means it will have more substantial performance and power efficiency improvements over the A19 chip for iPhone 17 models. Kuo, Pu, and others have all said that the A19 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, called N3P. The move from a 3nm to 2nm process allows for more transistors in each chip, which helps to boost performance. Specifically, reports indicate that A20 chips should be up to 15% faster and up to 30% more power efficient than A19 chips. Keep in mind that these nanometer sizes are simply TSMC marketing terms, rather than actual measurements.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
