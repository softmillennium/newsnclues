                <p>Ultimate online freedom is when you can go online and enjoy content uninterruptedly. Do you want to unblock restricted sites? Or do you, perhaps, want to stream sports events and avoid specky ISP surveillance?

Private Internet Access is your gateway to online freedom, privacy, and security. It even comes with an exclusive 82% discount for the biennial plan.

You can protect all devices with one subscription. Thanks to unlimited concurrent connections, Private Internet Access is an ideal VPN for iPhone, Android, macOS, Windows, and other devices at the same time.

Private Internet Access has a powerful bank-grade encryption and non-intrusive logging policy. It keeps no private data on its servers, enabling you to use the internet safely and anonymously.

A key perk of PIA is the server fleet — you can access over 30,000 servers in 91 countries. With so many IP addresses to choose from, you can effectively unblock anything you want and conceal your identity.

This plan includes 2 free months and now costs a meager $2.19/mo.</p></b>

                <p>Prepare yourselves, My Hero Academia watchers: the final season will kick off sometime in October.

During this weekend’s AnimeJapan in Tokyo, Toho released a small teaser announcing the release month for season eight. In it, the series’ respective main hero and villain, Deku and Tomura Shigaraki, have split narration on their goals and whose story this has been all along. Deku and the rest of Japan’s hero community have been at war against Shigaraki, All for One, and the other villains under their command, and last season ended with big shakeups on both sides, with several key players in the war either dead or out of commission.

The My Hero Academia manga ended in 2024 after 430 chapters and an epilogue that December. Creator Kohei Horikoshi hasn’t said anything about his next project since putting a bow on the superhero series, but he has drawn plenty of great art for its characters in the past year.

Before the main anime ends, fans can get their fix in the upcoming spinoff, Vigilantes. That show, set five years before Deku’s story, focuses on non-licensed heroes saving their city and crossing paths with young versions of supporting characters like Mirko and Eraserhead. It’s set to premiere April 7, so you definitely won’t be short on My Hero material throughout 2025.</p></b>

                <p>Looking for free channels to live stream the F1 Chinese Grand Prix?

Luckily, you don’t have to spend a cent to watch the F1 Chinese Grand Prix online. You can catch the free stream on ServusTV (from Austria) or SRF (from Switzerland).

Both channels are 100% free and don’t even require an account to work. While they’re not in English, at least, you’ll be able to catch up with the event in Full HD.

Date and schedule of the race March 23 3:00 am EST / 12:00 am PT / 07:00 am GMT / 08:00 am CET

ServusTV and SRF are licensed to broadcast within their respective countries. This means being outside Austria or Switzerland will produce an error message.

Here’s what happens when you try to watch Servus TV:

The goal is to, therefore, claim an IP address from one of these countries and watch the F1 Chinese GP on a free channel.

People online frequently mention NordVPN as their choice.

This VPN has hundreds of servers in Austria and Switzerland. It also comes with unlimited bandwidth for streaming, excellent speeds, and apps for all devices.

                <p>Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple, is investing $1 billion in a commercial space station project called "Haven-1" through his company Vast Space.

 

The construction of Haven-1 has already started this year, and it will have 1,600 cubic feet of habitable space. McCaleb aims to secure a lucrative contract from NASA to replace the aging International Space Station.

McCaleb has little experience in the aerospace sector but is willing to risk $1 billion if Vast Space fails to secure the NASA contract. His goal is to expand the human race into a multi-planetary species, similar to centibillionaire Elon Musk's vision.

NASA is partnering with private firms to launch its replacement for the International Space Station, which is scheduled to retire in 2030 after approximately 30 years of research. To launch Haven-1, Vast Space is teaming up with SpaceX to use its Falcon9 rockets.

Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen expressed support for McCaleb's aerospace plan, calling it a "big, bold vision."</p></b>

                <p>New York University's website fell victim to an apparent hack on Saturday morning.

The homepage was defaced, displaying racial slurs and graphs showing test scores of students broken down by race.


The hacker, who identifies themselves as "@bestn*ggy" on X, claimed that the data revealed NYU continued to use racial affirmative action in college admissions despite a ruling making it illegal. 

They hijacked the university's homepage and displayed the message, "On June 29 2023, racial affirmative action in college admissions was ruled illegal. Computer N*ggy Exploitation (CNE) reveals NYU continued anyway."


The hacker also published links to mirrors of the supposed data they gained access to, identifying it as "raw data" from NYU's own data warehouse with personally identifiable information redacted.


On X, the hacker claimed responsibility for a breach of the University of Minnesota in 2023 that exposed millions of social security numbers.</p></b>

                <p>Matt Owens, co-showrunner and executive producer for seasons one and two of Netflix’s One Piece, has revealed he’s stepping away from the show.

Owens explained on Instagram that working on the live-action One Piece over the last six years has been a "life-changing journey" but also "a lot." He's stepping off the show to take a break and focus on his mental health.

The first season was co-showrun by Steven Maeda and Owens, while Joe Tracz became the new co-showrunner and executive producer in April 2024. Tracz will guide season two’s post-production.

Owens' exit will not affect the show's chances of being renewed for a third season. He has also co-written at least one episode for season two.

One Piece wrapped production on season two last month, but no release window has been announced yet.</p></b>

                <p>Apple is preparing to debut its next-generation chipsets, the A19 and A19 Pro.

The chips will be manufactured using TSMC’s third-generation 3nm process N3P.

A fresh leak reveals Apple’s plan for the 2026 iPhone models’ chip — A20 and A20 Pro. If the leak is true, both chips could be manufactured using TSMC’s third-generation 2nm process.

iPhone 18 chipset details emerge

The launch of the iPhone 18 lineup is still a year and a half away, but we are already getting leaks. Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC’s 2nm process.

TSMC’s 2nm chips have achieved yield rates above the 60-70% range during trial production, meaning the chip is now ready for mass production.

Multiple analysts, including Jeff Pu, have already confirmed that TSMC will indeed manufacture A20 chips using its 3nm process.</p></b>

                <p>Cloudflare has announced AI Labyrinth, a tool to fight web-crawling bots that scrape sites for AI training data without permission.

Websites have long used the honor system approach of robots.txt, but this has been ignored by some AI companies, leading to over 50 billion web crawler requests per day.

Rather than blocking bots, AI Labyrinth fights back by making them process data that has nothing to do with a given website's actual data.

The company says it also functions as "a next-generation honeypot," drawing in AI crawlers that keep following links to fake pages deeper.

Website administrators can opt into using AI Labyrinth by navigating to the Bot Management section of their site's Cloudflare dashboard and toggling it on.

Cloudflare says this is only the first iteration of using generative AI to thwart bots, with plans to create "whole networks of linked URLs" that bots will have a hard time identifying as fake.</p></b>

                <p>The PlayStation 2 is one of the most important game consoles, as it was where the current triple-A landscape was born.

Third-party giants like Resident Evil and Monster Hunter took shape here, and the console's first-party lineup made its creators into A-tier names. 

Look no further than the original God of War, which just turned 20 years old. Sony Santa Monica's hack-and-slash title was pretty impressive back in the day, helped by an alluring demo that dropped players into the action right away and showed them what it was all about: slinging blades, killing everything in sight, and finishing off mythological creatures in increasingly gruesome ways.

So players fell in love with God of War, and thus a franchise was born. Sony Santa Monica has led the charge on mainline installments like God of War III—which turned 15 earlier in March—or the more recent Norse duology, while the late Ready at Dawn made spinoffs like Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta.

Despite a generally consistent quality, it eventually felt like the two studios were trying to milk the franchise for all it was worth. By the time 2013's Ascension rolled around, Kratos didn't seem to have any more gas in the tank, despite III's ending indicating he could (and would) come back to kill again.

And come back he did with 2018's God of War, a soft reboot that saw Kratos with a son, a wicked axe, and a new pantheon to brutalize. Given everything Kratos did and killed during those earlier games—it couldn't help be a strange ask to buy into him not just having another kid, but wanting better for the young Atreus during their trek through Midgard.

The series has always painted Kratos as a force of nature whose presence inevitably devastates everything around him. For as much time PlayStation's first-party lineup has devoted to cinematic greatness, this particular series achieves that feat more often (and with more fun) than most.

With a TV adaptation in the works and other mythologies clearly up for grabs, God of War certainly isn't lacking for a future.</p></b>

                <p>Demonstrators have taken to the streets and social media to protest the arrest of Turkey's President Tayyip Erdoğan's primary political rival.

According to Politico, some accounts that speak out against the government have been suspended on X, a platform previously acquired by Elon Musk.


Per Politico’s reporting, “university-associated activist accounts” that share protest information including times and locations for students and other activists who might want to participate have been the primary targets of the suspensions. Most of the accounts are described as “grassroots activists” with relatively small followings, typically in the tens of thousands.


In some cases, it seems those accounts have been suspended in Turkey—where their information is most relevant—and not in the rest of the world. One activist, Ömer Faruk Aslan, created a second account to dodge the local censorship, and claimed that his primary account got suspended after one of his posts exceeded six million views on the platform.


Turkey’s ruling government, led by Erdoğan—has claimed that suspended accounts are associated with “inciting hatred.” (It’s worth noting that the public demonstrations against the Erdoğan have taken place the government issuing a multi-day ban on protests.) Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya claimed authorities have identified 326 accounts for takedown, including 72 that are believed to be operated outside of Turkey.</p></b>

                <p>Following the arrest of the primary political rival of Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdoğan, demonstrators have taken to the streets and to social media to protest the seemingly politically motivated action.

According to Politico, some of those who have taken to speaking out against the government have been suspended on X.

University-associated activist accounts that share protest information have been the primary targets of the suspensions.

Most of the accounts are described as “grassroots activists” with relatively small followings, typically in the tens of thousands.

In some cases, it seems those accounts have been suspended in Turkey—where their information is most relevant—and not in the rest of the world.

One activist, Ömer Faruk Aslan, created a second account to dodge the local censorship, and claimed that his primary account got suspended after one of his posts exceeded six million views on the platform.

Turkey’s ruling government has claimed that suspended accounts are associated with “inciting hatred.”

The government claims authorities have identified 326 accounts for takedown, including 72 that are believed to be operated outside of Turkey.

54 “suspects” have been arrested for their activity on social media.

Turkey’s crackdown on activists is not necessarily on Musk or X (though we don’t know if the company surrendered any user data to the government).

Back in 2023, Erdoğan threatened to throttle X if the company didn’t comply with government requests to take down posts and accounts that it wanted removed.

Musk and X acquiesced, with Musk reasoning, “The choice is have Twitter throttled in its entirety or limit access to some tweets. Which one do you want?”

Additionally, X has complied with 86% of Turkey’s government requests to take down content in the second half of 2024, per the company’s transparency report.

The math isn’t too hard for Erdoğan. Ask and you will likely receive.</p></b>

                <p>Since the 16-pin connector was introduced and later revised, melting adapters and PSU/GPU-side connectors on some of Nvidia's mainstream GeForce gaming GPUs have been rampant.

Two of MSI's recently launched high-wattage PSUs feature two 12V-2x6 connectors while providing only one standard 8-pin connector via OC3D.

The industry made the shift towards 16-pin connectors to reduce cable clutter and meet the ever-increasing power demand of new GPUs. 

Reports of melting RTX 50-series GPU connectors and adapters have been making rounds on the internet, even with the improved standard. This time, it is believed Nvidia's power delivery design might be partially responsible.

MSI's MPG A1000GS and MPG A1250GS power supplies include two native 16-pin connectors and only a single 8-pin (6+2) connector. If you buy an additional 6+2 connector separately, you can only use a single 8-pin for the CPU.

Theoretically, a 225W TGP GPU or lower, like the Intel Arc B580, can easily be powered by one 8-pin connector. However, AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series cannot, as these GPUs typically require two or three 8-pin connectors.

Nvidia recommends a 1,000W (minimum) PSU for the RTX 5090. This raises concerns about the MPG A1000GS, which is borderline on recommended specs yet ships with two 12V-2x6 connectors.

All things considered, equipping PSUs with multiple 16-pin connectors is counterintuitive for most consumers, especially given the standard's original goal to simplify cabling.</p></b>

                <p>Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb is investing his estimated $3.2 billion fortune into Vast Space, a California-based aerospace company he founded in 2021.

 
That's entirely self-funded, aiming to replace the International Space Station, which is scheduled for decommissioning in 2030. McCaleb's goal is to build and launch a functioning station.

 
Vast develops artificial gravity space stations that simulate gravity by rotating to create centrifugal force while offering comforts of home. The company recently revealed the final design for Haven-1, its first station module.

 
Haven-1 will be launched into orbit using SpaceX Falcon9 rockets in May 2026, with a two-week mission above the Earth. The concept of artificial gravity stations has long been a staple in science fiction.

 
Vast is also developing a modular system called Haven-2, which can be connected to form a larger, expandable station. Public-sector space agencies are increasingly turning to private companies like Vast for resources and expertise.

 
A growing number of private citizens, including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos, are investing in space exploration. Companies like Axiom Space, Blue Origin, Voyager Space, Airbus, and China's CNSA are racing to build the next generation of space stations.

 
Vast is working with NASA to secure a contract for its space station, which would be essential for the company's long-term viability.</p></b>

                <p>Netflix revealed more information about its upcoming anime offerings at AnimeJapan.

Devil May Cry, an adaptation of the hit Capcom franchise, premieres in a few weeks. The show's Japanese dub features Toshiyuki Morikawa as Dante, Fumiko Orikasa as Lady, and Hiroaki Hirata as Vergil, the same actors from the games. A new clip was released ahead of its April 3 premiere.

Sakamoto Days started airing in January, with its second half set to begin in July. The show will introduce Gaku, a key member of X's organization voiced by Koki Uchiyama in the Japanese dub.

Moonrise is set for release on April 10, developed by WIT Studio and featuring designs by Hiromu Arakawa from Fullmetal Alchemist. The story follows Jacob Shadow as he joins Earth's army to scout the Moon and bring down the resistance leader.

The Summer Hikaru Died is an anime based on Mokumokuren's horror manga of the same name. It focuses on high schooler Yoshiki, who feels there's something off about his friend Hikaru after he went missing six months ago.

One Piece will air its second part of the Egghead arc starting April 12, with new episodes airing weekly going forward.</p></b>

                <p>The Chinese technology giant has launched a new model, T1, which leverages large-scale reinforcement learning.

 
The model scored 87.2 points on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Pro benchmark, surpassing DeepSeek-R1's 84 points but trailing OpenAI's o1 with 89.3 points.

T1 has also achieved high scores in other benchmarks, including 78.2 in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2024, slightly behind R1's 79.8 and o1's 79.2.

 
In terms of Chinese language capabilities, T1 excelled with 91.8 points in the C-Eval suite evaluation, the same score as R1 and better than o1's 87.8.


T1 rivals DeepSeek on pricing, charging 1 yuan per 1 million tokens of input, while output costs 4 yuan per million tokens.

The Chinese tech giant claims to be the first in the industry to adopt a hybrid architecture combining Google’s Transformer and Mamba.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Infinity Nikki and Assassin’s Creed Shadows have become my twin obsessions for their meticulously detailed environments, textures, and weather.

With open-world dress-up game Infinity Nikki, I continue to be agog at how clothing textures are rendered with such detail and fidelity that by mere sight, I know exactly what a piece of fabric will feel like. 

For Assassin’s Creed Shadows, an action-packed romp through feudal Japan, I’m constantly in a state of awe at the natural beauty of the Japanese countryside, a feature that has been widely celebrated since its release.

Both games are so visually arresting they made me fall in love with a video game staple that I’ve never really cared about before: photo mode. 

Photo mode, which typically pauses the game to give players the ability to take professional-grade images of their video games, is a modern gaming feature that’s been around long enough to become a standard inclusion.

I’ve played no shortage of games so interesting their moments demand to be captured and shared but that compulsion is on another level with Infinity Nikki and Assassin’s Creed. 

So, starting with the dress-up game, I opened photo mode, started fiddling around with apertures and vignettes and was genuinely surprised with the results.

The photos looked good! The photos weren’t Vogue quality, but they started to resemble the pictures that get upvoted to the moon on the Infinity Nikki subreddit. 

I took that success with Infinity Nikki and translated it to Assassin’s Creed.

I’m actually glad the game doesn’t have the feature from the last Assassin’s Creed where your horse automatically follows the road. 

Without it, I am forced to take in the game’s impressive weather and foliage as I drive ole’ Kikai around rather than looking at my phone after setting him on auto-pilot.

That’s how I found my first picture. I was roaming around as Yasuke and I rode by a long road flanked by Japanese maples in full, deep-red autumn foliage. 

I saw that entirely fake scenery made of pixels and code and immediately opened up photo mode as though I was capturing real natural phenomena.

I placed the camera behind him and zoomed out to see as much foliage as I could fit into the shot, while still keeping Yasuke as the focus of the picture. 

I then tinkered with the lighting to brighten the leaves and the saturation so their colors would pop. 

Putting the photo modes in Nikki and Shadows through their paces, I’ve discovered game photography is now something I can really, earnestly do, and want to do more of.

I hope to get better at it so I can one day take those skills from capturing video games to capturing real life.</p></b>

                <p>My new favorite external battery is the one with *two* hideaway cables.

I bought my wife the $110 Anker A1695 “InstaCord” and experienced instant jealousy; and not just because of its retractable cord. It’s the second cable that blew my mind, hidden inside its strong carry handle, plus the fact both are bidirectional. Either can charge the battery, either can charge my laptop; I get passthrough power if I use both! My colleague Richard wasn’t as lucky, saying his battery seems to throttle prematurely, but my wife’s stays cool so far.</p></b>

                <p>A man in Oregon filed a lawsuit against Wild Coast Pet Food after his cat died from bird flu.

The suit alleges the company misled consumers when it sold raw chicken cat food as healthy, failing to acknowledge potential risks, such as death from consuming H5N1-infected food.

The lawsuit seeks just under $8,000 in damages which covers compensation for veterinarian bills and legal fees.

Hanson adopted his cat Kira in 2021 and feeds his cats raw food like the chicken that killed his cat because “I believe in the health benefits of it.”

He bought the Wild Coast Pet Foods brand cat food in January but one day in early February Kira stopped eating.

Hanson brought her to the vet on Feb. 5 and a few days later tests confirmed Kira had bird flu.

Kira was so sick she had to be euthanized on Feb. 9.

Wild Coast, which is based in Washington, issued a recall on March 1 for its 16 oz and 24 oz frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats.

The food was sold in Washington and Oregon.

People who fed pets the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu in their pets, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness.

The spread of bird flu has been devastating for many cat owners, as they seem to be the most susceptible among domestic animals outside birds to H5N1.

Many cats from New York to Oregon have been documented to have died from the disease and there are likely many more deaths that are going undetected.</p></b>

                <p>Information on Zach Cregger’s Resident Evil reboot has been slowly trickling out in recent months, and now we may have our first casting.

Per the Hollywood Reporter, actor Austin Abrams is looking like a potential frontrunner for the upcoming film. Last seen in 2024’s Wolfs and Penelope, Abrams has already worked with Cregger on Weapons, which is due out in August. At the moment, it’s unclear who Abrams is playing, but given his youthful look, might he be Leon S. Kennedy, one of the series’ main characters? Leon’s popped up in the previous live-action films—played by Johann Urb in Resident Evil: Retribution, and Avan Jogia in Welcome to Raccoon City—but as a supporting player to others like Alice or the Redfields.

Sources speaking to THR claim Cregger’s take will feature elements of a “wilderness survival thriller,” while still being very much a horror film. The main selling point of this new Resident Evil movie is that it will hew closer to the original games, so whatever that entails, Abrams and whoever he plays will be at the center of it. We’ll find out more about Resident Evil and its cast ahead of its release on September 18, 2026.</p></b>

                <p>A report by the New York Times claims that Bryan Johnson's "Longevity Mix" has caused unwanted side effects in some users.

 

The supplement, sold by Johnson's company Blueprint, was intended to help users stay healthy and live longer, but many users reported feeling like they were going to vomit after taking it. According to internal documents, about 60 percent of participants in a study conducted by Blueprint experienced at least one side effect.


The study found that users saw their testosterone levels drop and became prediabetic after following Johnson's diet plan. One employee wrote that the Longevity Mix was causing nausea, bloating, heartburn, and vomiting in some users.


Bryan Johnson has been using confidentiality agreements to control his image and the companies he built, with employees, sexual partners, vendors, and contract workers required to sign them.


Three former employees have filed National Labor Relations Board complaints against Johnson, accusing him of forcing them to sign overbroad confidentiality agreements that break federal laws.</p></b>

                <p>Amazon has flagged Microsoft's Surface Laptop 7 as a "frequently returned item," cautioning potential buyers to check customer reviews before purchasing.

The label suggests that the device has a higher return rate than similar products, though Amazon does not specify the reasons behind it.

One likely factor is the laptop’s use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X platform, which relies on Arm-based architecture instead of the traditional x86 processors from Intel and AMD.

Many Windows applications are still optimized for x86 processors, meaning they must rely on software emulation to run on Arm.

Although Microsoft has improved emulation with Windows on Arm, specific older applications, professional software, and games may still suffer from reduced performance or fail to run altogether.

This limitation has been a common criticism of Windows devices powered by Arm chips.

The Surface Laptop 7 has a 4.2-star rating on Amazon from over 360 reviews, but 12% of those reviews are one-star.

Complaints about software compatibility, performance inconsistencies, and general usability appear to be recurring issues in these negative reviews.

These concerns may explain why the device has received the "frequently returned" warning.

Microsoft is expected to address some of these concerns by offering Intel-powered versions of the Surface Laptop.</p></b>

                <p>The Game Developers Conference has wrapped up in San Francisco, showcasing thousands of game developers.

Here are a few of our favorites from the unreleased indie games we got to check out. Dreams of Another is a shooter where you use your gun to create the world around you instead of destroying it. The game's graphics have a dreamy, deconstructed quality to them, and when you shoot things, the colorful, unfocused scenes you see will solidify into things like buildings and people.

Faraway is a game where you play as a shooting star trying to make constellations by pressing and holding one button to spin around other stars. The game requires just a simple concept, but I was impressed by it immediately. In just a 10-minute demo, I was really starting to get the hang of using my shooting star's momentum to perfectly swing around a star.

Haste: Broken Worlds is like a 3D version of the classic mobile game Tiny Wings, where you play as Zoe and run forward at blinding speed through procedurally generated levels. You can launch from rolling hills for added height, and if you time your fall right into the curve of another hill, you'll get a satisfying "perfect" message.

Herdling tasks you with herding mysterious, fluffy beasts out of a city to wilder pastures using a magic stick. The animals generally follow your directions but are sometimes difficult to direct. I really started to care for my fluffy friends by the end of the demo.

Hotel Barcelona is a challenging and roguelike game set in a world inspired by slasher movies, developed by Goichi "Suda51" Suda and Hidetaka "Swery65" Suehiro. The game features twitchy action that felt very satisfying once I got the hang of the controls. 

My Arms Are Longer Now is a slapstick comedy game where you control an unseemly long and stretchy arm, attempting to do things mostly illegally while remaining undetected. 

To a T is a delightful game about a teenager permanently stuck in a T pose, from Katamari series creator Keita Takahashi. The demo featured an elaborate tooth-brushing sequence, musical numbers, and a talking giraffe.</p></b>

                <p>The Dyson V8 Plus is designed to make cleaning effortless and enjoyable.

Dyson’s strong vacuums are designed to complete tasks in the quickest and simplest manner possible. If you’d prefer a rechargeable cordless vacuum that offers power, convenience, and affordability, the Dyson V8 Plus is a great choice.

The Dyson V8 Plus has an ideal mix of suction, battery life, and ease of use, making it one of the best in the range offered by the company. While more recent products like the V10 and V15 bring more enhanced features, the V8 Plus continues to prove its mettle for those looking for higher performance at a reasonable cost.

The vacuum offers 40 minutes of fade-free suction on a single charge, allowing you to vacuum multiple rooms without breaks. It also has a dual-mode feature that lets you switch between standard mode for everyday vacuuming and MAX mode for extra power when faced with stubborn dirt.


One of its features is the Motorbar cleaner head, which automatically adapts to different types of floor covering while always staying clear of hair tangling. This makes it an excellent choice for pet owners or anyone with long hair.

The V8 Plus also comes with a set of accessories to aid in boosting your cleaning capabilities. The hair screw tool, in particular, is wonderful at removing pet hair from bedding and upholstery, and four Dyson-designed attachments allow you to access high shelves and tight crevices.</p></b>

                <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have created a "breakthrough" solid-state deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser emitting coherent 193-nm light used for semiconductor photolithography in a lab, reports the International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE).

Traditional DUV lithography machines by ASML, Canon, and Nikon generate 193-nm light using an argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser. The laser chamber contains a gas mixture of argon and fluorine and a buffer gas like neon. When high-voltage electrical pulses are applied, the argon and fluorine atoms become excited and briefly form an unstable molecule called ArF (or excimer), which quickly returns to its ground state, releasing a photon with a wavelength of 193 nm.

The CAS approach

The test device developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences generates 193 nm light using a fully solid-state approach, avoiding gas-based excimer lasers entirely. It begins with a homemade Yb:YAG crystal amplifier, which produces a 1030-nm laser beam. This beam is then split into two optical paths, each undergoing a different optical process to create the components needed for 193-nm generation.

In the first path, the 1030-nm beam is converted into a 258-nm beam through fourth-harmonic generation (FHG). This part delivers an output power of 1.2 W. In the second path, the other half of the 1030-nm beam is used to pump an optical parametric amplifier, resulting in a 1553-nm beam with a power of 700 mW.

These two beams — 258 nm and 1553 nm — are combined in cascaded lithium triborate (LBO) crystals to generate a coherent light with a 193 nm wavelength. The test system has a linewidth narrower than 880 MHz, a performance comparable in spectral purity to that of commercial systems used today.</p></b>

                <p>Following recent years of overcrowding, this summer might be a good time to visit your favorite national park.

Tourist reservations at key hot spots around the United States have reportedly fallen off amid turmoil in the National Park Service, which was recently hit by DOGE-fueled layoffs of more than 1,000 staff. The cuts have been temporarily rolled back following legal challenges, but uncertainty remains.

Business Insider spoke with park advocates and business owners around the country, and the conclusion is that the public is taking a wait-and-see approach to the upcoming summer season. One hotelier near Yosemite told the website that his three resorts are down 1,000 bookings over last year.

On the east coast, near the Cape Cod National Seashore, hotel reservations are reportedly down approximately 5% for the peak season. The typical booking season runs from January through March.

It is possible some of this has to do with broader economic uncertainty, but Business Insider identified other more direct reasons.

One of the biggest concerns cited that could be keeping people away is the NPS’s decision to suspend its reservation system, which required visitors to book a set time and day they could visit the park. “Knowing whether there would be a reservation system or not has made it difficult for people to plan trips — why book a hotel room when you can’t be certain you’ll even be able to get into the park on the days you’re there?” 

Niedzwiecki, from the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, told Business Insider he has heard from recurring Canadian visitors who are “very direct” about not wanting to visit this year over the soured state of relations with the U.S.

If tourists do manage to get into the parks, potential understaffing could result in a noticeable impact on park visitors’ experience: Visitor centers staffed by volunteers or non-profits; smaller parks being closed on weekdays; long waits at entrance stations; trails not being maintained, and so on.

The NPS is working to reinstate the 1,000 probationary employees who were let go while the White House appeals a federal judge order. However, losses from deferred resignations are unlikely to return.

The drop in summer bookings seems to be having the biggest impact on local communities that rely on the parks to support small businesses. Right now, gear rental outfitters and other businesses are struggling to ascertain how many workers to hire.

Ultimately none of this may even matter to President Trump, who earlier this week announced a plan to use federal lands for new housing. He has also stated in the ongoing trade dispute with Canada that the U.S. does not need lumber from up north.</p></b>

                <p>The KYY X90D is an impressive piece of kit, featuring a well-built and sleek aluminum chassis.

 
It has dual 15.6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS displays with a claimed maximum brightness of 300 nits, a contrast ratio of 1,200:1, and a 60Hz refresh rate.

The monitor has five preset display modes: Standard, Game, Movie, Photo, and Vivid.

Each display on the X90D has its own on-screen display (OSD) and set of controls for navigation.

It takes time to become acclimated with the OSD, which can be accessed by pressing the Menu button and then using the +/- buttons to navigate right or left.

The X90D still positions the controls on the lower right corner (left display) and lower left corner (right display), making it awkward to make adjustments.

 
The display panels have a matte finish, which helps to cut down on reflections.

According to our colorimeter testing, the X90D improved upon the X90A in color performance.

In the Standard picture setting, we measured 81.3 percent coverage of sRGB and 57.6 percent of DCI-P3.

The Game and Vivid modes boosted maximum brightness to 201.2 nits and 203.6 nits, respectively.

 
We noticed slightly more accurate colors, particularly in the reds and greens, compared to the disappointing performance of the elder X90A.

Several movies were watched on the monitor with great results, including Catch Me if You Can and Marvel's Daredevil: Born Again.

The displays weren't as bright as wanted outside during the day due to ambient light, but indoors they were more than adequate.

                <p>Most people use ChatGPT for practical purposes, according to new research from OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab.

The study reveals that emotional connections mainly develop among a small group of heavy voice feature users.

After analyzing nearly 40 million ChatGPT conversations, researchers found little evidence of users seeking empathy, affection, or emotional support in their interactions.

Instead, most people stick to factual exchanges with the AI system.

The team used two different approaches to study how people interact with ChatGPT. OpenAI conducted a large-scale, automated analysis of millions of conversations, keeping user privacy intact by avoiding human review.

At the same time, the MIT Media Lab conducted a study with about 1,000 participants, testing how they used both text and voice features.

The MIT study split users into distinct groups. Some could only use text, while others tested voice interactions with different AI personalities - one designed to be emotionally engaged and another programmed to stay neutral.

Each group received specific tasks: personal conversations about memories, practical questions about topics like finances, or free-form discussions.

Heavy advanced voice users are more likely to bond with ChatGPT. While text users generally showed more emotional signals in their conversations, the data revealed a trend among frequent users of ChatGPT's advanced voice mode.

This small group developed significantly stronger emotional connections with the AI, more often referring to ChatGPT as a "friend."

The voice feature's effects varied significantly. Brief interactions seemed to make people feel better, but longer daily use often had the opposite effect.

According to the study, personal conversations were associated with higher levels of loneliness but lower emotional dependency.

Non-personal conversations showed a different pattern: users developed stronger emotional dependency, especially with intensive use.

This suggests that even when interactions are primarily functional rather than emotional, heavy users may still develop a form of dependence on the AI system.

According to the researchers, people who tend to form strong emotional attachments and those who viewed ChatGPT as a real friend were more likely to experience negative effects.

Heavy users also showed an increased risk, although the researchers couldn't prove a direct cause and effect.</p></b>

                <p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) employees were laid off by the Trump administration.

During an interview, Andrew Dessler, an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University, discussed his experience with layoffs in the science community. However, this article focuses on a NOAA employee instead.

The article features an interview with a NOAA meteorologist who flew through several hurricanes and was part of a research team that collected data for weather forecasting.

The meteorologist, Andrew Dessler is not mentioned by name but referred to as "he" throughout the article. This individual's identity may be Andrew Dessler or another person.

A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) employee, who wishes to remain anonymous, shared his experience with layoffs in the Trump administration.

The interviewee was part of a team that flew into hurricanes to collect data for weather forecasting. They discussed their experiences flying through intense storms like Michael and Helene.

In an interview with Gizmodo, a NOAA meteorologist explained the importance of open access to weather data. This individual stated that privatizing weather forecasting would be detrimental to public safety.

According to this NOAA employee, it costs 6 cents per American per day to fund the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at its current level. They emphasized how this is a minimal cost compared to the benefits of better weather forecasts.

The interviewee expressed frustration with the lack of transparency in the decision-making process for rehiring some employees after layoffs. They stated that there was supposed to be a preference given to veterans who had previously served in the federal government, but it has not been made clear how these decisions are being made.

This NOAA employee emphasized their desire to get back to work and help protect the American public. They highlighted the importance of their agency's mission to safeguard lives and property during natural disasters.

The article concludes with a statement from this NOAA meteorologist expressing their commitment to helping the public and their frustration with the layoffs and rehiring process.</p></b>

                <p>The Fire TV Stick is available at a discounted price, with the basic model going from $34 to just $19.

 

The Fire TV Stick 4K and 4K Max models have been reduced in price as well, with the 4K model dropping from $49 to $29 and the 4K Max model being slashed from $59 to $39.


 

The main difference between the basic model and the 4K model is that the latter supports up to a 4K image. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max, on the other hand, also includes Wi-Fi 6E and a library of 2,000 pieces of art and photography.

 

The new Fire TV Sticks support Dolby Atmos sound through select streaming services and can display 4K Ultra HD resolution along with Dolby Vision, and HDR10+.

 

A bonus feature on the Fire TV Sticks is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which allows users to stream games like Halo Infinite and Call of Duty Black Ops 6 directly to their device.

 

The Fire TV ecosystem supports various streaming apps, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, and Max. Additionally, there are ad-supported apps that offer free movies and TV show episodes.

 

A benefit of the Alexa-enabled remote is that users can find shows or movies with voice commands.</p></b>

                <p>Under Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the Social Security Administration has sought to downsize and reorganize its operations.

The agency made the highly controversial decision to nix identity verification over the phone, which threatens to force millions of seniors to travel to field offices to receive their benefits. Many have poor mobility.

At the same time, DOGE has been closing SSA field offices across the country, making it increasingly difficult to access those offices.


Organizations like Social Security Works are organizing to fight the changes, and they hope to spur a groundswell of activism that can convince the government to reverse course.

The group’s executive director, Alex Lawson, thinks that the SSA’s recent policy change will have immediate and disastrous impacts on the agency’s ability to deliver retirement benefits to Americans.


Lawson said: “We know exactly how it will impact benefits. There will be tragedies, people will be harmed, people will die.”

He added that it's pretty clear, the goal of Musk’s DOGE is to destroy the Social Security program from the inside out.

“People listen to Elon Musk on Joe Rogan’s podcast and hear his disdain, his hatred of Social Security,” Lawson said.

“He thinks it is an incredible net negative for the country.”

The SSA has argued that the policy shift is about rooting out fraud and abuse within the program. Critics maintain that the real intent is to drive the agency into dysfunction.


Lawson noted that huge numbers of retirees will be driven into SSA field offices, which were already straining even before the Trump presidency.

He added: “They’ve closed 45 offices, they’ve instructed GSA [the General Services Administration] to end the leases on all of them.”

The U.S. Commerce Secretary, billionaire Howard Lutnick, went on TV and claimed that an occasional drop in retirement benefits is really not that big of a deal.


Lawson said: “He says if Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month, his mother-in-law wouldn’t complain because she’d just think something I messed up.”

He compared the tactics being employed to private actors attacking public systems.

The strategy includes lowering public confidence in Social Security as a program.</p></b>

                <p>Napping has long been praised as a tool for boosting alertness, enhancing mood, strengthening memory, and improving productivity.

Most people experience a natural dip in alertness in the early afternoon, typically between 1 pm and 4 pm. This isn’t just due to a heavy lunch—our internal body clock creates cycles of wakefulness and tiredness throughout the day.

Studies suggest that a short nap during this period can help counteract fatigue, boost alertness, and improve cognitive function without interfering with nighttime sleep. These “power naps” allow the brain to rest without slipping into deep sleep, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed.

But there’s a catch: Napping too long may result in waking up feeling worse than before. This is due to “sleep inertia”—the grogginess and disorientation that comes from waking up during deeper sleep stages.

Once a nap extends beyond 30 minutes, the brain transitions into slow-wave sleep, making it much harder to wake up. Studies show that waking from deep sleep can leave people feeling sluggish for up to an hour.

When Napping Is Essential

For some, napping is essential. Shift workers often struggle with fragmented sleep due to irregular schedules, and a well-timed nap before a night shift can boost alertness and reduce the risk of errors and accidents.</p></b>

                <p>When Apple introduced the iPhone 15 Pro, Greg Joswiak said the device’s three rear cameras would give consumers “the equivalent of seven camera lenses in their pocket.”

Now, Fujifilm is trying the same thing.

With a 35mm lens stuck to a body similar to the super-popular X100VI, it would be easy to assume Fuji’s new GFX100RF is the company’s attempt to take a winning strategy and scale it up to medium format.

But while most fixed-lens cameras like the X100VI create intentional limitations and encourage you to shoot more than you think, the GFX100RF is all about flexibility and intentionality.

Using its high-resolution 102MP sensor, an all-new aspect ratio dial and four different digital “zoom” modes, Fujifilm aims to replace nine cameras and four lenses with one relatively compact body.

Fujifilm’s GFX100RF is the company’s most compact medium-format camera yet. Housing the same sensor as its flagship GFX100II, the $4,900 camera is hugely capable.

The new twist this camera adds to the formula is its aspect ratio dial. This physical dial lets you pick from one of nine different formats to frame your image.

You can choose between 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, 17:6, 3:4, 1:1, 7:8, and two other formats that are used less often in photography. The dial is located on the top of the camera.

The GFX100RF also features four digital “zoom” modes, which allow you to crop your image while maintaining the same level of detail as if you had shot at a wider angle.

These modes use complex algorithms to interpolate missing pixels and create an image that looks like it was shot with a longer lens. 

Fujifilm is positioning this camera as the best everyday camera on the market, but without a faster lens or optical image stabilization, you might have trouble shooting with this camera once the light gets low.

The 100RF is only marginally bigger than the Fujifilm X100VI, so it may not have developed a stabilization system compact enough for the body yet.</p></b>

                <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken aim at cellphones in schools as part of his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda.

In an interview with "Fox & Friends," Kennedy praised cellphone restrictions in schools and listed health hazards linked to phone use among children and teens, some backed by scientific research, others less so.

Kennedy cited established links between social media use and depression and poor school performance. Studies have found that excessive social media use can negatively impact teens' mental health and elevate their risk of depression and anxiety.

Scientists have also long understood that cellphone use in school can lead to poor academic performance, including lower grades.

However, research has found no association between cellphone use and cancer, nor evidence that cellphones damage DNA. Cellphones emit radio frequency radiation, which has far less energy than ionizing radiation.

Kennedy's statements follow a pattern of mixing misinformation with scientific fact. Some of the issues he has highlighted have broad support among the public and many scientists, but certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems are not backed by research.

Restricting cellphone use in schools is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Last year, Vivek Murthy called on schools to get rid of phones in the classroom.

Nine states have enacted bans or restrictions, and 15 states and Washington D.C. have introduced legislation to do so.

There's no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cellphone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis.

Kennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims about the physical harms of cellphone use in the past. He told Sen. Andy Kim that he stood by his past statements that Wi-Fi radiation causes cancer.

Research has been "very reassuring" about cellphone safety, Bushberg said. Most studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cellphones could increase the risk of brain tumors.

However, a large study among children found no association between wireless phone use and brain tumors. The National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration have said there's no evidence that cellphones cause cancer.

A decade earlier, a study looked at cellphone use among more than 5,000 people with brain tumors and found a possible increased risk of tumors in the 10% who used their phones the most.

Cellphone use has changed in recent years, which could affect exposure. People now text as much if not more than they call, so there's potentially less radiation near the brain.

Despite bipartisan support for cellphone restrictions, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>When surveys ask potential car buyers why they’re not going electric, the answer is consistent: It’s the charging. Drivers understand gas; plugging in, less so.

They’re worried about waiting around for a charger, which, depending on its power, can take anywhere between 20 minutes and eight hours to fill up a battery.

So the hubbub around a surprise announcement from Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD makes sense. The automaker said this week that two new vehicles set to launch in April will be able to add 250 miles of range in just five minutes.

That’s twice as fast as even the next generation of Tesla Superchargers. (The day of BYD’s announcement, Tesla stock dropped by five percent.)

Topping up in five minutes makes for great ad copy, and could go a long way to alleviating drivers’ concerns about EVs.

But practically speaking, experts say, it might not be the gigantic charging breakthrough it seems.

BYD says the superfast charging is made possible by an “all liquid-cooled megawatt flash-charging terminal system,” according to Bloomberg, plus a new, automotive-grade silicon carbide power chip.

The combination should allow the vehicle to channel up to 1,000 volts of charge. That’s a small but significant jump compared to competitors, at least among passenger vehicles.

Generally, the higher the voltage, combined with sufficient amperage, or electrical flow, the faster the charge.

Most popular EVs, including the Tesla Model 3, are built on 400-volt "platforms," which are usually cheaper to manufacture, though 800-volt models are on the rise.

The upcoming Lucid Gravity, meanwhile, has a 926-volt powertrain. BYD trumps it all.

The more significant BYD innovation, though, may be in its chargers, which the automaker indicates should be able to take advantage of that 1,000-volt capability.

BYD says it will build 4,000 of them in China, though hasn’t provided any specifics about when, where, and how. 

Getting those fast chargers in the ground likely won’t be a simple task.

“It’s going to take a while,” says Gil Tal, who directs the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis.

Building charging stations can already be a multimonth, if not multiyear journey in most countries, due partially to lengthy permitting processes, but also the time it takes to find, build, and assemble charging components.

What’s more, larger megawatt charging stations have larger megawatt power needs, and might require pricey grid connection updates.

Plus, an advanced liquid-cooled system, like the kind described by BYD, needs thick, heavy, and specially manufactured cables and connectors that can dissipate heat quickly.

“They need more copper, more cooling, more everything,” says Tal. 

That means more up-front building expenses, which could be passed on to drivers in higher charging prices.

EV industry experts know some of these things because super fast charging isn’t new.

Megawatt charging systems that can deliver up to 1,250 volts have been in development for nearly a decade, though developers have mostly been focused on the rapid charging of heavy-duty commercial vehicles like electric semitrucks and buses.

Most superfast charging efforts have focused on these sorts of vehicles for two reasons: They have much bigger battery packs; and they’re mostly operated by businesses and governments in fleets, so the moments they spend charging are moments they’re not transporting people or goods.</p></b>

                <p>In July 2012, a renegade American businessman, Russ George, took a ship off the coast of British Columbia and dumped 100 tons of iron sulfate dust into the Pacific Ocean.

He had unilaterally, and some suggest illegally, decided to trigger an algae bloom to absorb some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—an attempt at geoengineering, a tech-based approach to combating climate change.


A startup called Stardust seeks something more ambitious: developing proprietary geoengineering technology that would help block sun rays from reaching the planet.

Its approach is novel: Most geoengineering research today is led by scientists in the US at universities and federal agencies, and the work they are doing is more or less accessible to public scrutiny.

Stardust is at the forefront of an alternative path: One in which private companies drive the development, and perhaps deployment, of technologies that experts say could have profound consequences for the planet.


Geoengineering projects, even those led by climate scientists at major universities, have previously drawn the ire of environmentalists and other groups.

Such a deliberate transformation of the atmosphere has never been done, and many uncertainties remain. If a geoengineering project went awry, for example, it could contribute to air pollution and ozone loss, or have dramatic effects on weather patterns, such as disrupting monsoons in populous South and East Asia.


But as global temperatures rise, public and scientific sentiments are shifting.

If those temperature trends continue, governments or private entities may ultimately use geoengineering to alleviate or avoid the worst impacts of extreme weather, including deadly heat waves, firestorms, and hurricanes.</p></b>

                <p>Saturn will temporarily lose its iconic look from our viewpoint on Earth, appearing as a pale, yellow sphere without its swirling rings shrouding the gas giant.

The billions of rocky and icy chunks swirling around Saturn will disappear from our viewpoint on Sunday, March 23 as the thin edges of the planet’s rings are aimed toward Earth, seemingly vanishing from sight. The rare phenomenon occurs every 13 to 15 years, with Earth passing through Saturn’s ring plane. The last time Earth got this rare view of the gas giant was in 2009.

Saturn is surrounded by billions of swarming pieces of comets, asteroids, and broken-off fragments of moons that were caught by the planet’s orbit. The exquisite ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, and is made up of tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house, according to NASA.

Similarly to Earth, Saturn’s axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees. As it orbits the Sun, Saturn’s tilt shifts in relation to Earth, causing its rings to disappear from our view as our planet crosses their plane. When Saturn is tilted toward Earth, we can see the upper side of its rings, and we see the lower side of the rings when the planet is tilted toward us.

The plane crossing will begin at around 12:04 p.m. ET on Sunday.</p></b>

                <p>Verizon has started rolling out satellite connectivity for users of Google Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S25 series phones, allowing them to send texts in cellular dead zones.

This capability is part of a broader effort by carriers to provide satellite connectivity to fill gaps in terrestrial network coverage.

T-Mobile recently announced a partnership with Starlink that's currently in beta until July, which lets users send and receive texts, and will soon allow sharing photos, using data, making voice calls, and more.

AT&T is also working with AST SpaceMobile and has tested a video call over satellite connectivity.

 

The OneXSugar handheld console claims to do it all - like the Nintendo DS, but better. It features two screens and rotating gamepad controllers that can transform into different modes of use.

The device is Android-based and was announced alongside new gaming chips from Qualcomm, designed specifically for handhelds.

The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 boasts improved graphics with ray tracing, optimized for cloud-based gaming and retro emulators.

 

Velotric's Breeze 1 is a commuting and cruising ebike that features a comfortable seating position on a step-through frame and a powerful 750-watt motor.

It has a range of up to 70 miles and can switch between using torque or cadence sensors for optimal performance.

The bike also integrates with Apple Find My and Apple Health, making it easy to track fitness data.</p></b>

                <p>The opposition protests have spread despite the government banning gatherings for four days.

Much of the opposition activity has centered around universities, and many of those connected to the demonstrations are now finding their X accounts suspended, observers report.

The majority of the suspended accounts were "university-associated activist accounts, basically sharing protest information, locations for students to go," Yusuf Can, coordinator and analyst at the Wilson Center's Middle East Program, told POLITICO.

Some accounts appear to be suspended only in Turkey and not in the rest of the world. Activist Ömer Faruk Aslan created a second account to avoid censorship. "Yesterday, my account was blocked by a court order because the tweets exceeded 6 million views," he posted.

Turkey's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X that authorities have found 326 social media accounts that are inciting hatred, 72 of which were abroad.

A coordinated action between cyber and security authorities led to the arrest of 54 suspects related to the social media accounts, said Yerlikaya.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>In January, a generator AI developed by Chinese venture company DeepSeek was released, shocking the world.

It has attracted a lot of attention worldwide, taking the number one mobile app downloads in 140 countries around the world.

With the emergence of DeepSeek, the stock price of semiconductor giant NVIDIA fell sharply by nearly 17%, bringing its market capitalization to a negative of approximately 91 trillion yen in Japanese yen.


Low cost, low energy, high performance impact

There are multiple reasons why DeepSeek's appearance was so shocking. First of all, it had the ability to rival previous generation AIs such as "ChatGPT."

It also supports Japanese input, and questions are answered at a level that is almost the same as those in ChatGPT.

And nevertheless, it is offered at a much lower price than previous generation AIs such as ChatGPT.


Furthermore, the development cost was $5.57 million (approximately 860 million yen), which was less than a tenth of the US competitors, making it extremely inexpensive.

It is said that the electricity required is also quite low.


The US has placed restrictions on China on exports of NVIDIA's cutting-edge semiconductors.

Despite this, the high-performance DeepSeek has arrived.

DeepSeek is believed to have used poorly-performance semiconductors developed for China, which caused doubts about its huge investment in NVDIA and other countries, causing stock prices to plummet.


However, there are reports that DeepSeek had obtained cutting-edge semiconductors via Singapore, so it is important to note that it does not mean that NVIDIA's cutting-edge semiconductors are not necessary.

It is also said that the reason why it was able to be developed at a low cost is because OpenAI's AI was "distilled" and trained.


Answers in line with the Chinese Communist Party's wishes, security issues too

On the other hand, DeepSeek also has problems.

It is a Chinese service and the answers have been adjusted to be the official view of the Chinese Communist Party.

The Chinese voluntary censorship is carried out on topics considered sensitive, and the system is designed to avoid questions about geopolitical and sensitive issues, such as the Tiananmen Square incident that occurred in 1989 and the Senkaku Islands issue.


For most questions, if you type in Japanese, the answer will be answered in Japanese, but when you enter something like "Tiananmen Incident," you will only get replied that you cannot answer using standard sentences.

Additionally, data entered by users in DeepSeek is managed on a Chinese server.


What happens with the arrival of DeepSeek

With the emergence of competition, for generation AI such as OpenAI, measures such as reducing costs and improving performance are required.

This should work positively for users.</p></b>

                <p>The SUUNTO AQUA is a latest product from the company, designed for swimming but easy to use in other situations.

It can be completely submerged in water without any deterioration of sound quality even when it gets wet in the rain.

SUUNTO AQUA comes in two colors: black and lime blue. The lime blue model has a soft-touch navy blue finish with a lime yellow accent color.

The product is charged by a portable power supply (power bank) that can be clipped to the right body, allowing for two full charges (a total of about 30 hours).

The portable power supply itself can be charged via USB-C, and it comes with a magnetic charging cable.


The Aqua is equipped with a motion detection sensor that measures stroke posture while swimming, head tilt, breathing frequency, glide time, and more.

By connecting to the Suunto app, users can manage these swimming functions and perform other operations such as operating them with their head movements, dual device connections, sound modes, button customization, assessments, and firmware updates.


The function of operating the head movement is convenient even outside the pool, allowing users to answer incoming calls, reject calls, and skip songs without any problems by simply shaking their head vertically or horizontally.

For cycling, users can set neck fatigue alerts and range of motion assessments, and the jump assessment function allows users to check the degree of neuromuscular fatigue and understand their own condition.


The physical buttons on the headset are large and easy to press. There is one on the bottom of the right and one large multifunction button on the left.

Button functions can be customized to user's liking using the Suunto app. The unit has 32GB of internal storage, allowing users to play music where Bluetooth is not reachable or even in the water.


The sound quality of the SUUNTO AQUA is amazing, and the design of the main unit is also very well thought out.

The battery lasts for about 10 hours, and the 35g titanium and silicon body is lightweight and comfortable for long periods of time.</p></b>

                <p>Despite everything, there is a widget for everyone, and according to the applications installed on your Android device, you will probably find one or two in this article to help you gain in efficiency.

Widgets are additions to your Android home screen which allows you to quickly access applications of applications, applications themselves or services on which you depend. With the right collection of widgets, you can create a quick home screen that allows you to stay informed without opening up the slightest application.

I have traveled the widgets for phones and tablets, and I share those which, in my opinion, will make your phone or tablet more useful.

Google Agenda

Show the month or the whole day. As I regularly consult my Google agenda, I find the widget very useful. You can add a widget to display the whole month or a daily widget. From each widget, you can consult the events and even press the + button to add an event to your agenda.

Gmail (or your favorite messaging application)

Add the widget to your default email application allows you to have a quick overview of the content of your reception box and easily access the application writing window.

3 Keep Notes

Quickly note information. I use Keep Notes daily to quickly note information, share racing lists and much more. You can add two widgets: one to scroll through your notes and one to quickly create new notes (text, voice and even images from your camera).

For this widget, I recommend adding the scrolling widget to the tablets and the quick access buttons widget on phones.

4 Arc Search

Navigate the internet quickly. The addition of Arc Search as a widget offers functionalities similar to the Google Standard search bar, but automatically opens Arc Search instead of chrome.

If you prefer to get away from Google search, I strongly recommend that you install Arc Search and add the widget to your home screen.

5 battery

Load level information. There is already a battery indicator at the top of your phone screen. However, this indicator does not provide any information on the load level of connected devices.

6 Pixel weather

For pixel phones only. Android's "preview" feature indicates the ambient temperature and you can press it to open the weather app.

7 Spotify

Access your playlists. The Spotify widget allows me to quickly access my reading lists.</p></b>

                <p>Running hats are an essential part of every runner's equipment.

Breathability is a key characteristic in running hats, allowing for ventilation and air circulation to prevent sweat buildup and discomfort during runs.


The use of holes and mesh plays a functional as well as decorative role in breathable running hats.


Pass: Nobody wants to feel uncomfortable while running due to an ill-fitting hat.


A hat adjustment system allows runners to adapt the hat to their head circumference, making it easy to exploit this feature.

Some models have logos and/or reflective details that make them suitable for running at night or in low-light conditions.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>How does a VPN work?

The principle of a VPN is to establish an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the Internet access provider. Normally, when accessing a website, your IP address and other personal information is broadcast online. With a VPN, this data first goes through a secure server that takes care of hiding them, strengthening anonymity.

It is still necessary that the chosen VPN is effective: encryption, confidentiality policy, reliability of the VPN connection ... Different criteria must be taken into consideration to have the assurance that your identity is well protected.

Can a VPN guarantee total anonymity?

The short answer is as follows: yes, but with nuances ... All VPNs are not equal. Free services are often less secure and can keep connection newspapers (logs). This is why, if you are looking to be anonymous, it is best to turn to a paid service. It is also important to verify the privacy policy before taking out a subscription.

To maximize your chances of navigating anonymously, favor a VPN which:

Apply a strict policy of "no-log" (no data preservation), this is the case, for example, of surfhark;

Uses high-level encryption (AES-256) and advanced protocols (Kev2, OpenVPN and Wireguard);

Has advanced features such as "Kill Switch" and "Dynamic Multihop";

Integrates a stealth mode, capable of hiding the fact that you use a VPN.

Can we be followed online despite a VPN?

Your online confidentiality is threatened by many elements. If the use of a reliable VPN is effective protection, it is not enough alone. Its effectiveness is also based on the adoption of good practices and other protection tools.

Your online confidentiality threatened by your own accounts

When it comes to preserving your privacy on the Internet, one of the first elements likely to compromise your anonymity remains the use of your personal accounts, starting with those of Google or social networks. Even using a VPN to hide your IP address, connection to these services is enough to identify you and trace your activity online.

Risks related to malware

Malware software represents another serious threat. Some are able to steal your identifiers and passwords, while others, such as spyware, monitor your activity. The Keyloggers even go so far as to record the keyboard strikes.</p></b>

                <p>The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a series of alleged incidents across the country in which "Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged."

On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted charges against three people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles and writing "profane messages against President Trump" near Tesla charging stations.

Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars," Bondi said in a news release detailing the arrests.

Civil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Musk’s role in the government.

The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations.

Bondi’s announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots “Tesla Takedown” events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are scheduled to take place at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend.

Most of the protests have been peaceful, and the organizers of some of them have said that they don’t endorse property damage. 

But they are happening amid a string of alleged arson and vandalism cases targeting Tesla dealerships and charging stations, including one in Las Vegas Tuesday morning, as well as others in Colorado and Boston.

The FBI can file broader search warrants than in other types of cases under the Patriot Act, allowing law enforcement to get "special authorities" while investigating terrorism.</p></b>

                <p>Appleが「M4」チップ搭載「MacBook Air」（M4 MacBook Air）を3月に発表した。このウルトラポータブルノートPCについては、新機能に関するさまざまなうわさが飛び交っていた。

これがAppleの主要デバイスでM4チップを採用する最後の製品だったことや、われわれがテストしたノートPCの中で2024年の「M3」チップ搭載MacBook Air（M3 MacBook Air）が最高のものの1つだった（今でもそうだ）ことが、その理由だろう。M3 MacBook Airは、未来を見据えた「大衆向けAIコンピューター」であり、Appleのデザインの最高到達点とみなすことも可能だ。

しかし、MacBook Airの更新をやめるわけにはいかないので、M4 MacBook Airが漸進的なアップグレードとなることは明らかだった。つまり、M3 MacBook Airの長所がさらに強化され、消費者にとってのコストパフォーマンスも少し改善されるということだ。

例えば、M4 MacBook Airの価格は999ドル（16万4800円）からとなっており（16GBのメモリーを搭載する13インチモデルを選択した場合）、2024年のM3モデルよりも100ドル安く（訳注：日本では据え置き）なっている。さらに、ローエンドとハイエンドの両方でハードウェアが強化されており、最もローエンドの構成でも10コアのCPUと8コアのGPUが搭載されている。

一方、ハイエンド構成では、32GBのユニファイドメモリーが選択可能（M3 MacBook Airでは、最大で24GBまでだった）となっている。基本コンポーネントの強化と開始価格の値下げを組み合わせることで、AppleはM4 MacBook Airを戦略的に位置付けている。ますます競争が激化する市場で、M4 MacBook Airを購入する動機を作り出して、競争力を維持することが狙いだ。

M4 MacBook Airは素晴らしいデバイスだが、MacBook Airシリーズの自然な進歩でもあるため、これを「退屈な」アップデートとみなす人もいるかもしれない。それを肯定的に捉える人もいれば、否定的に捉える人もいるだろう。壊れていないものを直すことはできないが、MacBook Airには、もっと大胆なデザインを選択できる余地が幾つかあると思う。

明白な例の1つは、M4 MacBook Airの新色である「スカイブルー」だ。これは非常に控えめな青色である。筆者はMicrosoftの「Surface Laptop」にもう少し近い色を期待していたので、とても慎重な色の選択だと感じた。とはいえ、M4 MacBook Airを際立たせる特徴が幾つかあることも確かだ。詳しく見ていこう。

トリプルディスプレーの衝撃

M4 MacBook Airで特に期待されていた人気機能の1つが、本体を開いた状態で最大2台の外部ディスプレーに出力できる機能だ。3台のディスプレーを同時に使えるこの機能だけでも、仕事や生産作業、クリエーティブなタスクに新たな可能性が開かれ、M4 MacBook Airの競争力が高まるだろう。

本体のディスプレーも相変わらず美しい。Appleの「Liquid Retina」テクノロジーのおかげで、テキストは鮮明かつ明瞭で、動画は滑らかかつ鮮やかに表示される。さらに、このディスプレーは10億色に対応する。最大輝度は500ニトなので、「MacBook Pro」のディスプレーほど明るくはないが、それでもほとんどの用途に十分な明るさだ。

ただし、M4チップ搭載MacBook Pro（M4 MacBook Pro）で提供されている「Nano-textureガラス」へのアップグレードオプションが、M4 MacBook Airでは利用できないことに少し驚いた。私たちが少し過剰な期待をするようになってしまったのかもしれないが、M4 MacBook Airのディスプレーは映り込みが目立つため、さまざまなアップグレードの選択肢がある中で、Nano-textureガラスがなぜ採用されなかったのか疑問に思わざるを得ない。

ディスプレーで気に入らないもう1つの点は、カメラ用のノッチだ。レンズが配置されている部分に黒い切り欠きがあり、貴重な画面スペースの一部が無駄になっている。ツールバーをオンにしたままにしておけばノッチに慣れることができるが、アプリを全画面で表示すると間違いなく目立つ。

強力な生産性マシン

生産性と言えば、M4 MacBook Airの利点は複数のディスプレーだけではない。まず、M4 MacBook Airでビデオ会議をするのは楽しい。ウェブカメラのハードウェアが、2024年モデルの1080pの「FaceTime」カメラから、Appleの新しい「センターフレーム」機能を備えた1200万画素カメラにアップグレードされたからだ。

センターフレームは、2024年秋に発表されたMacBook Proと「iMac」で初めて登場した。これは、M4 MacBook Airを既存のMacBook Proに少し近づける多くの機能の1つである。ご存じない方のために説明しておくと、センターフレームは、デバイスの位置に関係なく、ユーザーがフレーム内で中心に映るように調整する機能だ。ユーザーが最小限の入力をするだけで、ビデオ通話の視覚的な調整を処理してくれる。

これは独立した機能というよりも、ウェブカメラ技術の必然的な未来であるように筆者には思える。これこそがウェブカメラのあるべき姿だ。Appleのイノベーションは、視覚的に美しく洗練された体験をMacBook AirのLiquid Retinaディスプレーで提供する。この体験は、仕事でも、Wi-Fi経由での個人的なFaceTime通話でも同じように楽しむことができる。

最高級のハードウェア、シームレスで効果的に統合された製品、そして、生活の質を高める機能群の相乗効果で、Macでのビデオ通話体験は全体的に向上している。

筆者が普段使用するのは「Windows」デバイスだが、Macも長年使っている。MacBook Airが「Launchpad」、画面分割、「Siri」との直接的なやりとりを組み合わせて、マルチタスクを極めて簡単に処理できることを忘れてしまっていた。さらに、ウィンドウのタイル表示の改善は、デスクトップを特定の方法で配置したいユーザーを大いに満足させるはずだ。</p></b>

                <p>While the most decorated public officials in America sipped cocktails in the presidential dance hall of the Capital Hilton, taking care of the assignment at the tables and wondering what their place was in the hierarchy between US senators and the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, Elon Musk was sitting at his phone, laughing.

On January 25, a group of high managers and his most loyal young people were preparing to occupy the highest offices of a nearby federal building under surveillance. They would have slept on mattresses covered with sensors for body temperature and respiratory frequency, giving themselves to renovate the country's base code. Or better yet, eliminate it completely.

The Alfalfa Club has existed since 1913 for the sole purpose of hosting an annual banquet in which the most important people in the government can entertain with the most important figures in the business world. The main table was reserved for alfalfa in government. Musk participated as a guest, sitting on the opposite side of the room.

The managers of the Alfalfa Club seemed convinced that the elections and constitutional rules should also determine the seats. Musk spent most of the dinner on the phone, speaking with the president, what is said to be Donald Trump. The entrepreneur was closer to Donald Trump. He told his friends that he committed himself in government buildings.

Musk's agents had already gained access to personnel management systems (OPM), which acts as a Federal Department of Human Resources for about 2.2 million US public employees. Many of these agents would later also show up in other government agencies: among them there were Akash Bobba, graduated from the UC Berkeley and a former palantir intern; Edward Coristine, a nineteen year old who is supernamed "Big Balls" online; And Nikhil Rajpal, a thirty-year-old computer scientist who had worked on Twitter during the period of Musk's acquisition.</p></b>

                <p>The World Water Day, dedicated to glaciers this year, returns as every year on March 22.

Fundamental for life
 
The glaciers are deposits of ice and snow that accumulate on the ground standing, and slowly slide driven by their weight. They are present in every continent. They are found in many mountain regions, and on the edges of the glacial cap of Greenland and Antarctica. There are more than 275 thousand glaciers in the world, which cover a total area of ​​about 700 thousand square kilometers.

Climate change indicators

On a global level, the glaciers began to dissolve starting from the middle of the nineteenth century (when the so -called small glacial era that cooled the climate of the earth has ended starting from the fourteenth century). In recent decades, however, they have started to shrink at increasing speed, due to the global warming linked to the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

A crucial water resource

As we said, the glaciers hold 70% of the planet's fresh water. Often it is a temporary deposit, which returns fresh water in spring when it begins to melt the snow, and feeds the aquifers used by man such as drinking water, agriculture, industry and energy production.

New dangers

The anomalous dissolution of the ice increases the risk of disasters. Floods, landslides, avalanches, in the future they will be increasingly common in mountain areas and in subarctic areas, exposing the populations that live there with new dangers, and difficult to predict.

Cut the emissions to save the glaciers

Italy is a hot spot of the effects of global warming, and it demonstrates the hidden hair of our mountains: the Italian glaciers are those that disappear with the fastest rhythm throughout the Alpine arc, and in the last 10 years they have already reduced by 13%, and risk losing a further 50% mass by 2050.

The importance of monitoring

Some glaciers have been subjected to annual monitoring campaigns for more than 130 years. More recently, remote monitoring technologies, even with the use of satellites, have made it possible to significantly expand the scientific mapping of glaciers.

The impact on the environment and the economy

The decline of the glaciers is the main responsible for the rise in the levels of the seas, increased on average by 20 centimeters since the beginning of 1900. The effects are seen in the erosion of the coasts, and in the growing risk of floods.

Biodiversity

A study from 2015 mapped the biodiversity of ice and perennial snow for the first time, identifying 16 species of mammals (17 with ours), including herbivores such as reindeer, alci and chamois, and their predators, bears, foxes and wolves.</p></b>

In Italy, renewables have reached 41.2% of the national needs, but the integrated national plan for energy and climate (PNIEC) places a challenging objective: to arrive by 2030 near 60%. Beyond the numerical details, the direction is clear: to advance in the transition to a more green energy basket, strategic funding, adequate political choices, international projects and initiatives, collective culture and - perhaps even before all this - technologies and innovations that allow both to optimize the efficiency of generation and storage and to exploit and manage the energy resources we have.

It is on this last point that, to put together visionary companies and ideas, more than a thousand Italian and international realities (from over 50 different states) have met in early March in Rimini for Key 2025 - The Energy Transition Expo, the fair dedicated to the future of energy that acts as a reference for Europe, Africa and the Mediterranean basin, organized by IEG (Italian Exhibition Group) and already scheduled in Rimini for the 2026 edition from 4 to March 6th. Between retailers, implants, developers of components and all the big names in the sector, the event was also an opportunity to gather Philos of research on the border between the world of university and technology transfer, startups and innovative projects. Among these, here it is 10 who intrigued us.</p></b>

                <p>Robots are a cornerstone of Japanese manga and souls. Their charm has also infected the world of western comics, where the mechs are certainly less frequent, but have still left an indelible mark. And lately they are conquering the tables designed, between tributes to the great classics of the 70s and 80s and new proposals with a more sci-fi cut.

They can take on various forms: whether they are android or noble children mechanical samurai, gigantic war machines or secret spies with a retro-fault appearance, the important thing is that they are the real protagonists of the story, or that they characterize the setting to the point that their absence would make it unrecognizable. Here then, here to follow, a rundown of the best robots that can be found between Comic Book and Graphic Novel. And if, like us, you believe that the robots go hand in hand with their natural opponents, the monsters (giants or not), after reading return here: we have other reading tips for you.</p></b>

                <p>StubHub filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the SEC on Friday, March 21.

The company hopes to value itself at $16.5 billion in its IPO.

StubHub had "gross merchandise sales" (GMS) of $8.7 billion in 2024, a 27% increase from 2023.


For the year, StubHub sold more than 40 million tickets from more than 1 million unique sellers across 200 countries and territories.

Revenue reached $1.77 billion in 2024, up 29.4% from 2023, while net loss was $2.8 million.


Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $298.7 million, down nearly 16% from $353.9 million in 2023.

Long-term debt stands at $2.33 billion — nearly eight times last year’s adjusted EBITDA.

Proceeds from the IPO will primarily go toward StubHub’s debt, with the remainder going toward general corporate purposes.

StubHub believes it is the leader in secondary ticketing, according to its S-1 filing on Friday.


The company has also made a foray into primary ticketing, which generated more than $100 million in GMS in 2024.</p></b>

                <p>WhatsApp has released a new Android update through the Google Play Beta Program, bringing the version up to 2.25.8.12.

Motion photos are a type of media format that captures a brief moment of movement before and after a photo is taken. Unlike traditional images, motion photos include a few seconds of video and audio, providing an immersive way to capture memories.

WhatsApp's upcoming support for motion photos aims to expand the media-sharing capabilities of the app. When users attempt to open the gallery sheet, they can expect to see a new button specifically for motion photos. This button will give users the option to choose between sending the static image or the motion photo version, if available, offering greater flexibility depending on the context.

The feature will be particularly useful for capturing moments where subtle movements or reactions are essential to the memory, as it allows users to share not only a still image but also the dynamic essence of the moment. 

Users will be able to share motion photos with friends, family, and followers without losing the dynamic essence of their captured moments. Recipients will automatically view the motion photo in its animated form, even if the feature is not supported on their device.

A feature to share motion photos in chats, groups, and channels is under development and it will be available in a future update. 

WhatsApp's upcoming support for motion photos aims to expand the media-sharing capabilities of the app. When users attempt to open the gallery sheet, they can expect to see a new button specifically for motion photos.

Motion photos are commonly available on devices like Samsung Galaxy smartphones, where the feature is called Motion Photo, and Google Pixel devices, which often refer to it as Top Shot or Motion Photos. Apple also offers a similar feature called Live Photos on iPhones, which captures a few seconds of video along with each still photo. 

The feature will be compatible with both individual and group chats, as well as channels. This means users will be able to share motion photos with friends, family, and followers without losing the dynamic essence of their captured moments.

In addition to this new feature, WhatsApp has enhanced the way shared media appears in chat by automatically grouping media items into an album within a single message bubble, even when fewer than four items are included.

                <p>Turkey is bracing for more civil unrest, after at least 340 protestors were arrested overnight Friday during a third day of demonstrations calling for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to resign.

Violent clashes between demonstrators and police were sparked by Wednesday's arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu – a top political rival of Erdogan. As many as 100 others were also detained. 

Supporters slammed the charges as politically motivated. The arrest came mere hours before Imamoglu was nominated as a presidential candidate for the country's main opposition party to Erdogan, in an election currently scheduled for 2028.

Imamoglu was questioned by Turkish police for five hours Saturday and is expected to be transferred to a courthouse to face possible charges. Tens of thousands of Turks have taken to the streets calling for Erdogan's resignation, in more than a dozen cities across the country.

Turkey's interior ministry warned that authorities would not tolerate "chaos and provocation." 

Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported that Turkish police have also detained 56 people for social media posts that allegedly incited unrest.</p></b>

This means that next year's iPhone 18 models should all take the leap to a next-generation chip architecture. 

Previously, it was unclear whether or not all iPhone 18 models would adopt 2nm tech.

Apple began to adopt 3nm chip technology in 2023 with the A17 Pro and M3 chips. Leaping to 2nm next year will mark the beginning of a new three-year chip cycle, as per usual.

TSMC states that 2nm chips should lead to a roughly 15% performance boost while consuming the same level of power.

Kuo also notes that TSMC's trial production for 2nm chips reached 60-70% yields three months ago, and they're now "well above that."</p></b>

                <p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan entered this year facing a knot of political problems with little precedent in his two decades at the summit of power in Turkey.

Voters were angry about persistently high inflation. His political party’s popularity had sunk. And his opponents had coalesced around the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, who made it clear that he was gunning for the presidency.

Then on Wednesday, just four days before the mayor was set to be designated as the political opposition’s presidential candidate, dozens of policemen arrested him at his home on accusations of corruption and terrorism.

Mr. Erdogan’s foes consider the arrest a ploy to abort Mr. Imamoglu’s presidential campaign before it begins. At stake is not only who will be Turkey’s next president, analysts, opposition leaders and foreign officials say, but to what extent Turkey, one of the world’s 20 largest economies and a U.S. ally in NATO, remains a democracy.</p></b>

                <p>Ann Kelleher, Intel's executive who led the company's technology roadmap through its transition beyond 7nm delays, will retire after 27 years.

 

Her departure coincides with the critical ramp-up of Intel's advanced 18A manufacturing process node. Intel's decision to divide her responsibilities highlights the urgency of addressing the company's manufacturing and financial struggles. Instead of a direct successor, Kelleher's role will be split between two executives: Naga Chandrasekaran will oversee front-end process engineering, while Navid Shahriari takes charge of advanced packaging and testing operations.

 

The leadership reshuffle aligns closely with the arrival of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who was appointed on March 12 to guide Intel through severe financial turbulence. Intel reported its largest loss since 1986 in its detailed financial disclosure for 2024, totaling $18.8 billion, with $13.4 billion specifically tied to its struggling foundry division.

 

Tan, addressing Intel employees, openly acknowledged these challenges, stating: "We have a chance to do something special together. In many ways, we are the founders of 'The New Intel.' We will learn from past mistakes, use setbacks to strengthen our resolve, and choose action over distraction to reach our full potential."

Central to Tan's strategy is expanding Intel Foundry Services beyond internal clients. Recent reports confirm that major industry players Nvidia and Broadcom are currently testing Intel's 18A manufacturing technology.

 

Intel's strategic shift coincides with setbacks in its ambitious U.S. manufacturing plans, including the delay of its Ohio chip factory until 2030, despite receiving a $7.86 billion CHIPS Act subsidy. The delay heightens the stakes for Intel's 18A node, now critical for demonstrating the company's manufacturing competitiveness.

Alongside manufacturing changes, CEO Tan is refocusing Intel's product roadmap on artificial intelligence. Intel recently cancelled its Falcon Shores GPU project, shifting instead to Jaguar Shores, a new AI-focused architecture expected to debut in 2027.</p></b>

                <p>A report by Runa Capital highlights the top 20 trending open source startups globally, with more than half of them closely aligned with AI.

The ROSS Index serves quarterly updates on the fastest-growing projects in terms of GitHub “stars,” a metric similar to social media likes.

Beginning in 2023, Runa started producing annual reports highlighting commercial open source startups.

Last year's report showed that AI and data infrastructure were driving demand for open source tooling.

This year, AI is central to 11 of the top 20 companies on the ROSS Index.


Stargazing


In first place on the 2024 ROSS Index is Ollama, a Y Combinator alum building an open source tool for running LLMs locally.

Ollama's GitHub star count increased by 76,000 in 2024 and has since risen to over 135,000 stars.


The next few companies on the list include Zed Industries, LangGenius, ComfyUI, and All Hands.

Zed Industries is a cross-platform collaborative code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

LangGenius offers an open source LLM app development platform called Dify.

ComfyUI provides a node-based program for generating images, videos, and audio using generative AI models.


Rounding out the top five is All Hands, which offers an open source platform called OpenHands for building software development agents.

The ROSS Index also includes companies like Zed and Astral's UV.

Other notable mentions include PDF manipulation tool Stirling PDF and finance management software Maybe Finance.


Methodology


The ROSS Index uses GitHub “stars” as a metric to track growth.

Older projects naturally have more stars, but the index focuses on relative growth over 90 days for quarterly reports and absolute new star counts for annual reports.

The report also notes that some issues may arise around what is considered “open source.”</p></b>

                <p>In Brief

Charlie Javice’s high-profile fraud trial has become a showcase of embarrassing missteps on both sides, with eyebrow-raising details about how JPMorgan Chase was allegedly deceived into buying her startup, Frank, for $175 million when it had just 300,000 customers instead of four million.

Per a new WSJ article, one pivotal moment came when former Frank engineer Patrick Vovor testified that he refused Javice’s request to create fake user data just one week before the sale, recalling she said to him: “Don’t worry. I don’t want to end up in an orange jumpsuit.” When Vovor declined, Javice allegedly turned to a math professor to generate synthetic user data, which was then submitted to JPMorgan. (In court, Javice’s legal team painted Vovor as a scorned suitor.)

In addition to JPMorgan’s failure to properly vet Frank’s user base, other uncomfortable details have been surfaced, including that Leslie Wims Morris, who led the deal at JPMorgan, reportedly sent a note to her team, underlining segments from CEO Jamie Dimon’s annual letter to investors in 2021 and adding that sometimes “there’s no need to do analysis at all.”

Javice’s attorneys said in court that it’s evidence JPMorgan didn’t think it needed to check its work, but Morris testified that it was tongue-in-cheek and written as “a joke to my team.”</p></b>

                <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued new instructions to scientists working with the American Institute of Artificial Intelligence Safety (AISI). The instructions remove references to AI safety, responsible AI, and AI fairness.

This notification was presented in early March as part of the Joint Research and Development Agreement (updated version) sent to consortium members working in conjunction with AISI. Previous contracts encouraged researchers to have AI identify and correct "discriminatory model behaviors" based on gender, race, age, and wealth and poor differences.

However, the revised version of the contract removed mentions on the development of tools that "authenticate content and track its origin" and the development of tools that "label synthetic content." This means that interest in misinformation and deepfake tracing has faded. 

The emphasis was on "America First." They are asking a working group to develop test tools to "expand the US's global AI position."

Researchers from the organization that collaborates with AISI said, "The Trump administration has removed the phrases that were considered important to AI: safety, fairness, misinformation countermeasures and responsibility. It's clear what the change means." 

A researcher spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, pointing out that overlooking these issues could harm the public because algorithms that encourage discrimination through income and other attributes can be left unchecked.

The researcher warned, "Unless you're a tech slut, there's a worse future coming for you and your loved ones. Be prepared for AI to be introduced unfair, discriminatory, unsafe and irresponsible."

Another researcher who has worked with AISI in the past says, "It's out of control."</p></b>

Kuo said TSMC's trial production of 2nm chips has now reached yields well above the 60-70% range.


An earlier rumor saying the A20 chip would remain 3nm was retracted.</p></b>
