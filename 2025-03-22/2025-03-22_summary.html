University students demonstrated against the arrest of Istanbul's mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a third straight day on Friday, even as the Turkish leader issued a stern warning, declaring that street protests would not be tolerated. His arrest this week intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition. On Friday, police in Istanbul used pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city's historic aqueduct while hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers. Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.</p>

When demonstrators gathered ­at Istanbul's city hall last week in outrage at the arrest of mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, 26-year-old Azra said she was initially too scared to defy a ban on gatherings. He also denies terrorism charges levelled at him over collaboration with a leftwing political coalition prior to local elections last year, which saw major losses for Erdoğan's Justice and Development party (AKP). “In this climate where Europe feels it has to defend itself against Russia alone, there's more talk about engaging Erdoğan.” There will be no concrete repercussions, because of the way Turkey has positioned itself in this new global arena as an important power,” he said. The CHP is expected to push ahead with declaring İmamoğlu its ­candidate for president this weekend, after a symbolic primary vote.</p>

Schiphol is implementing energy storage solutions, such as iron flow batteries, to reduce reliance on diesel generators and improve environmental sustainability. In the end, Heathrow Airport was only out of action for 18 hours, but it left vital cargo - such as life-saving organs - stranded mid-transit. Farah Rafeeq, 24, says she is frustrated to miss part of her close friend's wedding after the fire which closed Heathrow Airport on Friday. They have found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport with Turkish Airlines and Bangkok Airways that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander also said in a statement earlier that rail tickets can be used flexibly today to help passengers with their journeys.</p>

British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expects to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday. Officials walk through the North Hyde electrical substation in London on Saturday March 22, 2025, which caught fire Thursday night. Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe's busiest air hub. Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year. “I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.</p>

At home, she is under pressure from her coalition partner, the far-right League, to keep supporting Trump and Musk. On Friday, the League's leader and Meloni's deputy Matteo Salvini said he had a phone call with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, in which he praised "the remarkable American capabilities in key areas such as satellite communications". Crosetto said that when the situation calmed down, talks would move back to a technical level.

The new surveillance documents show Philby was being bugged and followed in this period. Ironic, since Philby's own memoir, My Silent War, revealed that he himself had bugged many communist sympathisers on behalf of the British government. The “watchers” made fun of their target, describing his “weatherbeaten face” and “untidy hair”. “We have noticed this previously with drivers of similar ‘models' at which small boys and their like are inclined to jeer.” They later note that he has no mirror, “in breach of law”, which makes tailing him easier.</p>

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a drone attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing three people and wounded 14, Ukrainian officials said Saturday, despite agreeing to a limited ceasefire. It said 100 were intercepted and a further 63 lost, likely having been electronically jammed. Local authorities said two people were injured and there was damage to six apartments when a Ukrainian drone hit a high-rise apartment block in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on Friday night. Zelenskyy told reporters after Wednesday's call with Trump that Ukraine and U.S. negotiators will discuss technical details related to the partial ceasefire during a meeting in Saudi Arabia on Monday. Russian negotiators are also set to hold separate talks with U.S. officials there.</p>

Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, as well as the two Donbass republics, officially joined Russia in autumn 2022 following a series of referendums. Kiev has never recognized the votes and continues to claim sovereignty over the territories, as well as over Crimea, which joined Russia back in 2014. “There are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory,” the envoy said, adding that it could also be particularly difficult for Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky as it could jeopardize his political career. The interview with Witkoff came out shortly after he held face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of diplomatic efforts aimed at mediating an end to the conflict.

Currently, 26,000 immigrant children receive government-funded legal representation, but many are representing themselves in immigration court due to a shortage of attorneys. These services are critical not only as a matter of fundamental fairness – children should not be asked to stand up in court alone against a trained government attorney – but also for protecting children from trafficking, abuse and exploitation, and for helping immigration courts run more efficiently.” Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), said the Trump administration had gone “all-in today on endangering unaccompanied children and interfering with their right to due process, breaking with decades of bipartisan congressional support for legal services for vulnerable children”. There are more than 600,000 immigrant children who have crossed the US-Mexico border without a legal guardian or parent since 2019, according to government data. Ice agents are directed to categorize unaccompanied immigrants into three groups: “flight risk”, “public safety” and “border security”.</p>

Speaking with reporters in Kyiv on Friday during a visit from the president of the Czech Republic, Zelensky emphasized the need to protect civilian infrastructure, saying that his office was preparing a list of sites, including ports and railways, that were a priority. … There is no silence only because Putin does not accept this proposal.” On Instagram on Saturday, she posted photos of the family she'd lost: her 17-year-old sister, holding a bouquet of pink and white flowers, celebrating her birthday last week; her parents taking a selfie, faces pressed against each other; the girls with their mom, flashing peace signs with manicured nails, alongside the caption, “Soft clouds to you. “Just one perfect moment to lose your loved ones,” she said in the post.</p>

As delegations from Moscow and Kyiv prepare to meet US negotiators in Riyadh, details of pact remain unclear Just hours later, Ukraine accused Russia of breaking its promises, with Zelenskyy reporting strikes on civilian infrastructure – including a hospital in Sumy. Zelenskyy's warning last month in Washington – that Russia cannot be trusted, backed by evidence of more than 25 ceasefire violations – was the initial spark that led to his dressing down by Trump and the vice-president, JD Vance. The UK and European leaders have warned that Putin would face serious consequences if he violated a temporary ceasefire agreement. The Kremlin has also signalled it would reject any presence of western troops in Ukraine – something Kyiv views as essential to securing lasting security guarantees.</p>

As part of the agreement, Columbia has agreed to ban face masks on campus, empower security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and place its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department under a new official. This move has been met with criticism from professors and academics, who worry that it sets a dangerous precedent for government control over academic institutions. The administration has also targeted law firms that it claims have helped Trump's political opponents or prosecuted him unfairly. Researchers have reported receiving notices that their projects have been terminated due to "unsafe antisemitic actions," including the development of an AI-based tool to help nurses detect the health deterioration of a patient two days earlier than other early warning systems, research on uterine fibroids, and a study designed to improve the safety of blood transfusion therapies for adults, children and newborns. The Trump administration's actions have been seen as an attempt to exert control over academic institutions and stifle free speech.</p>

Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi is living in Belgium's Antwerp with wife Preeti Choksi, a citizen of Belgium, a report by Associates Times said. However, the diamantaire from Gujarat left Antigua and Barbuda for medical treatment though he remains a citizen of the island nation, its foreign minister EP Chet Greene told news agency ANI on March 19. It is being speculated that if the temporary Belgian residency converts into a permanent residency, it may give Mr Choksi freedom to travel across countries in Europe, which could make it difficult for India to tighten the extradition net around him. Mr Choksi fled India in January 2018 after the PNB fraud case surfaced. In December 2024, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told parliament that properties worth Rs 22,280 crore had been restored or sold off to pay back debts of wanted individuals like Mr Choksi.</p>

Regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel on the Lebanese border erupted in September into all-out war. Hezbollah condemned Israel's return to war in Gaza but did not suggest it would resume hostilities on the border. Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding. U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.</p>

This violence tears at the fabric of our communities and leaves wounds that may never heal.” If you have any information, particularly video or images that could help identify those responsible, please come forward and contact the Las Cruces police department immediately,” she added.</p>

Since 1975, glaciers, which do not include the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, have lost more than 9,000 billion tonnes of mass. This is an issue as permafrost contains a vast amount of organic carbon and other nutrients. If climate change-induced glacier melting continues at the current rate, it can have catastrophic impacts on these people. The US, led by President Trump, has deported 333 Indian nationals in January 2025 as part of its tough stance against illegal immigration. However, legal immigration has also increased, with more visas being issued to Indians for business, tourism, and skilled work.</p>

In a memo on Friday, president also revoked clearances for Antony Blinken, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Letitia James Donald Trump moved to revoke security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a string of other top Democrats and political enemies in a presidential memo issued late on Friday. Trump's decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike on his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”. Others on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss's alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment. An NBC News poll published last weekend found the Democratic party's popularity has dropped to a record low – only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party.</p>

British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expects to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday. Officials walk through the North Hyde electrical substation in London on Saturday March 22, 2025, which caught fire Thursday night. Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe's busiest air hub. Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year. “I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.</p>

University students demonstrated against the arrest of Istanbul's mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a third straight day on Friday, even as the Turkish leader issued a stern warning, declaring that street protests would not be tolerated. His arrest this week has sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition. On Friday, police in Istanbul used pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city's historic aqueduct while hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers. Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.</p>

Health policy has quickly become a major touchstone of the Maga (“Make America great again”) right, as the Trump administration undertakes a shock and awe campaign that has dramatically altered public health institutions. Additionally, congressional Republicans have floated major cuts to Medicaid, a health insurance program for the low-income and disabled that insures about 72 million Americans, to extend tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy. This money comes with no questions asked, which is a world of difference from traditional “welfare”, or temporary assistance for needy families (TANF). Other articles in the issue propose home care cooperatives, to provide better working conditions to home care workers as baby boomers age; reinvest in public hospitals and public production of pharmaceuticals, such as California's $100m investment in local, public insulin production; or to provide social insurance for times people can't work. “Prevailing approaches to health policy are leaving people in America behind, including rural and low-income residents and people from historically marginalized communities,” Kathryn A Phillips, the editor-in-chief of Health Affairs Scholar, said in a statement about the issue.</p>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/22/gold-price-trump-trade-war'>Gold has surged amid economic uncertainty. Should you buy some?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> The Guardian US&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 11:02:00 <p>
Deluce said gold should be purchased “from reputable suppliers who insure all deliveries”, and financial magazines including Forbes have lists devoted to gold-selling companies. To the uninitiated, an equally important question is: what kind of gold should people buy? Menendez had also accumulated, through nefarious means, some one-kilo gold bars, each of which, at today's prices, is worth just under $100,000. She said gold prices are rising “in response to inflation, geopolitical unrest and economic uncertainty”. As Trump shows no signs of backing down on his trade battles, having a few dog tags of gold stored in a safe space, or, if you're Menendez, “jammed into jackets and boots”, might not be the worst option.</p>

TOKYO (AP) — Foreign ministers from Japan, China and South Korea sought trilateral cooperation on common ground in areas like aging, declining births, natural disasters and the green economy at a meeting that took place at a time of growing tensions. At a joint news conference after the talks, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said he, his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and South Korea's Cho Tae-yul agreed to promote mutual understanding and trust, while tackling shared and multi-generational concerns to gain wider support for trilateral cooperation. Saturday's meeting focused on plans for a trilateral leaders' summit later this year amid growing political and economic uncertainty at home and challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump. Iwaya said he will accelerate efforts toward achieving a leaders' summit in Japan later this year. Separately, delegations from Japan and China later Saturday held their first high-level economic dialogue since April 2019, attended by dozens of officials from finance, economy, transportation, environment, health and labor ministries.</p>

LONDON (AP) — Heathrow Airport was up and running Saturday and airlines worked to clear the backlog after a fire at a nearby electricity substation knocked out power to Europe's busiest airport, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of thousands of people around the world. About 4,000 tons of cargo were also stranded by the closure, according to Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and leadership consultant. First is airport operations and understanding, from an electrical system point of view, what has been impacted, if anything,” she said. Five other air hubs in southeastern England identify themselves as London airports, but they are much smaller than Heathrow. Its CEO Thomas Woldbye said “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar fire.</p>

“This was a surprising result,” said Frank Muller-Karger, distinguished professor and biological oceanographer at USF's College of Marine Science. But these algae patches were met with the right conditions to grow and perpetuate blooms. This population of algae, now separated from the Sargasso Sea, forms new blooms every year thanks to having enough light, nutrients and warmer temperatures,” he said. Almost annually for more than a decade, giant clumps of goop from the 5,000-mile-wide sargassum belt have washed ashore in the Caribbean, and from Florida to Mexico, creating problems for local authorities and businesses that rely on tourism. In 2023, scientists at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) warned of a “perfect pathogen storm [with] implications for both marine life and public health”, having found high levels of the flesh-eating Vibrio bacteria lurking in the decomposing vegetation.</p>

It's difficult to track the tangible impacts boycotts have on companies and exactly how many people participate in them. Some Americans feel companies are giving up core moral values in bowing to the president. Hispanic activists have similarly called on their community to boycott companies, calling it the Latino Freeze Movement. The movement calls for a boycott on companies that have scaled back their DEI initiatives, and asks for participants to not spend money on non-essentials “until they show us that they care about our minority and immigrant populations”.

Incoming International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Kirsty Coventry has said she does not support banning athletes from the Olympics based on their countries' involvement in armed conflicts. The IOC also insisted that international sports federations follow suit, leading to both countries being excluded from major global sporting events. When asked by Sky News a day after being elected to the post whether she opposed banning nations from the Olympics due to military conflicts, Coventry said: “I am, but I believe each situation must be considered individually.” Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Coventry on her IOC election, saying that her “experience and dedication to the true advancement of the noble Olympic ideals will ensure your success in such a responsible position.” Russian officials have repeatedly slammed Western nations for politicizing international sports and exerting pressure on sports federations to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes for political reasons.</p>

Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has issued a stark warning that his country is teetering on the brink of a new conflict, following Israel's vow to retaliate against rocket attacks launched from Lebanese territory. The Lebanese prime minister's statement served as a stern reminder that his country will not be drawn into another conflict without a fight, asserting that "all security and military measures must be taken to show that Lebanon decides on matters of war and peace." This fragile truce has been jeopardised by the recent surge in rocket attacks, which has prompted former Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman to lambast Prime Minister Netanyahu for failing to restore security. The prime minister of October 7 is a danger to Israel's security." Reuters has reported that the fresh escalation has brought the Middle East to a boiling point, with Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam reiterating his concerns that Israel's attacks risk dragging his country into another war.</p>

After Israeli artillery and airstrikes hit south Lebanon on Saturday, the beleaguered nation's prime minister, Nawaf Salam, warned that his country was at risk of being drawn into a "new war". Saturday's exchange came days after Israel effectively ended the ceasefire in Gaza with Palestinian militant group Hamas, an ally of Hezbollah. Israel later engaged Hezbollah after it fired at the nation to show solidarity with Hamas. Over the next few months, Israel killed top Hamas and Hezbollah leaders by employing precision strikes. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said the Lebanese government bore responsibility for any rocket salvoes from its territory.</p>

"When the president was shot, he went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the president," Witkoff said of Putin. "This is the kind of connection that we have been able to reestablish through a simple word called communication, which many people would say I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. Earlier this week, the two leaders engaged in a two-hour phone call to discuss ending Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

Last week members of the UK Subs, a British punk band, were denied entry and detained after they landed at Los Angeles international airport. Even before the most recent spate of detentions, forecast visits to the country this year had been revised downward from a projected 5% rise to a 9% decrease by Tourism Economics, an industry monitoring group, which cited “polarising Trump Administration policies and rhetoric”, particularly around tariffs. “You're looking at a much weaker economic engine than what otherwise would've been, not just because of tariffs, but the rhetoric and condescending tone around it.” A Canadian actor made headlines this week when she revealed US authorities had handcuffed her and moved her out of state to a detention center, where she spent several weeks in “inhumane conditions” despite not having been accused of any crime. Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told Fast Company that travellers now viewed entering the US as “too difficult or unpredictable”.</p>

Refuse workers have been on strike for over a week, leading to bags of rubbish piling up across the city. "I used to have a tremor in my left hand and that's disappeared over the last 12 months."

Elon Musk's controversial gesture at US President Donald Trump's inauguration earlier this year was "definitely a Nazi salute", his estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson has said. The crowd is equally to blame, and I feel like people are not talking about that. Ms Wilson is not concerned about the Tesla CEO but she feels "annoyed" whenever people associate her with Musk.Ms Wilson, who came out as transgender in 2020, had in 2022 filed a plea to get her name legally changed, for she did not want to be related to her biological father in "any way, shape or form. "Nearly two years after she filed the petition, Musk talked about her in an interview with Jordan Peterson, asserting  his daughter was “killed by the woke mind virus.” Ms Wilson said she was not left with "any room to care anymore." "I had all this pent-up energy, I had wanted to speak out for so long after being (essentially) defamed in a book, after being doxxed," she added.A few weeks ago, Musk appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast and addressed the controversy surrounding the alleged Nazi salute, which he performed in front of the Republican crowd.</p>

Ms Wilson discussed her personal life in an interview with Teen Vogue, wherein she was asked how her parents' politics changed and whether Elon Musk was always the way he is today. Further, she noted that a person's profile on Twitter (now X) was not "who they are in reality." He would speak at length about climate change and other risks to the planet. But it all changed around 2020 when he became a frequent user and poster on X, which was Twitter at the time. This was also the same time Vivian came out as transgender and changed her name.</p>

US President Donald Trump made good Friday on a threat to revoke the security clearances of his predecessor Joe Biden and several senior former White House and national security officials. "I hereby direct every executive department and agency head ... to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals," Trump said. Fiona Hill, a British-born intelligence analyst who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, including as an advisor in Trump's White House, is targeted. She is joined by former colleague Alexander Vindman, a Kyiv-born retired senior officer in the US Army who fell foul of Trump after expressing concerns about White House contacts with Russia.

Asthildur Loa Thorsdottir, Iceland's minister for children, abruptly resigned after admitting that she had a baby with a teenage boy over three decades ago. At the time, she was 22, while he was 15, BBC reported.While she has stepped down as the minister for children, Ms Thorsdottir, a member of the centre-left People's Party, has no plans to leave the Parliament.The two met when Ms Thorsdottir worked at Tru og lif (Religion and Life), where Eirik Asmundsson took refuge amid difficult circumstances at home, Icelandic news agency RUV reported on Thursday.She gave birth to the child at 23, while the boy turned 16.In Iceland, the age of consent is 15, and it is illegal to get physical with a person under 18 if you are their mentor or teacher or they remain financially dependent on you or even work for you. Those found guilty can get a maximum sentence of three years in jail.It has been 36 years now and Ms Thorsdottir feels that a "lot of things" have changed. Ms Thorsdottir denied him access despite receiving child support payments from him for 18 years.Last week, a female relative of Mr Ásmundsson tried to contact the Prime Minister twice to discuss the matter. This made Ms Thorsdottir upset as she thought it was "very difficult to get the right story across in the news today".</p>

But this was impossible because of Hachette imprints' vast back- catalogue, which includes key authors such as the punk feminist Virginie Despentes and writers including Lola Lafon. This meant not ordering certain new books, or taking fewer copies and placing them away from prime positions on tables. “A tiny bookshop like ours doing this won't cause much pain [to Hachette], but at least it feels significant for us,” he said. “I think for freedom of expression, pluralism and democracy it can represent a risk,” he said.</p>

The Grand Duke has an excellent real estate portfolio, unique jewels, acres of land, and private holdings -- all contributing to his $4 billion net worth.He has an extraordinary collection of jewels and a sizable estate. Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg is the primary residence of Duke Henri. The gardens of Berg Castle are available to visitors on June 23, Luxembourg's National Day, every year.Fischbach Castle served as Duke Henri's primary residence during his tenure as the heir apparent, before he officially left in 2000.Duke Henri caused a nationwide uproar in 2006 when, a year after his mother, Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte's death, he put some of her diamonds up for auction.Soon after, the monarch came under fire from the public, who claimed he was selling pieces of the country's "national heritage" for extra money.</p>

On being questioned over the NASA astronauts' calculated overtime, Mr Trump said, "Nobody's ever mentioned this to me. "If we don't have Elon...They could be up there for a long time. He's (Elon Musk) is going through a lot right now," the US President said. Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore, who had been at the ISS since June 5 last year, were flown back to Earth early Wednesday in SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.

Last summer China began building several unusual vessels at its Guangzhou shipyard on the south coast. Until recently, Chinese military planners had two options to support an invading force. Or they could use “roro” (roll-on, roll-off) ferries to unload amphibious vehicles into the sea. “How are they going to allow these ferries to send non-amphibious vehicles and trucks onto the beach without a port?” A floating causeway, seen on satellite images of Chinese ports in 2021, was one option. China filed patents for the new barges in 2020, notes Mike Dahm, a former naval intelligence officer.</p>

Women sit on their three wheeler tri-cycles waiting for clients at a market place in Hwedza, Zimbabwe, Thursday, March 6, 2025. In many parts of rural sub-Saharan Africa, women have long been excluded from mainstream economic activities such as operating public transportation. However, three-wheelers powered by green energy are reversing that trend, offering financial opportunities and a newfound sense of importance. Josephine Nyevhe, a volunteer village health worker, conducts weekly visits on her electric tricycle in Hwedza Zimbabwe, Thursday, March 6 2025.

Conservationists find critically endangered species thriving on Indian Ocean island of Aride The tree was once found on other, larger islands in the Seychelles archipelago but its sturdy wood was harvested for firewood, leading to its disappearance from everywhere except Aride. “But it's been raining a lot more in the past few years than before.” Ten were brought back nearly a decade ago as part of an conservation programme to re-establish these herbivorous ecosystem engineers on the island. The tortoises play a key role in dispersing seeds, including those of the Wright's gardenia, and as they forage bird species follow in their path to catch insects and invertebrates that they expose.</p>

It follows an earlier Trump administration decision to end what it called the "broad abuse" of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there's war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the US. DHS said parolees without a lawful basis to stay in the US "must depart" before their parole termination date. Cuba generally accepted about one deportation flight a month, while Venezuela and Nicaragua refused to take any. It was a part of the Biden administration's approach to encourage people to come through new legal channels while cracking down on those who crossed the border illegally.

Russian attacks killed two people in Ukraine's south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia late on Friday. Germany on Friday approved €3bn (£2.5bn) in new military aid for Ukraine, including artillery munitions and air defence systems, government officials have said. Ukraine accused Russia on Friday of illegally pressuring Ukrainians in occupied territory to change their legal status or leave, and said it would report the practice to the international criminal court. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, issued a decree on Thursday saying Ukrainian citizens living “in Russia without legal grounds” should “regulate” their status by 10 September. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, expressed his unwavering support for Russia's war in Ukraine during a meeting with Russia's security council secretary, Sergei Shoigu, in Pyongyang on Friday.</p>

“All Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Schimel has also echoed unfounded concerns about unproven voter fraud that Trump raised following his 2020 loss. Despite all of that, Schimel has repeatedly said he would not let his feelings about Trump impact any rulings he would make on the state Supreme Court, which came one vote away from reversing Trump's loss in Wisconsin in 2020. A spokesman for Crawford's campaign said, “Schimel has spent his entire career on bent knee to right-wing special interests, we assumed he had this endorsement locked up months ago.” This isn't the first time Trump has gotten involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race.</p>

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to visit the Philippines, the first stop in his first trip to Asia next week, for talks that will include increasing deterrence against aggression in the disputed South China Sea, a Philippine official said Friday. In the U.S., chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell later said Hegseth will visit Hawaii to meet civilian and military leaders in the Indo-Pacific Command then tour U.S. military facilities in Guam and receive briefings on capabilities before flying to the Philippines and Japan. In his first telephone talk with Teodoro last month, Hegseth “reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and its importance for maintaining a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” according to a readout provided by Pentagon spokesperson John Ullyot after the Feb. 5 call. Beijing has warned Washington, in return, to stay out of what it calls a purely Asian dispute and stop actions that endanger regional harmony and stability.

As Tesla stocks continue to slide - down 5 per cent in the past five days and more than 50 per cent from its December peak - Gerber insists that leadership change is necessary.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday gutted three oversight offices by placing more than 100 workers on paid leave, a Trump administration official and two former officials said. “Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.“ White House officials are reviewing federal agencies' downsizing plans, a move expected to result in the mass firing of thousands of government workers within the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Friday. Trump had given the agencies until 13 March to draw up plans for a second wave of mass layoffs as part of his rapid-fire effort to reshape and reduce the size of the federal government, which he has called bloated and inefficient. Thousands of workers fired in Trump's effort to slash the government workforce have sued to have their jobs reinstated by federal judges.</p>

On 17 March, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal (CFA), the city's top bench, rejected an application from Jimmy Lai. Although the trial is well under way, Lai's legal team have been trying to appeal against the decision to bar his preferred lawyer, Tim Owen KC, from representing him. Although Owen had been admitted to represent Lai before the interpretation was issued, Hong Kong's national security committee nonetheless instructed the immigration department to deny him a work permit. While the CFA did not give a reason for rejecting Lai's appeal this week, it did so using a rule that is normally reserved for applications with “no reasonable grounds” or that are “frivolous”. He will not be able to instruct his chosen lawyer in any future proceedings.</p>

Friday's meeting between Kim and Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Security Council secretary, followed a South Korean intelligence assessment in late February that North Korea had likely sent additional troops to Russia after its forces suffered heavy casualties fighting in the Russian-Ukraine war. Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the two countries' leaders, though it remains to be seen when it might take effect and what targets would be off-limits. North Korean and Russia media didn't say whether any new agreements were reached before Shoigu departed Pyongyang later on Friday. North Korea often responds to major U.S.-South Korean military drills with its own weapons tests and fiery rhetoric. Hours after this year's Freedom Shield training began on March 10, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea.</p>

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Canadians travelling to the United States for longer trips are being reminded of new registration rules that will kick in next month. The rule was part of U.S. President Donald Trump's “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” executive order, which was signed on Jan. 20 and applies to anyone who is not an American citizen or permanent resident. “Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution.” The rule, which goes into effect April 11, will apply to some Canadians, including “snowbirds” who travel south in winter months, according to immigration lawyer Rosanna Berardi.</p>

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The parents of a U.S. college student who vanished almost two weeks ago in the resort town of Punta Cana have asked authorities to declare her legally dead. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.” Sudiksha Konanki and five female friends had traveled to the Caribbean nation on March 3 for spring break.

MESSMORE, Pa. – Meteorologists with the National Weather Service say they never know what they'll encounter during a storm survey and while it's not unusual to come across something unexpected, discovering a mysterious creature lurking in the background of one of their photos certainly makes for a memorable experience. Giant Bug Found At An Arkansas Walmart Identified As A Jurassic-era Insect When they shined their headlights at it, the creature reportedly disappeared over a 40-foot embankment, never to be seen again. Despite actually seeing apparitions of a figure, many believe there's more to these encounters than meets the eye.

(In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.) In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

The deal deserves "serious attention," Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, added earlier this week, without directly criticizing CK Hutchison. It's not immediately clear what steps Hong Kong or Beijing could take to block the transaction, which isn't yet final and still requires consent from various regulators. He noted that ports do offer a great business for BlackRock, which will now have 100 in its portfolio if this deal goes through. This is not the first time CK Hutchison or Li Ka-shing, nicknamed "Superman" for his business prowess in Hong Kong, have faced criticism from Beijing.

Opponents, meanwhile, say sellers should get to dictate how their homes are marketed and argue that the MLS listing requirement violates antitrust laws. They're most common in high-end real estate, where celebrities or other VIP clients may be keen on keeping a transaction low profile. While Clear Cooperation was designed to reduce pocket listings, they're still permitted under some circumstances, including if a property is only marketed within one brokerage. Fair housing advocates generally support the policy, saying pocket listings can hurt traditionally underrepresented buyers' ability to compete in today's market.

Now the focus is on longer-term retention incentives such as retirement and health insurance benefits that make workers want to stay, Pollak said. In 2022, wage growth contributed to people quitting their jobs for higher-paying options, Allison Shrivastava, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Yahoo Finance. One caveat that can impact those lower starting salary figures: When people change fields, they tend to take a pay cut initially. “Only about 30% of job seekers say they want to switch industries, but more than 50% of recently hired workers got their jobs in a new industry,” Pollak told me.“That suggests that workers who keep an open mind, expand their search, invest in new skills, and follow opportunity are disproportionately successful.” Click here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more</p>

Boeing caught a break this week with two pieces of good news that sent its stock up more than 10% over the past five days. The Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Platform is something no other country can match, according to President Donald Trump. The contract is welcome news for Boeing, which has been struggling with a federal probe over quality control issues. Two months later, CEO Dave Calhoun announced his intent to step down at the end of 2024. "Boeing for this year was always going to be about safety, quality and stability.</p>

"April 2 is liberation day for our country because we're finally going to be taking in money," he said Monday during a stop at the Kennedy Center. The concern is that already battered markets might not realize how high some of those numbers may be, especially on allies such as Europe that Trump has criticized relentlessly without yet slapping with new duties. "It's called April 2, and that's going to be tariffs," Trump said at another point this past week, even refusing to back down when his interviewer, Laura Ingraham of Fox News, responded by bringing up the chances of a recession. Trump and his aides plan to calculate their so-called effective tariff rate that combines all the factors Trump deems as fodder for retaliation, including things like domestic consumption taxes in Europe that have traditionally not been considered in trade talks.

Three Wall Street strategy teams have cut their S&P 500 (^GSPC) outlooks amid the recent market drawdown in markets. Economic growth forecasts have been falling as the uncertainty around President Trump's policy plans wears on. Meanwhile, other strategists are starting to talk more about how the path ahead might not be so linear. "While we don't believe that a pullback beyond the 10% drawdown that has already been sustained is inevitable, we do believe that the path for stocks between now and December has gotten rockier with stronger headwinds," RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina wrote in a recent note when lowering her year-end S&P 500 target to 6,200 from 6,600. For what it's worth, that kind of environment could be an interpretation of the Fed's most recent economic forecasts released on Wednesday, which showed the central bank revising inflation projections higher for this year while cutting its economic growth forecast.</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has ruled out "tax and spend" policies, signalling that she will neither raise taxes nor government budgets in her critical Spring Statement next week. In her autumn Budget, Reeves increased the levels of tax and public spending significantly – paid for largely through extra taxes on businesses which proved highly controversial. "What I've done so far is put money into public services," Reeves insisted in her BBC interview. But Labour grandee Lord Blunkett wants Reeves to "loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules", calling them "Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst".

A Mokena resident won back more than $100,000 that was lost in an overseas cryptocurrency scam thanks to a Mokena police detective and Will County prosecutors. “The victim advised that in July of 2024, they responded to an online job ad presented as a commission-based, remote work opportunity aimed at optimizing app developers,” police said. Police investigators and prosecutors worked to freeze and seize the funds so they could be returned to the victim, police said. Mokena Police Chief Brian Benton thanked the work of Mokena Police Detective Darin McVicker, who worked “vigorously to locate the lost money and to seek out those responsible for committing this fraud.” Benton also thanked Assistant State's Attorneys Mike Casson and Dant Faulk for their assistance in the investigation.</p>

TRON founder Justin Sun has shared his thoughts about potentially reducing TRX block rewards, drawing parallels to Bitcoin's halving mechanism. Sun explained that as Bitcoin's (BTC) network matured and its price increased, block rewards were gradually reduced through the halving mechanism. Unlike Bitcoin's automated halving mechanism that cuts rewards by 50% approximately every four years, TRX's proposed reduction would be implemented through community governance.

Sidechains, rollups and other scaling solutions offer more options for holders who want Ethereum-style utility while remaining aligned with Bitcoin. This prepared the ground for BTCfi, where holders can access a range of income-generating solutions like staking, lending and derivatives. More importantly, it has accounted for a sizable share of new liquidity flowing into BTC, besides institutional products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, as Bitcoiners know, this is a conservative estimate and would be accelerated by accelerating BTC price action or even more Bitcoin DeFi adoption. Yield-bearing BTC derivatives on Bitcoin-aligned sidechains are a 100x improvement, offering self-custody and previously unavailable yield sources to Bitcoin holders.</p>

A new government outlook may bring crypto firms back to the United States after years of regulatory confusion.

Rather than having any promoter who could be responsible for their sale, they were the products of diffuse networks, attributable to no one. These offshore structures didn't just provide a compliance function — they also offered tax advantages.

He said, “If we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.” As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold's prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue.</p>

As Bitcoin's price struggles to break through key resistance levels, a worrying shift has been cited among big investors or whales. Whale participation often influences price trajectory, which could cause Bitcoin to continue dropping in the upcoming weeks. However, if buying pressure intensifies at critical support zones and creates a strong defense, BTC may move in an upward direction.

Astronomers call these cosmic ghosts "light echoes" — and that's what high-school junior Julian Shapiro found while scanning the cosmos for supernova remnants. But in between classes and scoping out potential colleges, he's also an independent astronomer who presents at global conferences like this week's APS meeting. Related: High school students who came up with 'impossible' proof of Pythagorean theorem discover 9 more solutions to the problem And if his estimates hold up, he thinks it could be a viable candidate for the largest light echo ever discovered. Plavin is also interested in seeing how this new light echo measures up to others — whether it occurred faster or slower than existing examples.</p>

Birds are often associated with flight, but not all of them take to the skies. The sternum (breastbone) with its central ridge (keel) — where flight muscles attach — also becomes smaller, Wright said. Although flightless birds are uncommon today, fossils reveal that they were far more prevalent and diverse a few thousand years ago, Tim Blackburn, a professor of invasion biology at University College London, told Live Science in an email. A 2020 study co-authored by Blackburn and published in the journal Science Advances found that there would be four times as many flightless bird species on Earth today were it not for human-driven extinctions.

The ministry has also advised cricketers, Bollywood celebrities, and social media influencers to avoid promoting these platforms, as they could be misleading Indian users into financial risks. The DGGI is investigating around 700 foreign e-gaming companies that have failed to register for GST and are evading taxes. This action was taken in collaboration with I4C (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The government is actively working to eliminate tax fraud in online gaming and protect users from financial risks. This latest plan offers unlimited calls, data, SMS, and a free OTT subscription, making it an attractive option for cricket lovers.</p>

CycloTech CEO Hans-Georg Kinsky notes, "With our BlackBird, we are showing how this innovative technology will open up the market for flying cars." This compact design means they can be more easily integrated into existing environments without requiring special infrastructure. Given CycloTech's emphasis on safety features like its multi-rotor redundancy and advanced maneuverability, how much trust would you place in the technology to feel comfortable flying in the BlackBird or a similar vehicle when it's ready for passenger use?

Yahoo has indicated that it intends to maintain a long-term partnership with Regent and TechCrunch, with a focus on expanding audience reach and fostering content development.This acquisition raises questions about the future direction of TechCrunch, but also shows the continued change happening within digital media.

This collaboration comes at a pivotal time for the quick-service restaurant sector, where digital transformation is no longer optional but essential. These voice agents don't just replace human labor; they're designed to enhance the ordering experience by being consistent, friendly, and efficient—particularly during high-volume periods like lunch rushes or major sporting events. With higher accuracy and the ability to upsell at scale, voice AI can also boost check averages while reducing strain on front-line employees. The company is building on its proprietary platform, Byte by Yum!, which integrates POS, inventory management, labor scheduling, delivery logistics, and customer data into a single technology ecosystem. When integrated thoughtfully, AI can act as a force multiplier across an organization, empowering staff and enhancing every aspect of the customer journey.</p>

Berry said that there is plenty of health care around Grove City and in central Ohio, but it can be expensive. “We're lucky enough not to have an accessibility problem because we've got some of the best hospitals in the world located right here in central Ohio — it's just we have an affordability problem,” Berry said. About one in four working-age adults in Grove City do not receive employer-sponsored health care, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The draft program includes an income cap of $30,000 with an annual grant maximum of $400 for individuals and $600 for family plans, but Berry said the committee will evaluate all of the numbers and could make changes.</p>

That's exactly what we are doing today – shining a light on how we can support our health workers, provide a quality, affordable experience for our patients and families, and strengthen communities. Which in turn leads to improved outcomes and a better quality of life for all,” House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle said. “In Delaware, we have higher rates of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer than the rest of the nation which places a strain on our healthcare facilities and contributes to higher healthcare costs. At the same time, our much-needed healthcare workforce struggles with burnout stemming from the day-to-day stress of caregiving, administrative burdens of dealing with insurance, and even violent threats and assaults. "I am certain our cross-functional collaboration will have an exponential impact on these issues.”</p>

By targeting donor contributions, they risk creating the very lapses in care and quality they profess to oppose,” says a news release provided by Matt Moeller, director of marketing and communications at South County Health, the parent organization of South County Hospital. The group held a meeting on Jan. 28 at South Kingstown High School, where former patients, providers and stakeholders spoke.</p>

Other upper Ohio Valley medical facilities are preparing for increased workloads as EORH patients seek care elsewhere. Cumberland Trail Fire Captain Jeremy Rife said it is normal for his department to take multiple patients to EORH a day as it is one of the closest facilities for them. Fellows echoed this concern, noting that a particularly bad flu and COVID season has already been overwhelming hospitals in recent months. Patients with a preference for EORH or who have  providers there are also being forced to make changes, Rife said. Health Department Deputy Commissioner Robert Sproul emphasized that Belmont County is already an area with a shortage of physicians.</p>

Dozens of locals marched to a Tesla showroom in San Jose on Friday, protesting federal cuts proposed by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. Protesters were focused on the proposed cuts to healthcare and social security. "We're here today to show the billionaires that they have no place in our democracy," said Lucy Ortiz of Silicon Valley Rising. "They have no place in our government making decisions for people who are impacted by this, and they're not gonna be able to get away with taking apart our democracy; that's why we're here." Friday's demonstration was just one of several this week across the county, all meant to protest the proposed cuts.</p>

WICHITA FALLS, Texas (KAUZ) - High school students got an up-close and personal look at the many career paths available in healthcare, thanks to a collaboration between the North Central Area Education Center, MSU Texas and Vernon College. This healthcare high school tour is sparking the interest of high school students in the area, long before they set foot in a formal college classroom setting. “A lot of times students go in knowing I want to help somebody. I want to help somebody, but many times they don't know all of the different programs that we have to offer and so this gives them exposure to every single one of them, whether it's radiology, social work, dental hygiene, athletic training, all of them. Really give them a good idea about what not only does it look like in college, but what it could look like as their career,“ Rask said.</p>

The league is waiting with bated breath for a decision from Aaron Rodgers on his playing future. 2 overall pick and opt for the likes of pass rusher Abdul Carter or receiver/corner Travis Hunter, a run at Milton could make some sense. They did bring in Kenny Pickett via trade, but that shouldn't preclude them from continuing to search for a long-term option at QB. In theory, they could go back to Russell Wilson, who started 11 games for them last season. There is a world where Rodgers retires and Wilson heads back to Pittsburgh, leaving them with little options at the position.</p>

For BYU: Fresh off their first NCAA Tournament win since 2012, the Cougars are playing in their biggest game since the days of Jimmermania. A win over the Badgers would put BYU in the Sweet 16 for just the third time in program history.

For Wisconsin: The Badgers are now 17-4 in the tournament's first round since 2002 and 6-6 in the Dig Dance under Greg Gard, but haven't reached a Sweet 16 since 2017.

4 in the Official World Golf Rankings -- just behind Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm. Coming into the 2025 Valspar Championship this week, he had missed three cuts across five events in 2025. After the round, Hovland was candid about his recent struggles and explained what's prevented him from making confident, consistent swings. If everything feels like the ball should be going one way, and instead, it's coming off the club face and starting somewhere else, it's impossible to make confident swings consistently -- especially, as Hovland noted, at more difficult courses. If he can put together three straight good days and notch his first win in over a year, perhaps he can carry that confidence and belief forward to become a real threat in big tournaments again.</p>

The Vikings have shown interest in adding Ryan Tannehill, but no deal has been discussed, per Fox Sports. Tannehill played for the Tennessee Titans from 2019 to 2023 but didn't sign with a team in 2024. The 36-year-old was adamant that it would take the exact right scenario for him to join a team, saying "nothing really felt right" during free agency last offseason. As a result, Tannehill didn't take any snaps during the 2024 season, last playing in January of 2024. In his 11-year career,  the former NFL Comeback Player of the Year has played in 155 games, with an 81-70 starting record, 34,881 passing yards, 216 touchdowns and 115 interceptions.</p>

So tariffs on Chinese goods equate to $112 million of the company's $5.1 billion in sales.” Though these sales impacts may seem relatively minor, they represent a surprising hit to an industry and sport Trump holds dear. Though a large part of Trump's tariffs on Canada were delayed, should they go into effect, hockey fans could see some impact.

That's more travel for sports than for policy announcements or official duties, though a long January swing took Trump to tour damage from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and wildfires in Los Angeles. He then gave a speech and visited the floor of Las Vegas' Circa Resort & Casino before heading to Doral, Florida, to address a House Republican policy conference. Trump has long built his public and political persona around sporting events, and relishes turning up at live events to hear cheers from the crowd, even if some in attendance boo him. The president has used most Saturdays and Sundays to play golf at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, though he also sometimes remained in Washington to give weekend speeches. Trump was a candidate when he went to the 2023 NCAA wrestling championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>

Signs, alternately called signals, used by my baseball and softball teams ranged from devious to ridiculously simple. My dad was manager of our local American Legion team and he entered us in the Grape Belt to pick up experience playing older teams. Well, the count went to 3 and 0 on our ace pitcher Terry Leja, a left handed batter. Terry had interpreted his coach's hand gesture as a “don't swing” signal, so he was understandably confused. He was skeptical but made sure to go over our signals — real and imagined — before every game from that day forward.</p>

RL Strength and Conditioning holds free events for children every Wednesday and then every other Saturday at the Bellaire Presbyterian Church at 3599 Guernsey St., across from Bellaire High School from 5-7 p.m. We've even had rappers and singers come in, just because not all kids are the same. Not everybody's going to the NFL or NBA, but maybe there's somebody that in the community doing good that can spark them kids and give them motivation to pull themselves out of whatever they're in and do great,” Leigh said.</p>

After an easy first title defense against Jose Roman, Foreman was paired with a much tougher task in the form of Norton. The fight played out in a way that made Norton's bonafides seem anything less than legitimate. Little did Foreman realize this was a part of Ali's plan as Ali covered up, taking punches to the body and arms as Foreman slowly wore himself out with a steady stream of heavy punches. Lyle had rebounded from back-to-back losses to Jimmy Young and Ali with a sixth-round knockout of Earnie Shavers. Four fights later, Foreman again lost, this time against Tommy Morrison in a fight for the vacant WBO title.</p>

The University of Maine System said Friday that it was found to be in compliance with federal and state laws, as well as NCAA rules that were changed following President Donald Trump's executive order to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in female sports. The statement from UMS followed an announcement from the USDA on Wednesday that said the university system “clearly communicated its compliance with Title IX's requirement to protect equal opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, as articulated in President Donald J. Trump's Executive Order.” Trump's transgender sports order, which he signed last month, prohibits trans women and girls from participating in female sports and states that the federal government will rescind funds from educational programs that don't comply. In 2022, the NCAA adopted a sport-by-sport approach for transgender athletes, deferring to policies set by each sport's national governing body, subject to review and recommendation by an NCAA committee. Last month, following Trump's executive order, the college sports association updated its policy to limit “competition in women's sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.”</p>

Bigger than life in more ways than one, George Foreman captivated the hearts and minds of sports fans and found a place on the kitchen counter of many American homes. With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones," Foreman's family announced on Instagram. He won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics before beating Joe Frazier in Jamaica to capture his first heavyweight championship as a professional in 1973. The fight, dominated by Foreman, is well known for Howard Cosell's legendary call: "Down goes Frazier!" After 10 years away from the ring, Foreman returned in 1987, at age 38, and went on to win 12 straight fights before falling to Evander Holyfield via unanimous decision in 1991.</p>

Villanova fired Kyle Neptune after three seasons in which the Wildcats did not make an NCAA Tournament berth. Neptune succeeded Jay Wright, who won two national championships at the Philadelphia-area school.</p>

The union, which was co-founded by 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic, cited "anti-competitive practices and a blatant disregard for player welfare" in lawsuits filed on Tuesday. The Serb went on to say: "I've seen some changes, but there are some fundamental changes that are still yet to be made and I really hope that all the governing bodies, including PTPA, will come together and solve these issues." Friday's motion also claims the ATP initiated a series of meetings and conversations at this week's Miami Open and alleges "ATP officials have threatened players with adverse consequences for participating in this action". The PTPA says an expedited decision, to prevent defendants communicating with players, is necessary so players can make "informed decisions about their participation in this case, and fully and freely pursue their legal rights without undue influence by the same parties who control their pay cheques and professional endeavour". It added: "Contesting this baseless legal case will divert time, attention, and resources from our core mission, to the detriment of our players and the sport as a whole."</p>

David Goffin handed Carlos Alcaraz his second straight defeat with a stunning comeback Friday night at the Miami Open presented by Itau. Sometimes some matches are tough and you have to fight, like the first round, and you're happy to have a second round like that in a stadium," said Goffin, who also came from a set down to beat Aleksandar Vukic in his Miami opener. I felt that physically I was ready to fight and then I was feeling the ball really well, so it's the kind of night that you feel great and you're happy to fight, you enjoy every point and at the end it's it's a perfect end with a great match point. Goffin won 17 of his 24 net points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while Alcaraz committed 43 unforced errors — including 28 on the forehand wing that also let him down against Draper in Indian Wells.

17 UCF men's tennis team dropped a contested match Saturday evening, losing its first Big 12 away duel of the season at BYU, 4-2. Mehdi Benchakroun and Santiago Giamichelle sat just a game away from taking court two before the contest was abandoned. On court four, Giamichelle tallied his 100th career win at the collegiate level with a dominating 6-2, 6-2, victory over Adam Chodur. Freshman Nicolas Oliveira authored one of his best performances to date as the Brazilian put the Knights within one following a 7-5, 6-3, result over Tygen Goldammer. UCF will look to jump back in the win column on Sunday afternoon as it makes the short journey north to Salt Lake City for a meeting with No.</p>

Arguments over who is the greatest of all time in men's tennis persist, as one former American ATP star now makes his pick. “I had a couple of sets that were like 6-4 but the way his game matched up to mine, it just didn't sit right with me. “Federer for whatever reason his name seemed bigger so I was a little bit more nervous,” said Querrey. Djokovic was the two-time defending champion but Querrey dashed any hopes of a three-peat, knocking him out with an impressive four-set win, 7-6, 6-1, 3-6, 7-6. A win over Nicolas Mahut followed for Querrey before he came up short against Canada's Milos Raonic in the quarter-finals.</p>

It involved that relationship,” Abbott confirmed about Bobbie and Emmett, who decided not to act on their feelings just yet during the Friday, March 21, season finale.
