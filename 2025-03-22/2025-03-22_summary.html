IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir did not wait long to put his stamp on the military.In a flurry of decisions on Wednesday evening, only hours after being sworn in, he made a variety of major and medium-level changes to the IDF.  1. Iran: Zamir publicly said that 2025 was the year of war focused on Gaza and Iran. This was an incredibly explicit and forceful statement. It should put Iran on notice that the clock is ticking on reaching a diplomatic resolution of the nuclear standoff. And yet that statement was potentially less significant than the decision to close down a special full IDF command portfolio that has been part of the high command since 2020, specifically focused on Iran.Why close down the Iran command when Tehran is only becoming a more serious and more immediate issue than it has ever been before?

They noted that previously there was a Depth Command for strategy that was closed and converted. They said that military realities often change in radical ways.However, in the post-October 7 world, they said that even if it is still necessary to have senior officers who spend all of their time thinking about strategy related to Iran, that the IDF's emphasis in terms of funding and human resources must return to combat fighters regarding border threats.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Given that in the last two years, new units focused on Iran have been created separately in IDF intelligence and in the air force, sources said that it might be less necessary to have a major general and a full high command portfolio just focused on Iran strategy. AdvertisementIn any event, the current and outgoing IDF Strategy and Iran Command Chief Maj. Gen., Eliezer Toledano (he is due to retire) had recommended to Zamit to close down the command.2. Checking into closing the Northern Corps (separate from the Northern Command):The idea of the Northern Corps is to be ready to immediately command and vastly multiply mandatory and reservist forces in the North in the event of a conflict far beyond the expected capacity of what the Northern Command can manage on its own. The current commander, Maj. Gen. Dan Goldfus, was the key general who took over Khan Yunis and played many other critical roles in the war in Gaza.  The Northern Corps was closed before in 2006 by then IDF chief Dan Halutz, but he was criticized for this heavily when the IDF failed to properly manage all of its land forces in the North during the Second Lebanon War. Shortly after Halutz was forced to resign the Northern Corps was reopened.Why now?With that background and so much action this year in the North, why close it now?First of all, unlike the command focused on Iran, the fact that the issue is being reviewed means that Zamir views the situation in the North as dynamic.Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3. Changing the Face of the IDF high commandContrary to what some predicted, Zamir is not racing to quickly change all of the high command. That said there are some major changes, including two key reversals from outgoing IDF Chief Herzi Halevi. Halevi passed over major generals Tamir Yadai and Yani Asur for promotion.Yadai retired for several months, only to now return being promoted to be IDF deputy chief.Asur finished his last role as chief of the IDF Human Resources Command in November and was on his way to retirement, but was brought back by Zamir to be the crucial IDF Southern Command Chief.Zamir's promotion of Itzik Cohen to major general probably would also have happened under Halevi, but his giving Cohen the critical Operation Command in his first position as a major general might not have. Still, in this area, Zamir is keeping on current Operations Command Chief Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk for some period of months to ease the transition. Basiuk was Halevi's right hand man, but has been in his position for around four years, so his retirement is not controversial.Defense sources told the Post that the dozens of other appointments at all levels of command from brigadier general to lieutenant colonel throughout the military were likely close to identical to the list which Halevi would have made.Really what happened was that in mid-December, Defense Minister Israel Katz froze all of Halevi's appointments and there was a glut of officers who were stuck without the ability to move on to their next standard expected roles.In fact, sources noted that Zamir even promoted officers known as close to Halevi, something one would not expect if the new IDF chief was trying to redo all of the appointments.Also, there were specific earlier officers who Katz had frozen the promotions of, who now were allowed to move forward.   It seems that Air Force Command Chief Tomer Bar has been given a pass by Zamir for any October 7 failures as being systematic to the military and not personal to him.The remaining key open question is IDF Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder.Halevi cleared him from any major personal errors on October 7 which allowed him to ascend to his current post in August 2024.But Zamir has ordered a full review of the probes concluded by Halevi by former major general and southern command chief Sami Turgeman.4. New October 7 probesTurgeman ran the southern command 2013-2015, such that he is seen as an expert in the area, but far enough away from the invasion to not be viewed as responsible or have any conflict of interest.Will Turgeman find that Binder and some other officers who have been promoted failed in their duties on October 7 and should lose their posts?Another possibility is that Turgeman could look at October 7 with a wider lens, going beyond the IDF, especially since the Shin Bet report on the disaster is out now.Finally, will Turgeman recommend any more radical changes to the IDF than what Halevi suggested after his probes?One issue which remains very unclear is how long Turgeman will take with his review: a few months or much longer?5. More TanksZamir comes from the Tank Corps. No one was surprised that he is restoring and even growing the power of the tank corps within the military.Likewise, it was unsurprising that if Zamir is returning tank units cut by former IDF chief Aviv Kohavi during a time where the military was told to downsize, that Zamir will also be returning field intelligence collection units which work directly with the tank corps.

New October 7 probesTurgeman ran the southern command 2013-2015, such that he is seen as an expert in the area, but far enough away from the invasion to not be viewed as responsible or have any conflict of interest.Will Turgeman find that Binder and some other officers who have been promoted failed in their duties on October 7 and should lose their posts?Another possibility is that Turgeman could look at October 7 with a wider lens, going beyond the IDF, especially since the Shin Bet report on the disaster is out now.Finally, will Turgeman recommend any more radical changes to the IDF than what Halevi suggested after his probes?One issue which remains very unclear is how long Turgeman will take with his review: a few months or much longer?5. More TanksZamir comes from the Tank Corps. No one was surprised that he is restoring and even growing the power of the tank corps within the military.Likewise, it was unsurprising that if Zamir is returning tank units cut by former IDF chief Aviv Kohavi during a time where the military was told to downsize, that Zamir will also be returning field intelligence collection units which work directly with the tank corps.
            



1. Iran: Zamir publicly said that 2025 was the year of war focused on Gaza and Iran. This was an incredibly explicit and forceful statement. It should put Iran on notice that the clock is ticking on reaching a diplomatic resolution of the nuclear standoff. And yet that statement was potentially less significant than the decision to close down a special full IDF command portfolio that has been part of the high command since 2020, specifically focused on Iran.Why close down the Iran command when Tehran is only becoming a more serious and more immediate issue than it has ever been before?

They noted that previously there was a Depth Command for strategy that was closed and converted. They said that military realities often change in radical ways.However, in the post-October 7 world, they said that even if it is still necessary to have senior officers who spend all of their time thinking about strategy related to Iran, that the IDF's emphasis in terms of funding and human resources must return to combat fighters regarding border threats.

AdvertisementIn any event, the current and outgoing IDF Strategy and Iran Command Chief Maj. Gen., Eliezer Toledano (he is due to retire) had recommended to Zamit to close down the command.2. Checking into closing the Northern Corps (separate from the Northern Command):The idea of the Northern Corps is to be ready to immediately command and vastly multiply mandatory and reservist forces in the North in the event of a conflict far beyond the expected capacity of what the Northern Command can manage on its own. The current commander, Maj. Gen. Dan Goldfus, was the key general who took over Khan Yunis and played many other critical roles in the war in Gaza.  The Northern Corps was closed before in 2006 by then IDF chief Dan Halutz, but he was criticized for this heavily when the IDF failed to properly manage all of its land forces in the North during the Second Lebanon War. Shortly after Halutz was forced to resign the Northern Corps was reopened.Why now?With that background and so much action this year in the North, why close it now?First of all, unlike the command focused on Iran, the fact that the issue is being reviewed means that Zamir views the situation in the North as dynamic.Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3. Changing the Face of the IDF high commandContrary to what some predicted, Zamir is not racing to quickly change all of the high command. That said there are some major changes, including two key reversals from outgoing IDF Chief Herzi Halevi. Halevi passed over major generals Tamir Yadai and Yani Asur for promotion.Yadai retired for several months, only to now return being promoted to be IDF deputy chief.Asur finished his last role as chief of the IDF Human Resources Command in November and was on his way to retirement, but was brought back by Zamir to be the crucial IDF Southern Command Chief.Zamir's promotion of Itzik Cohen to major general probably would also have happened under Halevi, but his giving Cohen the critical Operation Command in his first position as a major general might not have. Still, in this area, Zamir is keeping on current Operations Command Chief Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk for some period of months to ease the transition. Basiuk was Halevi's right hand man, but has been in his position for around four years, so his retirement is not controversial.Defense sources told the Post that the dozens of other appointments at all levels of command from brigadier general to lieutenant colonel throughout the military were likely close to identical to the list which Halevi would have made.Really what happened was that in mid-December, Defense Minister Israel Katz froze all of Halevi's appointments and there was a glut of officers who were stuck without the ability to move on to their next standard expected roles.In fact, sources noted that Zamir even promoted officers known as close to Halevi, something one would not expect if the new IDF chief was trying to redo all of the appointments.Also, there were specific earlier officers who Katz had frozen the promotions of, who now were allowed to move forward.   It seems that Air Force Command Chief Tomer Bar has been given a pass by Zamir for any October 7 failures as being systematic to the military and not personal to him.The remaining key open question is IDF Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder.Halevi cleared him from any major personal errors on October 7 which allowed him to ascend to his current post in August 2024.But Zamir has ordered a full review of the probes concluded by Halevi by former major general and southern command chief Sami Turgeman.4.

Given that in the last two years, new units focused on Iran have been created separately in IDF intelligence and in the air force, sources said that it might be less necessary to have a major general and a full high command portfolio just focused on Iran strategy. AdvertisementIn any event, the current and outgoing IDF Strategy and Iran Command Chief Maj. Gen., Eliezer Toledano (he is due to retire) had recommended to Zamit to close down the command.2. Checking into closing the Northern Corps (separate from the Northern Command):The idea of the Northern Corps is to be ready to immediately command and vastly multiply mandatory and reservist forces in the North in the event of a conflict far beyond the expected capacity of what the Northern Command can manage on its own. The current commander, Maj. Gen. Dan Goldfus, was the key general who took over Khan Yunis and played many other critical roles in the war in Gaza.  The Northern Corps was closed before in 2006 by then IDF chief Dan Halutz, but he was criticized for this heavily when the IDF failed to properly manage all of its land forces in the North during the Second Lebanon War. Shortly after Halutz was forced to resign the Northern Corps was reopened.Why now?With that background and so much action this year in the North, why close it now?First of all, unlike the command focused on Iran, the fact that the issue is being reviewed means that Zamir views the situation in the North as dynamic.Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3. Changing the Face of the IDF high commandContrary to what some predicted, Zamir is not racing to quickly change all of the high command.

Second, defense sources told the Post that after all of the action in Lebanon and Syria this year, and despite it being necessary to have security zones in both countries, Israel actually may need less forces focused on the North in the near future.In other words, Hezbollah and Syria still pose a threat, and may pose a larger threat in the coming years, but at this moment, Israel is more secure in the North than it has been in decades because of the military successes on both fronts.It is unclear what would happen to Goldfus if the Northern Corps was closed.3. Changing the Face of the IDF high commandContrary to what some predicted, Zamir is not racing to quickly change all of the high command. That said there are some major changes, including two key reversals from outgoing IDF Chief Herzi Halevi. Halevi passed over major generals Tamir Yadai and Yani Asur for promotion.Yadai retired for several months, only to now return being promoted to be IDF deputy chief.Asur finished his last role as chief of the IDF Human Resources Command in November and was on his way to retirement, but was brought back by Zamir to be the crucial IDF Southern Command Chief.Zamir's promotion of Itzik Cohen to major general probably would also have happened under Halevi, but his giving Cohen the critical Operation Command in his first position as a major general might not have. Still, in this area, Zamir is keeping on current Operations Command Chief Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk for some period of months to ease the transition. Basiuk was Halevi's right hand man, but has been in his position for around four years, so his retirement is not controversial.Defense sources told the Post that the dozens of other appointments at all levels of command from brigadier general to lieutenant colonel throughout the military were likely close to identical to the list which Halevi would have made.Really what happened was that in mid-December, Defense Minister Israel Katz froze all of Halevi's appointments and there was a glut of officers who were stuck without the ability to move on to their next standard expected roles.In fact, sources noted that Zamir even promoted officers known as close to Halevi, something one would not expect if the new IDF chief was trying to redo all of the appointments.Also, there were specific earlier officers who Katz had frozen the promotions of, who now were allowed to move forward.   It seems that Air Force Command Chief Tomer Bar has been given a pass by Zamir for any October 7 failures as being systematic to the military and not personal to him.The remaining key open question is IDF Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder.Halevi cleared him from any major personal errors on October 7 which allowed him to ascend to his current post in August 2024.But Zamir has ordered a full review of the probes concluded by Halevi by former major general and southern command chief Sami Turgeman.4.

University students demonstrated against the arrest of Istanbul's mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a third straight day on Friday, even as the Turkish leader issued a stern warning, declaring that street protests would not be tolerated.

Thousands of supporters rallied in front of Istanbul City Hall for the fourth night on Saturday night after detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu faced further questioning over allegations of corruption and terror links.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Hundreds of supporters gathered in front of an Istanbul courthouse on Saturday, where detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu faced further questioning over allegations of corruption and terror links. His arrest this week intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition.

Police questioned Imamoglu for around five hours on Saturday as part of an investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. A day earlier he was questioned for four hours over the corruption accusations. The mayor rejected all charges during both interrogations. 

He was later transferred to a courthouse for questioning by prosecutors along with some 90 other people who were also detained with him.

The authorities barred access to the courthouse using barricades on local roads and closing nearby metro stations. Hundreds of police officers and over a dozen water cannon trucks were deployed. Still, hundreds gathered in front of the building shouting: “Rights, law, justice!”

Crowds also began to rally outside the city hall for a fourth night in a show of support to the mayor.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on social media that 343 suspects had been detained in protests in major cities on Friday night, adding “There will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people's peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.” The cities listed included Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Antalya, Canakkale, Eskisehir, Konya and Edirne.

Imamoglu, who is a popular opposition figure and seen as a top challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was detained on Wednesday following a dawn raid on his residence over allegations of financial crimes and links to Kurdish militants. Dozens of other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.

Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

His arrest has ignited protests that have steadily increased in intensity.

On Friday, police in Istanbul used pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city's historic aqueduct while hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers. Police also dispersed groups that had rallied outside of the city hall for a third night running, after the opposition Republican People's Party leader, Ozgur Ozel, delivered a speech in support of the mayor.

Simultaneously, police broke up demonstrations in Ankara, the capital, as well as in the Aegean coastal city of Izmir, resorting to forceful measures at times, according to television images. Thousands marched in several other cities calling on the government to resign.

Earlier, Erdogan said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and terror organizations. 

The Istanbul governor's office announced it was expanding a ban on demonstrations until March 26 and imposed restrictions on the entry and exit of vehicles deemed to be transporting people “likely to participate in unlawful activities.”

Erdogan on Saturday accused the CHP's leadership of turning the party “into an apparatus to absolve a handful of municipal robbers who have become blinded by money.”

He also accused it of “doing everything to disturb the public peace, to polarize the nation.”

Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.

The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday — through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey — to show solidarity with Imamoglu.

In a tweet posted shortly before his arrival at the courthouse, Imamoglu urged the public to safeguard the ballot boxes for Sunday's primary, “Don't forget: they are very afraid of you and your democratic right to vote.”

In an earlier message, Imamoglu described his arrest as a “coup” and accused the government of exploiting the judiciary and worsening the country's troubled economy.

Anger over detention of Ekrem Imamoğlu becomes a touchstone for opposing President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan

When demonstrators gathered ­at Istanbul's city hall last week in outrage at the arrest of mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, 26-year-old Azra said she was initially too scared to defy a ban on gatherings. As protests grew on university campuses and in cities and towns across Turkey, she could no longer resist joining.

“I saw the spark in people's eyes and the excitement on their faces, and I decided I had to come down here,” she said with a grin, standing among tens of thousands that defied a ban on assembly to fill the streets around city hall on Friday night. Despite the crowds, Azra feared reprisals and declined to give her full name. Many demonstrators were masked in a bid to defy facial recognition ­technology and fearing the teargas or pepper spray sometimes deployed by the police. Others smiled and took ­selfies to celebrate as fireworks illuminated the night sky.

The arrest of the mayor of Turkey's largest city in a dawn raid last week was a watershed moment in the country's prolonged shift away from democracy. Opponents of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan fear it is a move to ­sideline the sole challenger capable of defeating him in upcoming elections, expected before 2028.

İmamoğlu and more than 100 other people including municipal officials and the head of the mayor's construction firm were served ­detention orders and accused of embezzlement and corruption – charges the mayor denies. He also denies terrorism charges levelled at him over collaboration with a leftwing political coalition prior to local elections last year, which saw major losses for Erdoğan's Justice and Development party (AKP).

Justice minister Yılmaz Tunç attempted to rebuff any suspicion the charges against İmamoğlu and ­others from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) were ­politicised. “Attempting to associate judicial investigations and cases with our president is, to say the least, an act of audacity and irresponsibility,” he said.

Within days, what began as protests in response to İmamoğlu's detention has grown into something more. “This is bigger than İmamoğlu. It's about a fight for democracy, law and equal rights,” said Azra as demonstrators massed around her.

The Turkish president has long sought to retake Istanbul from opposition control, fuelling protesters' joy at defying a ban on gatherings in the city where Erdoğan began his ­political career as mayor. Standing outside a metro station as hundreds of cheering people poured into the street, breaking into anti-government chants and banging on the escalators, another protester, named Diler, called the demonstrations “a response to the pressure that has built up over years”.

“There are problems with the ­economy, with education, with the health ­system,” she said in a nod to the ­economic ­crisis that has seen the cost of ­living soar. “We are fed up with this government.”

Supporters of the mayor said 300,000 people joined the demonstration in Istanbul on Friday night, while video showed protesters taking to the streets and clashing with the police in major towns and cities across the country. Turkish interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said 343 ­people were detained across nine cities after taking part in demonstrations.

Turkish authorities ratcheted up their attempts to quell the growing protests, including blocking traffic across two bridges leading to city hall in Istanbul and locking down several thoroughfares nearby with lines of riot police.

Erdoğan voiced his increasing ­displeasure at calls to demonstrate by the head of the opposition, saying: “Turkey is not a country that will be on the street – it will not surrender to street terrorism.”

Despite the domestic outrage at İmamoğlu's detention, the international response remained muted. The clearest reaction was ­financial, with estimates that the Turkish central bank spent a record $11.5bn propping up the lira the day after İmamoğlu's arrest as investors fled and the ­currency plunged in value.

Reactions elsewhere were far less impactful. A spokesperson for the UN secretary general said they hoped “the normal rules for due process will be followed”, while US state ­department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Washington “will not comment on the internal decision-making ­processes of another country”.

US president Donald Trump and Erdoğan spoke by phone just days before İmamoğlu's arrest amid reports the Turkish leader is seeking a meeting at the White House in the coming months.

US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told rightwing pundit Tucker Carlson in an interview that Trump and Erdoğan's conversation was “transformational”, adding “I think there's just a lot of good, positive news ­coming out of Turkey right now.”

“The international climate has Erdoğan feeling very confident,” said Gönül Tol, an analyst with the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

“The president of the United States is undermining democracy there, meaning the US is looking inward. He just doesn't care what other foreign autocrats are doing to their people. Those things are really impacting a global climate where autocrats think they can do whatever they want.”

European leaders previously quick to criticise Erdoğan, such as French president Emmanuel Macron, have yet to voice objections to events in Turkey amid expectations they could increasingly look to Ankara to supply peacekeepers in Ukraine.

“With Trump's return to the White House and his shift towards Russia on Ukraine, the Europeans are panicking and trying to boost defence,” said Tol. “In this climate where Europe feels it has to defend itself against Russia alone, there's more talk about engaging Erdoğan.”

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen became the highest-ranking official to offer any criticism, stating Turkey “must protect democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials”.

Soner Cagaptay, a biographer of Erdoğan and an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said such statements were not likely to prompt any change in policy.

“There are unlikely to be any meaningful actions to follow; there will be no sanctions or disinviting Erdoğan to summits, declining to include Turkey in future planning. There will be no concrete repercussions, because of the way Turkey has positioned itself in this new global arena as an important power,” he said.

The CHP is expected to push ahead with declaring İmamoğlu its ­candidate for president this weekend, after a symbolic primary vote. Those ­outside city hall were insistent the Istanbul mayor should remain the opposition's candidate, even if this means his running from prison.

Cagaptay said despite the lack of international criticism, the push to ­nullify İmamoğlu could still ­backfire. Erdoğan was briefly jailed in the 1990s while mayor of Istanbul, ­galvanising his ­support and fuelling his run for national politics.

“He entered jail as a mayor and exited as a national hero,” said Cagaptay.

“Erdoğan is betting this won't happen [now] due to state capture, his control of institutions and the media, and he's not worried about international criticism.”

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered an investigation into the power outage that caused Heathrow to close on Friday, following a fire at a power substation

The airport's chief executive says he hopes the findings will "help strengthen the airport's future resilience" as Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says it is "imperative to identify what happened"

Heathrow Airport is now "fully operational" though some disruption continues as more than 100 flights have been cancelled at the airport on Saturday

The BBC has been hearing from some of those affected by the disruption

The question of how to safeguard against future damaging power outages has now entered the equation, BBC's Marc Ashdown writes

'No comment': Heathrow boss asked if he should stay in job

Edited by Matt Spivey

The power outage that forced Heathrow to close yesterday was caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation

The independent National Energy System Operator (NESO), which will investigate the power outage, says it "welcomes the government's commission".

Fintan Slye, NESO's chief executive, says in a statement: "We will now work with all relevant stakeholders to understand the lessons that can be learned to improve future resilience of Great Britain's energy system." 

The Department Energy Security and Net Zero says it expects NESO to report back with initial findings within six weeks. 

NESO is expected to work with Heathrow Airport to ensure the investigation is "comprehensive and thoroughly examines the causes of the incident," the statement adds. 

Heathrow Airport's Chief Executive Officer Thomas Woldbye welcomes the investigation into the power outage that closed Heathrow Airport on Friday.

In a statement issued in the last few minutes, he says he hopes the findings will "help strengthen the airport's future resilience".

"We will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident and we are committed to working closely with all stakeholders to ensure a thorough investigation," Woldbye adds.

Earlier, Woldbye was questioned on BBC's Today programme, where he described the fire at a substation near to Heathrow "unprecedented", adding he is "proud" of how the airport handled the incident.

Akshay Kaul, director general for infrastructure at Ofgem, says in the Energy Security and Net Zero department's statement that the authority "will not hesitate to take action."

He adds that Ofgem will work to ensure the National Energy System Operator's review "goes as far as possible to ensuring steps are put in place to avoid any repeat of an incident of this scale in the future".

The statement from Kaul also says that households and businesses "should be able to have confidence in the resilience of critical national infrastructure".

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says it is "imperative" to "identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong".

Within the statement from the Energy Security and Net Zero department, she warns "some disruption is expected" over the coming days and urges passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling.

Alexander adds that the incident caused "significant disruption" but praised emergency services for working "swiftly".

We're now seeing a full statement from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, following Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's comments a short while ago.

The department says the National Energy System Operator's investigation will support efforts to "build a clear picture of the circumstances" surrounding the power outage at Heathrow and the UK's energy resilience more broadly so that it's prevented from ever happening again.  

"The government's Plan for Change is rebuilding Britain's resilience, including boosting the country's energy security with homegrown power. Separately, the resilience review led by the Cabinet Office is ongoing and is due to conclude in the Spring," the statement reads.

The statement also includes further comments from Energy Secretary Miliband, who says the government is "determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow. This review will be an important step in helping us to do so, as we deliver our Plan for Change".

We'll bring you more from the department's statement in our next few posts.

A moment ago, we brought you news that the energy secretary has commissioned in investigation into the incident at Heathrow. 

In a post on X, Ed Miliband writes: "The loss of power to the Heathrow area has caused major disruption to thousands of people and many businesses. 

"We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned."

He says he is working with Ofgem and has commissioned the National Energy System Operator to investigate the incident. Miliband says the investigation will look for "wider lessons" on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure. 

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has commissioned an investigation into the incident at Heathrow, to be carried out by the National Energy System Operator. 

We'll bring you more on this in our next post.

Anna HolliganReporting from Amsterdam's Schipol Airport

Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is Europe's fourth-largest, serving approximately 67 million passengers annually. 

Schiphol has faced power-related issues in the past, such as a voltage drop in Tennet's high-voltage grid in 2018, which led to disruptions in operations. 

This incident resulted in improvements in monitoring of the emergency power generators and response systems. Schiphol is implementing energy storage solutions, such as iron flow batteries, to reduce reliance on diesel generators and improve environmental sustainability. 

Despite these measures, like Heathrow, in the event of a major power substation failure Schiphol's systems might not be designed to power the entire airport indefinitely without external support. 

Both incidents resulted in substantial disruptions to flight operations. At Schiphol in 2018, the power outage led to the closure of the airport, with flights delayed or cancelled, affecting thousands of passengers.   

But the Schiphol outage in 2018 was due to a general power failure in the Amsterdam region, with the airport reopening after several hours once check-in systems were restored.   

Both scenarios highlight the importance of robust backup systems and emergency response plans to mitigate the impact of power outages.

More than 100 flights through Heathrow have been cancelled today, one day after a power outage brought the airport to a standstill.

Although Heathrow Airport is now "fully operational", we've been keeping a tally of all the cancelled flights on Heathrow's departure and arrival boards today. British Airways has been particularly affected, but other carriers are seeing cancellations, too.

Here's what we found:

More than 30 departing flights cancelled

You can check the status of your departing flight via your airline and on Heathrow's online departure board., external

More than 70 arriving flights cancelled

You can check Heathrow's arrival board on their website, external.

The term substation has been in the forefront of our coverage, as the disruption at Heathrow Airport yesterday was caused by a fire at a power substation in Hayes. 

Elizabeth Orchard from the Institution of Civil Engineers explained to our colleagues at BBC Breakfast exactly what a substation is. 

She describes it as a "stopping point" for electricity as it journeys from where it is generated to where it is used.

Large amounts of energy are used to enable the electricity to travel long distances. There are two types: transmission substations and distribution substations.

Transmission substations handle high-voltage electricity transmission over long distances, while distribution substations bring down the voltage for local distribution to homes and businesses.

Orchard adds that fires are "incredibly rare" as "substations are some of the best maintained infrastructure around the country".

We're now hearing from Labour MP Ruth Cadbury who tells the BBC that there is "a lack of power grid capacity" in the area surrounding Heathrow, with no new overhead lines expected until 2036.

She says it is too soon to tell whether this shortage had an impact on the closure of Heathrow Airport yesterday, after a substation fire caused a power outage.

Cadbury, who is chair of the Transport Select Committee, adds that the previous government has shown a lack of interest in Britain's infrastructure over the past 15 years.

She insists the Labour government is picking up on these issues but says it will take time to "ensure our key national infrastructure is fit for purpose".

Asked about plans for a possible third runway, she says it will take years but by that time "West London may have secured the additional grid capacity it needs".

In terms of mitigating the type of crisis we saw yesterday, she adds that Heathrow and airports in other countries will be "looking at their systems in the weeks to come".

BBC's Emma Barnett earlier put it to Heathrow's Chief Executive Thomas Woldbye that yesterday's full closure may impact passengers' trust in the airport - especially ahead of its controversial plans to build a third runway.

Woldbye said that he has "full trust in the fact the airport can build a third runway that is resilient".

Let's take a look at those plans for a third runway:

Marc AshdownBusiness correspondent

Yesterday's closure at Heathrow Airport was caused by a power outage following a fire at a substation in West London

In the end, Heathrow Airport was only out of action for 18 hours, but it left vital cargo - such as life-saving organs - stranded mid-transit. While passengers, pilots and planes have been scattered across Europe.

The airport's boss Thomas Woldbye said planes could have taken off and landed yesterday, but it was not safe to do so without back-up power to infrastructure such as runway lights, fuel systems and air bridges.

He insisted any airport would have responded in the same way, and said Heathrow uses as much power as a city and would need to install an expensive standalone generator to absolutely guarantee no power outages.

With one business leader labelling the UK a "laughing stock" over the incident, could this incident now weigh on its future investment plans?

Heathrow recently announced a multi-billion pound expansion plan, including revamping two terminals and adding a controversial third runway.

But the question of how to safeguard against damaging power outages has now entered the equation too.

We're seeing images showing passengers filing into Heathrow after it was announced that the airport is "fully operational" today.

Although flights to and from the airport have resumed, some airlines are warning passengers to expect delays. 

Air India has just announced that their operations to and from Heathrow Airport have started again following yesterday's disruption. 

"Today's flight AI111 was on schedule and other flights, to and from London, are expected to operate as per schedule," it says in a statement. 

Meanwhile, flight AI161 - which diverted to Frankfurt - "is expected to leave Frankfurt at 14:05 pm local time", the airline says.

Farah Rafeeq (L) and Niken Wulan (R)

Farah Rafeeq, 24, says she is frustrated to miss part of her close friend's wedding after the fire which closed Heathrow Airport on Friday.

She was due to travel with Singapore Airlines with her 32-year-old friend Niken Wulan, who is pregnant, to a wedding in Cambodia on Sunday.

The mass-cancellation of flights means they will now miss part of the ceremony.

They have found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport with Turkish Airlines and Bangkok Airways that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon.

Farah tells the PA news agency today that the last few hours have been "nightmarish" because "it is one of our closest friends' wedding and we have to travel for at least 20 hours to get there".

“We had to pay double the amount, between £600 and £700, for the new flight, and we had planned this trip for months and had hotels booked," she says.

“We are missing the morning ceremony but at least we can make it for the reception.”

"Around 85%" of British Airways' schedule at Heathrow will run as planned today, the airline has said in a statement, as it advises passengers to travel to the airport unless told otherwise.

The airline has been the worst affected, travel expert Simon Calder told the BBC earlier. 

Its latest statement explains customers will "likely" experience delays however as it offers those booked on flights to or from the airport this weekend "flexible options" to rebook for free. 

We're continuing to bring you stories from people who have been impacted by yesterday's disruption at Heathrow Airport.

Jane
     Davies, a headteacher from County Durham, was stranded in Dubai with eight
     of her pupils on a school trip.

She says they were just about to leave their hotel when a newsflash came up on her phone about Heathrow being closed.

“My heart sank," she says. "We didn't say anything to the children,
knew we'd just have to get to the airport."

Davies says they later heard the flight would take off, but delayed.

“I've got a WhatsApp chat with the parents, just making sure that they're kept informed all the time because obviously I'm
very conscious that they're sitting at home really worried how their children
are coping.”

Heathrow Express has just announced that any unused tickets purchased yesterday will be valid for today.

"Simply see the gateline staff at the barriers, and they will let you through," they say in a statement.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander also said in a statement earlier that rail tickets can be used flexibly today to help passengers with their journeys.

A fire at an electrical substation knocked out power to the airport for most of Friday, forcing Europe's busiest hub to shut down for roughly 18 hours, causing widespread cancellations and rerouting headaches, and stranding roughly 200,000 passengers.

British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expects to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday.

While Heathrow reopened on Saturday, airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations.

LONDON (AP) — The British government on Saturday ordered an investigation into the country's “energy resilience” after an electrical substation fire shut Heathrow Airport for almost a day and raised concerns about the U.K.'s ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure. 

While Heathrow Airport said it was “fully operational” on Saturday, thousands of passengers remained stuck, and airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations. 

Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe's busiest air hub.

“This is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It's a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,” said Toby Harris, a Labour Party politician who heads the National Preparedness Commission, a group that campaigns to improve resilience.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he'd asked the National Energy System Operator, which oversees U.K. gas and electricity networks, to “urgently investigate” the fire, “to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.” 

It is expected to report initial findings within six weeks.

“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,” Miliband said.

More than 1,300 flights were canceled and some 200,000 people stranded Friday after an overnight fire at a substation 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away from the airport cut power to Heathrow, and to more than 60,000 properties.

Heathrow said Saturday it had “added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers.” British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, said it expected to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday. 

While many passengers managed to resume stalled journeys, others remained in limbo.

Laura Fritschie from Kansas City was on vacation with her family in Ireland when she learned that her father had died. On Saturday she was stranded at Heathrow after her BA flight to Chicago was canceled at the last minute.

“I'm very frustrated,” she said. “This was my first big vacation with my kids since my husband died, and ... now this. So I just want to go home.”

Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion and then seeing a fireball and clouds of smoke when the blaze ripped through the substation. The fire was brought under control after seven hours, but the airport was shut for almost 18 hours. A handful of flights took off and landed late Friday.

Police said they do not consider the fire suspicious, and the London Fire Brigade said its investigation would focus on the electrical distribution equipment at the substation.

Still, the huge impact of the fire left authorities facing questions about Britain's creaking infrastructure, much of which has been privatized since the 1980s. The center-left Labour government has vowed to improve the U.K.'s delay-plagued railways, its aged water system and — especially — its energy network, promising to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy independence through investment in wind and other renewable power sources.

“The last 40, 50 years we've tried to make services more efficient,” said Harris. “We've stripped out redundancy, we've simplified processes. We've moved towards a sort of ‘just in time' economy. There is an element where you have to make sure you're available for ‘just in case.' You have to plan for things going wrong.”

Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year. 

Chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he was “proud” of the way airport and airline staff had responded.

“The airport didn't shut for days. We shut for hours,” he told the BBC.

Woldbye said Heathrow's backup power supply, designed for emergencies, worked as expected, but it wasn't enough to run the whole airport, which uses as much energy as a small city.

“That's how most airports operate,” said Woldbye, who insisted “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar blaze.

But Willie Walsh, who heads aviation trade organization IATA, said the episode “begs some serious questions.”

“How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,” he said.

Walsh said “Heathrow has very little incentive to improve” because airlines, not the airport, have to pay the cost of looking after disrupted passengers.

Friday's disruption was one of the most serious since the 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut Europe's airspace for days.

Passengers on about 120 flights were in the air when Friday's closure was announced and found themselves landing in different cities, and even different countries.

Mark Doherty and his wife were halfway across the Atlantic when the inflight map showed their flight from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to Heathrow was turning around.

“I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.

Doherty called the situation “typical England — got no back-up plan for something happens like this. There's no contingency plan.”

US envoy Steve Witkoff, who played a key role in the ceasefire deal in January that enabled 33 hostages to be freed, spoke on the Tucker Carlson Show recently. The interview has raised eyebrows because some commentators have focused on Witkoff's comments about Qatar, the country which hosts Hamas and has played a role as mediator.The interview with Carlson comes at a unique time. Carlson has also interviewed the prime minister of Qatar recently. He has also had guests who have been critical of Israel.  On the other side, Witkoff has been playing a key role in other Trump administration initiatives, such as outreach to Russia. The interview comes a week after Reuters noted that the “Trump administration has withdrawn the nomination of Adam Boehler to serve as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.”Boehler had held direct talks with Hamas and also done a round of interviews on Israeli media. He was critiqued for his comments that appeared to be soft on Hamas. The interview also came out as CNN reported that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has “run the risk of being overshadowed” by Witkoff's role. Both Rubio and Witkoff have pushed back on this report. AdvertisementNevertheless, clearly, the interview comes at a unique time in US policy and also a unique time as the Trump administration seeks a doctrine in world affairs. STEVE WITKOFF delivers an address at the presidential inaugural parade in Washington on January 20. He deserves congratulations from all of us in Israel on successfully completing a hostage-ceasefire deal before starting his role as Middle East envoy for US President Donald Trump, says the writer. (credit: Carlos Barria/Reuters)The administration launched airstrikes on the Houthis and reportedly sent a letter to Iran. Many things are up in the air. Hamas did not accept a deal that Witkoff pushed that could have extended the ceasefire whose first phase ended on March 1. Israel began airstrikes on Hamas on March 18. Now the war is back on. All eyes on WitkoffMany eyes are focused on Witkoff. His comments to Carlson are important. What did Witkoff say? He said that Qatar wants stability in the region and also wants a peace treaty with the US.Qatar is already a major non-NATO ally of the US. He said Qatar is an ally of the US and that it has moderated its positions. He also said that the head of US Central Command has described Qataris as “special.” Hamas wants to rule Gaza, Witkoff noted. He said that is unacceptable to the US.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  “We can't have a terrorist organization running Gaza.” He went on to say, “we trust the Qataris,” the envoy said. He said the Qataris have explained to Hamas “where they have to get to, to make a deal.” AdvertisementWitkoff is passionate about the hostages. He also is passionate about condemning October 7. He said, having watched the Hamas attacks, that it's hard to be dispassionate in the talks. “We can't ignore the reality of October 7.” He said part of the deal-making involves trying to figure out what Hamas wants. He said he doesn't think Hamas is ideologically intractable. He believes that a deal is possible. “I had to feel it for myself,” he says in how a negotiator has to operate in the region. He spoke to the released hostages. He has deep empathy for the hostages. He also discusses how Trump is “up close and personal” in caring for the hostages and being involved.The envoy wants to finish things with dialogue. Currently, there is a conflict in Gaza and it remains to be seen if he can bridge the gaps. He says this is the same method for talks with Iran, Russia and also talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia.Witkoff discussed being critiqued for being too close to Qatar. He describes the country as a mediator and he says he must collaborate with Doha to be effective. He also describes how he wanted to be like Trump when Witkoff was a young lawyer. Now he has a chance as Trump's envoy to make an impact on the world. He talked about how he wanted to see Gaza and see things on the ground for himself. He also discussed how Israel has enabled talks by having eliminated Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and weakening the “Iranian crescent.” Witkoff discussed the nuances in the Middle East that he has seen. He talked about the Arab summit in Cairo and also Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies.  Another issue that Witkoff is dealing with is Iran. He discussed the recent Trump letter sent to Iran. He says the US can never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon and have outsized influence in the Gulf. He says that Hezbollah and Hamas are weakened. He also says the recent US campaign against the Houthis will clip their wings. He mentioned that Lebanon could normalize ties with Israel. He also mentioned the new Syrian government of Ahmed Sharaa. He mentioned the possibility of normalization with Syria and Saudi Arabia. This would lead to a “GCC that all works together,” referencing cooperation in the Gulf.In Gaza what matters is demilitarization, Witkoff says. He describes Hamas as an “idea” and notes that removing its arms is important. “How do you build a framework,” Carlson asks. “We will need stability in Gaza,” Witkoff says. he also discusses the need for a better life for people in Gaza. He says Gazans currently lack opportunities. He says the US will attempt to ascertain development plans for Gaza. He also mentioned the issue of two states. “How do we have a better living prescription for Palestinians living in Gaza,” Witkoff says. He discussed the idea of development in Gaza, providing “prospects” for people in Gaza. Discussing the ceasefire and other US initiatives, Witkoff praised Trump's team. He said Trump listens to his team and is flexible. “We go out with that way of thinking, for the most part.”Witkoff says he is optimistic about an end to the fighting in Gaza. He said Israel likely had to go back into Gaza. He describes Hamas as being unreasonable in refusing a bridge to a peace deal at the end of the first phase of talks. He says the Hamas reaction was “inappropriate.” Clearly, Hamas was obstructing things from March 1 to March 18. He says that there needs to be a real security force in Gaza that is not Hamas in Gaza.Witkoff discussed the importance of stability in the region. He notes the problems in Egypt, how the country's economy is problematic and there is large unemployment. He also discussed the challenges in Saudi Arabia and how the region may look at the changes in Syria. He said there could be several countries joining the Abraham Accords.Carlson also asked about the conflict in Ukraine. He notes that Trump tapped Witkoff to talk with Moscow after the success in negotiating the Gaza ceasefire in January. He described Russian President Vladimir Putin as respecting Trump. Witkoff described the goal in Ukraine as a thirty-day ceasefire with Russia. He says the frontline in Ukraine is complex because of some seventy different points of conflict and battle along the long front. He said that there is flexibility in Kyiv as well.“I am very optimistic that we will be able to bring the two sides together.” Witkoff is also optimistic about other conflicts. He speaks about Iran and Turkey and other countries responding to US “strong leadership.”Regarding Iran, Witkoff says that a diplomatic solution with Iran is achievable. He noted that Iran's air defenses have been weakened by Israel's strikes last year. He says Trump is reaching out to Iran from a standpoint of strength. Trump's administration is now trying to build trust with Tehran. Witkoff says things can be solved by dialogue. He says the situation is very complex due to Iran's nuclear program.At the end of the interview, the envoy discusses how he moved into his current role. “I wanted to do something that felt worthy to me,” WItkoff says. He wanted to save lives and do something positive. He says he consulted with Jared Kushner about Kushner's work during the first Trump administration. He calls his current work as having been “blessed.”

He also mentioned the issue of two states. “How do we have a better living prescription for Palestinians living in Gaza,” Witkoff says. He discussed the idea of development in Gaza, providing “prospects” for people in Gaza. Discussing the ceasefire and other US initiatives, Witkoff praised Trump's team. He said Trump listens to his team and is flexible. “We go out with that way of thinking, for the most part.”Witkoff says he is optimistic about an end to the fighting in Gaza. He said Israel likely had to go back into Gaza. He describes Hamas as being unreasonable in refusing a bridge to a peace deal at the end of the first phase of talks. He says the Hamas reaction was “inappropriate.” Clearly, Hamas was obstructing things from March 1 to March 18. He says that there needs to be a real security force in Gaza that is not Hamas in Gaza.Witkoff discussed the importance of stability in the region. He notes the problems in Egypt, how the country's economy is problematic and there is large unemployment. He also discussed the challenges in Saudi Arabia and how the region may look at the changes in Syria. He said there could be several countries joining the Abraham Accords.Carlson also asked about the conflict in Ukraine. He notes that Trump tapped Witkoff to talk with Moscow after the success in negotiating the Gaza ceasefire in January. He described Russian President Vladimir Putin as respecting Trump. Witkoff described the goal in Ukraine as a thirty-day ceasefire with Russia. He says the frontline in Ukraine is complex because of some seventy different points of conflict and battle along the long front. He said that there is flexibility in Kyiv as well.“I am very optimistic that we will be able to bring the two sides together.” Witkoff is also optimistic about other conflicts. He speaks about Iran and Turkey and other countries responding to US “strong leadership.”Regarding Iran, Witkoff says that a diplomatic solution with Iran is achievable. He noted that Iran's air defenses have been weakened by Israel's strikes last year. He says Trump is reaching out to Iran from a standpoint of strength. Trump's administration is now trying to build trust with Tehran. Witkoff says things can be solved by dialogue. He says the situation is very complex due to Iran's nuclear program.At the end of the interview, the envoy discusses how he moved into his current role. “I wanted to do something that felt worthy to me,” WItkoff says. He wanted to save lives and do something positive. He says he consulted with Jared Kushner about Kushner's work during the first Trump administration. He calls his current work as having been “blessed.” 
            



The envoy wants to finish things with dialogue. Currently, there is a conflict in Gaza and it remains to be seen if he can bridge the gaps. He says this is the same method for talks with Iran, Russia and also talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia.Witkoff discussed being critiqued for being too close to Qatar. He describes the country as a mediator and he says he must collaborate with Doha to be effective. He also describes how he wanted to be like Trump when Witkoff was a young lawyer. Now he has a chance as Trump's envoy to make an impact on the world. He talked about how he wanted to see Gaza and see things on the ground for himself. He also discussed how Israel has enabled talks by having eliminated Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and weakening the “Iranian crescent.” Witkoff discussed the nuances in the Middle East that he has seen. He talked about the Arab summit in Cairo and also Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies.  Another issue that Witkoff is dealing with is Iran. He discussed the recent Trump letter sent to Iran. He says the US can never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon and have outsized influence in the Gulf. He says that Hezbollah and Hamas are weakened. He also says the recent US campaign against the Houthis will clip their wings. He mentioned that Lebanon could normalize ties with Israel. He also mentioned the new Syrian government of Ahmed Sharaa. He mentioned the possibility of normalization with Syria and Saudi Arabia. This would lead to a “GCC that all works together,” referencing cooperation in the Gulf.In Gaza what matters is demilitarization, Witkoff says. He describes Hamas as an “idea” and notes that removing its arms is important. “How do you build a framework,” Carlson asks. “We will need stability in Gaza,” Witkoff says. he also discusses the need for a better life for people in Gaza. He says Gazans currently lack opportunities. He says the US will attempt to ascertain development plans for Gaza.

A new exhibition at the National Archives in London will reveal the extent of MI5 operation to expose the British double agent who was also Observer reporter

Secret surveillance of Britain's ­notorious double agent, Kim Philby, made public for the first time in archived documents, reveals how keenly the Security Service wanted to confirm or disprove early suspicions of his high-level treachery.

In daily bulletins submitted to MI5 in November 1951, undercover operatives describe how Philby, codenamed Peach, moved about London.

They said he gave “no outward sign of being either nervous or on the alert, but your well trained man should not do so; every movement is natural – again as it should be”.

The notes, from official ­“watchers” who were tailing Philby and bugging his phone, raise a key question about how the arch-traitor eventually escaped justice: did the British establishment deliberately protect him, or simply hope to avoid a public scandal? Mark Dunton, of the National Archives, believes the ­documents, which go on display in the ­exhibition, MI5: Official Secrets, next week at Kew, west London, shed light on one of the most shady ­periods of British ­espionage.

During the cold war period, a group of “Cambridge Spies” managed to compromise the top ranks of British Security and Secret Intelligence Services, MI5 and MI6. “All the layers of description and detail in these documents make the complexity and the mistrust clear,” said Dunton.

“The original transcripts of Philby's interrogations later can be read by the public for the first time. They will be displayed alongside some extraordinary new loans from MI5. Philby's movements around London in 1951 make fascinating reading.”

Tracking him that winter between the Athenaeum Club, the Arsenal stadium, Harvey Nichols and The Goring Hotel, officers sought evidence. Signs of a relaxed demeanour were no proof of innocence: “Such behaviour, however, should not be taken as an indication (a) that his mind is at ease, or (b) that he is not on the look-out for followers. On the contrary he has used the corner of a street into which he was turning in such a way that it would not be difficult to spot a careless watcher: on a bus he has adopted the procedure of a clever agent – although it is impossible (as it should be) to say whether this (or the street corner manoeuvre) was deliberate or otherwise. For the present we are confident that our methods will combat such tactics – if indeed they are tactics, and in any case at the first sign of Peach becoming suspicious (the repetition of recognised spotting manoeuvres will be interpreted as such) we shall withdraw.”

Harold “Kim” Philby, an Etonian, had become a committed communist as an undergraduate and was recruited by the Russian intelligence services in 1934. He joined the British intelligence service six years later, serving in Washington from 1949 until 1951, when he first came under suspicion, after the defections of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

Philby, who later worked for the Observer as a Middle East correspondent, has been called the “Third Man” because he was suspected by both MI5 and the Americans of being the elusive double agent who had tipped off the two spies before they could be questioned, allowing them to flee to Moscow via France.

Philby was, however, publicly cleared of complicity due to a lack of evidence, or perhaps because of a ­protective MI6 strategy.

The new surveillance documents show Philby was being bugged and followed in this period. Ironic, since Philby's own memoir, My Silent War, revealed that he himself had bugged many communist sympathisers on behalf of the British government.

Philby drove a black cab that he had bought as a ­private vehicle.

The “watchers” made fun of their target, describing his “weatherbeaten face” and “untidy hair”. They added in their notes: “He is inclined to grin when driving; this is almost certainly due to the fact that his vehicle is an ex-taxi and it might well be called a self-conscious or shame-faced smirk.

“We have noticed this previously with drivers of similar ‘models' at which small boys and their like are inclined to jeer.” They later note that he has no mirror, “in breach of law”, which makes tailing him easier. “With our radio-equipped cars behind him it is extremely unlikely that he will see us so long as he is at the wheel.”

The five Cambridge spies – Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross – all passed information to the Soviet Union from key citadels of the British establishment.

Under suspicion again from 1962, Philby finally fled to Moscow a year later, handing over a written confession to his old MI6 friend, Nicholas Elliott. He had been accused by Flora Solomon, a former girlfriend, who said he had once tried to recruit her.

Solomon was prompted to speak out, she claimed, by what she saw as the anti-Israel stance of his ­articles in the Observer. This sealed the case against Philby, who had already been named by a Soviet defector, according to the Spycatcher author, Peter Wright.

Philby spent 25 years in Moscow, instructing trainee spies in the techniques of “tradecraft”. When he died, in 1988, he received full KGB honours.

The transcripts on display in Kew will include Philby's admission that he had passed on information leading to the presumed execution in Russia of the potential defector Konstantin Volkov and his wife.

Critics say cuts will mean that children will have to face off alone in court against experienced Ice attorneys

The Trump administration is reported to have cut funding to a legal program that provides representation for unaccompanied immigrant children, one month after directing immigration enforcement agents to track down minors who had entered the US without guardians last month.

Organizations that collectively receive more than $200m in federal grants were informed that the contract through the office of refugee resettlement had been partially terminated, according to a memo issued on Friday by the interior department and obtained by ABC News.

The cut affects funding for legal representation and for the recruitment of attorneys to represent immigrant children but maintains a contract for “Know Your Rights”, a presentation given to unaccompanied immigrant children in detention centers.

Currently, 26,000 immigrant children receive government-funded legal representation, but many are representing themselves in immigration court due to a shortage of attorneys. In 2023, 56% of unaccompanied minors in immigration courts were represented by counsel, according to the Department of Justice.

In a White House memo to the justice department posted on Saturday, the executive branch identified the immigration system as one of several legal areas “where rampant fraud and meritless claims have supplanted the constitutional and lawful bases upon which the President exercises core powers”.

“The immigration bar, and powerful Big Law pro bono practices, frequently coach clients to conceal their past or lie about their circumstances when asserting their asylum claims, all in an attempt to circumvent immigration policies enacted to protect our national security and deceive the immigration authorities and courts into granting them undeserved relief,” the White House said.

The memo directed the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, “to prioritize enforcement of their respective regulations governing attorney conduct and discipline”.

Lawyers for Civil Rights, a legal advocacy group currently suing the administration over deportations, called Trump's sanctions threat hypocritical in a statement to Reuters, saying the president and his allies “have repeatedly thumbed their noses at the rule of law”.

The move to cut funding for legal representation was immediately denounced by immigrant legal and welfare groups.

“The US government is violating legal protections for immigrant children and forcing them to fight their immigration cases alone,” said Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, deputy director of the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.

“Already, we are seeing the government move for the expedited removal of unrepresented children. These services are critical not only as a matter of fundamental fairness – children should not be asked to stand up in court alone against a trained government attorney – but also for protecting children from trafficking, abuse and exploitation, and for helping immigration courts run more efficiently.”

Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), said the Trump administration had gone “all-in today on endangering unaccompanied children and interfering with their right to due process, breaking with decades of bipartisan congressional support for legal services for vulnerable children”.

Toczylowski added that without representation, “the 26,000 children whose access to counsel was slashed today will be at higher risk of exploitation and trafficking and their chances of obtaining legal protection will plummet. No child should be forced to fend for themselves against a trained [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] attorney without a lawyer by their side.”

A study published by Save the Children in December found that record numbers of unaccompanied minors have come into the US since 2021.

In 2022, the US Department of Health and Human Services received a record 128,904 unaccompanied minors, up from 122,731 in the prior year, the majority coming from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

There are more than 600,000 immigrant children who have crossed the US-Mexico border without a legal guardian or parent since 2019, according to government data.

According to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) memo – “Unaccompanied Alien Children Joint Initiative Field Implementation” – issued in February and obtained by ABC News and Reuters, agents are directed to detain unaccompanied immigrant children to ensure they are not victims of human trafficking or other forms of exploitation.

Ice agents are directed to categorize unaccompanied immigrants into three groups: “flight risk”, “public safety” and “border security”.

Republicans have claimed that the Biden administration “lost 300,000” immigrant children – figures that come from a Department of Homeland Security report referring to the number of minors whom agents had not been able to serve with papers to appear in court.

“The unique needs of children require the administration to ensure a level of care that takes into account their vulnerability while it determines whether they need long-term protection in the United States,” Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, said in a statement.

“To be successful in its goals, the government must partner with legal service providers and the vast network of private-sector pro bono partners who provide millions of dollars in free legal services to ensure children understand the process and can share their reasons for seeking safety in the United States.”

The attack comes amid ratcheting tension over whether the partial ceasefire is being honored and as negotiators prepare to return to Saudi Arabia on Monday.

KYIV — A Russian drone strike in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region killed three — a 41-year-old man, his 38-year-old wife and their 17-year-old daughter — on Friday, ratcheting tension over whether a limited ceasefire is being honored.

The Friday night attack also injured 12 people, including a baby, Ukrainian authorities said, and damaged multiple structures, among them six apartment buildings, a catering facility, a house and a school. The city “is experiencing another tragedy,” said Zaporizhzhia city council secretary Regina Kharchenko.

The attack comes as negotiators prepare to return to Saudi Arabia on Monday for continued talks. In recent days, both sides have accused the other of undermining the current agreement.

On Friday, a few hours after Russian drones attacked the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, striking a shopping mall and an apartment building, Moscow blamed Kyiv for blowing up a gas metering station in Sudzha, a town in western Russia seized last year by Ukraine and recently retaken by Russia. On Wednesday, the day President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talked on the phone, the Kremlin said Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot in its Kuban region, setting it ablaze for days.

“It is obvious that by such antics Kyiv is once again demonstrating its complete lack of commitment, as well as its lack of desire to achieve peace,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Saturday, following the attack on Zaporizhzhia.

Speaking with reporters in Kyiv on Friday during a visit from the president of the Czech Republic, Zelensky emphasized the need to protect civilian infrastructure, saying that his office was preparing a list of sites, including ports and railways, that were a priority. He denigrated Russian President Vladimir Putin for not accepting the complete ceasefire proposed by the United States — even as Zakharova said that Ukraine's “provocations” are “being used to disrupt the negotiation process.”

“People have suffered,” Zelensky said. “In fact, every day in Ukraine is marked by such Russian attacks. … There is no silence only because Putin does not accept this proposal.”

Speaking with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday, Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said that he thought they were getting close to that outcome.

“The ultimate goal is a 30-day ceasefire, during which time we discuss a permanent ceasefire,” he said. “We're not far away from that. … I am very, very optimistic that we're going to be able to bring the two sides together.”

Scattered in the rubble at the scene of Friday's shelling in Zaporizhzhia were family pictures of the victims — a snapshot of a woman with a thin smile of red lipstick, a blonde girl sitting against a blue wall.

The couple's older daughter is the family's only survivor.

On Instagram on Saturday, she posted photos of the family she'd lost: her 17-year-old sister, holding a bouquet of pink and white flowers, celebrating her birthday last week; her parents taking a selfie, faces pressed against each other; the girls with their mom, flashing peace signs with manicured nails, alongside the caption, “Soft clouds to you. I love you.”

“Just one perfect moment to lose your loved ones,” she said in the post. “Just like a terrible dream.”

Now, she said, she was fundraising for their funerals.

As delegations from Moscow and Kyiv prepare to meet US negotiators in Riyadh, details of pact remain unclear

Ukraine and Russia have agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after the US president, Donald Trump, spoke with the countries' leaders last week. But uncertainty remains about how or when the part-ceasefire will take effect as Ukraine and Russia prepare to send delegations to Riyadh this week for parallel talks with the US.

The three sides offered strikingly different interpretations of the limited ceasefire pact: the White House described it as covering both energy and infrastructure, the Kremlin framed it more narrowly as focused on energy infrastructure, while Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope that it would also include railways and ports.

There is also uncertainty on when the ceasefire was meant to go into effect.

Following Tuesday's call with Trump, Vladimir Putin gave the impression that the limited ceasefire would take effect immediately, reportedly ordering his military to stop all strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

Just hours later, Ukraine accused Russia of breaking its promises, with Zelenskyy reporting strikes on civilian infrastructure – including a hospital in Sumy. It remains unclear, however, whether Russia also targeted Ukraine's energy facilities.

Adding to the confusion, Moscow, in turn, accused Kyiv of violating the partial ceasefire, pointing to a strike on an oil depot that occurred before Zelenskyy had officially signed on to the truce.

The US is expected to push for a firm start date for the limited ceasefire when Ukrainian and Russian delegations hold separate talks with White House officials in Riyadh on Monday.

Ukraine remains deeply sceptical of any Russian agreement, pointing to past instances where Moscow failed to honour its commitments.

Zelenskyy's warning last month in Washington – that Russia cannot be trusted, backed by evidence of more than 25 ceasefire violations – was the initial spark that led to his dressing down by Trump and the vice-president, JD Vance.

The UK and European leaders have warned that Putin would face serious consequences if he violated a temporary ceasefire agreement. However, their leverage over Moscow remains limited – most sanctions have already been imposed, and Europe continues to struggle with supplying Ukraine with enough weapons to match Russia's military output.

Russia, meanwhile, is likely to seize on any Ukrainian ceasefire violations – real or fabricated – as a pretext to continue its offensive and pressure Washington into cutting off military support for Kyiv.

At present, the two sides remain far apart on what would be acceptable terms for a peace treaty, with no sign that Putin has relinquished any of his maximalist aims in the war against Ukraine.

Ukraine has laid out a step-by-step plan for peace: first, a full and immediate ceasefire, followed by negotiations toward a durable peace deal underpinned by western security guarantees.

Russia, meanwhile, insists that any agreement must be comprehensive from the outset, combining a ceasefire with long-term conditions in a single package – rejecting any phased approach.

Moscow has set out several key conditions for any long-term settlement – most of which are non-starters for Kyiv and its European allies. These include a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, restrictions on the size of its armed forces, and international recognition of the four Ukrainian regions Russia illegally annexed following staged referendums in 2022.

The Kremlin has also signalled it would reject any presence of western troops in Ukraine – something Kyiv views as essential to securing lasting security guarantees.

The Israel Defense Forces targeted “dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers and a command center,” killing six and wounding 17. Hezbollah denied launching rockets.

BEIRUT — Israel launched strikes on southern Lebanon on Saturday, killing at least six people, authorities here said, in response to rockets fired from across the border earlier in the day. The exchange was the largest since the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect late last year.

The ceasefire remained in place, but the exchange fueled concerns that Israel's resumption of war in Gaza could imperil the truce in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, both a militant group and a Lebanese political party, denied responsibility for the rockets and said it remains committed to the ceasefire.

Rocket fire from Lebanon on Saturday morning triggered sirens in northern Israel for the first time in months. U.N. peacekeepers said four projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel near the town of Metula around 7:30 a.m. Israel said it was six, three of which entered Israel and were intercepted.

The Israel Defense Forces said Saturday's attack “constitutes a blatant violation.” In response, the IDF said, it targeted “dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers and a command center.”

“We promised security to the residents of the Galilee — and that is exactly what will be,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said. “I have instructed the IDF to respond accordingly.”

The Israeli strikes killed six people in southern Lebanon, the Health Ministry here said, one of them a child. Seventeen others were wounded.

Most of the strikes hit rural areas, videos and images of the aftermath shared on social media indicated. But one video showed a town hit and people rushing through debris to a strike site in the middle of a street.

After the rocket fire, the Lebanese army said, troops on a “search and inspection operation” found and dismantled three primitive launchers on the outskirts of the southern Lebanese town of Nabatieh. It did not identify who controlled the launchers.

“Hezbollah denies any involvement in the launching of rockets from southern Lebanon,” the group said in a statement. The group said Israel's “allegations are merely pretexts for its continued attacks on Lebanon, which have not ceased since the ceasefire was announced.”

Hezbollah, backed by Iran, renewed its attacks on Israel in support of Hamas at the outset of the Gaza war in October 2023. Hamas-led fighters streamed out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in Israel. Israel responded with a military campaign to eradicate Hamas.

Regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel on the Lebanese border erupted in September into all-out war. More than 4,000 people were killed and 1 million displaced in Lebanon, with 60,000 people displaced in Israel, before the sides agreed to a ceasefire in November.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza in January under significant pressure from the Trump administration. But after weeks of relative quiet allowed the exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, Israel this week restarted the war, launching airstrikes that have killed more than 600 Gazans, the Health Ministry there says.

Hezbollah condemned Israel's return to war in Gaza but did not suggest it would resume hostilities on the border. The most recent previous rocket fire from Lebanon into Israel was in December. Israel launched strikes in retaliation then as well, but the exchange was contained.

Lebanese officials warned against further escalation. President Joseph Aoun condemned “attempts to drag Lebanon back into a cycle of violence,” according to the country's official National News Agency.

The ceasefire has been shaky from the start. Israel has maintained troops in southern Lebanon past a mid-February deadline to withdraw and has continued to strike at Hezbollah. Aoun said he considered the exchange Saturday to be part of a “failure to adhere to the details of the ceasefire agreement.”

UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, said it was “alarmed by the possible escalation of violence,” which it warned could risk “serious consequences for the region.” U.N. peacekeepers maintain a presence along Lebanon's southern border with Israel and have been caught up in the fighting there multiple times since the war escalated last year.

“We strongly urge all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, especially when civilian lives and the fragile stability observed in recent months are at risk,” UNIFIL said in a statement.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

Authorities responded on Friday to reports of gunfire at a park and have asked for videos from bystanders to aid in investigation

Three people were killed and at least 15 others were injured in a mass shooting on Friday night at an “unsanctioned car show” in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Local police said the shooting occurred at around 10pm on Friday at Young Park following “an altercation between two groups of people”. There were approximately 200 people at the park when the shooting occurred.

Those killed included two 19-year-old men and one 16-year-old boy. Police have not yet released the names of those killed and others who were injured but said that the victims were between 16 and 36 years old.

In a press conference on Saturday, police said that seven people who were injured had been sent from local hospitals to El Paso for further treatment. Four others have been treated and released, and police are still waiting on updates from local hospitals on the remaining four patients.

No arrests have been made but police are following “multiple leads”, officials said, adding that “this is a huge crime scene with a lot of moving parts”.

In a statement on Facebook on Saturday, the Las Cruces police department issued a public request for videos from the Young Park shooting, particularly “video that shows the shooting or subjects with firearms, to submit the video so investigators can analyze it and help develop a better understanding of the incident”.

Police added that casings had been located “throughout the park and parking lot” and that “all the casings located so far are handgun caliber casings”.

One witness, 20-year-old Angel Legaspy, whose parked car was struck by bullets, told the New York Times: “They just started shooting and they just started running around everybody,” adding that the shooting was “like all over the place”.

On Saturday morning, Johana Bencomo, a Las Cruces city councilor and the mayor pro temp, wrote on Instagram: “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city but that actually feels deeply untrue. Honestly [nowadays] a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment, yet also always praying and hoping it never will.

“As with all acts of gun violence in our city and beyond, my heart is broken for the victims and families impacted. This was a heinous act of violence that will leave our city mourning,” she added.

New Mexico's governor, Michelle Grisham, has also issued a statement, saying: “The indiscriminate nature of this shooting is both shocking and unacceptable, but sadly not surprising. This violence tears at the fabric of our communities and leaves wounds that may never heal.”

“I am mobilizing state resources to support local law enforcement in their investigation. If you have any information, particularly video or images that could help identify those responsible, please come forward and contact the Las Cruces police department immediately,” she added.

The Guardian has reached out to city officials for comment.

In a memo on Friday, president also revoked clearances for Antony Blinken, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Letitia James

Donald Trump moved to revoke security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a string of other top Democrats and political enemies in a presidential memo issued late on Friday.

The security clearance revocations include former secretary of state Antony Blinken, former Wyoming representative Liz Cheney, former Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who prosecuted Trump for fraud, as well as Biden's entire family. They will no longer have access to classified information – a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.

“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump wrote. Trump said he would also “direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals”.

Earlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump's memo, along with “the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden disinformation letter” – referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.

Trump's decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike on his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”.

Earlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden's children, Hunter and Ashley, “effective immediately”, after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president's son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.

More broadly, the security clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president's political enemies, including the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.

Others on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss's alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans who served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban “includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community”.

The moves comes as NBC News reported that former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, have volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden's nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.

According to the network, Biden made the proffer last month when he met the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, but the offer had not been embraced.

An NBC News poll published last weekend found the Democratic party's popularity has dropped to a record low – only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party. On Friday, Trump was asked about the prospect of Biden re-entering the political area. “I hope so,” he responded.

Incoming International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Kirsty Coventry has said she does not support banning athletes from the Olympics based on their countries' involvement in armed conflicts. In an interview to Sky News on Friday, she also announced plans to initiate discussions about Russia's return to competition. 

Russian and Belarusian athletes were prohibited from competing in the Games shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The IOC also insisted that international sports federations follow suit, leading to both countries being excluded from major global sporting events. The committee later allowed some athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in the Games as individuals under neutral flags, including at the Paris Olympics in 2024, while national teams have remained barred.

When asked by Sky News a day after being elected to the post whether she opposed banning nations from the Olympics due to military conflicts, Coventry said: “I am, but I believe each situation must be considered individually.”

Coventry, who is now set to become the first woman and the first African to head the IOC, also pledged to establish a task force to develop “some policies and some guiding frameworks that we as the movement can use to make decisions when we are brought into conflicts.” 

The former Olympic swimmer, who won two gold medals for Zimbabwe, admitted that there are “horrific conflicts in Africa at the moment,” highlighting the necessity to protect and support athletes, ensuring they have the opportunity to come to the Olympic Games.

Asked about allowing the Russian national team to return to the Olympics in 2026, Coventry said: “We're going to have that discussion with a collective group, as I'd said, with the task force.”

Coventry was elected as the 10th president of the IOC on Thursday, having secured a majority of the vote. The 41-year-old came ahead of Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. and Britain's Sebastian Coe, who finished second and third in the voting, respectively.

Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Coventry on her IOC election, saying that her “experience and dedication to the true advancement of the noble Olympic ideals will ensure your success in such a responsible position.”

Russian officials have repeatedly slammed Western nations for politicizing international sports and exerting pressure on sports federations to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes for political reasons.

A unique home in Bengaluru, built entirely without cement, is making waves online after content creator Priyam Saraswat shared a video tour of the property.

The owner claims it to be the world's first zero-cement stone house, designed for sustainability and a net-zero carbon footprint.

A post shared by Priyam Saraswat (@priyamsaraswat)

Built to last 1,000+ years?In the video, Priyam speaks to both the owner and the architect, who reveal that the house is constructed solely from different types of stone, including grey granite and sandstone. Unlike conventional construction methods, no cement or blasting techniques were used to build the structure. The owner cites sustainability as the key motivation behind the project, claiming that the house is designed to last over 1,000 years. (Also Read: RSS Bengaluru event under fire for 'neglecting' Kannada, triggers public outrage) How did social media users react?The house has sparked a flurry of reactions on social media, with many users praising its sustainability while others questioned its practicality. One user remarked, "This is amazing! Ancient Indian architecture used similar techniques. This feels like a modern revival." However, not everyone was convinced. Another pointed out, "How can he patent this? Temples have been built using interlocking methods for centuries." Some were concerned about how livable the house would be in extreme weather conditions, with one commenting, "It looks stunning, but how will it handle extreme summers and winters?". Others raised questions about the sustainability claim, arguing, "Mining stone disrupts nature—how sustainable is this really?" The video has garnered over 800,000 views on X (formerly Twitter) and 425,000 views on Instagram, along with thousands of likes and reshares.

Andrew Tate, the self-styled "king of toxic masculinity", and his brother Tristan have flown from the US to Romania to fulfil legal obligations related to a criminal investigation against them.

The brothers are under investigation in Romania on multiple accusations, including forming an organised crime group and human trafficking. They have denied all wrongdoing.

The brothers' plane - which Andrew Tate said earlier in a post on X cost $185,000 dollars (£143,140 to "jet across the Atlantic to sign one single piece of paper" - landed at Bucharest Henri Coanda International Airport shortly before 1am local time on Saturday morning.

After arriving at their residence near Bucharest, they vowed to clear their names in court, with Tate saying "innocent men don't run from anything".

He went on to tell reporters: "After all we've been through, we truly deserve the day in court where it is stated that we've done nothing wrong and that we should have never been in court in the first place. We should have never gone to jail. We should have never had our assets seized. We should have never had our names slandered.

"Anyone who believed any of this garbage has a particularly low IQ."

As part of preventative judicial control measures pending the investigation, the Tates are required to regularly check in with authorities in Romania. Their next check-in is due on Monday.

Their return to Romania comes almost a month after the brothers travelled to Florida after Romanian prosecutors lifted a travel ban against them.

Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier said earlier this month that his office had opened a criminal investigation against the brothers, a move welcomed by the US National Centre on Sexual Exploitation, which represents one of Tate's alleged victims.

Tate said on X at the time that the brothers had returned to Miami to see family and had been insulted by the opening of the investigation.

"We have no criminal record and expected a hero's welcome after being unfairly abused abroad," he wrote.

An initial criminal case against the Tate brothers failed in December when a Bucharest court decided not to start the trial and sent the files back to prosecutors, citing flaws in the indictment.

A British arrest warrant has also been issued for the Tates and they will be extradited after the Romanian trial proceedings are completed.

The allegations in Britain, which they have denied, relate to sexual aggression between 2012 and 2015.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on his supporters to vote for a candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court who already had the full-throated backing of Trump's billionaire adviser Elon Musk.

“All Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

Trump's post came a little over a week before the April 1 election that will determine control of the court, which since 2023 has a majority of liberal justices. Who controls the court will impact a wide range of pending high profile issues, like abortion rights and congressional district boundaries, but it could also determine what the voting rules are for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election in the battleground state.

Schimel reacted to Trump's post with a statement saying: “I'm humbled and deeply honored to receive the endorsement of our President.” He added, “On April 1, Wisconsin conservatives must unite to restore objectivity to our Supreme Court and save our state like we saved our country in November.”

Schimel, a former Republican attorney general, is a Trump backer who had previously said he would welcome an endorsement from the president. He also appeared at a rally with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., in March, posed for a picture in front of a giant inflated Trump and attended Trump's inauguration in January. Schimel has also benefited from more than $12 million spent by groups funded by Musk.

One of the mailers used by the Musk group says that Schimel would back Trump's agenda from the Supreme Court. Trump Jr. stressed that a Schimel win was needed to protect his father's agenda. And Schimel told a group of Turning Point USA canvassers earlier this month that he needs to be elected to be part of a “support network” for Trump.

“Donald Trump doesn't do this by himself; there has to be a support network around him,” Schimel said, according to a video of his comments posted on YouTube. “They filed over 70 lawsuits against him since he took the oath of office barely a month ago, over 70 lawsuits to try to stop almost every single thing he's doing because they don't want him to get a win. ”

Schimel has also echoed unfounded concerns about unproven voter fraud that Trump raised following his 2020 loss.

Despite all of that, Schimel has repeatedly said he would not let his feelings about Trump impact any rulings he would make on the state Supreme Court, which came one vote away from reversing Trump's loss in Wisconsin in 2020. Trump won the state in both 2016 and 2024.

“If President Trump or anyone defies Wisconsin law and I end up with a case in front of me, I'll hold them accountable as I would anybody in my courtroom,” Schimel said during a March debate.

Schimel faces Democratic-backed candidate Susan Crawford in the election for an open seat. Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Whoever wins will be elected to a 10-year term that begins in August.

On Truth Social, Trump called Crawford “the handpicked voice of the Leftists who are out to destroy your State, and our Country — And if she wins, the Movement to restore our Nation will bypass Wisconsin.”

A spokesman for Crawford's campaign said, “Schimel has spent his entire career on bent knee to right-wing special interests, we assumed he had this endorsement locked up months ago.”

This isn't the first time Trump has gotten involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race. He endorsed the conservative candidate in the 2023 whose loss led to liberals taking control of the court for the first time in 15 years.

        Nearly 600 Palestinians have now been killed since the truce between Israel and Hamas was shattered on Tuesday.
    

Israeli forces advanced deeper into the Gaza Strip on Friday and blew up the only specialised cancer hospital in the war-torn territory.

The violence came as Israeli leaders vowed to capture more land until Hamas releases its remaining hostages.

The hospital was located in the Netzarim Corridor, which splits Gaza in two and was controlled by Israeli troops for most of the 17-month-long war. Israel moved to retake the corridor this week shortly after breaking the ceasefire with Hamas. The truce delivered relative calm to Gaza since late January and facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages.

The Israeli military said it struck the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, which was inaccessible to doctors and patients during the war, because Hamas militants were operating in the site. Turkey, which helped build and fund the hospital, said Israeli troops at one point used it as a base.

Dr. Zaki Al-Zaqzouq, head of the hospital's oncology department, said a medical team visited the facility during the ceasefire and found that, while it had suffered damage, some facilities remained in good condition.

“I cannot fathom what could be gained from bombing a hospital that served as a lifeline for so many patients,” he said in a statement issued by the aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the hospital's destruction and accused Israel of deliberately “rendering Gaza uninhabitable and forcibly displacing the Palestinian people.”

Hospitals can lose their protected status under international law if they are used for military purposes, but any operations against them must be proportional. Human rights groups and U.N.-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza's health care system.

Israel's renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip threatens to be even deadlier and more destructive than the last, as it pursues wider aims with far fewer constraints.

Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday that his country would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive.

“The more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” Katz said.

The Israeli military said on Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighbourhoods west of Gaza City, and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas.

The warnings came shortly after the military said it intercepted two rockets fired from northern Gaza that set off sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. Hamas had also fired three rockets the previous day in its first attack since Israel ended the ceasefire.

A long-range missile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels set off air raid sirens over Jerusalem and central Israel for the fourth day in a row on Friday, with the military saying it was intercepted.

In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's push to fire the domestic security chief has deepened a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza. It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country's division of powers.

Hours after Netanyahu's Cabinet unanimously approved the firing of Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet security service, the Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to his dismissal until an appeal can be heard. Netanyahu's office had said Bar's dismissal was effective April 10, but that it could come earlier.

Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar. However, Netanyahu sounded defiant in a social media post on Friday evening, saying: “The State of Israel is a state of law and according to the law, the Israeli government decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

Critics say the move is a power grab by the prime minister against an independent-minded civil servant, and tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated in support of Bar, including outside Netanyahu's residence on Friday.

Netanyahu has resisted calls for an official state commission of inquiry into the attack and has tried to blame the failures on the army and security agencies.

A Shin Bet report into Hamas' 7 October 2023 attack that prompted the war in Gaza acknowledged failures by the security agency.

But it also said policies by the Netanyahu government created the conditions for the attack.

In addition to its report on the Hamas incursion, Netanyahu is reportedly also unhappy that Shin Bet has launched an investigation into connections between some of his close aides and Qatar.

Around 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war with a wave of predawn airstrikes across Gaza on Tuesday, which came as many families slept or prepared to start the daily fast for the holy month of Ramadan.

Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over the ceasefire negotiations.

The attack by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Boo in the Soo? Quite the opposite, in fact.

At sports venues across the country, booing the American national anthem has become a common refrain in recent weeks — a not-so-polite protest of President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs and incessant musings about Canada becoming the 51st state.

Boos drowned out The Star-Spangled Banner at the 4 Nations Cup in Montreal, for example, and at Toronto FC's home opener against Chicago last week.

Even Justin Trudeau defended the trend in his waning days as prime minister.

“We're probably going to keep booing the American anthem,” he told reporters at a March 4 press conference. “But let me tell Americans: We're not booing you. We're not booing your teams. We're not booing your players. We're booing a policy that is designed to hurt us. We're insulted, we're angry.”

Which brings us to last night's Soo Greyhounds game against the Saginaw Spirit. It marked the first time since Feb. 12 that a U.S. team had visited the Hounds' home rink, and the first time since Trump's trade war really turned ugly.

How did fans react? A couple of scattered boos at the start — and resounding applause at the end. The video above captures the whole scene.

What do you think? Should Canadian fans be booing the U.S. anthem? Fill out our poll below.

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The parents of a U.S. college student who vanished almost two weeks ago in the resort town of Punta Cana have asked authorities to declare her legally dead.

In a letter to Dominican police dated Monday, Subbarayudu and Sreedevi Konanki state that after an extensive search, local authorities believe that Sudiksha, a 20-year-old student at the University of Pittsburgh, drowned.

“Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence,” they wrote. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.”

A police official not authorized to speak about the case confirmed Tuesday that authorities received the letter.

Sudiksha Konanki and five female friends had traveled to the Caribbean nation on March 3 for spring break. Police said she disappeared at a beach by her hotel before dawn on March 6.

Authorities have interviewed people who were with Konanki before she vanished, including Joshua Riibe, a senior at St. Cloud University in Minnesota.

Riibe has been detained by Dominican police and is believed to be the last person to see Konanki. He has not been named as a suspect.

He is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday afternoon following a request from his attorney that he be released.

According to the transcript of an interview with prosecutors, reported by Dominican media as well as NBC and Telemundo, Riibe told police he was drinking with Konanki on the beach and they were kissing in the ocean when they got caught in a current. Riibe said he was a former lifeguard and helped bring her ashore.

He told investigators he vomited upon reaching the beach and that Konanki said she was going to fetch her things. When he looked up, she was gone. He said he was later surprised to hear of her disappearance.

In their letter, the Konankis wrote that “the individual” last seen with their daughter is cooperating and that no evidence of foul play has been found.

Sudiksha Konanki was born in India and later became a U.S. permanent resident.

MIAMI — The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it will revoke legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, setting them up for potential deportation in about a month.

The order applies to about 532,000 people from the four countries who came to the United States since October 2022. They arrived with financial sponsors and were given two-year permits to live and work in the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they will lose their legal status on April 24, or 30 days after the publication of the notice in the Federal Register.

The new policy impacts people who are already in the U.S. and who came under the humanitarian parole program. It follows an earlier Trump administration decision to end what it called the "broad abuse" of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there's war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

During his campaign President Donald Trump promised to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally, and as president he has been also ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the U.S. and to stay.

DHS said parolees without a lawful basis to stay in the U.S. "must depart" before their parole termination date.

"Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status," DHS said.

Before the new order, the beneficiaries of the program could stay in the U.S. until their parole expires, although the administration had stopped processing their applications for asylum, visas and other requests that might allow them to remain longer.

The administration decision has already been challenged in federal courts.

A group of American citizens and immigrants sued the Trump administration for ending humanitarian parole and are seeking to reinstate the programs for the four nationalities.

Lawyers and activists raised their voices to denounce the government's decision.

Friday's action is "going to cause needless chaos and heartbreak for families and communities across the country," said Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit at the end of February. She called it "reckless, cruel and counterproductive."

The Biden administration allowed up to 30,000 people a month from the four countries to come to the United States for two years with eligibility to work. It persuaded Mexico to take back the same number from those countries because the U.S. could deport few, if any, to their homes.

Cuba generally accepted about one deportation flight a month, while Venezuela and Nicaragua refused to take any. All three are U.S. adversaries.

Haiti accepted many deportation flights, especially after a surge of migrants from the Caribbean country in the small border town of Del Rio, Texas, in 2021. But Haiti has been in constant turmoil, hampering U.S. efforts.

Since late 2022, more than half a million people have come to the U.S. under the policy, also known as CHNV. It was a part of the Biden administration's approach to encourage people to come through new legal channels while cracking down on those who crossed the border illegally.

President Donald Trump in a Friday night memo rescinded any existing security clearances and access to classified information for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Kamala Harris and various other officials.

"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information," the executive memo reads. "I hereby direct every executive department and agency head to take all additional action as necessary and consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals and to immediately rescind their access to classified information."

Representatives for Harris and Clinton did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday night.

The memo also states that the people named — 15 in all — will not have access to classified briefings or the ability to access secure U.S. government facilities without an escort.

Others named in the directive include former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former national security adviser Jake Sullivan and New York Attorney General Letitia James. It also applies to any members of the Biden family.

Many of the people in Trump's memo already had their clearances revoked this month by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

The State Department indicated in 2018 that Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 presidential election, had her security clearance withdrawn that year, at her request. It's unclear if her clearance was later reinstated.

Trump in February said he was cutting off former President Joe Biden's access to intelligence information.

Earlier this week, Trump said he was terminating Secret Service protection for Biden's two adult children: Hunter and Ashley Biden.

Among the first action's Trump took in January was rescinding the security clearance of at least 50 former intelligence officials who signed a letter during the 2020 campaign suggesting the contents of a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden had the “classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.”

MESSMORE, Pa. – Meteorologists with the National Weather Service say they never know what they'll encounter during a storm survey and while it's not unusual to come across something unexpected, discovering a mysterious creature lurking in the background of one of their photos certainly makes for a memorable experience.

During a recent investigation into damage caused by severe weather, something unusual was spotted beyond a fallen tree - the appearance of what many refer to as "Bigfoot."

The sighting occurred in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, an area nestled within the hills and the higher terrain of the Allegheny Mountains, north of West Virginia.

The figure appeared to be human-sized, if not larger, as it walked through the wooded landscape, but, according to an NWS meteorologist, there is no need to worry, as what was spotted was likely something purposely staged to add a bit of fun to people's lives.

Locals said it's rather common for residents to create figures out of iron or other similar materials, either for decoration or to spark curiosity from passersby.

While the recent sighting may not have been an actual living creature, there have been historical reports of similar-sized entities in the region.

According to the Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society, in 1977, a family driving along a dark stretch of a nearby roadway spotted a six-foot-tall figure covered in shaggy, reddish-brown hair. When they shined their headlights at it, the creature reportedly disappeared over a 40-foot embankment, never to be seen again.

In 2004, in nearby Greene County, two friends reported seeing a 7-foot-tall creature making cat-like noises during their bike ride, and in 2013, a man reported seeing an 8-foot-tall creature with caveman-like features in the far distance.

According to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, Pennsylvania is often a hotspot for sightings and ranks in the top 10 of states with the most reports.

The earliest reports of Sasquatch sightings date back to at least the 1800s, according to the State of Washington.

Many of these early cases lacked photos or video evidence, so they were often dismissed as misunderstandings or gags.

Advancements in technology have led to numerous modern sightings captured on video or in photos, fueling ongoing debate about the existence of these creatures.

Despite actually seeing apparitions of a figure, many believe there's more to these encounters than meets the eye.

Studies over the years have pointed to some sightings actually being large bears, while others could be pranks or attempts by people to simply gain attention.

For now, there's no conclusive evidence to prove the existence of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or whatever name you prefer to call it.

So, if you ever find yourself driving along Messmore Road in Fayette County, don't be alarmed if you spot something out of the ordinary - it simply appears to be a lawn decoration meant to capture a passerby's imagination.

Washington — Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Congress created the government-funded Radio Free Asia to broadcast facts into countries where governments are afraid of them.  

"The U.S. saw China gunning down its own citizens and then also successfully covering it up afterwards," RFA President Bay Fang told CBS News. "The U.S. Congress created us with an eye to giving these people in China and other authoritarian countries around Asia the ability to have free press, to get access to the truth through an unbiased news service."

Fang put 75% of RFA staff on leave Friday, the result of funding cuts ordered by Kari Lake, senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent agency of RFA and Voice of America, the nation's largest international broadcaster. 

Last weekend, all full-time employees and contractors with VOA were informed they were being placed on administrative leave, while Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty were notified that federal grants for both broadcasters had been terminated. 

"USAGM and the outlets it oversees will be reduced to their statutory functions and associated personnel will be reduced to the minimum presence and function required by law," the agency said in a March 15 statement. 

Lake, a former television broadcaster who ran unsuccessful Republican governor and Senate campaigns in Arizona, had been initially tapped by President Trump to serve as VOA director before taking on the role of senior adviser to USAGM. 

RFA had a full-time staff of about 400 people prior to the layoffs, according to its website. It also had another approximately 500 stringers and contractors. 

At least eight RFA journalists could be forced to leave the U.S. if they lose their work visas. Vietnamese journalist Khoa Lai is one of them and fears the possibility of being deported.

"I believe so, but I hope not," Lai said. "I believe that if I go back, then the government will snatch me right away."

Five people who worked for RFA are already behind bars overseas. RFA funds their families and their legal defense.

"These are not U.S. citizens, but they are people who are in jail because they worked for a U.S.- funded network," Fang said. 

RFA's stated mission is to provide fair, objective and uncensored news and information to Asian nations where there are few, if any, free speech protections.

 "We're worth saving because we actually bring benefit to the U.S. taxpayer," Fang said. "I think it is in the U.S. national security interest to have something like us. We are actually one of the lowest cost-effective elements of soft power that they could have."

RFA told CBS News that unless the courts, Congress or a private financier steps in, it only has enough money to continue broadcasting for approximately one more month. On Friday, meanwhile, a group of VOA employees filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking to be reinstated.

Oops, something went wrong

Capping credit card interest rates is starting to look like the hot policy idea of the season for populist lawmakers on both the left and right.

This month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive star from New York, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a MAGA favorite from Florida, teamed up to introduce a bill to limit credit card APRs at 10%. It follows similar legislation from Sens. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont, and Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, which would put in place the same 10% rate ceiling for five years.

The cost of credit has become a more pressing issue in recent years thanks to rising interest rates, which have helped fuel increasing delinquencies: The average APR was about 21.5% at the end of last year, up from 14.7% in 2020, according to the Federal Reserve.

For now, these bills mostly seem to be political signaling exercises that are unlikely to go anywhere soon. Democrats may also see them as a way of challenging President Trump to make good on his campaign-season promise to pass a credit card cap, an idea mostly embraced by progressives in the past. (In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.)

But the bipartisan enthusiasm suggests that limiting what card issuers can charge their customers may have legs down the line. For many voters, it's a pressing pocketbook concern: About half of credit card accounts revolve a balance from month to month, while 13% of cardholders make only the minimum payment due, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

As they've hiked interest rates, credit card companies' margins have hit all-time highs. To some, that's a sign that companies could continue lending profitably to most of their customers even with a rate cap cutting a bit into their profits.

The challenge, as almost any economist will note, is that limiting rates will likely mean less access to credit for Americans with weaker credit scores since lending to them won't be as profitable.

That might be for the best for some households if it saves them from overborrowing. But many could be forced to resort to other, even less affordable types of debt to cover emergency expenses. And even without the aid of a high-APR credit card, some still find ways to make unaffordable purchases on credit, such as through buy now, pay later plans.

The question is how low is too low before restrictions do more harm than good. A 10% rate might be overly strict. But what about a 25% cap? Or 35%?

“At the end of the day, it's a trade-off,” said Breno Braga, an Urban Institute senior fellow who has studied the impact of interest caps. “You want to maximize the number of people that benefit from it and minimize the number of people that suffer from it.”

Usury laws are nothing new. At least 76 countries impose limits on lending rates, according to World Bank researchers, and at least 26 have chosen to place caps on all types of credit. In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright.

Studies on the impact of payday loan limits have yielded conflicting results. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. Others suggest the laws cut back on payday loan use without those drawbacks.

What would happen if the government tried to limit what Visa or Mastercard can charge? In the US, there's at least one recent real-world example we can draw conclusions from: The Military Lending Act, which originally capped the interest rates on payday and other loans for active-duty service members at 36%. In 2015, the law was expanded to cover revolving products like credit cards.

The change had a fairly limited impact on troops' wallets, according to a paper by Braga and his colleagues at Urban. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

The absolute riskiest borrowers appear to have felt the change more. After the reform passed, people with Vantage credit scores under 500 were less likely to have a credit card and saw their borrowing limits lowered. At the same time, their credit ratings and delinquency rates didn't improve, suggesting the group lost access to credit without much benefit.

One reason the 36% cap might not have had much effect overall is that, during the time period studied, relatively few people had credit cards with an APR above 36%. Today, with rates higher, the impact might be wider.

The cap Ocasio-Cortez and Luna have proposed would certainly bite much harder, and likely cut off access to credit for many millions more. Even among superprime borrowers with credit ratings above 720, average APRs are typically higher than 10%. There's also concern that companies might try to skirt a severe limit by charging new fees, though the bill tries to prohibit that.

Still, it's possible to imagine looser limits making some headway in Washington.

In 2019, for instance, a bipartisan bill that would have extended the Military Lending Act's 36% rate cap to all Americans was nearly reported out of committee but derailed by the pandemic. Politically, a bill like that could one day be ready for a comeback.

Oops, something went wrong

BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink orchestrated the Panama Canal port takeover that made President Trump happy, but the cost may be an angry Xi Jinping.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the Chinese leader is not happy with a $22.8 billion deal giving a BlackRock-led investment coalition control of two key ports on either end of the vital shipping lane currently owned by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison.

CK Hutchison, which is controlled by the family of 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, didn't seek preapproval from Chinese government leadership, according to the Wall Street Journal.

What's more, Chinese leaders hoped to use the ports as a bargaining chip with the Trump administration as part of larger talks between the two countries, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Other signs of displeasure emerged in articles and commentary published in pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao, arguing that Chinese ships would now face restrictions in the canal and accusing CK Hutchison of "prioritizing profit over everything, disregarding national interests and national righteousness."

The deal deserves "serious attention," Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, added earlier this week, without directly criticizing CK Hutchison.

The rumblings from Beijing add a new layer of complications to what appeared to be a big win for BlackRock's Fink, who himself reached out to the White House after Trump alleged Chinese interference in the canal and said he wanted to "take it back."

Fink argued to the White House that there would be no need to forcibly take the ports if BlackRock were to arrange a purchase on its own.

Trump referenced the deal during his address to Congress earlier this month while still reiterating that "my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal" and "taking it back."

It's not immediately clear what steps Hong Kong or Beijing could take to block the transaction, which isn't yet final and still requires consent from various regulators. The companies hope to sign a definitive agreement by April 2.

Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese authorities are examining the deal closely. Bloomberg said the review includes any signs of security breaches or antitrust violations, while the Wall Street Journal said officials have been told to see what Beijing can do to hinder the deal.

BlackRock's stock price would likely "see a little hit" if the pact falls through, according to CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert, but the bigger threat would be to the credibility of BlackRock's newly bolstered infrastructure group.

Last year, BlackRock paid $12 billion to buy private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners — a major investor in energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects — and GIP was part of the consortium that agreed to buy the ports at either end of the Panama Canal.

"There may be some pressure for this group to spin out or announce another deal to sort of regain some marketplace credibility," Seifert added.

The deal negotiated by BlackRock and GIP involves much more than just the Panama ports — it includes a total of 43 ports in 23 countries.

Fink, speaking at a Houston energy conference earlier this month, said there were some misconceptions about the deal as reported in the press. One was that BlackRock itself was buying the entire canal.

"My kids called me and said, 'BlackRock bought the Panama Canal? Can we go on it?' And I said, 'We did not buy the Panama Canal.'"

He also said the "far left" and "far right" didn't mention that there were many other ports in the deal, including six along the Suez Canal. "They mentioned we bought two" — the ones along the Panama Canal.

Those two ports, he said, represent 4% of the total value of the transaction.

He noted that ports do offer a great business for BlackRock, which will now have 100 in its portfolio if this deal goes through. They can produce returns of 15% to 16%, he said.

"Even with tariffs and other things, it means the ports will be quite active," he said.

This is not the first time CK Hutchison or Li Ka-shing, nicknamed "Superman" for his business prowess in Hong Kong, have faced criticism from Beijing.

When Li served at the conglomerate's helm in 2015, CK Hutchison faced backlash for diversifying its business to European assets. That's where the bulk of its revenue now currently comes from, according to Nikkei.

In an earnings statement on Thursday, CK Hutchison did not mention the ports deal but said that "geopolitical and trade tensions have ... risen significantly."

Victor Li, chair of CK Hutchison and son of Li Ka-shing, said in a statement Thursday accompanying the earnings release that the environment for CK Hutchison's businesses could be "both volatile and unpredictable" this year.

Oops, something went wrong

Chinese tech giant ByteDance has roughly two weeks to save its video app TikTok from a renewed US ban — and there are signs cloud computing giant Oracle (ORCL) could play a prominent role.

ByteDance faces a federal mandate to divest the popular social media app but won a reprieve from President Trump, who, on his first day in office, asked his attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days. If ByteDance can't find a buyer for TikTok's US operations, the ban passed by Congress will kick in April 5.

Vice President JD Vance told reporters this past week that a high-level agreement satisfying US national security concerns by early April was "almost" certain.

President Trump said last weekend that four bidders had emerged, but he didn't identify them. Names previously floated by Trump and others have included Microsoft (MSFT), AI startup Perplexity, a coalition of billionaire investors, and even the US government.

One prominent corporate name, however, keeps surfacing: Oracle.

The tech giant co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison already acts as TikTok's primary cloud provider and had attempted a prior purchase of TikTok that eventually fizzled during Trump's first term in 2020.

The app started routing its US traffic through Oracle's cloud in 2022 in an overhaul known as "Project Texas" that aimed to satisfy US regulatory demands to store Americans' data domestically.

Now Oracle is a leading contender to help rescue TikTok from its current predicament, the Information reported this past week. ByteDance's leaders reportedly want to retain a hands-on role with TikTok's operations in any such deal.

Bloomberg separately reported that an Oracle deal being mulled by the White House would task the tech giant with safeguarding Americans' data on TikTok in exchange for a stake in the company, while leaving app's algorithm in the hands of ByteDance.

TikTok and its CEO Shou Zi Chew have repeatedly objected to letting go of the app's proprietary algorithm. Neither TikTok nor Oracle responded to a request for comment.

On Friday, Reuters offered up yet another scenario involving Oracle. 

The news agency said the biggest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance may increase their existing stakes and acquire the US operations of TikTok as part of a new entity, while Oracle protects the US user data to ensure it is not available to China.

These investors include Jeff Yass' Susquehanna International Group and Bill Ford's General Atlantic. In such a scenario, Chinese ownership in the new business would drop below a critical 20% threshold needed to avoid the US ban.

"Every day there is another TikTok rumor," Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary, who is part of a consortium pursuing its own bid for the app's US operations, told Yahoo Finance this past week.

But "it doesn't matter what I want or what Larry wants," O'Leary said, referring to Oracle's Ellison. "What matters now is the narrative now between Xi and Trump," referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

"The question is, 'Does Xi want to sell TikTok, yes or no?'"

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, operates under Chinese Communist Party law, which requires it to share user data upon request.

US intelligence officials have expressed concern that the CCP could use Americans' data against them and use TikTok's algorithm to gain backdoor access to swaths of information on US citizens.

To address those concerns, former President Biden signed legislation last April requiring TikTok to divest or face a nationwide ban. The US Supreme Court upheld the law against a constitutional challenge from TikTok and TikTok users.

In effect, the statute outlawed app stores — like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) — and cloud services from offering the app for downloads unless it is controlled by a country that the US does not consider adversarial.

The law resulted in TikTok's short-lived shutdown on Jan. 20, Trump's first day back in office. That same day, Trump delayed enforcement of the divestment via executive order.

The order, which experts have said is legally dubious, opened a 75-day window for the Trump administration "to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way" for TikTok's US business.

Trump has said he is open to an extension of the 75-day pause if a deal isn't reached by the deadline. Trump is not empowered to repeal the law; new legislation to overturn the measure would need to be approved by a majority of federal lawmakers.

Vance told reporters this past week that "we'd like to get it done without the extension."

“I think the question is, what is the equity ownership of the new joint venture? Vance added. "How do you do the contracts for all the investors, the customers, the service providers? … The deal itself will be very clear, but actually creating those thousands and thousands of pages of legal documents, that's the one thing that I worry could slip.”

Trump has sent encouraging signals about Ellison playing a role in the TikTok situation.

"I'd like Larry to buy it too," the president said on Jan. 21, with Ellison standing next to him at a press conference held to announce a new $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure commitment.

"Larry, let's negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said as SoftBank CEO Masa Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also looked on.

"What I'm thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we'll give you the permit. And they'll have a great partner, the United States."

"Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President," Ellison said.

But Trump has also denied talks with Oracle when asked about the subject in late January after NPR reported that the company could be part of a TikTok deal.

"No, not with Oracle," he said then, adding that "I never spoke to Larry about TikTok."

Oops, something went wrong

Barely a year after the National Association of Realtors settled a lawsuit and rewrote the rules for how agents get paid, the powerful trade group is examining the fate of another policy that could change how homes are bought and sold across the country.

The policy, known as Clear Cooperation, requires agents to list homes on shared databases known as multiple listing services (MLS) within one business day of beginning to market the properties. The rule is designed to cut down on what are known as “off-market” or “pocket” listings, where a home for sale is marketed semi-privately to small pools of potential buyers without being advertised widely on the MLS.

Since it took effect in 2020, the policy has sparked fierce debate within the real estate world and at times pitted its top players against each other. Proponents argue that the rule helps ensure that the industry follows fair housing laws and helps sellers secure top prices for their homes by putting them in front of the broadest pool of potential buyers. Opponents, meanwhile, say sellers should get to dictate how their homes are marketed and argue that the MLS listing requirement violates antitrust laws.

The NAR is currently reviewing whether the rule should be repealed, remain in place, or be changed. At a time when the number of homes for sale remains below historical norms and brokerages have consolidated, the decision has implications for how hundreds of thousands of homes are marketed and sold each year.

“We take for granted that you can go to any portal ... and have a complete and total data set that's accurate in real time,” said Leo Pareja, the CEO of eXp Realty. “That only comes from the cooperative structure we have set up where everyone shares everything.”

A profitable niche

Pareja thinks his firm, the country's largest by agent count, would benefit if the policy is repealed. But he'd like to see it stay in place because he believes more transparency is better and cheaper for consumers.

Where most real estate companies fall on the issue tends to align with whether or not they benefit from the rule. Executives at Zillow and Redfin, which aggregate home listings from the MLS, are for it. Compass, a luxury-focused brokerage that touts its access to “Private Exclusives,” is against it. Anywhere Real Estate, the parent company of franchises including Century 21, Coldwell Baker, and Sotheby's International Realty, has said it would like to see the rule remain but with changes.

Pocket listings are a relatively niche way to sell a home in most parts of the country. Data is scarce, but estimates generally put the deals at 5% or less of sales nationwide. Using deals that were listed as “sold” the same day they first appeared on the MLS as a proxy, Redfin estimates that they made up 1.8% of deals in mid-2024.

They're most common in high-end real estate, where celebrities or other VIP clients may be keen on keeping a transaction low profile. Those sellers also sometimes want to test their listing prices in more private channels to avoid the stigma of publicly cutting prices or having a home linger on the market for months for all to see.

“With the luxury markets, they do like to keep things close to the vest,” said Linda Hussey, a real estate agent in Waikoloa Village, Hawaii. But the last pocket deal she closed was more of a matter of happenstance: The condo sellers walked into her office, and she happened to have been in contact with a buyer eager to purchase in their complex.

Pocket listings can proliferate in markets and time periods when inventory is particularly scarce, and some agents advertise their access to off-market deals in an effort to win business. In the midst of the pandemic buying frenzy in mid-2021, pocket listings totaled 2.8% of deals, Redfin said. While Clear Cooperation was designed to reduce pocket listings, they're still permitted under some circumstances, including if a property is only marketed within one brokerage.

Unclear impact on prices

There's debate as to whether pocket listings help sellers maximize their payouts. A seller can come out ahead by floating a price above what comparable homes are going for and finding a willing buyer. But without advertising widely, they also risk leaving money on the table. And since pocket listings frequently stay within one brokerage or with one agent who winds up representing both the buyer and seller, buyers and sellers can have limited power to negotiate commissions.

Zillow, which generally benefits from properties being widely marketed, analyzed 2.72 million homes sold in 2023 and 2024 and found that homes sold via pocket listings sold for 1.5% less on average than comparable residences that were listed on the MLS.

The brokerage Compass, which marketed more than half of its new listings in early February with some sort of off-MLS status, says its data shows that homes pre-marketed before hitting the MLS ultimately sold for 2.9% more.

Robert Reffkin, Compass's CEO, said in an earnings call last month that the MLS policy “harms homeowner value by taking away homeowner choice.”

Matt Curtis, a real estate agent in Huntsville, Ala., shares Reffkin's skepticism, even though he thinks most sellers benefit from having their house in front of as many potential buyers as possible.

“At the end of the day, it's the seller's house,” Curtis said. “I think the seller ultimately should be able to decide what they can and can't do.”

Fair housing advocates generally support the policy, saying pocket listings can hurt traditionally underrepresented buyers' ability to compete in today's market.

“It exacerbates potential segregation and discrimination,” said Laurie Brenner, associate vice president of housing and community development for the National Fair Housing Alliance. “When these listings are deemed as being exclusive, that, by definition, means that people are being excluded.”

The nonprofit group Consumer Federation of America believes that pocket listings harm both buyers and sellers, and has advocated that the NAR restrict the use of “office exclusives” as well.

Clear Cooperation has been subject to court battles over the years. Top Agent Network, an off-market listings service, initially sued the NAR over the policy in 2020. After several appeals and dismissals, it dropped its latest case earlier this year. The Justice Department also looked into the rule as part of a broader investigation into NAR policies.

The NAR is expected to rule on the policy in the coming weeks, but the threat of more litigation remains. Michael Ketchmark, the lead plaintiffs' attorney in the lawsuit that upended commissions, has threatened to sue if the policy is upheld.

Costco is reportedly demanding price cuts from its Chinese suppliers as U.S. tariffs continue to take a toll.

With rising import costs due to tariffs, Costco (COST) – along with major U.S. retailers like Walmart – is trying to get suppliers to absorb some of the hit. This has placed additional pressure on Chinese exporters, who are already grappling with years of tariffs and razor-thin margins.

“If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said last week on Fox Business Network (FOXA). Her boss, President Donald Trump, has vowed that violent protestors are “going to go through hell.”

Oops, something went wrong

Donald Trump has taken a shine to the term "liberation day" as a shorthand for his coming reciprocal tariff plans.

"April 2 is liberation day for our country because we're finally going to be taking in money," he said Monday during a stop at the Kennedy Center.

He brought it up again Friday in the Oval Office, saying, "We have been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe."

All told, Trump has used a version of the term at least six times this past week in a reflection of how central tariffs have become to his second-term vision and how, in his mind, this liberation theme encapsulates his plans.

He used "liberation day" language previously in his inaugural address, but then he was looking at Jan. 20, the day he took the oath of office.

The now-in-focus April 2 trade deadline "has become something of a catch-all date for tariff rate hikes from the White House," Henrietta Treyz of Veda Partners said this past week, noting that headline risk for markets and new duties for importers are likely around that day.

Trump's main agenda item on April 2 will be reciprocal duties after a plan was unveiled in February laying out an administration investigation that will end — as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently put it — with a situation where "each country will receive a number that we believe ... represents their tariffs."

The concern is that already battered markets might not realize how high some of those numbers may be, especially on allies such as Europe that Trump has criticized relentlessly without yet slapping with new duties.

A wide array of industries — from autos to shipbuilding to pharmaceuticals to semiconductors to copper to uranium to lumber to dairy — could also be in for new sector-specific duties after a flood of threats from the White House.

The main question for those sector-specific duties is whether Trump actually moves to impose new tariffs on these sectors that day or whether he instead launches new investigations that push those deadlines for another 30 days or longer as new investigations and public comment periods commence.

What Trump promised again and again this past week is that April 2 will be when the country-specific reciprocal tariffs are in place and money flows in.

"It's called April 2, and that's going to be tariffs," Trump said at another point this past week, even refusing to back down when his interviewer, Laura Ingraham of Fox News, responded by bringing up the chances of a recession.

"Everything could happen," Trump said.

He also brought up liberation day when he pressured the Federal Reserve to lower rates on Wednesday.

"He's more willing to soldier through a level of economic pain," Eurasia Group founder and president Ian Bremmer said in a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview.

"I think that some of the purpose of tariffs this time around is more structural," he added. "It's really to change trade flows."

And Trump has given himself an extraordinary amount of leeway to achieve those ends when it comes to what he could impose.

Trump and his aides plan to calculate their so-called effective tariff rate that combines all the factors Trump deems as fodder for retaliation, including things like domestic consumption taxes in Europe that have traditionally not been considered in trade talks.

The view from Trump's orbit, as one of his top aides put it in a recent podcast appearance, is that the recent weeks of market volatility will end once the full scale of the coming tariffs is clear. That point could come soon after April 2 as "some of the tariff stuff comes into clearer focus for the markets to be able to absorb and price in."

The aide, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair, added a promise that Trump wants to provide predictability for businesses as soon as April, suggesting "we will get to a place very soon where [businesses] feel very comfortable with how to plan."

Economic data releases and earnings

Three Wall Street strategy teams have cut their S&P 500 (^GSPC) outlooks amid the recent market drawdown in markets.

The calls all have a similar flavor. Economic growth forecasts have been falling as the uncertainty around President Trump's policy plans wears on. This comes counter to the environment many expected when consensus projected another year of strong economic growth for the US economy. 

At a high level, there's also been a sentiment shift, with strategists now arguing that markets might no longer trade at the extended valuations seen over the past two years, and therefore the benchmark S&P 500 likely won't rise as much. There's also the simple fact that any rally in stocks is coming from a lower starting point and therefore might not see the massive rise required to reach prior targets.

Still, 16 of the 17 strategists we track at Yahoo Finance forecast the benchmark index rallying from here.

What stands out now, as the chart below shows, is that there's not much of a clear consensus besides a general idea that stocks will go up at least somewhat.

With an upside range as low as 6,200 and as high as 7,100, forecasters are calling for the S&P 500 to rally anywhere from about 10% to more than 26%.

Broadly, strategists feel the current hesitancy in the stock market will continue until there's more clarity on President Trump's policies. The extent to which stocks rally from there likely depends on the outlook for the economy and corporate profits.

Deutsche Bank chief strategist Bankim Chadha wrote in a recent research note that if the souring mood about the president's tariff plans prompts a "credible plan to resolve tariff uncertainty, it will allow the business cycle to continue."

If so, Chadha believes the S&P 500 could hit 7,000 this year.

Meanwhile, other strategists are starting to talk more about how the path ahead might not be so linear.

"While we don't believe that a pullback beyond the 10% drawdown that has already been sustained is inevitable, we do believe that the path for stocks between now and December has gotten rockier with stronger headwinds," RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina wrote in a recent note when lowering her year-end S&P 500 target to 6,200 from 6,600.

Last week, Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert told us about a "sentiment shift" among investors over the past few months as more of their clients have been asking about the chances the S&P 500 hits their "bear case" of 5,500. This is a stark change from the past two years when the prevailing question was whether or not strategists had been bullish enough. 

Given the recent drawdown, the question makes sense. Stifel's Barry Bannister is standing by his 5,500 year-end target for the index, the most bearish call on Wall Street entering the year. Bannister believes stocks will stay in the doldrums amid a period of slower economic growth and sticky inflation, which he notes is "historically adverse for the broad equity market."

For what it's worth, that kind of environment could be an interpretation of the Fed's most recent economic forecasts released on Wednesday, which showed the central bank revising inflation projections higher for this year while cutting its economic growth forecast.

RBC's Calvasina often calls her S&P 500 target a "compass, not a GPS," an idea this column has highlighted before. For now, the arrow is clearly pointed in one direction, with the majority of macro strategists arguing stocks will head higher at some point in 2025.

But it's hard not to acknowledge the needle on the compass might be wavering a bit, and the argument for where stocks are headed has become far more nuanced — and with less conviction — than the straight line higher of the S&P 500's past two years.

CINCINNATI — More than a dozen small businesses across Cincinnati are receiving grants to help grow and overcome any obstacles they may face.

Each business will receive $20,000 from the City of Cincinnati's Commercial Tenant Improvement Program (CTIP) through the Department of Community and Economic Development.

“Helping to kind of create a more vibrant community and strengthening our regional economy would be the goal of our Commercial Tenant Improvement Program and relieving the barriers of really high construction and material cost that are being, you know, being realized right now by our small businesses,” said Gerald Fortson, senior community development officer for the city's Department of Community and Economic Development.

The grants are available to businesses that have been in business for at least one year within the city or are looking to relocate to the city.

This is the second round of CTIP grants the city has given out. In 2024, they provided grants to 11 local businesses.

One of the businesses receiving $20,000 is Selfie Cincy, located right downtown.

“We have a lot of different experiences all within this space,” said Amari Samya, CEO and owner of Selfie Cincy.

Selfie Cincy has nine different interactive rooms where customers can take all the photos and videos they want. With the grant money, Samya said they plan on moving to a new space with double the square footage of their current building.

“We'll be expanding to upwards of 15, which is like a big jump, and we'll be able to curate a space that is also meeting the need and demand of event space,” Samya said.

Renika Smiley and her business, Lusheous Collection, also received a $20,000 grant. They will be using the money to turn an old barber shop in College Hill into her dream boutique specializing in women's plus-size clothing.

“With me being a plus-sized woman, and me knowing how hard it is out there for us, I wanted to make sure that we have something of our own,” Smiley said. 

The new Lusheous Collection building will have a boutique in the front, and suites for other beauty-centered small businesses for rent in the back. 

“So we'll have more revenue come in and we'll be able to highlight other business owners and grow within College Hill,” Smiley said.

We asked both Samya and Smiley what it meant as small business owners to have opportunities like this grant to grow their business.

“A blessing, a huge huge blessing,” Smiley said. “It gives you a lot of confidence.”

“The grant opportunities, the city support, the support of the City of Cincinnati is very important to us cause it allows us to keep our footing and grow,” said Samya.

According to Milk Road, a cryptocurrency investor has made a substantial purchase during a market dip, as highlighted in a recent tweet. This move suggests a strategic approach to capitalize on lower prices, potentially indicating an expectation of future market recovery. Such actions are typical in trading strategies that focus on buying low to sell high, reflecting confidence in the market's potential rebound. Traders should monitor these trends for potential signals of market sentiment shifts.

On March 20, investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano stated on Fox News, “There's a global race going on–Russia, Abu Dhabi, El Salvador, Bhutan–all these other countries are trying to buy Bitcoin… the same way that there was a space race there's now a Bitcoin race.” 

The idea of a Bitcoin “race” is now a reality as world leaders actively discuss the urgency of either establishing digital asset reserves or embracing cryptocurrency as legal tender. 

El Salvador, in 2021, became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, purchasing over 2,000 Bitcoin as part of a national reserve to foster financial inclusion and economic growth. The move has been both celebrated and criticized due to Bitcoin's volatility. Similarly, in 2022, the Central African Republic became the second country to adopt Bitcoin, viewing the cryptocurrency as a tool to improve economic development and financial inclusion in one of the world's least developed nations. 

Both countries' actions reflect growing interest in Bitcoin as an alternative financial strategy. It's hard-capped at 21 million, and in 10 years, most of it will be mined.

The theory is that the countries considering Bitcoin a valuable reserve asset will strive to establish as much ownership of the total BTC supply as possible. 

Proponents believe scarcity and growing demand will drive Bitcoin's value, making large BTC holders influential. 

One of the most prominent Bitcoin evangelists, Michael Saylor, said that 78% of the U.S. was bought for $40 million at some point. The former CEO of MicroStrategy referred to various land acquisitions, such as the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 to illustrate why the U.S. government should buy Bitcoin now when it's “cheap.”

In a recent speech, Saylor called the next decade “a digital gold rush” and compared Bitcoin to the Manhattan Project, dubbing it “digital energy.” 

“Today, Bitcoin represents the digital capital network, controlling 99% of power within the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” he said. “The U.S. government recognizes only Bitcoin as legitimate digital capital. To secure the future of cyberspace and maintain global financial dominance, America must adopt Bitcoin strategically. Only Bitcoin—and U.S. Treasuries—have the liquidity and global trust required to serve as reliable reserve assets worldwide.” 

No wonder Saylor has been vocally supportive of government officials pushing to increase the U.S.'s BTC stockpile. 

President Donald Trump, Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, and Bo Hines, the Executive Director of the President's Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, have all expressed a desire to increase the U.S.'s Bitcoin reserve.

Like Saylor, Pompliano (among the most vocal crypto advocates in the U.S.) considers the Trump administration's focus on Bitcoin dominance important.

Speaking about the future price of Bitcoin, Pompliano said during a Fox News appearance that he doesn't know when BTC will hit one million. However, he is seemingly confident that, like gold, its value will increase from where it currently is today. 

At last check, Bitcoin is trading at just above $84,000. 

“I think people are drastically underestimating how maniacal they are going to be about buying Bitcoin,” Pompliano said. “Everyone thinks it's cute that they put 200,000 Bitcoin over here and now we have this reserve — they are going to continue to buy Bitcoin.”

Apart from the U.S., Pompliano named Russia, El Salvador, Bhutan, and the United Arab Emirates. Indeed, all of these countries reportedly have Bitcoin holdings, but not necessarily all of them explicitly expressed their desire to buy more. 

It is not quite clear how much crypto Russia holds. However, it is known that Russia has large-scale mining operations while local companies use crypto for international trade and dodging Western sanctions. 

Pompliano neglected to mention several leading Bitcoin holders, including China, which is the second biggest BTC owner after the U.S. 

The United Kingdom and Ukraine currently follow China, according to BitBo's Bitcoin Treasuries page. 

All these countries have different strategies:

More than that, some corporations, most notably Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and asset manager BlackRock, are among the world's biggest Bitcoin holders, capable of competing with leading nations in terms of Bitcoin dominance. Both firms own or manage around 500,000 Bitcoins (over 2% of the total supply). As of March 2025, no country holds even half that amount. 

European countries have been cautious and innovative in their interactions with blockchain solutions. For instance, Estonia is one of the world's pioneers in adopting blockchain for elections and healthcare data management. However, the EU countries take a conservative stance when it comes to crypto reserves. High volatility and low liquidity are the main reasons for rejecting Bitcoin's reserve establishment. 

Similar reasons are cited by Switzerland, South Korea, Japan, and other countries that seem unbothered by America's passion for winning in the Bitcoin musical chairs game. Germany went so far to sell thousands of Bitcoin.

Crypto.news asked Genius Group, a company using Bitcoin as a corporate reserve, how they time the market. 

“As fundamental believers in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, we don't try to time the market, but rather buy and hold with the intention of never selling,” a spokesperson responded.

Let's assume the so-called Bitcoin race exists, as Pompliano described it. If we compare it to space or the Manhattan Project, we must ask ourselves: Were the countries that didn't have spacecraft or atomic weapons in the 20th century left with nothing?

Mokena Village Hall on Monday, Oct. 8, 2018, in Mokena (Alex Ortiz)

A Mokena resident won back more than $100,000 that was lost in an overseas cryptocurrency scam thanks to a Mokena police detective and Will County prosecutors.

The investigation of the scam began Sept. 11, 2024, when a Mokena resident reported losing more than $150,000 from an online scam involving cryptocurrency, according to a statement from the Mokena Police Department.

“The victim advised that in July of 2024, they responded to an online job ad presented as a commission-based, remote work opportunity aimed at optimizing app developers,” police said.

The victim was directed to set up a cryptocurrency exchange account and transferred funds “across the accounts as directed” by fraudsters for the next few months, police said.

The investigation revealed a “portion of the funds” were held on a cryptocurrency wallet controlled by a person with a Nigerian passport and using an internet protocol address out of Cambodia, police said.

The financial institution hosting the cryptocurrency wallet had more than $101,000, police said.

Police investigators and prosecutors worked to freeze and seize the funds so they could be returned to the victim, police said.

Mokena Police Chief Brian Benton thanked the work of Mokena Police Detective Darin McVicker, who worked “vigorously to locate the lost money and to seek out those responsible for committing this fraud.”

Benton also thanked Assistant State's Attorneys Mike Casson and Dant Faulk for their assistance in the investigation.

“While it is unfortunate that we were unable to arrest those responsible for committing these crimes, we are glad we were able to return a significant amount of the lost money,” Benton said.

Mokena Police Chief Brian Benton, a former police chief in Joliet, issued a statement Friday thanking detectives and prosecutors for recovering a large amount of money stolen from a Mokena resident in a cryptocurrency scam. (Eric Ginnard)

Oops, something went wrong

Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) Reserve and the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The former will hold Bitcoin -- no surprises there. The latter will hold four more of the largest cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA).

The fact that the U.S. is stockpiling crypto is exciting news for crypto investors. But are these good cryptocurrency investments? Let's take a closer look at each one.

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and has also been the most successful. At the time of writing, its market cap is $1.7 trillion, larger than that of every other cryptocurrency combined. Over the last three years (as of March 19), Bitcoin's price has increased by 98%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 27% return.

While Bitcoin was intended as a decentralized digital currency, transactions are too slow and expensive for it to work as a payment method. Processing times generally range from 10 minutes to over an hour, depending on network congestion, and fees are around $1 per transaction.

Despite that, Bitcoin has caught on as a digital store of value, or "digital gold." The supply is capped at 21 million Bitcoin, adding an element of scarcity to it. If you're looking for a way to hedge against inflation or add cryptocurrency to your portfolio, Bitcoin is worth considering.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it became popular through introducing smart contracts. A smart contract is a program built into a cryptocurrency's blockchain network to record transactions.

Developers can use smart contracts to launch decentralized apps (dApps). This gives Ethereum a wide range of uses, including decentralized finance (DeFi) services, such as crypto lending platforms, blockchain gaming, and launching new crypto tokens.

Because Ethereum was the first to offer smart contracts, it has a large lead in terms of market share. According to DefiLlama, Ethereum currently has $46 billion in total value locked into its DeFi applications, the most of any blockchain.

On a negative note, Ethereum's performance lags behind other smart contract blockchains. The average transaction fee is $0.19 as of March 19, compared to $0.00025 for rival Solana. Ethereum has also lost 34% of its value over the last three years. You're better off avoiding Ethereum until it proves that it can reverse this downward trend.

XRP is the native cryptocurrency for Ripple, a blockchain designed as a cross-border payment solution. The current system of choice for international payments, the ​​Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), can take three to five days for international banking transfers. Fees generally cost $15 to $50, depending on the banks involved.

On the Ripple blockchain, transactions process within four to five seconds for a fee of 0.00001 XRP, a fraction of a cent. In addition to being used for its minimal transaction fees, XRP is also a bridge currency used to facilitate international transfers.

With a real-world use case, XRP is one of the stronger crypto investments currently available. Over the last three years, it has topped every other cryptocurrency on this list with its 187% return. Its biggest headwind since 2020 has been a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but on March 19, RippleLabs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had dropped the lawsuit.

Solana is a competitor to Ethereum, as it also provides developers with a platform to launch dApps. The difference is Solana's unique proof-of-history system for validating transactions, which makes it a far more efficient blockchain.

As mentioned above, the average transaction fee on Solana is just $0.00025. It processes over 4,000 transactions per second (tps). In comparison, Ethereum processes about 17 tps, because it hasn't developed a fast method to validate transactions like Solana has.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Solana is a high-risk, volatile investment. But it's up 39% over the last three years, and its speed and low costs should continue attracting developers to the Solana ecosystem.

Cardano is another Ethereum competitor that supports smart contracts and allows for the development of dApps. It helped popularize the proof-of-stake system, where people who own a cryptocurrency can pledge their tokens to be part of the transaction validation process and earn rewards. The proof-of-stake system has minimal energy requirements, and even Ethereum adopted it in 2022.

One of the unique things about Cardano is the developers' dedication to using peer review and evidence-based research. This hasn't always been to its benefit, though. Cardano's development has been notoriously slow. For example, it didn't introduce smart contracts until 2021.

Cardano's price has decreased by 18% in the last three years. As with Ethereum, it's best to see if Cardano can build any forward momentum before committing your money to it.

Just because the U.S. government will be stocking up on these five cryptocurrencies doesn't mean you should invest in all of them. Cryptocurrency is a risky, unproven asset class. Two of the cryptos on this list, Ethereum and Cardano, have lost value over the last three years. Even though the others have done well, they're still highly volatile.

As far as crypto investments go, Bitcoin is the safest option, relatively speaking. It's the most well-known cryptocurrency, and it has been the largest since the very beginning. If you're looking for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, XRP and Solana are two standout projects. With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, you could have a solid crypto portfolio that covers multiple use cases.

No matter which cryptos you choose, be careful about your asset allocation. Because of the risk involved, cryptocurrency shouldn't be more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio. Use the rest to invest in stocks, bonds, and other stable assets.

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $305,226!*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you'd have $41,382!*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you'd have $517,876!*

Right now, we're issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

Bitcoin traders have been sitting on the sidelines in recent weeks as they wait for an update on U.S. president Donald Trump's bitcoin plans (while they scramble to defend against a new, mystery crypto wallet threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has flat-lined through March, stuck at around $85,000 per bitcoin, despite a huge, prescient bitcoin price prediction setting the market alight.

Now, as the Federal Reserve could be gearing up to open the “floodgates,” a senior White House official has revealed the U.S. could use its gold reserves to buy bitcoin.

“If we actually realize the gains on [the U.S. gold holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more bitcoin,” Bo Hines, White House executive director of the president's council of advisers on digital assets, said in an interview with the Crypto in America podcast, adding there's been “countless ideas” and the "best ideas” will be enacted by Trump.

"I'll actually point you to senator [Cynthia] Lummis' Bitcoin Act of 2025, in which she believes that we can identify the real true value of some of these gold certificates,” Hines said.

Lummis reintroduced her Bitcoin Act this year, proposing the U.S. buy 1 million bitcoin, around 5% of the total bitcoin supply, over five years through the sale of Fed gold certificates.

Earlier this week, speaking during a bitcoin and crypto conference, Hines said the U.S. wants "as much [bitcoin] as we can get.”

“It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what president Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines said, referring to Trump's executive order that prevents the sale of bitcoin and crypto that U.S. has seized.

Trump also addressed the conference, promising in a pre-recorded message that he will make the U.S. “the undisputed bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world … Pioneers like you will be able to improve our banking and payment system and promote greater privacy, safety, security and wealth for American consumers and businesses alike," Trump said. "You will unleash an explosion of economic growth."

Trump's comments, piling praise on bitcoin and crypto technology, companies and investors, have reassured the market that he remains committed to crypto.

“Bitcoin is rewriting the rules of wealth creation and economic freedom for all—a truth president Trump recognized at the Digital Assets Summit by vowing to make the U.S. a ‘bitcoin superpower,'” Cory Klippsten, the chief executive of bitcoin-only app Swan Bitcoin, said via email.

“Nation-state adoption is inevitable, but the real revolution lies in empowering individuals to shape a more fair and prosperous future.”

The recent bitcoin price stagnation has been blame on macro economic factors, though many crypto market watchers remain confident the down turn is a temporary correction rather than the beginning of a long-term trend.

“The bitcoin bearish price action is being driven by exogenous factors like trade wars, uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies as well as geopolitics. The world is going through major structural changes, and we believe both bitcoin and gold will outperform other asset classes in the coming months,” Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at Switzerland-based hedge fund Tyr Capital, said in emailed comments.

"Zooming out bitcoin is still performing relatively well and will most probably be well supported around the $75,000 level. We still expect to see new record highs above $125,000 in 2025.

According to Cas Abbé, when considering purchasing cryptocurrencies, traders should focus on projects with robust technology, well-structured tokenomics, and verified founders. Strong technological foundations can facilitate mass adoption, while balanced tokenomics with non-aggressive vesting schedules prevent large token dumps, maintaining price stability. Additionally, projects with doxxed and trustworthy founders increase investor confidence. (Source: Twitter @cas_abbe)

AltcoinGordon emphasizes the importance of evaluating project whitepapers and the development team, as well as monitoring social media platforms for emerging discussions and sentiment changes (source: AltcoinGordon's tweet).

The Securities and Exchange Commission's years-long crusade against the crypto industry appears to be over.

The final chapter closed on Wednesday, when Ripple announced that the SEC had officially dropped its four-year-old lawsuit against the company. The suit, filed on Jay Clayton's last day as SEC chair, accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through the sale of its XRP token without registering it as a security. 

Crypto companies and exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, Binance, and OpenSea all previously saw lawsuits or investigations dropped, resolved or put on hold. Ripple is now taking a victory lap. 

"Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back — and won on essential legal questions — throwing a major wrench into the SEC's plans to destroy crypto in the U.S. through enforcement," Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told CNBC in an emailed statement. "The SEC has now abandoned its appeal in our case. In a fitting irony, Ripple was the first major case they brought and will now be the last one they walk away from."

XRP was created in 2012 as one of the first non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies. It was started by the founders of the company Ripple, and became the platform's native currency. Like bitcoin, XRP can be bought and sold by retail investors. XRP jumped about 11% after Wednesday's announcement. 

Ripple spent $150 million battling the government in a bruising legal standoff with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose approach to crypto was widely viewed as hostile. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is "not necessarily a security on its face," undercutting the foundation of the SEC's case.

The win wasn't just a turning point for Ripple. It signaled to the crypto industry that the tide was turning, and built momentum for a movement that helped return President Donald Trump, a former crypto critic, to the White House. A year after the judge's ruling, Trump, as Republican nominee, delivered a keynote at the annual Bitcoin Conference, and announced that he was "laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world." 

Ripple and its crypto peers were major contributors to Trump's campaign. The president has spent his first two months in office paying them back. 

On Friday, the SEC hosted its first major crypto roundtable, signaling a new approach of regulation through engagement, rather than enforcement. Leading the effort is Hester Peirce, who is helming the regulator's newly established Crypto Task Force. 

Peirce's message to the industry is that the SEC is no longer an adversary, but is instead trying to give crypto a clear, lawful framework.

In a major policy reversal, the SEC rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 — a controversial rule that required banks to treat crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. Introduced in 2022 and championed by Gensler, the rule was widely viewed as a major barrier to institutional adoption of bitcoin and other digital assets. 

"Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun," Peirce wrote on in a post on X after the change was announced in January.  

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that month, CEOs from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America signaled that the thaw in Washington could lead to renewed crypto engagement. 

And at the White House, David Sacks, Trump's AI and crypto czar, stood beside the president as he signed an executive order on digital assets. Sacks had recently attended the Crypto Ball as part of the inauguration, where he declared, "The war on crypto is over."

Coinbase's lawsuit was dismissed in February. Then came Kraken. The SEC pulled back from its Wells Notice against Robinhood's crypto division. The investigation into Binance is on hold.

Ripple's legal team long argued that the SEC's strategy wasn't about upholding the law, but about using it as a blunt instrument. The regulator sent subpoenas to foreign regulators that worked with Ripple, demanded troves of documents from business partners and even sued CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen personally. Those charges have also been dropped.

"While this chapter is closed, the fight for clear, fair, and transparent crypto regulation continues," Alderoty told CNBC. "Ripple will continue to lead that fight."

Cryptocurrency and blockchain continue to captivate with promises to revolutionize finance, culture, and now philanthropy. In 2024, digital currency donations surpassed $1 billion, as reported by The Giving Block, fueled by a booming crypto market and clearer regulations. However, the true significance lies not just in the figure but in what this phenomenon reveals about our societal values. 

Crypto philanthropy reflects our trust in technology, our skepticism towards traditional institutions, and our evolving understanding of generosity. Does this trend herald progress or illuminate deeper societal currents?

Blockchain's allure in charitable giving lies in its transparency. Traditional philanthropy often leaves donors uncertain about the fate of their contributions, undermined by opaque processes. A public, immutable ledger, exemplified by initiatives like GiveTrack, offers reassurance. In 2024, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) collectively accounted for 90% of crypto donations, allowing donors to trace every transaction, as reported by The Giving Block. This is less about cost-effectiveness than about certainty—a means to restore confidence in an era wary of intermediaries.

The wealth generated by cryptocurrency further enhances its appeal. Market volatility has attracted benefactors eager to share their gains. Vitalik Buterin's $1 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) donation to India's COVID-19 relief effort in 2021 and the Pineapple Fund's distribution of 5,057 BTC, valued at $86 million in 2017, to various causes exemplify this trend. The $1 billion milestone in 2024 underscores this momentum. Such acts resonate not only as acts of generosity but also as demonstrations of technology's potential to convert digital success into tangible good, a narrative that captivates our imagination.

While crypto philanthropy offers a promising vision, it faces the challenge of delivering tangible results. The $1 billion milestone in 2024 serves as a reminder that promises alone are not enough. It is crucial to ensure that these donations are effectively utilized and have a meaningful impact on society. This challenge requires collaboration between donors, charities, and technology experts to create a sustainable and effective philanthropic ecosystem. 

Yet, this enthusiasm encounters limitations. For instance, the SHIB donation caused a price drop, reducing the aid provided despite its bold announcement. The Pineapple Fund's contributions, while substantial, were dependent on Bitcoin's fluctuations—some recipients benefited significantly, while others received less. Even with the total donations reaching a billion dollars in 2024, the practical impact remains inconsistent. The spectacle of cryptocurrency giving inspires, but its outcomes often depend on unpredictable markets, raising questions about its reliability.

Furthermore, the culture of cryptocurrency—dynamic and risk-oriented—diverges from philanthropy's traditional demands. Established figures like Warren Buffett, committed to decades of giving through the Giving Pledge, embody endurance. In contrast, cryptocurrency donations often align with tax advantages or public recognition rather than sustained support. The environmental impact of Bitcoin's energy consumption further complicates the matter—can philanthropy derived from such a source be considered unequivocally virtuous? Our fascination with the novel may overshadow enduring priorities.

What, then, drives our fixation? Crypto philanthropy reveals a profound reliance on technology as a solution. Disillusioned with the pace of conventional systems—whether governmental or charitable—we turn to blockchain for immediacy and transparency. The Giving Block notes that regulatory clarity in 2024 attracted more participants, leading to an increase in donations. This reflects a desire for control—a system we can oversee rather than entrust to others.

This trend also reveals a broader mistrust. Our insistence on transparency stems from disillusionment with established frameworks. While crypto giving doesn't yet surpass traditional philanthropy in scope, it compensates for perceived shortcomings. Initiatives like Gitcoin, which experiment with methods to fund grassroots projects, suggest a potential redefinition of impact—yet their reach remains limited. The $1 billion in donations in 2024 don't signify triumph but rather an aspiration: to create a form of generosity that aligns with our digital age. We're enamored with innovation, sometimes at the expense of proven consistency.

What does this signify? Crypto philanthropy occupies an ambiguous space—neither a definitive failure nor a complete success, but rather a lens on our priorities. It raises questions: Can generosity match the speed of technology? Must it bear a digital imprint to hold value? Those advancing this cause should temper their boldness with pragmatism. True impact doesn't lie in the tools employed but in the lives improved. Traditional philanthropy offers lessons in persistence; crypto provides audacity. A synthesis might yet emerge, but for now, our enthusiasm exceeds our evidence. The paradox lies here: in amassing over $1 billion, we reveal a society eager to redefine good yet still grappling with what that entails.

 According to Bo Hines, a senior White House advisor on crypto who spoke on the Crypto in America Podcast, the US could leverage its gold holdings to fund its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). 

Hines suggested that the Trump administration would explore creative ways of funding the SBR without further burdening the American taxpayer, News.Az reports citing foreign media.

His sentiments seem to be an attempt to pacify Americans, many of whom, according to a recent survey, oppose the SBR. The Data for Progress advocacy group poll showed 51% of American voters disapprove of the idea, placing it last on the list of priority areas for federal funding. 

America's budget-neutral means of financing its SBR

Hines explained that his think tank had received countless ideas on how to fund the SBR. He, however, hinted that the one(s) it would settle on would have to be budget-neutral. On that account, the US could use the gains from its gold certificates to acquire more Bitcoin. 

The crypto council head honcho also held that the certificates were massively undervalued compared to actual gold values. Therefore, getting their correct valuation, as Senator Cynthia Lummins' Bitcoin Act 2025 proposes, would give America the finances it needs to build its BTC stash. 

He said, “If we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.”

How does revaluing the gold certificates work? 

Lummins' push and, therefore, Hines' stance have merit, too. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, the Fed banks holding gold certificates value them at $42.22 per troy ounce. That figure pales in comparison to the $3,037, which is a similar unit of the precious metal fetches in the market. 

America owns about 8,133 metric tons of gold, which comes to 260.8 million troy ounces (using the formula, 1 metric ton = 32,150.7 troy ounces). Gold's current price gives you a market value of roughly $792 billion ($3,037*260.8M). Meanwhile, the book value is slightly over  $11 billion ($42.22*260.8M), bringing potential gains to over $780 billion ($792B – $11B). 

As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold's prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Such a windfall would provide the US with enough liquidity to set up the SBR without tapping into taxpayers' funds. 

Overcoming challenges and exploring alternatives to revaluing gold certificates

While the financial advantages are clear, questions remain about revalued gold certificates' scalability. Such a shift could induce pushback from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department itself, since it would risk impacting monetary policy and inflation expectations.

Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue.

Revaluing gold certificates is a strong possibility, but other budget-neutral approaches are worth contemplating. The U.S. could, for instance, consider issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds, as El Salvador has, or allocate some of the confiscated assets from criminal crypto activities toward funding the reserve.

Other experts have proposed tokenizing segments of federal assets and allowing private investors to contribute to the SBR via decentralized finance (DeFi) methods.

Excitement has swelled in the crypto community following Bitcoin‘s recent upward move to key resistance levels. While the move may have sparked optimism, many investors' reactions toward BTC were negative as they continued to bet on a sustained decline, creating a bearish outlook for the asset.

As Bitcoin's price struggles to break through key resistance levels, a worrying shift has been cited among big investors or whales. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data platform reveals rising pessimism among these investors as they bet on an extension of the ongoing correction.

BTC recently saw a brief surge to the $87,000 level even as volatility grows in the broader crypto market. However, the upward move was met with strong resistance as whale holders massively opened short positions after the upswing. “Whales Enter Short Positions on Bitcoin as Leverage Increases,” the platform stated.

Despite the brief move to the $87,000 mark, these big investors have chosen to close their long positions and open more shorts. Given the ongoing volatility of the market, this shift has raised questions about BTC's prospects in the short term.

Whale participation often influences price trajectory, which could cause Bitcoin to continue dropping in the upcoming weeks. However, if buying pressure intensifies at critical support zones and creates a strong defense, BTC may move in an upward direction.

Furthermore, Alphractal points to a rise in market leverage. After examining the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest/Market Cap Ratio, the platform noted that the metric is rising again, reflecting growing leverage. According to the platform, this increase in market leverage might set off a fresh round of volatility, resulting in further mass liquidations.

On-chain data have also revealed substantial sell pressure among Bitcoin large investors, triggering concerns about potential downside risks. Leading market intelligence and data analytics platform IntoTheBlock, outlined a decrease in whale balances as the market fluctuates.

Looking at the chart, BTC whales seem to have been trending downward for almost a year. However, data from March suggests a potential reversal as whales now hold about 62,000 more BTC than they did at the beginning of the month, signaling renewed accumulation.

The renewed accumulation by BTC whales raises the likelihood of a price reversal from the ongoing downtrend. This price reversal could be part of a larger trend as Captain Faibik, a crypto analyst and investor predicts an impending surge to its current all-time high. His prediction is supported by a key chart pattern, particularly the Falling Wedge formation. 

Captain Faibik believes that BTC could consolidate within the key pattern for the next 10 to 15 days before undergoing a huge bullish breakout. When this breakout happens, Bitcoin's price will rally significantly to the $109,000 mark, reigniting the bull market.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has charted a diametrically opposite trajectory when compared to its older sibling, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), over the past year.

Consider this. Bitcoin has jumped 32% in a year, reaching an all-time high of $109,000. Its share in the overall cryptocurrency market has expanded from 52% to 60%.

Ethereum, on the other hand, contracted 39% during the same time, reducing its market share from 16% to 8%.

The widening gap has sparked discussions about Ethereum's role in the cryptocurrency hierarchy and its future course Benzinga spoke to a few analysts to understand the factors contributing to the ecosystem's ongoing downturn.

Jeffrey Hu, Head of Investment Research at digital asset manager HashKey Capital, believed the fault lies in Ethereum's economic model.

"The activation of EIP-1559 allows more Ether to be burned for deflation when Ether activity is high on Ethereum; however, in order to further support on-chain applications, Ethereum must scale," Hu stated.

The Ethereum London Hard fork, dubbed EIP-1559, introduced a token burn mechanism for the network. Under this mechanism, the base fee, i.e., the minimum fee per transaction, is removed to add deflationary pressure to ETH and boost its value.

So, what exactly is the problem?

Hu asserted that the rise of  Layer-2 blockchains and the Dencun Upgrade, which slashed fees on L2s by orders of magnitude, diverted on-chain activity away from the base Ethereum chain, resulting in inflation.

According to Ultrasound Money, ETH's deflation rate started slowing down in May 2024, and since early February, the coin's supply has been net increasing.

Trever Koverko, Web3 investor and co-founder of Sapien, echoed these observations.

"Ethereum is struggling to establish a narrative around how L2's are accretive and not extractive to the main chain," he added.

However, L2s were not the only competition that Ethereum encountered.

"Ethereum is also not doing well in terms of community culture. In contrast, Solana clearly places more emphasis on meme coin community culture, which has attracted more application development and on-chain transactions," Hu said.

Over the past year, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) has indeed become a meme coin hotspot, helped by its user-friendly meme coin generator Pump.fun. In fact,  President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump also chose Solana to launch their Official Trump (CRYPTO: TRUMP) and Official Melania (CRYPTO: MELANIA) coins, respectively.

It's worth remembering that Ethereum remains the only cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin to have its spot exchange-traded fund on Wall Street, however, inflows have been relatively subdued.

Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ Global, stated this is due to a lack of a clear consensus on Ethereum's narrative.

“Lacking a pure store-of-value proposition and often perceived as the "middle child" of the crypto ecosystem, Ethereum struggles to capture the same institutional confidence,” Maradiya argued.

He also noted that the absence of staking rewards has made Ethereum ETFs less appealing, which may be remedied given that fresh applications have been filed to allow them.

A spokesperson for the Ethereum Foundation—a non-profit dedicated to promoting and developing Ethereum-related technologies—declined to comment on ETH's shrinking market share but said that their focus remained on ecosystem development and research.

While sifting out signatures of supernova remnants, a high-schooler stumbled upon the afterglow of a dormant black hole. It may be one of the largest ever seen.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Long after the black hole in the center of a galaxy sputters out, you can still see its ghost lingering in surrounding gas clouds aglow with leftover radiation, like wisps of smoke emanating from an already extinguished flame. Astronomers call these cosmic ghosts "light echoes" — and that's what high-school junior Julian Shapiro found while scanning the cosmos for supernova remnants.

"There are these outer regions of gas being ionized by a supermassive black hole, which results in this echo," Shapiro said at a March 20 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society (APS) Global Physics Summit.

Shapiro, 17, is a student at The Dalton School in New York City. But in between classes and scoping out potential colleges, he's also an independent astronomer who presents at global conferences like this week's APS meeting.

Originally, Shapiro began sifting through the DECaPS2 survey — an inventory of the southern galactic plane from the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile — to find the debris of exploding stars in supernova remnants and planetary nebulas.

But after zeroing in on one such object, he found its structure didn't match the wispy filaments characteristic of a supernova remnant, nor did it show evidence of a supernova at its center. "It was a real surprise to stumble upon this," Shapiro told Live Science.

The object, which he believes to be a light echo, stands in a field of potential supermassive black holes. Using measurements from the Southern African Large Telescope, he found high contents of oxygen and ionized sulfur sprinkled into the region — both indicators of shocked material. All of these signs suggest that the object is the afterglow of a now-dormant black hole, which once spewed radiation that ionized the surrounding gas, causing it to emit light even after the black hole quieted down.

Shapiro currently pegs the light echo at about 150,000 to 250,000 light-years in diameter — about 1.5 to two times the width of the entire Milky Way galaxy. And if his estimates hold up, he thinks it could be a viable candidate for the largest light echo ever discovered.

"This object covers a large area in the sky, which makes it a bit easier to get in-depth images of," Shapiro said.

According to Sasha Plavin, a black hole researcher at Harvard University who was not involved in the research, echoes like the one Shapiro discovered can help us learn more about how black holes behave in the hearts of galaxies.

"I really like how carefully [Shapiro] looked into these images," Plavin told Live Science. "These galactic events are always of interest, and I think these echoes are a great way of studying them."

Plavin is also interested in seeing how this new light echo measures up to others — whether it occurred faster or slower than existing examples. "Putting this discovery in a wider context could be useful in the future," he said.

—Evidence for Stephen Hawking's unproven black hole theory may have just been found — at the bottom of the sea

As Shapiro continues studying the light echo, he hopes to learn more about its composition with measurements of its different regions. But in the meantime, he's excited to continue contributing to black hole science — even if he came across it by accident.

"My involvement in this area of research came as a bit of a surprise to me," he said. "But I hope this object, in particular, helps expand the knowledge of galaxy activities that we don't have too great of an understanding of."

Yum! Brands, the global powerhouse behind Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC, and Habit Burger Grill, is taking a major leap into the future of restaurant operations through a new, high-profile partnership with NVIDIA. The alliance, announced during NVIDIA's recent GTC developer conference in San Jose, is designed to accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence across Yum!'s global footprint—impacting everything from drive-thru ordering to back-of-house operations and labor management.

This collaboration comes at a pivotal time for the quick-service restaurant sector, where digital transformation is no longer optional but essential. Faced with rising labor costs, changing consumer expectations, and increasing demand for speed, convenience, and personalization, operators are turning to technology not just to streamline workflows, but to reshape the customer experience from the ground up.

Yum! Brands' Chief Digital and Technology Officer Joe Park told attendees at GTC that digital sales now account for more than 50% of the company's total revenue, up from 19% in 2019. The sharp rise is driven by a strategic focus on integrating digital tools—including AI-powered solutions—across Yum!'s vast portfolio of more than 61,000 restaurants worldwide.

A primary focus of this initiative is the deployment of voice AI agents at drive-thrus and call centers. Developed in partnership with NVIDIA, these systems leverage advanced natural language processing and conversational AI models to understand, respond to, and even upsell to customers—all in real-time. These voice agents don't just replace human labor; they're designed to enhance the ordering experience by being consistent, friendly, and efficient—particularly during high-volume periods like lunch rushes or major sporting events.

According to a 2024 drive-thru study by Intouch Insight, the average customer spends about 5 minutes and 29 seconds in a fast food drive-thru. Early data shows that AI-powered drive-thrus can reduce that time by up to 29 seconds—a potential game-changer for both customer satisfaction and throughput efficiency. With higher accuracy and the ability to upsell at scale, voice AI can also boost check averages while reducing strain on front-line employees.

Park emphasized that the use of AI is not intended to replace team members, but to support them. AI can take care of repetitive and transactional tasks, he noted, so that team members can focus on delivering great hospitality and managing operations.

Yum! Brands is not simply layering AI onto existing systems. The company is building on its proprietary platform, Byte by Yum!, which integrates POS, inventory management, labor scheduling, delivery logistics, and customer data into a single technology ecosystem. By integrating NVIDIA's AI and edge computing technologies, Yum! can now scale these capabilities across multiple brands and markets with improved efficiency and lower cost of deployment.

NVIDIA's contribution includes the use of its NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform and NIM microservices—pre-trained AI models that can be easily customized and deployed on edge devices within restaurant environments. This technology allows for real-time, on-site processing of AI tasks, reducing latency and dependency on cloud infrastructure.

Additionally, NVIDIA's computer vision solutions are being used to analyze restaurant camera feeds. For example, AI can assess whether the food being handed out at the window matches the customer's order, helping to improve order accuracy and reduce waste. Vision-based AI is also being trained to identify bottlenecks in kitchen or drive-thru operations and recommend adjustments in real time.

Yum! has begun piloting these AI tools in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations across the U.S., with plans to expand to 500 locations—including KFC and Habit Burger Grill—by the end of Q2 2025. While the company hasn't disclosed the specific locations of these pilots or financial terms of the partnership, the scale and scope of the project indicate a significant investment in long-term AI infrastructure.

Yum! is also exploring the use of AI-generated action plans for restaurant managers. These tools leverage historical performance data and current conditions to offer prescriptive guidance—essentially telling managers not just what is happening in their stores, but what they should do about it.

Yum!'s move is part of a broader industry shift. The QSR industry has become a proving ground for AI deployment, with competitors like McDonald's, Wendy's, White Castle, and Panda Express all testing voice AI and automation in various forms. However, the path hasn't been smooth for everyone. McDonald's, for example, ended a voice AI pilot with IBM in 2023 after customer complaints and technical difficulties, signaling that successful implementation requires not just innovation, but rigorous testing and human oversight.

This is where Yum! appears to be differentiating itself—by focusing on strategic integration, transparency, and iterative development. The company has made it clear that AI will not be a “set it and forget it” solution, but a tool that evolves through continuous learning and refinement.

For restaurant executives, franchise operators, and technology leaders evaluating AI initiatives, the Yum!-NVIDIA partnership offers a compelling blueprint for success. AI is no longer a futuristic buzzword—it's a practical tool for improving operational performance, guest experience, and financial outcomes. When integrated thoughtfully, AI can act as a force multiplier across an organization, empowering staff and enhancing every aspect of the customer journey.

Yum! Brands has the scale, infrastructure, and leadership commitment to drive meaningful results with AI. And with more than 61,000 locations worldwide, what happens at Yum! often sets the tone for the broader industry. The company's partnership with NVIDIA is not just about faster drive-thrus—it's about creating the intelligent, responsive, and scalable restaurant model of the future.

As AI matures, it will be the operators who embrace strategic innovation—backed by data and tested through real-world use—who gain the clearest competitive advantage.

A cascade of actions from the Trump administration represents a “grave threat” to health care, social, educational and other critical services in Indian Country, including for Native American communities in the Northwest, tribal leaders say.

In the past two weeks, the Trump administration has announced the cancellation of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities and 25 Bureau of Indian Affairs offices, representing nearly 30% of all agency locations, including one each in Toppenish, Washington, and Lapwai, Idaho, as part of an effort to decrease federal office space.

Additionally, IHS employees were included in the latest buyout offer from the Trump administration, alarming tribal officials and Indigenous community leaders who fear that any employees leaving the understaffed, underfunded agency will force the shutdown of critical health services.

A steady stream of executive orders from the president and cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency — combined with frequent changes of course — have had a destabilizing effect on agencies that serve tribes, including those in the Northwest. Hundreds of employees at the Bureau of Indian Affairs have been fired. Access to important payment systems has been blocked. Congressionally approved grants have been unilaterally terminated.

The chaos intensifies concerns about whether critical health care services for roughly 3 million Native American and Alaska Native tribal citizens can be preserved.


“Significant underfunding cannot be categorized as wasteful,” said Greg Abrahamson, vice-chair of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the chairman of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, who, along with other Northwest tribal leaders, testified before the U.S. House Interior Appropriations Committee on Feb. 27.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

In the past two weeks, the Trump administration has announced the cancellation of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities and 25 Bureau of Indian Affairs offices, representing nearly 30% of all agency locations, including one each in Toppenish, Washington, and Lapwai, Idaho, as part of an effort to decrease federal office space.

Additionally, IHS employees were included in the latest buyout offer from the Trump administration, alarming tribal officials and Indigenous community leaders who fear that any employees leaving the understaffed, underfunded agency will force the shutdown of critical health services.

A steady stream of executive orders from the president and cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency — combined with frequent changes of course — have had a destabilizing effect on agencies that serve tribes, including those in the Northwest. Hundreds of employees at the Bureau of Indian Affairs have been fired. Access to important payment systems has been blocked. Congressionally approved grants have been unilaterally terminated.

The chaos intensifies concerns about whether critical health care services for roughly 3 million Native American and Alaska Native tribal citizens can be preserved.


“Significant underfunding cannot be categorized as wasteful,” said Greg Abrahamson, vice-chair of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the chairman of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, who, along with other Northwest tribal leaders, testified before the U.S. House Interior Appropriations Committee on Feb. 27.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

A steady stream of executive orders from the president and cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency — combined with frequent changes of course — have had a destabilizing effect on agencies that serve tribes, including those in the Northwest. Hundreds of employees at the Bureau of Indian Affairs have been fired. Access to important payment systems has been blocked. Congressionally approved grants have been unilaterally terminated.

The chaos intensifies concerns about whether critical health care services for roughly 3 million Native American and Alaska Native tribal citizens can be preserved.


“Significant underfunding cannot be categorized as wasteful,” said Greg Abrahamson, vice-chair of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the chairman of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, who, along with other Northwest tribal leaders, testified before the U.S. House Interior Appropriations Committee on Feb. 27.

“IHS federally operated facilities and tribal clinics are already stretching their dollars to provide health care services to members, with most clinics already struggling to meet rising needs, especially around the mental health and opioid crisis,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, told InvestigateWest she's already heard from tribes in Washington who are seeing consequences from Trump's “careless” firings and funding freezes.

“​​Trump and Elon Musk are taking a wrecking ball to government with zero idea of what they are doing and zero concern for who gets hurt — and their reckless and illegal moves are already harming Tribes in Washington state and throughout the Pacific Northwest,” she said in a written statement.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said it's imperative that funds Congress approves are spent.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“We have to do everything we can to boost the strength of the health care core team at Indian Health Service, not do anything that would diminish it,” Merkley said in an interview with InvestigateWest. “When I heard the administration talking about significant firings at Indian Health Service, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, no, absolutely not. That would be horrific.'”

Tribal officials express concern that policy decisions affecting their communities — like unilateral lease terminations, blocked funds used for fighting wildfires, and disabled payment systems for Native American health organizations — are being made without legally mandated, official government-to-government consultation between the U.S. and tribes.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion.

“Ignoring this duty isn't just disrespectful, it's a violation of federal law,” testified Quintin Swanson, chairman of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe.

Tribal leaders testify against cutsConcerns about services being swept up in anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level drove 120 tribal leaders to testify on Capitol Hill in February, advocating for funding and stability for the programs and agencies that fill the U.S. government's trust and treaty obligations.

Although many tribes control the administration of federal dollars earmarked for IHS, five tribes in the Northwest's Portland Service Area, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, receive health care directly through the IHS, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts or closures.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“Spokane Service Unit providers have already been destabilized by these directives even when they get rescinded because of chronic provider shortages at our service unit. At a minimum, we request tribal consultation for any decisions that would affect funding, staffing, and services for the Indian Health Service, tribes, or tribal organizations,” Abrahamson told the Interior Appropriations Committee.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education and Indian Health Service make up less than 0.25% of the federal budget and the funds are already appropriated by Congress. Tribal leaders told Congress that because these agencies need more funding, not less. Billions in other funding sources that tribes rely on, like federal grants from the EPA, are frozen.

For fiscal 2024, the Indian Health Service received $8.2 billion in funding despite asking for nearly $60 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which provides funding for law enforcement services to hundreds of tribes, meets just 12% of law enforcement funding needs in Indian Country, according to Mark Macarro, chair of both the National Congress of American Indians and the Pechanga Band of Indians.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation in rural north-central Washington also receive health care directly through the IHS. The lone clinic on its 1.4 million acre reservation, the largest in the Northwest, has long faced serious understaffing.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the tribe, told the committee that he's concerned about the Trump administration's recent actions.

“With more than 200 deferred resignations at BIA and more than 400 on the IHS side, now is the worst possible time to be a direct service tribe,” Erickson said.

The tribe is slated to open a second health clinic in Omak, Wash., this November.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

“Health provider positions were already notoriously difficult to fill in rural areas,” he said. “The recent administration's actions will make filling these new positions much more difficult if not impossible because of the perceived instability of federal employment.”

The tribe is rushing to take over the administration of its health care system from the IHS so the tribe can advertise the Omak jobs as tribal, not federal, in the hopes it will incentivize candidates.

Funding freezes have had “significant detrimental effects” on the Snoqualmie Tribe, according to the tribe's vice chair, Steve de los Angeles, who said the tribe cannot access millions in allocated funds it needs for managing its forestland to prevent wildfires and sell forest products.

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation received notice via email that the U.S. General Services Administration would be terminating its lease on the Yakama Nation Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Toppenish later this year on Sept. 25, more than two years before its original end date of Oct. 31, 2027. The office provides “essential services and functions” in various federal and tribal offices, including natural resources and human services, according to a March 6 press release from the tribe.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The office supports 85 federal jobs at the building located on Yakama tribal land, and the annual lease costs $533,985 for 17,107 square feet of office space. Even before the possible closure, Stephen Selam, executive secretary of the tribe, said the BIA was failing to meet the tribe's needs, particularly in its forestry department, with key positions vacant.

Washington's Sen. Murray said she's “demanding answers” about the planned closure of the BIA office in Toppenish.

Broadly, the U.S. government and agencies responsible for dealing with sovereign tribal governments must engage in official government-to-government consultation with tribal officials for decisions that would affect their communities. The Yakama tribe says it has received no official communication around the reasoning or intent behind the cancellation of the lease.

“The federal government has a trust and fiduciary obligation to the Yakama Nation, one that must not be eroded by budget cuts and freezes,” Selam said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The lease cancellations don't guarantee a closure, as some agencies may renegotiate the lease or downsize, but the lack of communication alarms tribal officials.

Some federally funded Indian health organizations have also had their funding frozen.

The Seattle Indian Health Board is an Urban Indian health organization that operates three facilities in Seattle providing medical, dental, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and traditional medicine practices.

On Jan. 28, the board was locked out of its payment management systems, according to Esther Lucero, the organization's president and CEO, who is Navajo. The board, which receives 54.8% of its funding from the federal government, works on a reimbursement structure.

“So if you can imagine 54.8% of your paycheck going away because you've already put out the money to provide those services and you work on a reimbursement basis — that's what we're working with,” Lucero said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Lucero said she is concerned that $5 million in congressionally approved funding to open the Thunderbird Treatment Center, a state-of-the-art residential treatment facility for opioid users, won't carry forward until they receive a permit.

The center, a $35 million project, would hold 92 beds and increase the total treatment bed capacity in King County by 67%.

“I'm sitting here worried that we may not be able to open those doors,” Lucero said.

Citing a 2021 CDC report showing the opioid crisis in the U.S. cost more than $1.2 trillion, Lucero said cutting funding to treatment programs is poor financial management.

“Here we are in King County trying to provide a service that will help overcome that opioid crisis, right?” Lucero said. “A smart business person looks at cost-benefit and takes calculated risks. So why in the world would you cut the services that are going to reduce that cost for you in the long run? I don't understand that.”

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, says Trump's efforts to take control of congressionally approved funds goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

“What Trump is doing by saying ‘I'm cutting out funding to this and that' is patently not just illegal, but unconstitutional,” Merkley told InvestigateWest.

“The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress — to Congress, not to the president — but now we have an ‘authoritarian-ly' inclined president who doesn't like the idea that Congress makes the policy and decides what programs get which,” Merkley said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chair of the House Interior Appropriations Committee, listened to nearly 12 hours of testimony from tribal leaders. The lease for the BIA office in Lapwai, Idaho, is slated to be closed. Simpson did not respond to a request for comment.

Confusion reignsFor tribal leaders, it has been difficult to keep up with the inconsistent directives and actions.

A Feb. 6 memo from the Department of Health and Human Services supposedly exempted programs serving Indian Country from federal anti-DEI efforts and funding freezes, but a Feb. 14 memo in the Education Department that said “discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible” caused more confusion.

Tribal leaders say there were still interruptions to services, even after assurances were made that the programs would be exempted from freezes.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Cuts strain critical care accessThe closure of area IHS clinics also places increased pressure on the agency's beleaguered Purchase and Referred Care Program.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

Most IHS clinics are unable to provide comprehensive health care services. Many tribes have small clinics that lack sufficient doctors and nurses, and the IHS has a 30% staffing vacancy rate.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area. Since both lack any IHS-operated hospitals, all emergency and hospital-level care must be administered through the referred care program. Any closure of any area IHS clinic means patients may need to travel long distances or go through the referred care program for basic medical treatment.

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

On March 9, all employees under the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Indian Health Service, were offered buyouts of as much as $25,000. The Trump administration and the president's Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have made clear their intention to slash federal programs and fire federal employees as part of an effort to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse.”

It was not the first time the Indian Health Service has been affected by Musk's “chainsaw” approach.

On Feb. 12, the Office of Personnel Management first announced plans to fire 2,200 of roughly 15,000 total IHS employees, including frontline workers like doctors and nurses, only to reverse the majority of those days later after backlash from tribal leaders and Democrats.

Now, DOGE has announced the termination of leases for at least 12 Indian Health Service facilities across the country. Tribal officials say closures could worsen health disparities for Native Americans and lead to the loss of critical services.

Twenty-five Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are also slated for closure, which tribal leaders say will leave tribal citizens and some rural communities without access to social services and land management, while weakening law enforcement.

So far, thousands of employees at the Indian Health Service have been fired only to be given a reprieve, though hundreds remain listed as deferred resignations. Congressional representatives on both sides of the aisle have petitioned Musk and the Trump administration for reversals of lease terminations and cuts in their respective districts — though Republicans appear to be having more success than Democrats. House Appropriations Chair and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole secured reversals of lease terminations in Oklahoma, including the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City, calling it “common sense.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said in a written statement Feb. 28 regarding a spate of planned lease cancellations that the Trump administration was “devastating local economies and abandoning tribes.”

The lease cancellations include two IHS-funded facilities in Huffman's district.

“The federal government exists to serve the people — not abandon them,” Huffman said. “But Trump and Musk are taking a wrecking ball to our country. … Shuttering these physical locations goes hand in glove with DOGE's ‘destroy the government' approach, and it will make their illegal cuts even more challenging to reverse.”

Even without additional pressure from potential cuts, the referred care program isn't operating sustainably in the Northwest due to rising costs and inflation, according to Abrahamson with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board.

“Many of our people are already on waitlists,” Abrahamson said.

The Purchased and Referred Care Program allows IHS patients to receive care from non-IHS providers when the agency cannot provide the service itself — but the program is plagued with problems. It is a small portion of the agency's budget that is guaranteed to run out each year, forcing the agency to at times ration the procedures it approves funding for.

As InvestigateWest has reported, the referred care program has persistent issues with the payment process — the agency often fails to reimburse external providers for the care it provides, leaving patients to be held liable for the unpaid bills and often sent to collections, resulting in disproportionate medical debt for Native Americans.

Pressure on the program is especially strong in the Northwest Portland service area, which serves the 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, and in the California service area.

Corvallis-based Samaritan Health Services has formally notified its bank that it likely violated its bond terms last year due to losses. While CEO Doug Boysen downplayed the notice, he said the finances in Oregon health care appear untenable statewide and it's the system's “duty” to seek growth while contemplating possibilities such as a merger or one or more outside partners.

“All options are on the table,” he told The Lund Report, adding that the system's overriding goal is to make sure residents in the region continue to have access to care.

“It's a really uncertain environment right now and we are looking at all different potential options to make sure that Samaritan is sustainable into the future,” he said. He stressed that no specific plan has been adopted, and no specific conversations with other health systems or companies have taken place.

In a Feb. 25 letter to U.S. Bank, Daniel B. Smith, Samaritan's chief financial officer, wrote that Samaritan's final 2024 income likely won't meet its debt-service terms with the bank, and that would constitute “a nonpayment related default.”

Boysen said the violation would be a technical one. He said the nonprofit system, which includes hospitals, clinics and a coordinated care organization under the Oregon Health Plan, has reserves and does not have a problem making payments. 

That said, Samaritan's situation reflects what he's seeing and hearing all over the state, Boysen said, with payments under Medicare and the Oregon Health Plan remaining flat or even declining. Indeed, he echoes a common refrain among health care industry observers.

“I believe that health care is unsustainable right now in the state of Oregon,” he said. “I do believe if it continues on this track in five to 10 years, the configuration of how health care systems are made up in the state are going to change dramatically.”

Nearly 90,000 low-income residents of the region are served by the InterCommunity Health Network operated by Samaritan. Past sales of organizations overseeing care for the Oregon Health Plan have been controversial.

I believe that health care is unsustainable right now in the state of Oregon.”

For Samaritan, it likely makes sense to follow the “movement in the state” toward growth, which could include finding a larger partner, as he noted hospitals like Mid-Columbia Medical Center in The Dalles, Bay Area Hospital and Legacy Health have done.

“We believe that it's our duty to be thinking about that and talking about that,” he said.

Samaritan North Lincoln Hospital in Lincoln City is one of two critical care hospitals in the county, comprising a large portion of the rural health care safety net. According to figures reported to the Oregon Health Authority, Good Samaritan Medical Center, the flagship hospital in the Samaritan system, suffered an operating loss of  $7.6 million last year, an improvement over the $28.5 million operating loss the previous year.

Samaritan's notice to its bank cited “decreasing payments from health insurance companies, declining payor mix, and increased utilization on its health plans in excess of premiums received, as well as other industry-wide pressures on expenses, such as labor, supplies, and general inflation.”

Under the terms of the bond covenant, Boysen said, Samaritan was required to hire a consulting firm to help it improve its financial picture. Samaritan hired Warbird Healthcare Advisors of Atlanta, a firm that advises health care organizations on everything from analyzing productivity of physician practices to negotiating sales of client organizations.

Samaritan is facing crosswinds that bedevil many rural and small regional health care systems. A February analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform said financial difficulties threaten to close more than 700 rural hospitals — about a third of all rural hospitals in the country — including seven in Oregon. 

It said the primary driver of rural hospital financial problems is that they are losing increasing amounts of money serving patients with private insurance coverage. But hospital systems around the country also lament stagnant Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements even as care expenses continue to rise.

According to figures reported to the Oregon Health Authority, Good Samaritan Medical Center, the flagship hospital in the Samaritan system, suffered an operating loss of $7.6 million last year, an improvement over the $28.5 million operating loss the previous year. Samaritan also operates hospitals in Albany, Newport, Lebanon and north Lincoln County. It also operates two insurance plans.

Boysen said in December he would resign from his job as CEO this year, and that the company would recruit a replacement. He said this week the board has been evaluating candidates and he expects a decision will be announced within the next 45 days.

Since last year, Samaritan, which employs more than 6,000 people, cut 200 jobs systemwide and reduced hours for some employees and temporarily reduced executive pay. In a prepared statement, Samaritan cited pressures ranging from inflation to a national cyber incident caused it to lose money in 2024. Boysen said this week that the cost-cutting measures launched last August are already paying off. 

“Our January financial metrics look like they're heading on a much more positive pathway right now,” he said.

Boysen said the system's proposed absorption of Stayton-based Santiam Memorial Hospital, a financially challenged 40-bed hospital that serves Stayton and surrounding communities, reflects Samaritan's quest for “economies of scale.”

Under the terms of the proposed acquisition, Samaritan said it would build a $15 million medical office building in Stayton and supply the smaller hospital with $10.5 million for capital expenses. It also said it would assume about $25 million of debt Santiam owes to the federal government and Key Bank.

While that purchase is not final, it would expand Samaritan's coverage area deeper eastward into Linn County and eastern Marion County, and buttress the system's already dominant market position in its core region of Lincoln, Benton and Linn Counties. 

One concern raised publicly by commenters on the proposed acquisition is that the deal would mean Santiam patients who are covered by United Heallthcare insurance plans would no longer be in the Santiam network.

“After the merger, where will United Healthcare patients go for care?,” asked Kristin Thompson in her communication with Oregon's Health Care Market Oversight program of the Oregon Health Authority.

As Samaritan weighs its options in the months ahead, Boysen said, it is conscious of the need to make sure residents have access to local health services, even if absorption by a larger partner means they are not provided under the name Samaritan. 

“The core issue for us is that you have this hyper-rising inflation market where our supply expenses, pharmaceutical expenses, all our labor expenses have gone up exponentially over the last three or four years,” he said. “Seventy-five percent of our revenue, our payer mix, is from Medicare and Medicaid (in which) we've seen hardly any increase to the revenue side.

“And there is a point where the math doesn't work.”

Grove City is moving forward with a potential program to help low-income residents with health care costs.

A new committee of city officials and mayoral appointees will figure out more specifics for the program, which the city council member who sponsored it says is one of the first in the country.

Council member Ted Berry said in an interview with The Dispatch that he introduced the idea because “I've gotten sick and tired of waiting on the federal government and the state to do something about it.”

Berry also said that he knows of many people in Grove City who don't get health insurance, including people who work multiple part-time jobs that don't offer healthcare, as well as seniors who struggle to pay for health care.

He added that some people work part-time for small businesses that need workers but can't afford to pay for health care for full-time employees.

An original version of the ordinance included $75,000 in pilot funding, but the final version the city council passed unanimously March 17 omitted the seed funding. Berry said the committee will first establish more guidelines for the program before moving forward.

Berry said that there is plenty of health care around Grove City and in central Ohio, but it can be expensive.

“We're lucky enough not to have an accessibility problem because we've got some of the best hospitals in the world located right here in central Ohio — it's just we have an affordability problem,” Berry said.

About one in four working-age adults in Grove City do not receive employer-sponsored health care, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. About 4% of people do not have health insurance.

The draft program includes an income cap of $30,000 with an annual grant maximum of $400 for individuals and $600 for family plans, but Berry said the committee will evaluate all of the numbers and could make changes.

This wouldn't be the first direct grant program to city residents: Grove City offers $1,000 per semester to local full- and part-time college students, for a total benefit of up to $12,000.

SOUTH KINGSTOWN – When nearly the entire team of hematology oncology providers abruptly resigned from South County Hospital last June, their departure was discreetly announced in a newsletter to the medical staff.

That may have been the end of it – except that patients and former medical staff started questioning the hospital's version of events that a divergence of perspectives on how to handle the cancer center's finances created a rift between the institution and the providers. Soon an opposition group formed, which claimed the blame lay with the hospital's top administration.

The opposition group, dubbed Save South County Hospital, held public forums calling on the hospital's top administrators to resign, sent letters to the hospital's board and appealed to state authorities to intervene. It also set up a website to press forward with its public information campaign.

The hospital, for its part, launched an entire landing page on its website dedicated to “addressing the facts” – defending the hospital's administration, explaining departures of physicians and the hospital finances. It also held news conferences, community forums, and question-and-answer sessions in response to Save South County Hospital's efforts.

Now, more than half a year after it all started, the battle for South County Hospital is heating up.

On March 11, the hospital filed a lawsuit against Save South County Hospital and Claudia Swain, a former development executive who managed donor relationships.

The lawsuit claims Swain disclosed confidential information to Save South County Hospital to convince donors to stop financially supporting the hospital.

“Though [Save South County Hospital claims] to advocate for quality care, their actions threaten the very funding that enables us to maintain that standard. By targeting donor contributions, they risk creating the very lapses in care and quality they profess to oppose,” says a news release provided by Matt Moeller, director of marketing and communications at South County Health, the parent organization of South County Hospital.

Save South County Hospital's Director Steven Fera, a former cardiologist at the hospital, denies that any disclosures of confidential information occurred and says that a list of the donors to the hospital are all on publicly available plaques in the hospital lobby.

He chalked off the lawsuit as an attempt to stifle opposition.

“This lawsuit is nothing short of a shameless, desperate stunt designed to choke off dissent and cover up the catastrophic fallout of gross mismanagement at South County Hospital,” Fera said.

In a separate news release sent to media Wednesday, Save South County Hospital announced it is convening a special meeting of members of South County Health's endowment on April 3. At the meeting, which will be open to the public, members will seek to elect nine additional trustees to the hospital's board to “right the hospital's ship.”

But, in an email to the media Thursday, Moeller said the meeting did not meet the criteria to be considered a meeting of South County Health's endowment.

“Any decisions or votes taken at this gathering hold no validity or authority to enact change at [South County Hosptial],” Moeller wrote.

Fera disagrees.

“The meeting has been thoroughly researched by lawyers and is legally able to be held to provide opportunities for new leadership at the hospital,” he said.

South County Hospital has an annual meeting scheduled for April 7, which will include the board of trustees, the health system's executive leadership and members of South County Health's corporations. It is not open to the public.

Tension between South County Hospital's leadership and Save South County Hospital has been building since the beginning of the year. The group held a meeting on Jan. 28 at South Kingstown High School, where former patients, providers and stakeholders spoke. About 300 people attended the event, according to the group.

Earlier in January, a separate group of more than 60 donors, former trustees and staff sent a letter to South County Hospital's Board of Trustees asking the hospital to rehire the hematology oncology providers who resigned, remove CEO Aaron Robinson and pursue a partnership with a larger health system. The letter was unaffiliated with Save South County Hospital, though Fera and Chris VanHemerlrijck, also one of the group's directors, were among its signers.

With one less hospital in the area after the closure of East Ohio Regional Hospital in Martins Ferry, emergency medical response staff say patients could see delays. 


MARTINS FERRY — After weeks of uncertainty, East Ohio Regional Hospital officially closed its doors Thursday night, the impact of which is rippling through the surrounding healthcare landscape. 

Local hospitals are preparing for larger patient loads during an abnormally busy year, while first responders say they expect longer transport and wait times for emergency medical services. 

Cumberland Trail Fire Captain Jeremy Rife said it is normal for his department to take multiple patients to EORH a day as it is one of the closest facilities for them. Now, having to drive patients further to WVU Medicine Barnesville or Reynolds Memorial hospitals will make turnaround times for EMS longer. 

The closure will also have a ripple effect on local hospitals who will be forced to take on more patients than usual, Rife said. 

“I think one of the biggest things is that it's going to overwhelm other hospitals and cause them to possibly have to go on diversion more often and they're just going to have to work a lot harder to get patients through that can no longer go to EORH,” Rife said. 

OR&W Fire Chief R.C. Fellows echoed this concern, noting that a particularly bad flu and COVID season has already been overwhelming hospitals in recent months. 

“The hospitals have been overloaded right now regardless and with taking an ER away from us it's going to really impact all of these hospitals because they're getting more and more patients and we've been busier than we've probably ever seen before,” Fellows said. 

Patients with a preference for EORH or who have established providers there are also being forced to make changes, Rife said. 

“There are a lot of patients that prefer to go to EORH now they're having to switch up where their doctors are and stuff like that and just try to find different options,” Rife said.

Health Department Deputy Commissioner Robert Sproul emphasized that Belmont County is already an area with a shortage of physicians.

“Any time we lose medical services it is a detriment to the county. So it's very sad to see [EORH] close because there's a lot of services, a lot of care that they're providing to the community,” Sproul said. “As a health department our job is to fill the gaps and help the community in any way we can.” 

Sproul said the county leaned on EORH for things like infectious disease reporting and general medical services, much of which will now be diverted across the Ohio River. He said he hopes Wheeling-area hospitals can sustain the increase in patient load. 

He also noted how difficult it is to get a hospital up and running again after a closure, which EORH has already seen once before in its troubled past. 

“Anytime we lose these services, it's hard to get it back. The first time [EORH] closed, look how long it took to reopen. The worry is, how long will it take for another entity to move into that facility to provide care to the county again? That is a concern,” Sproul said. “It's just a sad day, that's for sure.” 

A statement from WVU Medicine – which has Wheeling, Reynolds Memorial, Barnesville and Weirton hospitals in its fold – extended “good thoughts and prayers to fellow caregivers and support staff” at EORH. 

The statement said WVU Medicine's hospitals are prepared to take on the additional patient load – and potentially offer jobs to some of the laid off EORH healthcare staff. 

“Our hospitals and clinics in eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia stand ready to care for East Ohio's patients, and we encourage the hospital team members to explore opportunities to join our team at WVUMedicine.org/Careers,” the statement read. 

The Ohio Department of Transportation said counties will soon work to remove EORH from highway signs indicating that it is the nearest hospital.

Shenyang Institute of Computing Technology, CAS and Chinese PLA General Hospital Joint Team conduct series of investigations on Infantile Spasms Syndrome (IESS), also known as West syndrome, discovering a video-based epileptic seizure detection method that effectively enhances the accuracy of infantile spasm identification.

1. Background introduction and problem bottleneck

IESS is an epileptic encephalopathy that manifests during infancy, characterized by unique epileptic seizures, including repeated muscle contractions, extensions, or alternating flexion-extension spasms. These seizures are accompanied by high-amplitude electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms, known as hypsarrhythmia. IESS has adverse prognostic implications for intellectual development. In clinical practice, precise monitoring of bedridden patients' movements is crucial for effective disease management and epileptic seizure diagnosis. However, even experienced EEG technicians face challenges when analyzing relevant data.

2. Research opportunity and discovery

Given the massive generation of EEG data, the susceptibility of signal interpretation to interference, and the potential comfort issues for infants and young children when wearing EEG devices, we explored a video-based epileptic seizure detection method utilizing feature recognition. This method aims to simplify the assessment process, reduce non-medical expenditures, and ensure continuous evaluation of the patient's condition.

3. Brief summary of research content

This study initially integrated target detection technology into the video data processing stage to accurately locate patients in clinical monitoring videos, thereby extracting video clips that solely contain the patients. Subsequently, an enhanced 3D-ResNet was employed for video-based IESS detection. This method utilizes an optimized 3DResNet-50 architecture, which deeply extracts local key features from the video through asymmetric convolution and CBR modules, and introduces a 3D Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance the spatial correlation between channels in video frames.

4. Current challenges and future directions

Currently, the main challenges faced by the research include issues such as occlusion, lighting variations, and similar human body interferences during the identification process. Future research directions will focus on further enhancing the network's generalization capability, optimizing algorithms to address various challenges in practical applications, and exploring more AI-based solutions to alleviate the workload of doctors when screening VEEG data.

HONOLULU (Island News) -- "I'm originally from New Jersey. I've been on island for about six and a half years," said Keri Anacker.

Anacker is a school psychologist, who spent years in grad school for her specialist degree.

Now she works at a number of public schools assessing students for special education, then comes up with plans to help them.

Local lawmakers want to spend millions to attract and keep new healthcare professionals in Hawaii through a bill that forgives loans used when studying for their profession.

In her move to the islands, she brought more than just her belongings.

"I accumulated I want to say about a little under $30,000 in student loans," stated Anacker.

She said she would pay a little each month, but planned on paying for ten years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Instead, she signed up for a Hawaii program that nearly wiped it all away.

"I got awarded the money 2024. I had about $26,000 in student loan debt and they sent a check to my loan servicer for $25,500," said Anacker.

She is one of the nearly 900 healthcare workers, who took part in the loan repayment program over the past two years.

Now lawmakers want to set more money aside to help hundreds more Hawaii healthcare professionals.

"$30 million, that is $15 million in each of the next two years, which pays for the loans that people take out when they study to become doctors, nurses, physician assistants, social workers. This pays back the amount of money they took out in loans up to $50,000," said Rep. Gregg Takayama.

The program is a popular one, with more than 1,300 people on the wait list, but it does come with an important requirement.

"As part of forgiving of their student loans, they have to agree to serve at least two years in a rural area, which in Hawaii is almost all of Hawaii. So we get back committed healthcare workers to serve in our community. That meets a real shortage we have of healthcare workers all across the board," added Takayama.

The House bill survived crossing over to the other side of the State Legislature, but now will be heard by the Senate Ways and Means committee, which reviews all bills with a financial impact.

For new healthcare workers like Anacker, the program has made a difference in her Hawaii career.

"Although this program didn't help bring me here, it's definitely helped to retain and keep me here," stated Anacker.

She is a such a fan of the program. She's also reached out to other current and former students, to let them know about the loan repayment program and encourage them to come to Hawaii.

"I'm hoping to bring more people to the island because of it. So I'm hoping to even recruit, more healthcare workers and mental health workers like myself," added Anacker.

OREGON, USA — Oregon Health & Science University and UnitedHealthcare have reached a "good-faith agreement" on a new contract, according to a statement from the hospital system on Friday. About 74,000 people in Oregon will be looking for a new doctor at the end of March if the two sides do not finalize the deal.

Health care providers like OHSU have contracts with insurance providers, agreeing to reimbursement rates that the insurance company will pay for medical services. But United's contract with OHSU ends on March 31, and if they don't negotiate a new one by April 1, OHSU's doctors will be "out of network" for patients with United insurance.

That means United patients can still go to an OHSU doctor, but it will cost them significantly more, and OHSU says patients might not even be able to stay in the hospital. If patients remain on March 31, OHSU said on its website that it will make sure they are stable, but on April 1, patients may be asked to leave and find a hospital that's still in United's network.

All United patients will need to find a new doctor within United's network — but an appointment, particularly with a specialist, is likely months away.

OHSU said that patients can ask United for "continuity of care" service by April 30, but it is up to United whether they approve it.

In a statement banner posted on OHSU's site Friday evening, the hospital system signaled that they may be close to a deal:

"We are pleased to share that OHSU, Adventist Health Portland and Hillsboro Medical Center have each reached a good-faith agreement with UnitedHealthcare and and are working to finalize contracts before the expiration deadline."

Both United and OHSU declined interviews with KGW.

OHSU has said that "operational and financial issues" with United are disrupting care. OHSU added that United denies more than 56% of claims compared to an industry standard of 5% to 10%, and that it takes an average of 307 days — almost an entire year — to resolve claims.

United has not responded to those claims, but they have said they are contending with "unreasonable price hikes" under OHSU's proposed contract, claiming that if they agree to what OHSU wants, a C-section would cost $9,000 more than it does today; outpatient surgery would cost $3,000 more; and an ER visit would cost $1,100 more.

OHSU responded to an email from KGW regarding the claims, saying they haven't reviewed the cost claims and can't verify how United calculated those figures.

Meanwhile, both sides say they're still at the negotiating table, so it's possible they could reach a deal before April 1.

Becky Hultberg, president and CEO of the Hospital Association of Oregon said in part:

"We have seen increased friction between insurers and providers since the pandemic. It really comes down to basic math. Hospitals aren't being paid enough to cover the cost of caring for patients."

"Over the past few years, some insurers have pocketed record profits, at a time when about half of Oregon's community hospitals have been consistently operating in the red. This is a serious issue that all Oregonians should care about because no organization — or household, for that matter — can operate indefinitely in the red," said Hultberg.

Dozens of locals marched to a Tesla showroom in San Jose on Friday, protesting federal cuts proposed by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.

Protesters were focused on the proposed cuts to healthcare and social security. Many chanted, "No justice, no peace," as they made their way to the Tesla location in Santana Row.

"We're here today to show the billionaires that they have no place in our democracy," said Lucy Ortiz of Silicon Valley Rising. "They have no place in our government making decisions for people who are impacted by this, and they're not gonna be able to get away with taking apart our democracy; that's why we're here."

Friday's demonstration was just one of several this week across the county, all meant to protest the proposed cuts. 

"This showroom and these types of politics are not welcome in our communities," said Timmy Lu of Oakland.

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. --- (KBAK/FOX58) Los Angeles County Democratic Congressman Jimmy Gomez (CA-34) visited Kern County Thursday night for a townhall to give local Democrats and concerned citizens a chance to hear a different side of the political spectrum not always seen in Kern County. Gomez spoke with Eyewitness News today about his visit and why it was important for him to come up on his time away from Washington D.C.

WICHITA FALLS, Texas (KAUZ) - High school students got an up-close and personal look at the many career paths available in healthcare, thanks to a collaboration between the North Central Area Education Center, MSU Texas and Vernon College.

“We want them to be able to see the campus, touch the materials, interact with the students and the faculty so that they can just really get a good idea about if this is the direction it's going, what's it going to look like,” community base educator Paige Rask said.

This healthcare high school tour is sparking the interest of high school students in the area, long before they set foot in a formal college classroom setting.

“A lot of times students go in knowing I want to help somebody. That's what I want to do long term. I want to help somebody, but many times they don't know all of the different programs that we have to offer and so this gives them exposure to every single one of them, whether it's radiology, social work, dental hygiene, athletic training, all of them. I'll say for respiratory therapy we actually had some cadaver pig lungs that we had. We have a healthy set and we had one that was exposed to cigarette smoke. It allows the students to see what kind of damage can actually be done to the lungs,“ director of interdisciplinary education Randy Case said.

“In dental hygiene they got to clean teeth, they go through the sterilization, they look at even making models and taking x-rays and so each department really brought its own and let them really get a good idea about what they would see, feel, and interact with as a student,“ Rask said.

During the tour, each department added its own touch with unique activities in each profession.

For some students it wasn't just about exploration, it was discovering new and valuable skills, like working on a team.

“Everyone's a team, even though there's so many different ways that you can be a health care provider,“ Windthorst High school student Lane Hale said. 

“Just communication is a big key, a big part of it. Teamwork, like they said earlier, but just listening and observing bigger patients and everything,” Iowa Park High school Trinitey Sousa said.

At its core, this event offered more than just exposure as students were being guided, leading students to take meaningful step into their future.

“What we really hope that this does is just help inspire students to get excited to possibly open their minds up to different opportunities and they knew that were even available. Really give them a good idea about what not only does it look like in college, but what it could look like as their career,“ Rask said.

Jannik Sinner would have feared the worst when he was informed he would not be able to play for three months.

The World number one was found to have tested positive for banned substance clostebol on two occasions in 2024.

Therefore, Sinner was handed a three-month suspension after agreeing to a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). He has not played since February and will not be able to play until after May 4.

But since Sinner won the Australian Open in January, his position at the top of the ATP rankings has not been under any threat.

Jannik Sinner has a healthy lead at the ATP Tour rankings, but it was expected that the gap would close following his suspension.

While that could still be the case, Sinner's lead remains intact as those closest to challenging him have produced some poor results of late.

Since finishing runner-up to Sinner at the Australian Open, World number two Alexander Zverev has failed to reach the last four of any other tournament since.

Carlos Alcaraz won February's Rotterdam Open, but he has not won a title since and suffered a semi-final loss at Indian Wells and a shocking opening round defeat to David Goffin at the Miami Open.

America's number one Taylor Fritz has reached just one quarter-final this year, and 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic has been below his best for most of 2025, and he just ended a three-match losing streak in Miami.

Sinner currently has a 3,385-point lead at the top of the ATP rankings and due to the current form of his closest rivals, not much has been done top close the gap so far.

Sinner is set to return to the tour in front of his home fans at the Italian Open, which commences May 7.

Another advantage in the 23-year-old's favour is that he will be feeling fresh while his compatriots will have played a long and gruelling clay court season, after the North American hard court swing.

Furthermore, Sinner will be boosted by his fellow Italians at the Foro Italico, who will undoubtedly make their voices heard when he takes to the court.

Sinner has yet to win a Masters 1000 title on clay, but it will come as no surprise if he breaks his duck on home soil immediately after returning from his doping ban.

After playing in Rome and Hamburg, Sinner will compete at the French Open.

In 2024, he produced his best run of his career by making it to the semi-finals, and Sinner also became the new World number one during the tournament.

Should he perform well in Rome and Hamburg, Sinner will arrive in the French capital as the player to beat. This will also be the case if his rivals produce more inconsistent results throughout the clay court swing.

Alcaraz is the defending champion in Paris and he defeated Sinner each time they played in 2024. At his best, he will be Sinner's biggest threat.

But without Sinner lifting a racket since January, and Alcaraz currently not playing his best tennis, Sinner may be in a great position to beat the Spaniard for the first time since 2023, and win his first French Open title.

Coleman Wong became a tennis player by complete coincidence. Now, the Hong Kong native is one of the brightest young talents in the sport.

The 20-year-old's tennis journey began aged five when his older sister by two years, Elana, was meant to take a private lesson at Victoria Park, home of the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open. She fell ill and their parents, Bruce and Dora, did not want to waste the money, so Coleman took the lesson.

“I really liked it,” Wong recalled to ATPTour.com. “I was a bit out of shape, I was a bit chubby and at first it was just for keeping fit. Then, slowly, I grew.”

Fifteen years later, Wong is competing in the Miami Open presented by Itau, one of nine ATP Masters 1000 events. His smile left no doubt regarding the emotions the rising star felt after he defeated Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 6-3 on Thursday for the biggest victory of his career.

“It feels unreal. This year I've been struggling a little bit, playing tougher tournaments. That's why I'm not winning a lot,” Wong said. “Maybe sometimes I win a round and then I lose second round, playing some really good players. But I'm really happy to get one of my biggest wins in my career. For me, it means a lot, and I really hope it's the first of many.”

 

The No. 182 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was full of gratitude when discussing his special moment. Wong was sure to thank the tournament for providing him with a main draw wild card, his team and his family. He made clear how many people have supported him.

Wong does not come from a sporting family. His father is a school principal, his mother is a teacher and his sister works in the bank industry, so Coleman is the outlier as a professional athlete.

Aged 17, Wong spoke to his parents and decided to move to Spain to train at the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar. The then-teen told his parents he would not be able to become a professional without making the move.

“They didn't have any picture of it, and they let me go,” Wong said. “I really, I really need to thank them as well. It's a big sacrifice, because I don't see them at all. I probably see them a few times a year.” 

Wong has not physically been with his family since the first week of the season in Hong Kong. It was special to compete in the ATP 250 event.

“Being from Hong Kong, it means a lot, because Hong Kong, we had two gold medals in the past few years in the Olympics, [so] many people are starting to like sports,” Wong said. “So I'm really happy. I feel like they're always behind me, supporting me, and I really hope that I can inspire someone.”



It has now been around four years for Wong at Nadal's eponymous academy and he has been able to train with the Spaniard on a half-dozen occasions. One memory sticks out, and it did not occur in Mallorca. When Nadal last won the Australian Open, in 2022, Wong earned the boys' doubles title with Bruno Kuzuhara. They had a chat on the practice court.

“He congratulated me. We have a picture together, holding the trophy, my doubles,” Wong said. “He said, 'You're in the right path, because we have one of the best coaches', and I believed him.”

A post shared by ATP Challenger Tour (@atpchallengertour)

Tennis has become more than just a sport for Wong. It is a place where he can forget about anything going on off the court and just work on his game.

“I like to win. I want to be the best, and I want to see what my limit is. I'm still searching for it,” Wong said. “The best in this journey is I can always challenge myself every time. Every day, I want to improve. So I think this is one of the points that my coaches really liked about me, because I really like to work. But I always say it's not enough, not enough. So that's why I think if I don't like tennis, I cannot do that for sure.”

Wong will certainly try to enjoy the experience of playing home favourite Ben Shelton on Saturday in Miami. He hopes to continue making a name for himself and Hong Kong.

“I want them to know that Hong Kong can also have a professional tennis player,” Wong said of the fans. “We don't believe in that yet, but I want to tell them that even a small city like Hong Kong can still produce someone that can play against the world.”

PROVO, Utah - The No. 17 UCF men's tennis team dropped a contested match Saturday evening, losing its first Big 12 away duel of the season at BYU, 4-2.

A point of emphasis for the Knights (15-6, 1-2) has been their growth in doubles play, however, in the high altitude of Provo, the Cougars (11-4, 1-2) retained serve to claim the early advantage.

Shifting up to court one, Yassine Dlimi and Emilio Sanchez couldn't find their footing against BYU's Zach Fuchs and Wally Thayne, while Luca Hotze and Simeon Terziev fell to a similar fate on court three. Mehdi Benchakroun and Santiago Giamichelle sat just a game away from taking court two before the contest was abandoned.

The team split the first sets to open singles play as the Knights looked to find the leveler, which would come in just over an hour. On court four, Giamichelle tallied his 100th career win at the collegiate level with a dominating 6-2, 6-2, victory over Adam Chodur. In just three seasons, the Argentinian native hit the century mark with his 52nd singles win, paired with 48 in doubles.

BYU immediately jumped back out to a lead with wins on courts two and six, as Benchakroun and Sanchez suffered straight-set defeats. Freshman Nicolas Oliveira authored one of his best performances to date as the Brazilian put the Knights within one following a 7-5, 6-3, result over Tygen Goldammer. 

With the 90th-ranked Dlimi amidst a third set, Colin was striving to push his court-three duel to a similar situation, though the junior was eventually bested in a second-set tiebreak as the Cougars secured the win via Redd Owen, 6-3, 7-6. 

UP NEXT

UCF will look to jump back in the win column on Sunday afternoon as it makes the short journey north to Salt Lake City for a meeting with No. 52 Utah. First serve is at 3 p.m. ET.

Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal dominated tennis for years, winning the sport's biggest prizes.

Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal became known as the ‘big three' as they ruled the ATP Tour for almost 20 years.

The trio remarkably combined for 66 Major titles, battling it out for the Grand Slam record throughout their tennis careers.

It is Djokovic who now leads the way with 24 triumphs at the sport's four biggest events, ahead of Nadal on 22, and Federer on 20.

Arguments over who is the greatest of all time in men's tennis persist, as one former American ATP star now makes his pick.

Appearing as a guest on the Digital Social Hour podcast, former world number 11 Sam Querrey revealed who he thinks is the greatest of all time.

“I have [Novak] Djokovic as the best tennis player of all time,” he said.

“The most impactful person, [Roger] Federer.

“I think if you went around the world [asking] who do you love watching the most and who made the biggest impact on your life, I think Federer wins that.

“But if I gave you three blind resumes Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal, and said who is the best here, you would be like this guy definitely, it would be Djokovic.”

Querrey played 21 matches against members of the ‘big three' as he now explains which of the trio were hardest to play against.

“I was able to beat Djokovic, Nadal and [Andy] Murray,” he said.

“Federer I played five times and lost all five and never even had a close set against him.

“I had a couple of sets that were like 6-4 but the way his game matched up to mine, it just didn't sit right with me.

“He was able to put me in uncomfortable positions.”

The American then outlined what was different about playing Federer that always made him ‘nervous'.

“Federer for whatever reason his name seemed bigger so I was a little bit more nervous,” said Querrey.

“Any time you played Federer it was on a Centre Court at Wimbledon or the French Open or these big events and the crowd loved him.

“He was beloved everywhere, you were always nervous, the crowd always wanted him to win.

“I could never really settle in against him, and never got close to winning a set against him, even when I was playing at my best.”

The big-serving American was always a threat on the grass and produced one of the biggest wins of his career in 2016 when he took down Djokovic at Wimbledon.

Djokovic was the two-time defending champion but Querrey dashed any hopes of a three-peat, knocking him out with an impressive four-set win, 7-6, 6-1, 3-6, 7-6.

A win over Nicolas Mahut followed for Querrey before he came up short against Canada's Milos Raonic in the quarter-finals.

He returned one year later in even better form, taking down the defending champion for a second year running when he beat Murray in the quarter-finals.

In his only career appearance in a Grand Slam semi-final, Querrey fell to defeat, losing in four sets to Marin Cilic, 7-6, 4-6, 6-7, 5-7.

The American retired from tennis in 2022, having scored wins over Djokovic, Murray, and Nadal, collecting  ten titles on the ATP Tour.

Mathew Knowles is addressing Kanye West's disturbing comments about his grandchildren.

Earlier this week, the 47-year-old "Flashing Lights" rapper took to X to tweet some offensive comments about Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 7-year-old twins Rumi and Sir Carter.

In a since-deleted post, Kanye, wrote, “WAIT HAS ANYONE EVER SEEN JAY Z AND BEYONCES YOUNGER KIDS,” before questioning their mental capacity while using offensive language.

Now in a new interview, Mathew, 73, responded to Kanye's comments.

Keep reading to find out more..."People pay a price for being stupid, especially in the music industry," Mathew told TMZ.

He added, "I'm hopeful Kanye gets the type of help he needs, in terms of mental health."

Beyoncé's mom Tina Knowles, who was married to Matthew from 1980 to 2011, also seemingly addressed Kanye's comments about Rumi and Sir.

Kylie Kelce has no time for haters.

Earlier this week, Kylie, 32, had former First Lady Michelle Obama as a guest on her podcast Not Gonna Lie.

After Kylie shared a clip from their interview on Instagram, a user named Dana reacted to the post by putting the throwing up emoji in the comments section.

Keep reading to find out more...Kylie then directly responded to the comment, writing, “Hi Dana. We actually don't do this here. If you have nothing nice to say just keep scrolling.”

During the episode, Kylie, who is currently pregnant with baby No. 4, took a moment to sing her praises for Michelle, 61.

“I'm not going to lie, Mrs. Obama, this is a pretty surreal moment for me,” Kylie said. “I have always been such a fan of the way you carry yourself."

She continued, "At 18 was the first election that I was able to vote for your husband. But seeing you as a powerful figure alongside him as a partner was such an outstanding image of female empowerment.” 

During their conversation, Michelle took a moment to praise Kylie for her bravery for having a fourth child. Kylie and husband Jason Kelce are already parents to daughters Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 2.

“You're doing it a fourth time. I just had to stop,” Michelle told Kylie. “I was like, ‘I think I've been lucky with these two.' Barack was like, ‘We should have a third,' and I was like, ‘Dude.'”

She continued, “I'm thinking, ‘We're gonna get a crazy one. It's just the roll of the dice.' So, I admire your courage. You don't know what you're gonna get.”

If you missed it, Michelle recently responded to rumors about her marriage.

NBC's Happy's Place went through quite a few story line changes — including when it came to those Reba cameos — but what were the show's original plans and how did they shift?

During an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, creator Kevin Abbott confirmed that the biggest shakeup was Danny (Steve Howey) was no longer going to be a potential sperm donor for Gabby (Melissa Peterman) despite past comments from him.

“With Steve Howey, we originally had an idea that he was going to be the sperm donor. Then NBC wanted a Christmas episode so we had to scramble and come up with something. We put Steve in that and we changed things,” Abbott explained. “But he was originally the sperm donor.”

Howey, 47, and Peterman, 53, previously teased to Us in individual interviews how they wanted to see the story go after sharing the screen on Reba. Abbott, however, admitted that it would be “a little weird” considering the way viewers have associated Howey with Van from Reba and Peterman with the role of Barbara Jean. (The pair played in-laws on the hit sitcom.)



“It got a little creepy and a little incestuous,” he quipped. “It got weird. So we decided against that. We are so lucky we've been able to have two of our old cast members on right now. And we're looking to bring JoAnna Garcia Swisher. Obviously we love her.”

Despite Happy's Place overlapping so much with Reba due to stars Reba McEntire and Peterman being on both shows, the NBC sitcom has to be careful with guest stars. (In addition to Howey, season 1 featured an episode with Christopher Rich as well.)

“We can't get too close to what the original [revival of Reba would have been],” Abbott noted. “We can only do so much without crossing legal lines. So that's always a big caution for us. Mostly my attitude on this.”

The other onscreen shift could come as a surprise for viewers who saw McEntire's Bobbie come to terms with her feelings for Rex Linn‘s character, Emmett.

“I actually had a different place I was going to wind up with in the first season. It involved that relationship,” Abbott confirmed about Bobbie and Emmett, who decided not to act on their feelings just yet during the Friday, March 21, season finale. “But I couldn't because we like to track these out and then build them so that when we get there, it is a surprise. It seems obvious the tracks have been laid because we had the 13 episodes and we weren't told whether or not we were going to get picked up for more.”

The Happy's Place writers decided not to rush the romance, with Abbott adding, “I didn't have time to build where I wanted to build to. But I wanted to start that relationship because the one thing I never got to do on the old Reba show was relationships.”

After Happy's Place was ordered to series in May 2024, the character descriptions, cast members and even potential onscreen relationships evolved.

“When you have a pilot, hopefully you create areas that you could grow into. For instance, Pablo Castelblanco‘s character was [pictured] as Larry Wilmore and I was thinking that was going to be a very different type of character,” Abbott explained. “Pablo came in and he was just so brilliant. I didn't know if he was going to be Steve or who but he was going to be in the show. So the dynamics put in place for Steve we didn't follow at all.”

He continued: “Originally Steve and Isabella [Belissa Escobedo], were possible love interests with each other. Obviously that's not going to be the case. … I could be lying [though]. You have no idea. You shouldn't trust me.”

Happy's Place has been renewed for season 2. Season 1 is now streaming on Peacock.

Gene Hackman's daughter has reportedly made a plan to bury the Oscar winner's late dog alongside his wife, Betsy Arakawa.

Nearly one month after Hackman, Arakawa and one of their pet dogs died, new sheriff department footage obtained by TMZ revealed how the canine would be buried.

In the footage published on Friday, March 21, a law enforcement officer asked Hackman's daughter Elizabeth if she was interested in cremating the pet's ashes.

“I'm thinking, cremate the dog and bury it with Betsy,” Elizabeth said in the footage. “And if the dog was wearing a collar, can you save that for me?”



The police officer agreed to save a collar for Elizabeth.

Arakawa, in particular, had a fondness for her pets ahead of her sudden death.

“She was devoted to those dogs,” Gruda Veterinary Hospital owner Robert Gruda told USA Today on March 11, remembering her visits to the facility. “She was consistent, predictable. We knew something was wrong when she didn't pick up the food on time. She was an excellent dog owner [and an] excellent caretaker to those dogs. She really doted on them.”

News broke in late February that Hackman and Arakawa had been found dead inside their Santa Fe, New Mexico, house. They were 95 and 65, respectively.

“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy. He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us, he was always just Dad and Grandpa,” Hackman's daughters and granddaughter told Us Weekly in a statement. “We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.”

Hackman and Arakawa are survived by his children, Christopher, Elizabeth and Leslie, whom the actor shared with late ex-wife Faye Maltese, and their granddaughter, Anna.

A medical examiner later confirmed that Hackman died due to hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributing factor. Arakawa, for her part, died as a result of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

Hackman and Arakawa owned three dogs: Zinna, Bear and Nikita. Zinna, an Australian kelpie, also passed away in February. A report from the local animal control agency obtained by the Associated Press noted that Zinna likely died from dehydration and starvation. (Police had found Zinna locked in a crate inside Hackman and Arakawa's home).

Bear and Nikita, meanwhile, survived and were taken into custody by a Santa Fe animal shelter. They also allegedly assisted members of the sheriff's department in finding Hackman and Arakawa's bodies.

Chief Brian Moya revealed earlier this month that one of the dogs ran up to officers and started barking upon arrival for a welfare check.

“They realized [the dog] was trying to say, ‘Hey, come over here! Come over here!'” Moya recalled to USA Today, noting the pet led the officers to a mudroom where Hackman was lying on the floor.

“At its core, Ransom Canyon isn't just a town. It's an idea. It's the painful longing for your first love. It's the burning desire to protect your family. It's cowboys and lovers, grifters and thieves. Lust, deceit, heartache, home. Ransom has it all,” creator April Blair told Tudum in March 2025 about the series. “I think people are going to fall in love with this little slice of Texas and the dramas and romances that we created there.”

Just like Minka Kelly's Quinn, viewers will find themselves conflicted between Staten and Eoin Macken's character Davis.
The "charming, Ivy-educated owner of the modern Bar W Ranch" is "intent on capitalizing on the invaluable aquifer running below Ransom's ranchland." Staten and Davis butt heads as the two biggest landowners in Ransom and their individual romantic interest in Quinn doesn't help.

Andrew Liner is Reid Collins, a.k.a the guy "toeing the line between confident and cocky." 
"Reid appears to have the perfect life as the star quarterback of Ransom High and heir to the Collins family ranch. He was devastated when his cousin was killed in a car accident but doesn't let that stop him from living life to the fullest as a 16-year-old with nothing to lose," reads the official character breakdown. "Behind the arrogant exterior, though, lies a caring, emotional boy eager to be loved and with a secret that's haunting him."

Mike “The Miz” Mizanin last appeared on The Challenge in 2005, back when it was still known as Real World/Road Rules Challenge. 20 years later, he remains one of the franchise's iconic characters.

Mizanin, 44, spoke to Us Weekly exclusively at the Newport Beach Celebrity Classic golf tournament on Sunday, March 16, benefiting Steadfast LA and the Newport Beach Fire Department Foundation, where he set the record straight on whether he will return to the show.

“I retired from The Challenge,” he told Us. “I told everyone, ‘This is my last one.' And people were like, ‘No, it's not. Never will be blah, blah, blah.' And I was like, ‘It's the last one.' And then it literally was.”

That's not to say Mizanin has disappeared from the reality spotlight. He's competed outside of The Challenge franchise, appearing on Fear Factor and Dancing With the Stars. He also served as host of the reunion shows for several Challenge seasons and hosted spin-off series Champs vs. Stars for two seasons.



Even though he's no longer competing, he's paying attention.

“I love seeing the new, up-and-coming challengers. I love seeing where The Challenge is. Who would have thought that it's bigger than The Real World, bigger than Road Rules?” he said. It's one of the biggest shows out there.”

Mizanin shouted out Johnny Bananas specifically, as well as Wes Bergmann, who recently competed on season 3 of The Traitors. And, yes, he has considered potentially competing on the Peacock reality hit.

“The hard part about doing Traitors for me would be three weeks in Scotland with no phone,” he said. “I can't be away from my kids that long, not just that long, but it's about not even talking to them. I need to talk to my kids, but I feel like that's a show that I could totally go on and win.”

Mizanin also admitted that Mark Long, who he played with on The Challenge in the early 2000s and most recently competed on The Challenge 40: Battle of the Eras, has tried to recruit him back to the franchise before.

“He always talks to me. I always hear from Mark, but he knows the answer,” Mizanin said. “I'm busy. I literally have WWE. I have a new golf YouTube channel called Miz Golf.”

For his part, Long told Us that he's enjoyed following Mizanin's career and praised his fellow wrestler's work ethic.

“When I think of cast members, I always put Mike in his own category: ‘superstar,'” he said. “He's one of the hardest working guys out there so I never even ask him. But I love following his career and chatting with him.”

Mizanin also teased something “big” that will further occupy his time in the coming months.

“It's something that I had a passion [for] ever since I was a little kid, and now I get to be a part of it and I'm really excited about it,” he said. “And then also, me and my wife were working on something big as well.”

Sophie Rain has built a massive, multimillion-dollar brand with her work on OnlyFans.

Despite receiving criticism left and right for the questionable content she shares online, the 20-year-old model only listens to the words of a higher power.

Rain, who goes by SophieRaiin across social media platforms, exclusively told Fox News Digital that the subscription-based site is simply a stepping stone in her career, which has already helped her amass $43 million just two years out of high school.

The content creator admitted that while she does receive backlash online, she's never questioned her Christian faith.

"I'm very strong," she said. "I have a very close relationship with my church and I love God. I believe that he will forgive your sins for anything, and I think that he's happy that I'm successful."

She doesn't often have time to attend services in person, but makes sure to dial in weekly to virtual services.

"I do a little video call because I'm currently living in Miami, but I used to live in Tampa, and that's my home church," she said. "I love that church so much and… my pastor that is there. I can't listen to another pastor."

She added, "It's so nice because I don't have to be there to listen to the Word of God. I can listen to it from my phone."

Rain also credited her strong morals and values for helping her stay focused on her future and quiet the outside noise.

"Having personal boundaries is the biggest thing," she said. "You have got to have morals or else you're going to get lost in the industry. That's just what happens. It's really easy to listen to what someone else says and listen to them and try to follow what they do, but you have got to stay true to yourself."

She added, "Essentially, there's just this big misconception on OnlyFans that you are labeled as a porn star, but I'm still a virgin. I keep my content on OnlyFans very reserved, and you can still make money from doing all of these things."

Before Rain became one of the most coveted influencers online, she was "barely making by" working as a server at a restaurant. She recently shared a video admitting she made $4 million from OnlyFans in one month.

"I was working long shifts just because I was just trying to make money," Rain said. "I was still living with my parents. I wanted to move out. I wanted to go do my own thing, and it just wasn't making me enough money. Like everything is so expensive nowadays, I'm barely making by. My sister was actually doing OnlyFans first and she kind of got me into it. I started with her and everything, and it just blew up, and it turned out into this."

What began as posting a few fun photos online has now spawned into a profitable business. Rain and a few of her friends live and work out of a home in South Florida — the Bop House, a money-making idea that formed organically.

"We always were hanging out, going on trips, like, just hanging out, being friends," Rain said. "So we had this idea, 'Why don't we just all move into a house together and all work together?' And that's exactly what happened.

"We all are there to help support each other. We're all there to help each other grow."

She added, "I honestly was a little nervous about it… moving into a house with eight girls was going to be tough, but it's so much fun. We're all there to just support each other, and we've built a community where our collaboration fuels our success."

When it comes to her critics, Rain takes a different approach than many to handling disapproval.

"I listen and I take in their criticism, and sometimes I don't believe it, but I'll just sit there and listen to them because it's nice to have someone to talk to and hear another view on what I'm doing, so I can work on being better," she said. "A lot of times it is good information, but if I don't think that I need that information, I'm going to sit there and listen to them anyway."

Rain added, "That's a lot of where the morals come back in to play. Like you have to stay true to yourself. And as long as you have that security, you're going to be good in this industry and you're going to be successful."

Bollywood diva Malaika Arora, known for her sizzling glamour and presence in over 30 films, has recently opened up about a surprising incident that took place on a dance reality show she was judging. While Malaika is a regular on TV as a judge on dancing competitions, she revealed a startling experience where a 16-year-old contestant crossed the line with his behavior, leaving her furious.

In an interview with ANI, Malaika recalled the moment when the young contestant began winking at her and blowing flying kisses during his performance. While she didn't initially plan to confront him, Malaika couldn't hold back her frustration. “I wasn't planning to scold him or tell him that what he was doing was wrong. But I told him, ‘You are doing a little too much. There's no need for all this.'” She emphasised that the moment felt inappropriate, even though playful gestures like winking or a kiss might be common in performances.

However, it wasn't just a scolding—Malaika's response took a more serious turn. “I asked him to give me his mother's number,” she said. This shocking reaction was rooted in the need to address inappropriate behavior, especially from a teenager on a professional platform.

Despite the intense confrontation, Malaika didn't hold a grudge against the contestant. She praised his dancing skills afterward, calling him a "lovely kid" and acknowledging his exceptional performance. "He did a great job with his dance," Malaika shared, highlighting that even after the disciplinary moment, the contestant deserved recognition for his talent.



Malaika's candidness about the incident sheds light on the challenges judges face in maintaining professionalism while also fostering creativity.

Is Rachel Zegler going Sharks vs. Jets with her costar?

The "Snow White" star recently reflected on the impact the Disney project had on her life and, over the course of multiple social media posts, praised the film's cast and crew for their hard work. However, the 23-year-old's glaring omission of costar Gal Gadot has fueled ongoing speculation of a feud between the actresses.

“This movie was a life-changing experience that has held about four years of my career,” Zegler wrote in a March 20 Instagram post alongside behind-the-scenes photos of the cast and crew on set. “I became a real adult during the course of this film—learned hard lessons, did hard things, laughed, cried, turned 21, lived across the ocean from my family, made new friends, and completely fell in love with this group of people I got to work with for three magical summers.”

She continued, “We had the greatest crew in the world on this movie. It cannot be overstated. This photo dump doesn't even dig into the fun, the magic, and the love that was shared throughout this process. But it's a start.”

In addition to no pictures or references of Gadot in the first heartfelt post, the "West Side Story" actress did not include her costar in a second tribute to her “daily magicians” from “both in front of and behind” the film's camera.

“It takes a village to bring stories like Snow White to the big screen and I loved this one so very much,” Zegler wrote in her second March 21 Instagram post. “Here's a little glimpse into this family I came to care for deeply.”

Following the posts, fans wondered whether Gadot's absence was intentional, with one X (formerly Twitter) user writing in a translated post, “Disney is having a hard time trying to debunk the Rachel Zegler-Gal Gadot feud because Rachel posted 19 photos on Instagram thanking her co-stars for helping her grow during the 4-year process, but she didn't mention or post any photos of Gal.” 

Though Zegler and Gadot have not commented publicly on the rumored feud, they presented together at the Oscars March 2 and both attended the Los Angeles premiere of the Disney remake on March 15. At a separate screening, Zegler also gushed about the film and shared her love for the cast and crew.

"This is a movie that is so close to my heart,” she said in a March 17 Instagram video shared by Disney. “I auditioned for this movie when I was 19 years old and I am about to turn 24. So it's a really big chunk of my life, and about five of the seven years of my career, which is crazy.”

She added, “I love everybody in this movie so dearly."

Jonathan Majors is addressing the leaked audio footage where he allegedly admitted to physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari.  

The 35-year-old actor spoke about the situation in a new interview. 

“I was so grateful that I had done my work, and am continuing to do my work. I can't speak to it, but obviously, because you're talking about it, there are vibrations, reverberations, same as everything before," he told Complex. 

"I'm living life. I'm surrounded by loved ones and family," he added.

On Monday (March 17), audio footage was leaked of a conversation reportedly between Jonathan and Grace, where he allegedly admitted to physically abusing her. 

“I'm ashamed I've ever...I've never [been] aggressive with a woman before. I've never aggressed a woman — I aggressed you,” Jonathan allegedly said in the clip, per Rolling Stone. 

“You strangled me and pushed me against the car,” Grace said. 

“Yes, all those things are under ‘aggressed,' yeah.” Jonathan responded.

Jonathan was first arrested in March 2023 after an alleged domestic dispute against Grace. He was found guilty of third degree assault and guilty of harassment in December 2023.

Shortly before the audio leaked, Jonathan and actress Meagan Good got married in a private ceremony.

Adolescence has been the #1 television series on Netflix for the past week and fans are surprised to find out that Brad Pitt has a role on the show!

No, you won't catch the Oscar winner on screen, but Brad was heavily involved in the behind-the-scenes process to bring the show to life.

Keep reading to find out more...

Brad is one of the show's executive producers as his production company Plan B helped put the show together.

Director Philip Barantini has opened up about Brad's involvement with the series. He told Radio Times, "Brad was on the phone with us and he was so enthusiastic." 

Brad's first Oscar win was actually for a movie that he wasn't in. He won Best Picture in 2014 for producing 12 Years a Slave. 

Brad has produced dozens of movies and shows he didn't appear in, including Mickey 17, Nickel Boys, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Blonde, and Vice, as well as shows 3 Body Problem, Outer Range, and The OA.

The "Deal or No Deal Island" finale and a new Jonas Brothers single round out our picks for the weekend of March 21.

 I was never that into The Real World, but Road Rules was my jam. And as reality competition shows exploded with Survivor, Big Brother, and Amazing Race, I was glued to my screen. For a decade, I've hosted friends every Wednesday for "Winesday" and whichever of those three CBS shows are currently airing. Even if you're not a reality fan like me (but especially if you are), I encourage you to check out our Reality Rewind Issue. Spearheaded by TV executive editor Samantha Highfill and brilliantly designed by art director Alex Sandoval, the issue breaks down the 25 best reality stars of the 2000s, looks back at the legacy of shows including The Swan, and game-changers such as Big Brother 3's Danielle Reyes. Were your favorite Y2K reality stars included? Go find out. —Patrick Gomez, Editor-in-Chief

Erin Simkin/Netflix

 Uzo Aduba plays Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant and eccentric detective tasked with investigating the murder of a White House employee (played by Giancarlo Esposito) in Paul William Davies' new Netflix comedic whodunnit from Shondaland. Everyone is a suspect — all 157 members of staff and guests at a state dinner for Australian dignitaries, where the murder mystery occurs — as Cordelia investigates the upstairs, downstairs, and secret backstairs of Washington, D.C.'s most famous mansion. Susan Kelechi Watson, Randall Park, Ken Marino, and Kylie Minogue (yes, Kylie Minogue!) also star. —Jessica Wang, Staff Writer

Roadside Attractions 

 Writer-director Tracie Laymon's real-life friendship inspires this sweet film about two strangers (Barbie Ferreira and John Leguizamo) who meet by mistake when a young woman looks for her dad on the internet. A quiet, moving film about the need for human connection. —Yolanda Machado, Staff Editor


 John Leguizamo reflects on Bob Trevino and the 'brave' move by Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes to star in To Wong Foo


Monty Brinton/NBC

 Host Joe Manganiello tells EW the March 25 finale will be "mind-blowing, riveting TV," and we believe him. We were on set in Panama during filming and concur with his assessment that "people are going to be talking about it immediately after." Catch up on Peacock before the finale airs on NBC. —Dalton Ross, Editorial Director

Julieta Cervantes

 Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Ripley fame brings his one-man band take on Chekhov's Uncle Vanya to the cozy confines of the Lucille Lortel Theatre in NYC for an intense, tour de force performance. The actor skillfully plays nine different roles using props, tone, and mannerisms to differentiate the characters, with the compact setting making the action feel all the more intimate. —D.R.


Jonas Brothers/Instagram

 The Jonas Brothers definitely get better every time. After kicking off 2025 with collaborations featuring Marshmello and Rascal Flatts, the trio is returning to their pop roots. This addicting new single sets the tone for what the brothers say "will be a year of music," as they gear up to celebrate their 20th band anniversary with a variety of releases including Joe Jonas' solo album, a live concert album, and soundtrack for their upcoming Christmas movie. —Briana Edwards, Social Media Editor
