Energy secretary Ed Miliband has ordered the National Energy System Operator to “urgently investigate” the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday. “That is why, working with Ofgem, I have today commissioned the National Energy System Operator to carry out an investigation into this specific incident and to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) is expected to report to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and Ofgem with initial findings within six weeks. A blaze knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes the previous evening. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today. “We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.

Elon Musk's evening all-hand meeting at Tesla shows that he can afford more than other CEOs. And maybe in a unique way is free of the norms that other bosses adhere to. Even though he has convinced his employees over the years to work in tents and sleep in the office, his scope is not unlimited to employees, investors and customers, said Musk observer to Business Insider. "There is no version in which he does so many things at once and is going well," Wil Schroter, founder and CEO from Startups.com, a tech accelerator, told BI. He pointed out the sheer number of points on Musk to-do list-from control over half a dozen companies, including Tesla, X and SpaceX, to attempt to redesign the federal government. Musk's decision to hold a company -wide meeting at 9 p.m. in Austin without notice - although technical problems continued to delay the beginning - sends several negative signals. It is one thing to get over some corporate standards in the initial phase of a company. But Musk has long been behind this honeymoon, says Schilling. "His actions now affect too many people to get through with this behavior," she said. Schroter said that Musk is often preferred in case of doubt, but if he were confronted with a larger crisis, such as a drastic decline in Tesla shares compared to their high in December (they fell by about 50 percent), the musk supporters would be less forgiving. It is not the first time that Musk stands out with his attitude towards work. Tesla had recently suffered from vandalism from his vehicles and in his exhibition rooms, which he attributed to the political left, and a decline in shares. One reason that Musk can pull through an evening session at the last minute is that most people expect him to be "a bit chaotic". "This is a person who smoked in the Joe Rogan Show Dope," she said to BI. She said that the meeting could have sent a message to the employees instead, that Musk is still aware of and takes care of his companies. However, according to Clark, this will probably not be enough to further raise the mood among the employees and investors if he does not show through further measures that he is facing the challenges at Tesla. "It is different when you stand in front of people, even if it is over zoom where they see that you speak, see how to move," said Schroter. It is a way to show that you share your worries. Nevertheless, according to Schroter, the question of how many managers can demand from their employees often depend on how much they are willing to "follow them through a fire" He said that at Musk, as with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the loyalty of employees is often so great that they endeavor to meet high expectations, including long working hours. Schroter said Musk's track record showed that he usually has the front, but that "99.9 percent of CEOs" did not have the luxury to ask for as much as he was. "Most founders or CEOs don't even have this kind of attraction."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

During her time at Disney, she was homeless and slept in an employee car park. A second job at the Universal Orlando Resort finally helped her to make ends meet. From 2010 to 2014, Cody worked as an actress in Walt Disney World and performed as Lady Tremaine, Pluto and other figures. She also worked as an actress and dancer at the Universal Orlando Resort from 2010 to 2013. The following text was revised for reasons of length and clarity. But at some point Disney covered the number of working hours. At this point I could no longer pay rent. So I lived in my 2005 Chevy Malibu, which I parked on the West Clock, the parking lot for Magic Kingdom employees. I slept there for months and showered in the changing room every day to get more hours. It was an amusement park that brought me into this situation, but it was also an amusement park that helped me get out of this situation. In November 2010 I was employed as an actor and dancer at Universal. My first role there was for "Grinchmas", a Christmas event in the theme park. Universal paid me $ 15 an hour, which, together with my Disney hours, helped me to finally rent an apartment with two other people and enable me to have the basic needs. I would not want to exchange my time at Disney for anything. I no longer work on Disney or Universal. Disney has made some positive changes with programs to support employees in recent years. But in my opinion this is still not a existential wage when it comes to Orlando. There is no reason why an employee of the staff is dependent on food brands or that the basic needs cannot afford. This place would not be open without the committed and great people who work there and work out to give families. The company offers employee packages with additional services. In 2022, Walt Disney World Resort announced that it will build affordable apartments with over 1,000 apartments for employees and the community in Orange County, Florida.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

JT McCallen found a new job five months after his release last year. He added that it helped his mental health and bank account to stay social and to have a secondary employment. This essay is based on a conversation with JT McCallen, a 37-year-old account manager who lives in the US state of Tennessee. The following text was revised for reasons of length and clarity. I was told that I would receive a three-month severance payment, but there was no indication of the outplacement services that I knew that they were sometimes offered by companies and offer access to various resources for work search. I would have access to a service for about three months. Before discharge, my search was generally to search job exchanges such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Monster to search and to set up notifications for the types of places in which I was interested. First I turned to all recruiters with whom I had previously been in contact, and agreed a 30-minute phone call in which I was able to exchange ideas about possible job offers and their view of the setting situation. They also said that I should take care of job advertisements, do not actively hire the companies, but to publish it in part to give the impression that they would hire. A job advertisement can look good, but it may not be really real. The conclusion: my job search may not be easy. My career coach helped me to find the right way Can you get in touch with the HR manager?" With three or four jobs I came to the second round of introductions and in two of them in the final round. In January I started my new position as a key account manager at a company that works in the same industry as my previous employer. The task is somewhat more customer -oriented than my old, but many of the knowledge and experience from my previous job were transferable. My new job is not quite as well paid as my old one, but it is in the salary span that I imagined. I would also recommend that people think about how they can make some money while looking for work. Shortly after my release, I was stopped by a company that cleans swimming pools and the water chemistry was waiting: I already had some experience with this work because I managed my pool at home. I worked between 20 and 35 hours a week, and although the hourly wage of $ 20 (18.40 euros) was far below what I was used to, I was able to avoid that my savings were attacked. My wife works full -time, which gave me an additional source of income. Finally, I recommend that you take care of your mental health. I tried to eat at lunch at least once a month with a few people with whom I used to work.

Heathrow ‘open and fully operational’ after disruption caused by power outage Heathrow Airport said it is “open and fully operational” on Saturday after the airport was shut over a loss of power caused by a substation fire. The statement, posted to X, says: “Flights have resumed at Heathrow following yesterday’s power outage. “We apologise for the disruption and appreciate your patience whilst operations return to normal.” A further statement from Heathrow said the airport was “open and fully operational”. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today. “We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport. Firefighters and workers were still at the electricity substation on Saturday morning. “But American Airlines did a fabulous job – we didn’t have to wait in the line or anything. “In fact, they had several planes leaving within an hour of each other to Heathrow. The way everybody responded and fell into action, it was fantastic.” The airline would usually expect to run nearly 600 departures and arrivals on Saturday but it is understood cancellations will be made, where possible, to high-frequency routes. “We expect around 85 per cent of our Saturday Heathrow schedule to run, but it is likely that all travelling customers will experience delays as we continue to navigate the challenges posed by Friday’s power outage at the airport.” Restrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, the Department of Transport (DfT) said. Of the power outage, Heathrow Airport’s chief executive Thomas Woldbye said a back-up transformer failed, meaning systems had to be closed down in accordance with safety procedures so that power supplies could be restructured from two remaining substations to restore enough electricity to power what is described as a “mid-sized city”. After announcing early on Friday it would be closed until 11.59pm, Heathrow later reopened with a focus on repatriation flights for passengers diverted to other airports in Europe. Around 200,000 passengers have been affected by the closure of what is Europe’s busiest airport. “After initial assessment, we are not treating this incident as suspicious, although inquiries do remain ongoing,” Commander Simon Messinger said. Heathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9m passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024. This is believed to be the worst disruption at Heathrow since December 2010, when thousands of Christmas getaway passengers camped in the terminals because of widespread cancellations caused by snow.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

No10 said “thousands” of personnel would be required to support any operation whether by “sea, on land or in the air” as allies prepare “for all eventualities” amid diplomatic efforts to end the war. Sir Keir Starmer said new military sub-planning groups would continue talks during “three intensive planning days” next week, in a call with EU chiefs and non-EU countries on Friday. It comes after Sir Keir warned Vladimir Putin would face “severe consequences” for breaching any truce as he met defence planners for the first stage of talks at the UK’s Northwood military headquarters on Thursday. “But clearly thousands of troops will be required to support any deployment, whether that is at sea, on land or in the air.” “Next week, we’ll continue to accelerate the pace and scale of operational planning with further meetings at our Northwood headquarters as we look forward more closely at the details and structure of any future force.” Moscow agreed to pause attacks on Ukrainian power plants after a phone call between Putin and US president Donald Trump, but Kyiv has said civilian targets including hospitals have since been struck. Zelensky has said he is hopeful a “lasting peace can be achieved this year” after he spoke on the phone with Trump on Tuesday, but appeared to contradict a suggestion that Washington could take ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security. Speaking on Friday at a White House press briefing, Trump said he believed “we’re going to pretty soon have a full ceasefire” and “the contracts in terms of dividing up the lands et cetera, et cetera, it’s being negotiated as we speak”.

The Chancellor has ruled out “tax and spend” policies ahead of her spring statement next week. Rachel Reeves is under pressure to increase taxes or cut spending to meet the financial rules she set at the budget in October amid disappointing growth figures and higher-than-expected borrowing. Figures released on Friday came as a further blow, showing that government borrowing had soared past forecasts in February. The defence budget has already been boosted by slashing spending on aid, and sweeping cuts to welfare were announced this week. When she delivers her spring statement on Wednesday, Reeves will be responding to new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) made after the Bank of England reduced its forecasts for growth this year. Public sector net borrowing was £10.7bn in February, £4.2bn more than had been forecast by the OBR.

Nvidia's new Blackwell GPUS mean that the older Hopper models are less useful, which affects cloud giants. Amazon is a leader in adapting the service life of servers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a joke this week, which its largest customers will probably not find funny. "I have already said that Hoppers cannot be given away if Blackwell is delivered in large quantities," he said on Tuesday at the Nvidia big AI conference. "There are circumstances under which Hopper is okay," he added. He spoke about Nvidia's latest AI chip and server package, Blackwell. Large cloud companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google buy a lot of these GPU systems to train and carry out the huge models that drive the generative AI revolution. "I have already said that Hoppers cannot be given away if Blackwell is delivered in large quantities," he said on Tuesday at the Nvidia big AI conference.

Large cloud companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google buy a lot of these GPU systems to train and carry out the huge models that drive the generative AI revolution. "As a result, we shorten the service life for some of our servers and network devices from six to five years from January 2025," said Olsavsky, adding that this will reduce operating income this year by about $ 700 million (around $ 640 million). Sandler, the analyst of Barclays, added a striking graphic to his Research Note on Friday. It shows the cost of renting H100 GPUs that Nvidia's older Hopper architecture use. "This could be a much bigger problem with Meta, Google and other margin -strong software companies," wrote Sandler. For Meta, he estimated that a shortening of the company's useful life by one year would increase depreciation in 2026 by more than $ 5 billion (4.5 billion euros) and that the operating result would reduce a similar amount. An important reservation: just because a large cloud provider has already made such an adjustment does not mean that the others have to do the same. Some companies could design their AI calculus centers differently, so that the NVIDIA GPU systems last longer or are less likely to be outdated. "All of these Nvidia GPUs have to be accommodated somewhere. An analyst of amber, Mark Shmulik, discussed this with my colleague Eugene Kim. "I could imagine that the tech companies keep an eye on the useful life of the GPUs, but I would not expect anyone to change his depreciation time plans now," he wrote in an email to BI.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/tesla-5-kernpunkte-von-musks-spontaner-mitarbeiter-versammlung/'>Tesla: 5 key points from Musk's spontaneous employee meeting</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 08:46:46 <p>
Elon Musk held a meeting with all Tesla employees at the last minute on Thursday evening. The meeting took place after Musk had been criticized by investors that he was not concentrating enough on Tesla. The short -term meeting was transferred to X by livestream. Tesla usually holds his company meetings during regular working hours.

In this case, your consent also includes the transmission of certain personal data into third countries, including the USA in accordance with Art 49 Para. Here are the five most important findings from Tesla's all-hand meeting. "It is very difficult for people on the stock exchange- especially for those who look into the rearview mirror what most people are- to imagine a future in which a fleet of 10 million vehicles suddenly has five to ten times use," said Musk to the employees. The Tesla exhibition rooms were hit by vandalism and protests nationwide. "If you read the news, it feels like an Armageddon. I can't walk past the television without seeing a burning Tesla. The company's share price has fallen over 50 percent since its record high in mid -December. According to Musk, autonomous driving will release the true value of Tesla. But in the future it will pay off. And some people like Cathie Wood Invest see the future," said Musk on Thursday. ARK Invest had set a price target of $ 2,600 (2390 euros) for the Tesla share in June. "What I want to say is: 'Hold on your shares'," added Musk. Musk wants Tesla's company team to focus on the cybercab line Musk said that the production process for the cybercab was not like a "normal car manufacturing street", but similar to a "high -speed line for consumer electronics" "The line will move so quickly that people can't even get around. I think it will be able to produce a car in less than five seconds," added Musk. "Let's see where the boundaries of physics lie, how big a watering machine can be. During this presentation, Musk said that the Cybercab would go into production before 2027. During a conference conference on the Tesla results in October, Musk told investors that the cybercab would cost "about $ 25,000". "We are striving for at least 2 million units of the cybercab per year. This will happen in more than one factory, but I think there are at least 2 million units a year, maybe even 4 million," said Musk at the time and added that the numbers were his "best estimates". Musk said he expects Tesla to start his production of Optimus robots this year. "This year we will hopefully be able to produce about 5,000 optimus robots," Musk said when asked by an employee when the robots will be available to the public. "But since it is a completely new product. But even 5,000 robots, that is the size of a Roman legion," said Musk. "I think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year," he added. "Because if you have a sensitive humanoid robot that is able to find your way around in reality and to do tasks on request, there is no sensible limit for the size of the economy," Musk told investors. Some Tesla investors have criticized Musk's political engagement and claims that it contains the company. "This is bad," wrote Ives, adding that Musk "had to step back and to balance his Doge and Tesla CEO roles". Last week Ross Gerber, a long-time Tesla investor, told BI, he did not expect the Tesla share to recover this year. Musk has freaked Tesla's customers with his political activities and positions, says Gerber. Musk told his employees on Thursday that he was "quite drained" after an employee asked him if he wanted to produce other products such as planes or trains. I just go to sleep, work, go to sleep, work and do it seven days a week," said Musk. In addition, there is his commitment to the White House office (Doge), where he works for the reduction in government spending. In an interview with the FOX Business moderator Larry Kudlow, which was broadcast on March 10, Musk said that he could "only" bring his political and business work under one roof Representatives of Tesla did not respond to a request from BI.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This question in the interview is a warning signal, says Kristine Capek. According to the personnel consultant Kristine Capek, the key to a successful job interview in competence -based questions, which enable a precise assessment. Instead of pushing the applicants into a sales situation, companies should specifically ask about their motivation - for example: "Why did you apply for this position?" She gives career tips on Tikkok as a "dieheadhunter". In an interview with Business Insider, she explains what really matters in a successful interview - and what questions should be deterrent. According to Kristine Capek, an ideal interview always starts with small talk. This creates a pleasant atmosphere and relaxes the situation. This is followed by a brief introduction to the company and Hiring management. Also read 6 psychological tricks to look more likeable in an interview As an applicant, your self -presentation should take between five and ten minutes. Reading I also had over 1000 interviews - this one question should always ask applicants However, this is not surprising that many companies vote for the first question to applicants very openly. You would say, for example: "Tell something about yourself." Instead, companies should target the interview and ask more specific questions. Applicants could specifically explain how they have already used this competence. As an applicant, on the other hand, you should not only worship past positions. Focus on the skills and strengths you have developed in previous roles and what added value you could offer in your potentially new role. This question is a red flag in an interview: "Why should we hire you?" This question is often asked from above, with the unspoken message: convince us first. Reading you also ask no questions in the interview? Why this is a mistake according to HR and which you should at least make Unlike the other question, it is not about how well someone can sell. This is how you react confidently to problematic questions in the interview In one of her Tikok videos, Capek says: "If you as an applicant are asked, why you should be set, then pack your things together and take a tear." But if that is too dramatic for you, for example, you can answer instead: "I was invited because my qualifications fit the position. Then you could play the ball back and ask your interlocutors whether it is covered with all skills relevant to the position or whether they would like to talk about further qualifications. "This remains the conversation professionally and at eye level," concludes Capek. In this article, Capek will help you with your decision:</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The cruise industry is booming - especially in Germany. We present you which positions on the ships of the largest European cruise brands are currently free: AIDA, Costa Crociere, MSC and TUI Cruises. As many Germans like never before set sail: Almost three million tourists spent their vacation on cruise ships in 2023. Only American passengers travel more often over the world's oceans, as the Clia industry association writes in its report 2024. If you dream of a season job or even an international career on the high seas, you have a good chance. The salary teams are based on information from current and former employees that they have given on job platforms such as Kununu and Glassdoor, and are therefore not necessarily representative. AIDA, TUI Cruises and MSC did not want to provide any concrete information; A response from Costa Crociere has so far been pending. It is important to know that the salary information at Kununu and Glassdoor are based on the number of users and their personal information, these are more direction values. Deviations to the salaries actually paid are of course possible. In addition, some companies also pay bonuses or extra grants, for example with personal target agreements. AIDA is looking for temporary workers, beginners and professionals AIDA Cruises currently employs around 18,000 employees on land and sea as a market leader in the German boom industry. 16,500 of them work on the eleven AIDA cruise ships. In her online career portal, AIDA currently says 34 (mostly temporary) jobs on board. Almost a dozen only apply to the area of ​​gastronomy. The employer always requires good knowledge of English, but not mandatory training for jobs at the bar or as a service. As a manager Accounting and Administration, you take care of the bookkeeping and financial processes of the hotel company. On average, AIDA pays its administrative employees between 28,700 and 39,000 euros, according to Kununu. According to Glassdoor, receptionists, who also sets AIDA, can count on an annual salary between 20,400 and 24,000 euros. Further vacancies at AIDA are advertised in the areas of fitness training, cosmetics, hairdresser and spa management. The annual salary span of the positions in this area puts between 20,900 and 55,000 euros, depending on qualifications and responsibility. Reading I also did work on a cruise ship - these things bothered me while working AIDA is particularly looking for creative reinforcements in the areas of art, entertainment and media: as a DJ in the brewery restaurant, video editor. According to Glassdoor, the annual salary is between around 24,000 euros for DJs up to around 55,000 euros for gallerists. Dual students can also start their career at the brand with the famous kissing mouth: Anyone who completes academic training in nautics, ship operating or electrical engineering can hire as an intern. AIDA not only promises benefits such as use of the guest areas, but also a takeover after the university degree. "We offer our crew an attractive remuneration with many other benefits. Our employees receive in addition to their wages," the company answers when asked about a BI. In addition, the company has agreed with employee representatives about the employment conditions on board, working time regulations and salary systems. The same applies to direct competition, TUI Cruises from Hamburg. The eight open, mostly temporary positions in the career portal only describe positions as officers and for medical staff. According to only two Kununu information, health and nurses at TUI Cruises earn around 35,100 to 39,600 annually, nautical officers between 44,700 and 71,200 euros. Anyone who completes an apprenticeship - such a nautical officer assistance is advertised - according to the portal, 9400 to 13,600 euros a year. Tui Cruises commissioned concessionaires for hotel and wellness on board. It is very surprising that Sea Chefs 89 occupies a wide range of positions for the Mein Schiff fleet. The TUI-Business partner almost always requires knowledge of English. The employer demands relevant training for qualified bodies. There is a comparably low minimum wage of 750 euros per month. Tui Cruises also works with service providers elsewhere. Cruise Vision, for example, employs a freelance basis of film and photo teams who hold the holiday moments of passengers on board and on land. There are currently 85 jobs open: from service to technology, from fire brigade operations to the specialist for meat products. Here you also register for an application, upload your resume and run a knowledge test in the next step before you are invited to the job interview. According to its own sustainability report, 2022 is looking for MSC Cruises worldwide. In the service sector, MSC requires about several years of work experience in the upscale gastronomy or hotel industry. According to the website, experience is primarily important for craft work. How many German employees can earn on board does not arise from the job advertisements or data from Glassdoor or Kununu. In 2022, their ten ships at that time brought over one and a half million passengers to 139 ports, according to the latest sustainability report. If you want to work here, you need a school leaving certificate, relevant training, economic degrees or, depending on the respective bodies, several months of work experience. These service employees are supported by German-speaking guests as contacts on the high seas. Glassdoor only occurs isolated salary information from Costa employees who-similar to the salaries specified above-have rarely been repeated. Those who hire on a cruise ship ultimately take up long working hours and a life far from their own family. After all: Most jobs are limited to months and the entry and exit into the industry are always possible with their expected growing personnel requirements.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

CitizenM breaks every Paris hotel rule – here’s why I love it CitizenM Gare de Lyon breaks every Paris hotel rule, but it’s one of the most memorable stays in the city, writes Anna Moloney When thinking of Paris, CitizenM Gare de Lyon, a hulking grey block tower that protrudes over the Seine, is not likely the image that comes to mind. After all, swirled balconies on pretty white town houses are ten a penny in Paris. From here you’ll be assigned a room, printed a key and sent on your way by the elusive, faceless voice of ‘CitizenM’, who authors all communication in the hotel. There’s no concierge falling over themselves to assist you, but the lobby is sociable and inviting, with sofas and coffee tables; useful for getting some work done if needed. Its vibe is a bit ‘luxury communism’, and I was into it. Every room at CitizenM is exactly the same – that’s anywhere around the world – which means a happy farewell to choice fatigue. As mentioned, this isn’t a destination hotel, and that’s by design. CitizenM co-founder Michael Levie said he felt the days where people would travel to be inspired by hotels themselves were long gone. After all, you’ve got the whole of Paris to explore. Cosy yet utilitarian: big squishy beds, blackout blinds, a waterfall shower plus an iPad to control the lights and temperature. The iPad also allows you to programme an alarm, which coordinates your lights, blinds and music for a main character wakeup. Steal a croissant from the breakfast buffet and head for a scenic stroll at the Coulee Verte, aka the Promenade Plantee, a former railway line turned garden walk which inspired New York’s High Line. I was staying in Paris alone and ducked into the historic Le Caveau de la Huchette, a sexy, sweaty underground jazz bar featured in films from Funny Face to La La Land, which is great for both dancing and people watching. Strolling back by the moonlit river, I felt more than sufficiently dosed up on Parisian romance to climb happily back into my spaceman cave.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

MLB has a plan to get them to root for every team</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnbc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 00:00:00 <p>
Shohei Ohtani #17 of the Los Angeles Dodgers waves to fans while leaving the field after the MLB Tokyo Opening Series between Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs at Tokyo Dome on March 19, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. On the morning of the second and final game of Major League Baseball's Tokyo Series between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 19, a dusting of snow fell on Japan's capital city — an extremely rare occurrence for a time of year more known for cherry blossom blooms. But that didn't dissuade more than a thousand people from lining up to shop at the 31,100-square-foot Fanatics-operated MLB store outside the Tokyo Dome when it opened that morning. That is a reflection of the type of impact that Shohei Ohtani is having on MLB's business in Japan, an impact that has only grown in size since he signed a then-professional sports record 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023, following that up with MLB's first-ever 50 home run and 50 steal season, in addition to winning both the National League MVP and a World Series title. Last year, Fanatics, which operates the MLB's merchandise business globally, saw a 170% increase in MLB merchandise sales year-over-year in Japan, according to Nori Kawana, East Asia managing director for Fanatics. In the past five years, Ohtani-related merchandise has accounted for 57% of all MLB sales in MLB Store Japan and Fanatics Japan, while Dodgers merchandise sales are up more than 2,000% year-over-year since he signed with the team, Kawana said. MLB also has had a long connection to the country, dating back to barnstorming games that saw players like Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig play in exhibition games in Japan to the now deeper relationship between MLB and Nippon Professional Baseball. Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner of business and media, said Japan is by far the league's largest commercial market outside of the U.S. and Canada, something he attributes to those long-term investments. However, he added: "And then you've got this-once-in-a-lifetime talent." The first game of this year's Tokyo Series was watched by 25 million viewers in Japan, according to MLB, setting a new record for the most-watched game in the country — Japan's population is roughly 125 million. MLB plans to feed that growing fanbase in Japan with content. "When the next set of deals are up, you're going to find people that are looking for worldwide rights, especially the streamers," Garden said. That also carries over to sponsorships, Garden said, with American companies seeing an opportunity to further break into the Japanese market while Japanese companies are able to not only do things with MLB now locally but reach U.S. consumers as well. "We're benefitting from all that kind of converging at the same time," Garden said. Sales at the store at the Tokyo Dome surpassed every MLB All-Star Week ever, selling more than half a million products. Justin Turner #3 of the Chicago Cubs poses with young fans who wear fake beard prior to the game against Yomiuri Giants at Tokyo Dome on March 16, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. That growth will only continue as Ohtani, alongside other Japanese-born players like the Dodgers' Roki Sasaki and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and the Cubs' Shota Imanaga and Seiya Suzuki, continue to make an impact in MLB. David Leiner, president of trading cards for Fanatics Collectibles, where he oversees Topps, said that the fandom around baseball in Japan is undeniable, with plenty of support not only for the Japanese MLB stars but the local NPB teams as well. Japanese baseball card collectors aren't very different from American ones, Leiner said, but one of the significant differences is how much they look to support players from their country. Of course, but they lean a little more towards the Japanese players in MLB, and there's a lot of pride in that," he said. Leiner said that does lead to the fandom of teams that Japanese players played on, and that does stick over time — for example, there is a contingent of Seattle Mariners fans in Japan due to Ichiro Suzuki's time with the team. But there are other examples of it being a fleeting phenomenon, as Japanese fans flocked to one player and then stopped following as closely when that player left MLB. Kawana, who is based in Tokyo, said that while Japanese fans have historically been player-fandom focused, he is now seeing a growth in team fandom especially as it has become easier to follow those teams. Having MLB teams on the ground hasn't hurt either. Before this year, the last time MLB played official games in Japan was in 2019, and Garden said that the league is hoping that when it agrees to its new CBA, set to expire in 2026, it will come with "an even bigger [international] plan."

George Foreman, world heavyweight boxing champion and Olympic gold medalist who later became an entrepreneur known for the indoor grills that bore his name, died Friday at 76. "Our hearts are broken," an announcement on Foreman's Instagram page read. "With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones," it read. A cause of death was not provided. Foreman, known as "Big George," won an Olympic gold medal in boxing at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City when he was 19 years old. At 45, Foreman reclaimed the heavyweight title in 1994 when he beat Michael Moorer — a comeback that made him the oldest boxer to win the championship. Foreman retired from boxing in 1977 and became a born-again Christian. Foreman returned to boxing in 1987, a decade after he retired. He was also known as an entrepreneur for the "George Foreman Grill" — officially called the George Foreman Lean Mean Grilling Machine. More than 100 million were sold worldwide, according to Foreman's website, and he became a fixture on television programs promoting the device in an apron.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A rose and and an image of Pope Francis are placed at the statue of late Pope John Paul II outside Gemelli Hospital, where Pope Francis is admitted for treatment, in Rome, Italy, Feb. 27, 2025. Addressing reporters outside the hospital in Rome on Saturday, the pope's doctors acknowledged that his condition had been "life threatening" on two occasions, but confirmed he has remained stable for at least two weeks. "We have prepared to welcome him home," Dr. Luigi Carbone said. His doctors added that he will be under a "protected discharge," which will require ongoing medications, oxygen assistance as needed and a period of rest "for at least two months." "Immediately, he won't be able to continue his work activity of meeting groups of people or important work, that he will likely be able to do once he has finished the period of convalescence prescribed and the clinical improvements are verified," Dr. Sergio Alfieri said. Carbone added: "The Holy Father is improving, so let's hope that soon he will be able to continue his normal activity." However, he has remained out of the public eye for weeks. Despite his health battles, the Vatican made no indications that the pope would resign, unlike his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 in a move that prompted global outrage. Francis' hospitalization in recent weeks was not his first time battling serious ailments. Francis has been leader of the Catholic Church's more than 1 billion members since 2013.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

London's Heathrow Airport reopened Saturday but travelers are being warned of significant delays as airlines scramble to resume flights and return stranded passengers. Europe's busiest airport was closed for most of Friday after a power outage following a fire at a nearby electrical substation, causing over 800 flights to be canceled in and out of the airport, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. "Flights have resumed at Heathrow following yesterday's power outage," the airport said on its website Saturday. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate your patience whilst operations return to normal." National Grid said Saturday that power supply had been restored to all customers, including Heathrow, allowing operations to resume. "We are now implementing measures to help further improve the resilience levels of our network," the utility company said in a statement. Airlines are rushing to resume flights and get thousands of stranded passengers to their final destinations. British Airways was the airline most affected by the incident, with over half of its Friday schedule canceled. It said it expects to run the majority of its Heathrow schedule on Saturday, but that customers should expect delays.

The store has creative merchandise displays, such as in its sneaker room. A piece of Paris has landed in New York City. French luxury retailer Printemps officially opened its first U.S. store this week in the city's Financial District. About 25% of its brands are either not available or rare in the U.S., such as the Joseph Duclos brand, a French luxury name that made a handbag sported by Taylor Swift, Printemps CEO Jean-Marc Bellaiche said. Its playful design is inspired by a Parisian apartment, and it is located at One Wall Street, a historic Art Deco skyscraper. The Art Deco-style room was decorated floor to ceiling with red and gold mosaics by master muralist Hildreth Meière and completed in 1931. The store also will include Maison Passerelle, a fine dining restaurant steered by Gregory Gourdet, a two-time Top Chef finalist and three-time James Beard award winner. Even some wealthier consumers have pulled back on discretionary purchases because of inflation and economic uncertainty. In China, a key market for higher-end goods, luxury spending has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. Global luxury spending across goods and services totaled an estimated $500 billion in 2024. Still, Brian Ehrig, one of the report's authors and a partner in Kearney's consumer practice, said the U.S. remains an attractive market for luxury brands because of consumers' resilience. "And then the other thing is, Americans love to shop." Ehrig added that other high-end retailers have doubled down on investments in large and eye-catching physical stores, too, such as LVMH -owned Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton opening new stores in New York City. He said the in-person experience is more critical in a sector where items come with such high price tags and expectations for personal service. "And there's just no way to do that online or on an iPhone." Other internationally based retailers with lower price points are expanding and opening more stores in the U.S., too, including Ireland-based Primark and Spain-based Mango. Yet, Americans are closing the gap, with sales to American customers tripling from 2019 and 2024, he said. Even with its luxury focus, Laura Lendrum, CEO of Printemps America, said the store mixes in more approachable items for tourists or aspirational shoppers who may stop by for a cup of coffee or browse for a $50 gift.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Palisades nuclear power plant in Covert, Michigan, Feb. 24, 2025. COVERT, Mich. — A nuclear power plant on the shores of Lake Michigan is aiming to make history this fall by becoming the first reactor in the U.S. to restart operations after shutting down to be eventually dismantled. The effort to restart the Palisades plant near South Haven, which shut down three years ago, is a precedent-setting event that could pave a path for other shuttered reactors to come back online. But Palisades needs major repairs to restart safely, highlighting the challenges the industry will face in bringing aging plants back to life. The plant permanently ceased operations in 2022, one of a dozen reactors to close in recent years as nuclear energy has struggled to compete against cheaper natural gas and renewables. But Holtec is facing major repairs to Palisades' aging steam generators that could delay a schedule the NRC has called demanding. Holtec has disclosed to regulators that its inspections have found damaged tubes in the plant's two generators, which were installed in 1990. Those tubes are crucial components that protect public health. Plant owners are required to demonstrate to the NRC that if a tube does fail, any radiological release beyond the plant's perimeter would remain below what the regulator describes as its "conservative limits." "The NRC is scared to death of steam generator tube ruptures. It's not a hypothetical," said Alan Blind, who served as engineering director at Palisades from 2006 to 2013 under previous plant owner Entergy. Palisades is currently in a safe condition, NRC spokesperson Scott Burnell said, as the steam generators are not in use because the plant is shut down and defueled. Holtec President Kelly Trice told CNBC the company has done a "complete characterization" of the generators and "they are fully repairable." NRC Branch Chief Steve Bloom warned Holtec during a Jan. 14 public meeting that the work required to review the plan will "add to a schedule that is already very aggressive." Holtec's inspections found more than 1,400 indications of corrosion cracking across more than 1,000 steam generator tubes at Palisades, according to a company filing with the NRC in October 2024. The tubes have not failed, Holtec CEO Krishna Singh told CNBC in February. Several had corrosion cracking with more than 70% penetration, according to the filing. Holtec said it is using a technique to repair the tubes called "sleeving" in which a higher quality alloy is inserted and expanded to seal the damage. "The techniques of repair which we're using, which is called sleeving, has been done in about 10 plants across the world and in some plants is done every outage, so this is not new, exotic technology," Trice said. "It is a common repair technique, and we expect it to be done on time and on schedule." Holtec's repair plan is scheduled to start this summer following inspection and testing, spokesperson Nick Culp told CNBC. But during the Jan. 14 meeting, NRC branch chief Bloom pushed back on Holtec's statements that the company's repair plan is following industry precedent. "Even though you're quote, unquote, following a precedent, it's not exactly, because it's a different material, different type of sleeving," Bloom said at the January meeting. The sleeve design that Holtec is proposing for the repairs has not been installed in steam generators before, though it has been used in other heat exchangers at nuclear plants, according to a company filing. The sleeves are made of an alloy that has not shown signs of cracking in U.S. or international plants, according to the filing. Entergy, however, did not replace them after purchasing Palisades. The utility found that purchasing new generators would make the plant economically unfeasible, said Blind, who was engineering director at Palisades during that time. Backed by the governor's office, Holtec first applied for federal support to restart Palisades two months after it closed. A steam generator tube rupture at the Indian Point nuclear plant — located 24 miles north of New York City in Westchester County, New York — demonstrates the potential risks such incidents pose to public health and the finances of utility companies. On Feb. 15, 2000, operators at Indian Point Unit 2 received a notification that a steam generator tube had failed, according to the NRC's report on the incident. The rupture resulted in "a minor radiological release to the environment that was well within regulatory limits," according to an NRC task force report.

Being indecisive is one of the most frustrating, unproductive behaviors you can engage in. It breeds doubt, uncertainty, and even resentment from people counting on you to make a call so they can move forward. When you let multiple options linger, it can sap everyone's energy and make them question your ability to get things done. I've studied mental strength for decades and, as I lay out in my book, "The Mentally Strong Leader," decision-making is an essential component, along with fortitude, confidence, boldness, and more. Here are five things you may be doing that signal indecision — and what to do instead. You can take much longer to decide than necessary because you're busy ruminating over the implications of making the wrong decision. DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money For example, let's say you can't decide if you should ask that friend of a friend out to dinner because you worry about getting rejected. Meanwhile, someone else takes initiative and just like that, your crush is in a relationship that doesn't involve you. Often, though, delaying and avoiding makes you feel like all options are still open even as the window closes on some opportunities. Considering the cost of not deciding — like missing out on the chance to get to know someone you're interested in — can spur you into making a great choice. Without a deadline, or with a deadline too far in the future, you can easily fall victim to Parkinson's Law, which says that work expands to fill the time allotted. In other words, you use the extra time you've given yourself to consider more decision inputs for longer than necessary. What to do instead Give yourself a deadline if there isn't one imposed on you already — erring toward sooner rather than later — and create consequences for missing it. And you don't give yourself too much time to overthink it. Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that confirms an existing belief or, in this case, a decision you want to make. For example, you need to cut a toxic person out of your life. But leadership — and mental strength — means being willing to make tough calls at times. Know that the goal is not to have 100% approval. Instead, strive to make choices that feel authentic and align with your values. You get overwhelmed and stuck rehashing the same information</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There's no single path rich people follow to obtain their wealth. Some are born with generational wealth that gives them a head start, while others work their way up through grit, determination and well-timed career decisions. But there are a few common habits among wealthy people, self-made millionaire, author and TV host Ramit Sethi wrote in a recent newsletter. "It's time to stop worshipping rich people — and start copying what they actually do," he wrote. Here are five rules Sethi said rich people live by and how you can use them to grow your own wealth. "You have to know your numbers," Sethi recently told CNBC Make It. "Shockingly, 50% of the couples I speak to do not know their own household income. But those factors are probably not making the difference between being able to retire and working full-time well into your golden years. Instead, focus on seven key questions, he wrote: How much money do I make? How much of my income do I spend on housing? Of course, knowing the answer to these questions and not making any adjustments won't get you far. "Rich people who are savvy with money can tell you how much they'll have next month, next year, and even five years from now," Sethi wrote. Don't rely solely on willpower to make smart money decisions. "Willpower is great ... until your kid throws a tantrum, you catch the flu, or your entire mood tanks because last night's 'Bachelor' episode sucked," Sethi wrote. Your savings, investments and bill payments can all be automated, so you don't even have to think about things like whether you can afford a vacation this year. Additionally, you can set money rules for yourself, like deciding that a certain percentage of every cash windfall gets invested and the rest can be used for fun. "Rich people don't gamble their financial success on how motivated they feel today," Sethi wrote. For better or worse, life is full of unexpected surprises. But what often sets rich people apart is that they have a plan for the future, Sethi said. They not only have a healthy emergency fund, but also have a solid understanding of what they want their lives to look like. "Most people don't know how much they should be saving or investing," Sethi wrote. "Build a system so your back is never against the wall." But on a personal level, it means instead of worrying about $3 questions, like the whether you should buy a latte or make coffee at home, focus on "$30,000 questions," like whether you can negotiate a raise or significantly lower your housing costs. "These questions are worth tens of thousands of dollars and yet we remain in the weeds and play small by asking the $3 questions," Sethi previously told CNBC Make It.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 4, 2022. The suit, filed on Jay Clayton's last day as SEC chair, accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through the sale of its XRP token without registering it as a security. Crypto companies and exchanges Coinbase , Kraken, Robinhood , Binance, and OpenSea all previously saw lawsuits or investigations dropped, resolved or put on hold. "Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back — and won on essential legal questions — throwing a major wrench into the SEC's plans to destroy crypto in the U.S. through enforcement," Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told CNBC in an emailed statement. "The SEC has now abandoned its appeal in our case. In a fitting irony, Ripple was the first major case they brought and will now be the last one they walk away from." XRP was created in 2012 as one of the first non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies. Like bitcoin, XRP can be bought and sold by retail investors. Ripple spent $150 million battling the government in a bruising legal standoff with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose approach to crypto was widely viewed as hostile. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is "not necessarily a security on its face," undercutting the foundation of the SEC's case.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"I was looking at other people's Instagrams and being like, 'How can they afford furniture?' We were just trying to buy stuff," Brannon, 33, tells CNBC Make It. The sales were like little windows into other people's worlds.

Luxury handbags have outperformed other collectibles in recent years and are increasingly viewed as a potential investment category in the eyes of consumers and analysts, at least according to some recent reports.

For the first time, the value proposition of designer handbags from top brands, such as Hermes, Chanel, Goyard and Louis Vuitton are growing across the board, one report by luxury resale site Rebag found last year.

"These trends signal exciting investment opportunities across both heritage and more attainable brands," the Rebag report said.

Handbags are among the least volatile of any collectible asset and offer a good risk versus reward, they have also proven to be a worthwhile hedge against inflation, according to a separate 2022 study by Credit Suisse.

However, while some designer handbags, particularly classic and sought-after styles, can potentially retain or even increase in value over time, they are not a traditional investment in the way stocks or real estate are, expert say.

Over the last two decades, luxury handbags went from being an accessory to what is now "the only female-centric collecting category," according to a 2020 report by Art Market Research.

For women, however, the evolution of such increasingly expensive purchases has come at a price, said Jasmine Tucker, the National Women's Law Center's vice president of research.

Vitamins and supplements like zinc and cod liver oil are often touted for their ability to boost your immune system, but Jeffrey Bland, the "father of functional medicine," says that's not actually possible. "[But] those nutrients don't boost the immune system. Those nutrients may fill the gaps in a person who needs them to meet their daily requirements for proper immune function, but you're not going to boost the immune system like you do with a vaccination." Getting vaccinated causes a physiological effect that boosts the function of the immune system. Supplementing with nutrients doesn't have the same effect, he says. Instead of a sole focus on boosting immunity, Bland says you should be thinking about rejuvenation. Roughly every four months, the cells that make up our immune systems are replaced with new cells. "The question I ask people is, 'Do you want the cells that are replacing the ones today to be as good as, better than, or worse than the ones that you have [now]?'" he tells CNBC Make It.

We know many of the shoppers who frequent TJX Companies ' off-price chains love treasure hunting. What entices them to keep coming back for all those discounted designer clothes and trendy home furnishings, however, is something less talked about and works even in tough economic times. According to UBS analyst Jay Sole, it is TJX's strong relationships with 21,000 vendors around the globe that allow it to get the best deals on merchandise for its stores, which includes T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods. "For a lot of vendors, TJX is their biggest customer," Sole told CNBC at last week's UBS consumer and retail conference in New York City. "They want to grow with a company like TJX that's winning and taking market share, especially if some of their other retail partners are losing market share." "A lot of public companies are aggressive on cutting merchandise in advance because they have to grow their earnings," said TJX CEO Ernie Herrman during the company's earnings call on Feb. 26. This trend has been intensified by a slowdown in consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan's preliminary March index fell to 57.9 — a 10.5% drop from the prior month and a 21% decline year over year as Americans expect a higher rate of inflation within the next year driven by higher prices from tariffs imposed and threatened by President Donald Trump . We increased our price target to $140 per share after TJX delivered a better-than-expected quarterly report in late February. As retailers offload excess inventory— a trend that's accelerating as consumer confidence dives — TJX swoops in to buy the highest-quality stuff at cheap prices. These elements "tend to work pretty well for TJX," Herrman said during February's post-earnings call. TJX's size also gives it more buying power and a negotiating edge over its off-price peers. In a note Friday, they said TJX's ability to purchase new inventory and quickly convert it into sales is a key part of the company's unique moat, or competitive advantage, that "enables opportunistic buying." Morgan Stanley described TJX as offering "simple" and "consistent" relationships with vendors that don't include advertising or markdown dollars, inventory takebacks, and no issues with late payments. "As a result, TJX is sometimes able to negotiate better margin," analysts said — adding "this negotiating power likely only grows with further scale." That growth is steadily taking shape as TJX recently increased its long-term store target of 7,000. But it also has stores in Canada, Australia, and Northern Europe. It recently expanded into the Middle East and Mexico through partnerships and has plans to open new stores in Spain in early 2026. TJX also uses a "roll-up strategy," wherein the company partners with local businesses to offer its expertise in supply chain and inventory management. TJX takes a stake in these businesses and benefits from their growth. Last year, TJX announced a pair of joint ventures with international off-price retailers: Mexico's Grupo Axo and Dubai-based Brands for Less. Morgan Stanley, for its part, concluded that TJX is a "scarce, high-quality retail investment option" that has room for higher profits in the future. While the overall retail industry has been hard hit by tariff concerns, economic uncertainty, and the health of consumer spending, Goldman continues to see the consumer as a "source of strength" and remains "constructive on off-price." Analysts find TJX as a defensive stock that can be bought to protect against economic downside. They have a buy rating and price target of $142 on the stock. However, if the U.S. economy goes into a recession, TJX "won't be able to maintain the same-store sales growth rate," UBS' Sole explained. Still, TJX tends to have a more consistent performance than your typical retail stock and can steal share in any economic environment, even in a weaker scenario.

Lauren Scott says she couldn't afford to buy a house in the United State, so she started looking abroad. Ohio native Lauren Scott, 29, had lived in Los Angeles for 10 years working as a freelancer in the film industry, when she decided she was ready to buy a house. Scott started her search in 2019 and wanted to stay under $400,000. "I didn't think I was ever going to be able to buy in California, much less Los Angeles, which is somewhere I've kind of called home for such a long time and that really sucked," Scott tells CNBC Make It. Scott realized buying in California was close to impossible, so she started looking in other states like Florida, where her family lives. She quickly realized she wouldn't be able to find a job that would match her current lifestyle. Scott was also disappointed in the quality of life in the United States and set her sights on Mexico, Portugal and Italy because they all had weather similar to California. Scott found a two-bedroom, one-bath townhouse one hour outside of Florence. The contention between locals and expats over rising housing costs, made Scott dismiss Mexico and Portugal pretty quickly. She set a budget of $50,000 and did her house hunting online. "I reached out to a lot of agents and just ended up paying somebody to do it all for me." She could walk and use public transportation, which was a big priority for her. "I didn't want to deal with a car since I'm not there full time and just being in the mountains and having that view made me feel super at peace," Scott says. "She left it completely furnished and just wanted to get out and move to a different part of Italy but was having problems selling the home," Scott says. "I really lucked out because there's nothing wrong with it except for needing to replace that one part of the home." Scott paid the full asking price of $34,905 and an additional 4,200 euros, or $4,581 USD, in closing costs. Scott closed on the townhouse in August 2022 and flew to see it in person for the first time that November and says when she first arrived, she was overcome with emotion. Scott's original plan for the house was to rent it out, but she realized she didn't want to deal with the issues that could arise with tenants or short-term renters. "The cost of just having it empty would probably outweigh the cost of renting it out and having somebody break something," she says. In 2024, Italy launched its "Visa for Remote Workers," allowing a one-year residency with the option to renew for highly skilled professionals to work remotely as employees or as self-employed freelancers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/why-trumps-tariff-plan-and-inflation-may-have-cancelled-doge-dividend.html'>Why Trump's economic policies may have canceled the DOGE dividend check, at least for now</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnbc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 00:00:00 <p>
Elon Musk stands as he is recognized by U.S. President Donald Trump during Trump's address to a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4, 2025. Well, think about if the government spends the money, they spend a dollar and you get whatever multiplier effect you think of that if they don't spend the money, and say give it back to people. It's the idea that it's inflationary is just again, people should study their economics textbooks a little bit before they make partisan points." Trump's head of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, said in a recent CNBC interview that the DOGE dividend check makes a "great deal of sense," and he has argued that anyone saying it would stoke inflation doesn't understand economics. If they save or invest it, the impact is less immediate, but long-term effects depend on how markets react. "Dumping $5,000 per person into the economy sounds great on paper, but it's essentially pouring gasoline on an already hot fire," warns Aaron Cirksena, CEO of investment firm MDRN Capital. "Now look, for folks who want to criticize this plan and say, well, DOGE would never deliver $2 trillion in total savings, we disagree, but let's just assume that they're right on that," Fishback told NBC News "Let's say it's only $1 trillion. The exact amount of any DOGE dividend check is unclear, but some analysts have equated a 20% dividend to $5,000 per taxpaying household (20% of the "savings" from cuts could amount to that). As Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues its effort to gut the government, the idea has been floated that savings could end up in checks mailed to taxpayers. That idea has come and gone in the headlines, but it is one that Trump has expressed support for in the recent past. A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money we're saving by going after the waste, fraud, abuse, and other things happening," Trump told reporters at one point. Trump has renewed his pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to help ease the pain of tariffs as more Americans become worried again about their financial situation. Inflation is expected to tick higher again, if maybe only in the short-term , if President Trump follows through on expansive tariffs threats against trading partners around the world. The messaging from Trump and his top economic advisors is that he plans to do just that on April 2 , and any short-term market correction or economic "detox" is a price worth paying to reset the U.S. economy. But economists worry the proposed payments are not sound fiscal policy. John W. Diamond, CEO of Tax Policy Advisers, and adjunct professor of economics at Rice University, recently argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed co-written with former Secretary of State James Baker that entitlement reform tied to a healthy dose of DOGE could help get the federal deficit under control — but DOGE alone can't do it. The hope is that it does not act as a stimulus (like stimulus checks during the pandemic, which were geared to help maintain consumption) and instead is saved by these households with a greater propensity to save," Kassens said. This would reduce the debt less than if the whole amount was put towards this purpose, but this could be partially offset in the long run by added personal savings, investment, and economic growth," she said. MDRN Capital's Cirksena said that while some portion of a new government check to the public could go into savings, as some money from Covid stimulus checks did, it also will fuel immediate demand, and people spend it on goods and services. "It comes down to how the money circulates," he said. It builds value," Cirksena said, whereas direct stimulus hits the economy like a sugar rush — fast spending, quick demand spikes, and a higher risk of inflation without lasting economic growth. Right now, the administration isn't prioritizing a DOGE dividend in public comments. Beyond tariffs policy as an economic focus, Trump's recent speech to Congress prioritized tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Dropping $5,000 per person into the mix would be like throwing fuel on a fire that's already burning hot. The administration is leaning into economic growth through investment and tax incentives, not direct cash handouts, Cirksena said, adding that Trump's focus on tariffs and domestic production suggests he's looking to shift money toward industries, not directly into people's pockets. Case Western Reserve University economics professor Jonathan Ernest says that now would be an unusual time to inject stimulus because all indicators show a strong economy. It might be a good political, if not economic, strategy, but ultimately, Ernest says it might slow down the Fed's efforts to tame inflation and lower interest rates. A stimulus check now while inflation is still persistently above where the Fed wants it would risk stimulating demand, which would drive up prices, Ernest said, and he added it could reduce the likelihood that the Fed achieves its goals. "A stimulus now is not quite going hand in hand with current monetary policy, which has guided the soft landing up until this point," he said. The Fed's Chair Jerome Powell said after its FOMC meeting on Wednesday that a good part of any higher inflation would come from tariffs, but an economic growth decline would balance out that, although it could "delay" the Fed's progress in hitting its 2% inflation target. Ernest also thinks paying down the deficit as an administration priority is at odds with sending out stimulus checks. "Stimulus would be a confusing strategy because we are running deficits, and instead of using savings to pay off the deficit, we would be returning it to consumers," Ernest said. Meanwhile, job cuts across the federal government, as well as deportation plans, are contributing to uncertainty about a national labor market that is also holding up so far, though hiring has slowed. "Typically, when we think of these things, we are in an economic slump, and we want to do a little bit of stimulating demand by putting more money in people's pockets so they can prop up the economy," he said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

They include buy-rated stocks such as: Analog Devices, Nvidia, Broadcom , Marvell and AppLovin. Analyst Vivek Arya says the stock is best positioned for growth after a series of meetings with management. Further, Arya says Analog has only a very minimal impact to the tariff uncertainty. The firm hosted CEO Matt Murphy for a series of meetings and came away with a "reassuring tone in [the] near & longer-term growth outlook." Marvell's data center opportunity also remains large, according to Arya. "We expect the overall data center TAM [total addressable market] to be raised towards ~$100bn with continued targeting of 20% share over time," he added. In addition, Marvell has a much anticipated analyst day in June where it could raise its growth forecast, the firm says. Meanwhile, shares of the company are down 37% this year and remain attractive, Arya wrote. Analyst Omar Dessouky also recently participated in a series of meetings with AppLovin concluding that the bullish thesis is becoming clearer. Dessouky says AppLovin has a first mover advantage and is well positioned to benefit from an increase in digital spending.

Fears of a recession and tariff uncertainty continued to pressure stocks. The broad market index managed to break a four-week losing streak, however. Amid this tumultuous backdrop, CNBC Pro used its stock screener tool to identify the most oversold stocks on Wall Street, through their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. A few consumer-focused names made this week's oversold list. Shares finished 0.6% lower on the week, and it is down more than 16% in March. The company recently warned that February sales were soft and that it sees a "meaningful" drop in first-quarter profit compared with a year earlier. Analysts are optimistic on the stock's upward potential, even as Target shares have suffered. Consensus price targets call for upside of more than 32%, per LSEG.

Deckers, which has a 14-day RSI of about 21.6, declined 0.7% during the week. However, the consensus price target indicates it may be heavily oversold.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Every investor knows, or should, that the moment of maximum uncertainty is a time to buy. The only trick, then, is discerning when we've reached peak uncertainty. But swirling around it are immigration restrictions, headlong and haphazard reductions in Federal spending and a separate but related confidence shock weighing on consumer behavior. .SPX 5D mountain S & P 500, 5 days Renaissance Macro Research has consistently pointed out that when the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is near an extreme high (in the top 10% of all readings since 1985), forward equity performance is better than average. And perceived certainty is bearish: The lowest 10% of policy-uncertainty readings were followed by a positive stock market performance only 36% of the time. After the meeting last week in which the Fed left interest rates unchanged and preserved a tentative outlook for a half-percentage-point worth of cuts the rest of this year, Chairman Jerome Powell said, "I don't know anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast." JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli plotted the "risk bias" of FOMC members, or which direction they believe their inflation and GDP-growth forecasts are in jeopardy of being wrong. Is this inherently negative for the economy and markets, though? Look at the last time those lines gapped apart to a similar degree. It was in late 2022, just as reported inflation was peaking, recession expectations were near-universal — and the S & P 500 bottomed after its nine-month, 25% bear market. What's tricky right now is not simply that perceived uncertainty can always go to more extreme extremes for a while. What we've had is a sharp little correction in the S & P 500 that kissed the 10%-loss threshold before bouncing a week ago Friday, having started from elevated valuations and ebullient investor expectations following consecutive 20% annual gains. When perceived uncertainty rages (yes, perceived; the world is inherently uncertain even when we're all sure of what comes next), it is helpful to anchor to what we know about the probabilities. Recession is what matters Warren Pies, founder of 3Fourteen Research, dissected the 52 S & P 500 corrections since 1950 (which works out to around one every year and a half or so. However, within those 52 corrections, 28 occurred with no recession ahead in the next 12 months. Out of these cases, only 12 went on to become serious corrections." Simplistic as it sounds, the odds of a decline something much deeper and more long-lasting hinges on whether the slowdown underway sags into an economic contraction. This is why tariffs are more than simply a psychological overhang on the market, because at some level of severity and in certain escalation scenarios they are much more potentially damaging in undercutting economic activity than in mechanically resetting some prices higher. For now, the hesitant but still healthy corporate-credit market is doing a lot of the work in holding off a recessionary setup. Consumer activity has slowed and retail and travel stocks have taken lumps for it, but household balance sheets aren't badly stretched in aggregate. Industrial production was reported at a record high, something that has never immediately preceded an economic contraction. Ned Davis Research U.S. equity strategist Ed Clissold points out that after an initial rebound rally, there is typically a period of churn and retesting. A week ago here , in suggesting the snapback rally had plenty to prove after four losing weeks, I noted that five-week losing streaks were rare and this past Friday's triple-witching derivatives expiration looked to have a slight upside bias. It failed to hold above the 5,700 level on three separate days, finishing at 5,667, its precise mid-July high, coinciding with the peak in Mag7 dominance. It has reclaimed just a quarter of its peak-to-trough decline. .SPX 1Y mountain S & P 500, 1 year The correction low from seven trading days ago still seems a plausible, if not fully persuasive, tactical pivot point. The S & P 500 Volatility Index put in a nice spike, peaking near 30 and then declining below 20, often a sign the fever has broken. And it's tough to see many catalysts for analysts to be lifting profit forecasts soon, especially given second-half estimates have held up as GDP forecasts have come down. Strategists at two Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital, have cut their year-end S & P 500 targets in recent weeks.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

What could be next as the activist aims to build value</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnbc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-22 00:00:00 <p>
Its resorts operate primarily under the Caesars, Harrah's, Horseshoe and Eldorado brand names. Earlier this month , Carl Icahn and Caesars reached an agreement in which the company consented to expanding the size of the board to 12 directors and appointing Jesse Lynn (general counsel of Icahn Enterprises) and Ted Papapostolou (chief financial officer of Icahn Enterprises) as directors to the company's board. Icahn agreed to abide by certain customary standstill and voting provisions. This is not Carl Icahn's first foray at Caesars. Courtney Mather is still on the board of Caesars but no longer works for Carl Icahn. In the press release announcing this agreement, Icahn stated that they, "look forward to working with [management] and the Board to maximize value for all shareholders, including by exploring strategic alternatives for the Company's underappreciated digital business." A spin-off of Caesars Digital makes sense for several reasons. Consensus estimates suggest that Digital can continue to grow in mid-double-digits. Digital's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) has also surged 207.9% from 2023 to 2024, with projections of another 160.9% increase in 2025. Clearly, these are two businesses at vastly different points in their growth cycles, making it difficult for the market to fairly evaluate them as a single entity. Applying that multiple range to Digital's $305 million of 2025E adjusted EBITDA would render an entity with a value of approximately $4.6 billion to $7.6 billion. As Digital only represents 3% of the company's current EBITDA, this separation would unlock a ton of value, as Digital's standalone valuation would represent 15% to 25% of the company's total current enterprise value – significantly higher than what its implied valuation is right now within Caesars. This separation would also allow investors the option to invest in a consistent legacy casino business or a riskier high-growth digital business. This does not have to be a straight sale or spinoff, either. Icahn is one of the most creative investors ever and his two nominees will likely work to figure out what the best structure is for shareholders. Carl Icahn knows a ton about the casino business. He has had a tremendous history of creating value at casinos. So, there is no other activist more qualified to create value at a company like Caesars. The stealth nature and structure of the agreement in addition to the comments made by Caesars and Icahn strongly indicate that this is a very amicable arrangement, and that Icahn is confident in management's ability. This has been an area rife for activism with Icahn protege Keith Meister on the board of MGM, two activists in Penn Entertainment and two more activists in Entain with Eminence founder Ricky Sandler on the board. This industry is at an inflection point with the onset of interactive gaming. The companies that navigate this better – likely through acquisitions and alliances, and without significantly weakening their balance sheets – will be the winners. I am not sure you can have a better ally in that type of initiative than Carl Icahn. Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
