                <p>Energy secretary Ed Miliband has ordered the National Energy System Operator to “urgently investigate” the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday.

He is working with Ofgem and using powers under the Energy Act to formally launch the grid operator’s investigation.


A blaze knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes the previous evening. Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police initially led the investigation, but the force has confirmed the fire is believed to be non-suspicious, so London Fire Brigade is now leading the probe which will focus on the electrical distribution equipment.

Flights resumed at the west London airport on Friday evening and restrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted after hours of closure.</p></b>

                <p>The Boston Celtics are sold to an investor group for a record amount of $6.1 billion.

William Chisholm, Managing Partner of Symphony Technology Group, leads the group of investors but is not well-known in the public eye.

Chisholm founded a private equity company for technology companies in 2002 and is Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer.

The Boston Celtics are one of the most prestigious teams from the US professional basketball league NBA, with 18 titles won in their history.


No matter whether football or basketball clubs: If new investors buy a team, they are usually publicly known. But the Boston Celtics are now moving into the hands of an investor group, the head of which is a completely blank leaf in the general public.

There are hardly any pictures of Chisholm online and his private equity company is also not well-known.

The deal not only surprised NBA insiders but also Chisholm itself, reports the "Wall Street Journal" (WSJ). It was a "Kneif-Mich moment".

Chisholm founded the private equity company Symphony Technology Group in 2002 and is still managing partner and Chief Investment Officer there.


According to the WSJ, Chisholm's company is investing in technology companies that deal with cloud security software or operate platforms for job searches.

Chisholm's curriculum vitae reads straight - MBA at the renowned Wharton School, stations at Bain Capital, according to the WSJ. "The capital, to put it together, is openly, the simple part," quotes him, the journal. 

Above all, you have to get the right people at the table.

In addition to Chisholm, Rob Hale, Bruce A. Beal-President of the Related Companies-and the investment company Sixth Street include.

According to WSJ, how much money Chisholm himself has contributed. But he is a majority owner-his comparatively small private equity company must have dropped a good rod for him.

The STG manages assets of almost $12 billion (around 11 billion euros).</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Elon Musk's evening all-hand meeting at Tesla shows that he can afford more than other CEOs.

A late discussion at the last minute also carries the risk of being unorganized, according to a leadership expert.


With every other CEO it would have been an emergency with five alarm levels.

But Elon Musk's recent meeting with the Tesla employees at the last minute was a memory that the company's front man can get through with a lot. And maybe in a unique way is free of the norms that other bosses adhere to.


The big question is: when is it too much?

Even though he has convinced his employees over the years to work in tents and sleep in the office, his scope is not unlimited to employees, investors and customers, said Musk observer to Business Insider.

"There is no version in which he does so many things at once and is going well," Wil Schroter, founder and CEO from Startups.com, a tech accelerator, told BI.


He pointed out the sheer number of points on Musk to-do list-from control over half a dozen companies, including Tesla, X and SpaceX, to attempt to redesign the federal government.


A big challenge for the employees

Musk's decision to hold a company-wide meeting at 9 p.m. in Austin without notice - although technical problems continued to delay the beginning - sends several negative signals.

That said Melissa Schilling, professor for management and organizations at the Stern School of Business at New York University.


Schilling, who dealt with Musk's career and his companies, said Bi that one of these signals was a feeling of uncertainty. "This is a really dangerous position for someone who is so central to the brand," said Schilling.


Starting a meeting, if the employees are already in bed, can also affect the work ethic.

"If you signal the employees that their time is not valuable, you harm the relationship with them," she said.


It is one thing to get over some corporate standards in the initial phase of a company. But Musk has long been behind this honeymoon, says Schilling. "His actions now affect too many people to get through with this behavior," she said.


Musk did not respond to a request from BI.

Schroter said that Musk is often preferred in case of doubt, but if he were confronted with a larger crisis, such as a drastic decline in Tesla shares compared to their high in December (they fell by about 50 percent), the musk supporters would be less forgiving.


In such a case, "you can't go around with the government and make cuts," said Schroter, referring to Musk's other role at the head of Donald Trump's advisory group for the efficiency of the government (Doge).


On the couch

It is not the first time that Musk stands out with his attitude towards work.

As is well known, the richest man in the world said that he slept on the floor in the Tesla factory when the company was in the “production hole” for his model 3.</p></b>

                <p>Jessica Cody worked in Walt Disney World in Florida from 2010 to 2014, performing as Lady Tremaine and other figures.

She also worked at the Universal Orlando Resort from 2010 to 2013.


After a stock market crash in 2008, Cody worked full-time at Walt Disney World for about 70 hours per week. However, when Disney cut back on working hours, she could no longer pay rent and lived in her car in the Magic Kingdom employees' parking lot.


Cody was not alone in this situation; there were many other homeless employees sleeping in their cars. Security guards knew of the situation but turned a blind eye because they understood that these individuals had nowhere else to go.


In November 2010, Cody began working as an actor and dancer at Universal, where she earned $15 per hour. This additional income allowed her to rent an apartment with two other people.


Cody no longer works for Disney or Universal but is now a dance teacher and choreographer. She believes that human resources should be paid a living wage.


In recent years, Disney has made some positive changes, including increasing the minimum wage for employees to $15 in 2021 and $18 in 2023. The company also offers employee packages with additional services.


Additionally, Walt Disney World Resort announced plans to build over 1,000 affordable apartments for employees and the community in Orange County, Florida, in 2022.</p></b>

                <p>Net migration in and out of the UK has dropped by 20 per cent to around 728,000 in the past year, official figures have shown.

 
Some 341 people made the journey in six boats on Thursday, bringing the provisional total for the year so far to 5,025.

This is the earliest point in the year that crossings have reached the 5,000 mark since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018.

Last year, the 5,000 arrivals mark was passed on March 31.

The cumulative number of arrivals so far in 2025 – 5,025 – is 24 per cent higher than at this stage in 2024, when the figure stood at 4,043, and 36 per cent higher than at this point in 2023 (3,683).

 

The highest number arriving in one day this year so far stands at 592 people, crossing the Channel in 11 boats on March 2.

Channel crossings have reached a high point earlier this year with over 5,000 migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel so far this year, latest figures show.

 

A Home Office spokesperson said: “We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security.”

A No10 spokesman said on Friday: “We’ve acknowledged that there is a flow of migrants into this country by illegal means on small boats and we’ve seen a number of incidents this week in French waters.</p></b>

                <p>The major Swiss bank UBS made a profit of 5.1 billion euros last year.

The CEO, Sergio Ermotti, earned CHF 14.9 million, making him one of the top earners in Europe.

Ermotti's salary exceeds the median of the CEO salaries of the top 10 stock exchange groups by 53 percent, according to Ethos.

UBS published its annual report for 2024 on Monday.

As the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" (FAZ) first reported, Ermotti's basic content is CHF 2.8 million and variable remuneration is CHF 12.1 million.


According to a calculation of the Swiss investment foundation Ethos, Ermotti's overall remuneration is 53 percent above the median of the CEO salaries of the ten largest Swiss stock market companies.

And 139 percent above the median of the twelve largest financial companies in the MSCI Europa Index.</p></b>

                <p>JT McCallen, 37-year-old account manager from Tennessee, was let go from his job about a year ago.

About a year ago I had an idea that it was not going well in my job and my company. So I started looking for work. At the beginning of August the dismissal I had expected came.

I was told that I would receive a three-month severance payment, but there was no indication of the outplacement services that I knew were sometimes offered by companies and offer access to various resources for work search. I asked my supervisor whether one of these services could be included in my severance payment package, and while I was cleaning up my office, I learned that my request had been granted.

I would have access to a service for about three months. Before discharge, my search was generally to search job exchanges such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Monster to search and to set up notifications for the types of places in which I was interested.


When I was released, I took my search much more seriously. First I turned to all recruiters with whom I had previously been in contact, and agreed a 30-minute phone call in which I was able to exchange ideas about possible job offers and their view of the setting situation.

They told me that I had to find a way to bypass the AI bots that some companies use to filter applicants. They also said that I should take care of job advertisements, do not actively hire the companies, but to publish it in part to give the impression that they would hire.


The conclusion: my job search may not be easy. My career coach helped me to find the right way


When I started to apply for jobs, I felt like I was throwing stones into the sea and I struggled to get an interview. I hoped that the Outplacement Service Randstad Risesmart would help me turn the tide.

In September, about a month and a half after my release, I started to meet a career coach every few weeks. My career coach helped me to improve my curriculum vitae and my cover letter and to coordinate them to the respective position for which I had applied.


He recommended that every company in which I applied to research and in my cover letter to name details such as the mission statement, the location and the exact job name.

The hope was that I would overcome the AI filters through the recording of relevant keywords and my cover letter and would come to an interview on the phone, in which I could speak to a real person and explain my expertise.


I was also recommended to write to people on LinkedIn who work in the companies where I applied and say: "Hey, I just applied for this position. Can you get in touch with the HR manager?" You will probably ignore it in 99 out of 100 cases, but maybe you will reach a few people.


That was something that had worked in some clients of my career coach in the past.

After I was almost no luck with my applications before I was released, the sheet began to turn. I might have had a telephone interview between May and August, and there were five or six between September and December.

With three or four jobs I came to the second round of introductions and in two of them in the final round. On Christmas Eve I received an official job offer that I finally accepted.


In January I started my new position as a key account manager at a company that works in the same industry as my previous employer. The task is somewhat more customer-oriented than my old, but many of the knowledge and experience from my previous job were transferable.

My new job is not quite as well paid as my old one, but it is in the salary span that I imagined.


I would recommend other job seekers to take the time to improve their curriculum vitae and cover letter - and at least for a while to take professional help if they are not sure how to do it.


I would also recommend that people think about how they can make some money while looking for work. Shortly after my release, I was able to eat at lunch at least once a month with a few people with whom I used to work.</p></b>

Gold is one of the best investments of this year with an increase of 16 percent since January.

                <p>Janet Truncale is the worldwide chair and CEO of EY, making her the first woman to hold this position.

In an interview, Truncale said she felt uncomfortable being referred to as a female pioneer in her role.

When she became the first woman at the head of Ey's America's Financial Services Organization, Truncale tried to downplay the achievement and didn't want to be known for it.

However, many strong women in her practice told her that she had to accept the title "First Woman" as a way to inspire future generations.

Truncale has been with EY since the 1990s and has often been one of the only women in meeting rooms throughout her career.

She advised women who are outnumbered on their career path to remember that they have a place at the table due to their background and specialist knowledge, and to support and take others as mentors.

According to the DEI report for 2024, 48 percent of EY employees in the USA are women, but only 36 percent of US partners are women.</p></b>

                <p>The T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup is taking place tonight in Lievin, northern France.

Cassandre Beaugrand, an Olympic champion and home favourite, is among the entrants, along with New Zealander Hayden Wilde.

The short-course event consists of a 200m swim, 2.8km cycle, and 1km run, all taking place in the same arena near Lille.

More than 100 elite male and female triathletes are set to take part, with the fastest expected to finish inside 10 minutes.

Part of the Lievin Triathlon Indoor Festival, it took place last year as the World Triathlon Indoor Cup but has now been rebranded as a T1 event in collaboration with the Professional Triathletes' Organisation (PTO).

World Triathlon president-elect Antonio F Arimany said the event has achieved "so much momentum" and praised its electrifying atmosphere.

The T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup format includes five heats, followed by a repechage deciding which 36 athletes advance to the semi-finals.

In the three semi-finals, the top four qualify for Final A while those finishing fifth to eighth go into Final B, which decides who finishes in places 13-24 in the final standings.</p></b>

                <p>Heathrow Airport said it is "open and fully operational" on Saturday after the airport was shut over a loss of power caused by a substation fire.

Flights resumed at the west London airport on Friday evening and restrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted following hours of closure, after a blaze knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes late on Thursday evening.

The Metropolitan Police are not treating the incident as suspicious and the London Fire Brigade's investigation is focusing on the electrical distribution equipment.

Heathrow also said it has added 50 slots to Saturday's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.

A statement from Heathrow says: "Flights have resumed at Heathrow following yesterday's power outage. If you're due to travel today, we advise you to still contact your airline for your latest flight information before heading to the airport."

Heathrow reopened

A further statement from Heathrow said the airport was "open and fully operational". A spokesperson said: "We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today.

Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday's outage at an off-airport power substation.

"We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.

"Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight."

The airport later added that all terminals and all car parks are open. Firefighters and workers were still at the electricity substation on Saturday morning.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander posted on X: "Good to see Heathrow Airport return to full operations this morning. Passengers should continue to check with their airline before travelling."

An American tourist has praised his airline's and Heathrow's "fantastic" response to a fire that closed the transport hub on Friday.

Speaking at Heathrow, Tim Kolb, who travelled to the UK on holiday from Dallas, Texas, told the PA news agency: "I was just getting ready to board the plane on Thursday night, and the news actually started coming across on our phones quicker than on the (airport) desk."

But American Airlines did a fabulous job – we didn't have to wait in the line or anything. They got us our accommodation reservation.

Kolb, 55, added: "I thought I was going to be there (Dallas) delayed two days, but I went over yesterday. It was organised well.

"In fact, they had several planes leaving within an hour of each other to Heathrow. The way everybody responded and fell into action, it was fantastic."

According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, British Airways (BA) flight BA56 from Johannesburg, South Africa was the first regular passenger flight to arrive at Heathrow on Saturday morning.

Some 120 aircraft heading to the airport on Thursday evening at the time of the incident were forced to either divert or return to their point of origin, which saw passengers on Qantas flights to Heathrow from Singapore and Perth divert to Paris before taking buses to London.

Around 200,000 passengers have been affected by the closure of what is Europe's busiest airport.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said she was in close contact with the Energy Secretary, the Home Secretary and with Heathrow to "make sure that any lessons we need to learn from the systems that the airport has in place are learned".

Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police have been leading the investigation into the cause of the fire, which did not result in any casualties at the scene.

" After initial assessment, we are not treating this incident as suspicious, although inquiries do remain ongoing," Commander Simon Messinger said.</p></b>

                <p>Western military planning to enforce a potential ceasefire in Ukraine is set to intensify in London next week as No10 said “nothing is off the table” over possible troop deployment for Kyiv.

No10 said “thousands” of personnel would be required to support any operation whether by “sea, on land or in the air” as allies prepare “for all eventualities” amid diplomatic efforts to end the war.

Officials from the so-called coalition of the willing will “accelerate the pace and scale” of work to consolidate proposals for possible troop deployment across land, air or sea to safeguard any Kyiv peace deal, a No10 spokesman said.

Sir Keir Starmer said new military sub-planning groups would continue talks during “three intensive planning days” next week, in a call with EU chiefs and non-EU countries on Friday.

It comes after Sir Keir warned Vladimir Putin would face “severe consequences” for breaching any truce as he met defence planners for the first stage of talks at the UK’s Northwood military headquarters on Thursday.

Downing Street on Friday said officials from allied countries will meet again at the same site next week to firm up a strategy to protect Kyiv as plans enter an “operational phase”.

‘Nothing off the table’ – No10

Asked whether the focus of discussions had shifted away from the prospect of ground troops for Ukraine, a No10 spokesman said: “No, nothing is off the table on any of these fronts, so I wouldn’t start ruling anything out.

“But clearly thousands of troops will be required to support any deployment, whether that is at sea, on land or in the air.”

Any deployment will require significant support and the firming up of “basic logistics of … moving people and ensuring deployment rotations,” a No10 official said.

European and Commonwealth allies are seeking to pressure the Russian president as he resists accepting in full a US and Ukraine-backed ceasefire.

EU defence talks

Sir Keir spoke to the presidents of the European Council and European Commission as well as the leaders of Turkey, Norway, and Iceland on Friday.</p></b>

                <p>Elon Musk held a meeting for all Tesla employees on Thursday, in which he spoke to the latest vandalism incidents against Tesla dealers and vehicles.

Elon Musk addressed the persistent Tesla protests and vandalism incidents during a company meeting on Thursday. The CEO said he understands when people don't want to buy Tesla, but they should not use property destroy. The Ministry of Justice and Trump have declared that attacks on Tesla dealers are regarded as domestic terrorism.

Musk initially silent about the protests that took place at the Tesla dealers, and described them as "fake rallies" with "hardly any people". However, when the protests increased and Tesla dealers and owners of several vandalism incidents, Musk condemned the actions.


"When you read the news, it feels like an Armageddon," said Musk on Thursday evening. "I can't walk past the TV without seeing a burning Tesla."


Musk commented on the attacks on X at the beginning of the week and called it "deeply wrong". He also spoke about vandalism during a appearance at "Hannity" on Fox News on Tuesday. The billionaire said that vandalism had reached a new level and he was shocked.


Tesla is a peaceful company," he said. "We have never done anything harmful."


During the one-hour company meeting in Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, Musk also spoke about the security balance of Tesla, the extradition figures, autonomous driving and robotics. He also asked employees and investors to capture their shares despite the recent slump in the number of delivery, boycotts and public demonstrations.


The Ministry of Justice joined Trump's words and described the attacks in a statement on Tuesday evening after the vandalism incidents at Tesla on Monday and Tuesday as "domestic terrorism".</p></b>

                <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has ruled out “tax and spend” policies ahead of her spring statement next week.

The Chancellor has ruled out “tax and spend” policies ahead of her spring statement next week.

Rachel Reeves is under pressure to increase taxes or cut spending to meet the financial rules she set at the budget in October amid disappointing growth figures and higher-than-expected borrowing.

Figures released on Friday came as a further blow, showing that government borrowing had soared past forecasts in February.

She signalled that she would neither raise taxes nor government budgets in an interview with the BBC.

“We can’t tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That’s not available in the world we live in today,” she said.

The defence budget has already been boosted by slashing spending on aid, and sweeping cuts to welfare were announced this week.

When she delivers her spring statement on Wednesday, Reeves will be responding to new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) made after the Bank of England reduced its forecasts for growth this year.</p></b>

Three students, one vision and the drive to catapult Europe back into the space race. The beginnings of Isar Aerospace almost sound like a startup fairy tale.

Within a few years, Daniel Metzler, Josef Fleischmann and Markus Brandl have built up the best-financed space-tech startup of the continent. Their strategy is to produce, test and adapt within a few hours if necessary.


The company has grown sharply since its foundation - from around 20 people in April 2019 to 220 employees at the end of December 2021.

Isar Aerospace is currently employed by more than 400 employees from the end of 2024. They will soon move from the current headquarters in Ottobrunn near Munich to the nearby community of Vaterstetten.

The new location should then accommodate the production, development and corporate headquarters of Isar Aerospace.</p></b>

                <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at an AI conference on Tuesday, "I have already said that Hoppers cannot be given away if Blackwell is delivered in large quantities."

"There are circumstances under which Hopper is okay," he added. "Not many."

He spoke about Nvidia's latest AI chip and server package, Blackwell. It is significantly better than the previous version Hopper, which came onto the market in 2022.

Large cloud companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google buy a lot of these GPU systems to train and carry out the huge models that drive the generative AI revolution.


Amazon dares to jump first

At the Amazon profit notification, CFO Brian Olsavsky said that the company was "observing an increased pace of technological development, especially in the field of artificial intelligence and mechanical learning".

"As a result, we shorten the service life for some of our servers and network devices from six to five years from January 2025," said Olsavsky, adding that this will reduce operating income this year by about $ 700 million (around $ 640 million).

Then even more bad news: Amazon sent some of his servers and network devices "retired prematurely", said Olsavsky and added that this "accelerated depreciation" costs around $ 920 million (845 million euros) and that the company expects the operating result in 2025 to reduce about $ 600 million (around $ 550 million).


A much bigger problem for others

Sandler, the analyst of Barclays, added a striking graphic to his Research Note on Friday. It shows the cost of renting H100 GPUs that Nvidia's older Hopper architecture use.

The diagram shows the costs for the rent from NVIDIA H100-GPUs.


This could be a much bigger problem with Meta, Google and other margin -strong software companies," wrote Sandler.

For Meta, he estimated that a shortening of the company's useful life by one year would increase depreciation in 2026 by more than $ 5 billion (4.5 billion euros) and that the operating result would reduce a similar amount.

For Google, a similar change would reduce the profit by $ 3.5 billion (3.2 billion euros), Sandler estimated.


The time is ripe

When the generative AI boom picked up speed in the summer of 2023, the analysts from Bernstein were already thinking about this impairment.

"All of these Nvidia GPUs have to be accommodated somewhere. And how quickly are these newer servers written off?"</p></b>

                <p>Elon Musk held a meeting with all Tesla employees at the Gigafactory in Texas on Thursday evening.

The short-term meeting was transferred to X by livestream, which started at 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time but was abruptly interrupted and restarted 28 minutes later.


During the one-hour meeting, Musk informed employees about the security balance of Tesla, delivery figures, and work in autonomous driving and robotics.


Here are the five most important findings from Tesla's all-hand meeting:


Musk said that investors "have to stick to their shares." He mentioned the turbulence around Tesla's share price when discussing the ambitions of the company in the field of autonomous driving.


Tesla builds Optimus robots in large quantities. Musk said he expects Tesla to start its production of Optimus robots this year.


In April, Musk said during a telephone conference that the Optimus robots were the most valuable good of Tesla.


No Tesla employee asked about politics during the 30-minute question time.


Musk told his employees on Thursday that he was "quite drained" after an employee asked him if he wanted to produce other products such as planes or trains.</p></b>

                <p>According to the personnel consultant Kristine Capek, the key to a successful job interview is competence-based questions, which enable a precise assessment. The question "Why should we hire you?" puts the applicants under unnecessary pressure. 

The application process is no longer just about a one-sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level.

Companies should specifically ask about their motivation - for example: "Why did you apply for this position?"

An interview can decide on the professional future, but often these conversations are anything but ideal. Companies present themselves in detail, applicants lose themselves in irrelevant details, and some questions have a daunting effect rather than being effective.

Kristine Capek knows the typical stumbling blocks. As the founder and managing director of the personnel consultancy "Ivies", she has been teaching specialists in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry for over 15 years. She gives career tips on Tikok as a "dieheadhunter".

In an ideal interview, small talk creates a pleasant atmosphere and relaxes the situation.

This is followed by a brief introduction to the company and hiring management. 

"When managers only present themselves for minutes, it is a clear red flag and says a lot about corporate culture." Instead, the conversation should quickly pass to the applicants - this signals real interest on the part of the company.

The perfect self-presentation in the interview: neither too long nor too short

As an applicant, your self-presentation should take between five and ten minutes. No less, nothing more. You should leave out irrelevant details and concentrate on what is really important for the position, the personnel consultant advises.

From the beginning, this creates a targeted connection between your own experience and the new position. However, reality often looks different.

Capek knows: "Many start with their Abitur - and lose their focus."

This is not surprising that many companies vote for the first question to applicants very openly. You would say, for example: "Tell something about yourself." 

Instead, companies should target the interview and ask more specific questions. For example: "Why did you apply for this position? What competencies do you bring with you that enable you for the job?"

The key to a successful interview? Competence-based questions.

For a successful interview, it is crucial that companies define in advance exactly which skills are required for the open position. 

"For example, if negotiation skills are required, one could specifically ask for experience with difficult negotiations," explains Capek.

Applicants could specifically explain how they have already used this competence.

As an applicant, you should not only worship past positions. Focus on the skills and strengths you have developed in previous roles and what added value you could offer in your potentially new role.

This question is a red flag in an interview: "Why should we hire you?"

Not every question in the interview makes sense - some could (and should) even put off applicants according to the expert. 

One of them: "Why should we hire them?" This question is often asked from above, with the unspoken message: convince us first.

The application process is no longer just about a one-sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level.

Capek advises companies to formulate the question differently in order to put the applicants less under pressure. 

For example: "Why did you apply for this position?"

This question rather aims at what applicants are interested in the position and the company.

Unlike the other question, it is not about how well someone can sell. Rather, it is about finding out how well someone is suitable for the open position.</p></b>

                <p>Holger Loclair is the long-time managing director and sole owner of the Orafol Group, which has built up the largest family group East Germany.

Holger Loclair is the richest East German with an estimated property of 700 million euros.

The 74-year-old started his career in the GDR as a doctorate in chemists, took over a "state-owned company" (VEB) after the turn.

Orafol today produces adhesive tapes and special foils for traffic signs, the car and aircraft industry, with around 3,000 employees at 30 locations worldwide.


According to Manager Magazin, Holger Loclair is number 314 of the richest Germans. He comes from Penzin in the Rostock district. In his youth he was a gymnast.

He later received his doctorate from the Faculty of Chemical Technology and Process Technology at the Technical University in Szczecin, Poland.


His success story finally began in Oranienburg: In the 1970s, as a chemist, he joined the "VEB special colors Oranienburg" at the time-a so-called "state-owned company" (VEB) in the GDR.

He later became operational director there. After the turn, he ventured the step to the entrepreneur and took over the company.


In 1991 the company was privatized by the trust. Loclair led the privatization of the family business.


Orafol still has its headquarters in Oranienburg. The company produces products that you have all ever seen or even used yourself.

Namely, among other things, self-adhesive foils that are used for vehicle clees, advertising signs or window decorations.


Many reflective materials for traffic signs, markings on emergency vehicles or safety clothing also come from Orafol.

In addition, the company is developing special adhesive tapes that are used in industry, for example in the automotive or aviation industry.


The company has significantly expanded its presence in the United States, among others, with several subsidiaries and production locations.

The main activities of Orafol in America are controlled by Orafol Americas Inc.


In 2020 "Orafol Rus Reflective Solutions" has been in Pskow, Russia.</p></b>

                <p>Space Hero was probably one of the most ambitious TV projects of all time.

Two entrepreneurs from Germany and Great Britain wanted to produce the largest reality TV show ever. 24 candidates from all over the world should compete against each other in global competitions, which winners are shot into space with a rocket.

Also present: prominent partners such as NASA, SpaceX, CBS and Hollywood producers. But the show was never broadcast.


Hundreds of internal documents, exclusive contracts and conversations with insiders show why the project failed and how investors were apparently brought by millions with a network of empty promises. 

The British and German entrepreneurs wanted to create a global reality TV show, in which the winner flies into space with a SpaceX rocket.

The seasons should play on all continents and inspire millions of people. To finance this, they collected money from private investors from all over the world. Including Hollywood sizes and astronauts.

They promoted NASA and SpaceX, although they were not allowed in part. And they caused exclusive TV contracts.


Tens of thousands of people stand in front of a festival stage, behind it a dragon rocket from SpaceX shoots into the sky. Under roaring cheers, she flies the winner of the biggest reality TV show ever into space: Space Hero.

Also present: prominent partners such as SpaceX, the NASA, CBS, Hollywood producers and space companies from all over the world. More than two million euros invested private individuals and venture capital providers in the project.

At least seven seasons were planned, the first should start in 2022. But exclusive research by Business Insider show why the ambitious project failed.


We have evaluated hundreds of internal documents, viewed exclusive contracts and spoke to insiders that were deeply involved in the project. The research draws a picture of two entrepreneurs who wanted to change the TV world, but failed due to their overambitious ideas.

Who have continued to dug into a construct of apparently empty promises to disguise that the money of the investors has apparently long been gone.</p></b>

                <p>CitizenM Gare de Lyon is not likely to be the image of Paris that comes to mind.

The hotel provides affordable luxury, with good sleep, good shower, and good service, leaving the excitement for the city.

When thinking of Paris, CitizenM is a new breed of hotel that breaks every rule, but it's one of the most memorable stays in the city.


On arrival, you'll be greeted by a screen to check yourself in. From here you'll be assigned a room, printed a key and sent on your way by the elusive voice of 'CitizenM'.

CitizenM says: howdy Citizen Anna. CitizenM says: go to your room. CitizenM says: time to wake up.

Every room at CitizenM is exactly the same - that's anywhere around the world - which means a happy farewell to choice fatigue.


When you check in, you'll be asked (by virtual CitizenM) what view you prefer. The rooms are small, plush and perfectly formed. Cosy yet utilitarian: big squishy beds, blackout blinds, a waterfall shower plus an iPad to control the lights and temperature.

The iPad also allows you to programme an alarm, which coordinates your lights, blinds and music for a main character wakeup.


Just five minutes from the metro and 25 minutes from the Eurostar, you are well situated to get anywhere in the city. There are sights worth exploring on your doorstep.


Steal a croissant from the breakfast buffet and head for a scenic stroll at the Coulee Verte, aka the Promenade Plantee. Alternatively, head 30 minutes down the river and you're at the newly madeover Notre Dame.

Strolling back by the moonlit river, I felt more than sufficiently dosed up on Parisian romance to climb happily back into my spaceman cave.

                <p>Aston Martin’s Formula 1 team honoured former paddock legend Eddie Jordan with his name on their racing car.

Jordan passed away last week aged 76 from an “aggressive” form of cancer.

His Jordan Grand Prix team has gone through many iterations, with the current one being Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team.


The team made a number of references to Jordan on this weekend’s car at the Chinese Grand Prix, including his name and a clover on the rear wing and main body.


Jordan was a deal-maker, and not afraid to speak his mind. He was close with former Formula 1 bigwig Bernie Ecclestone, gave Michael Schumacher his debut and managed design guru Adrian Newey during his move from Red Bull to Aston Martin.


Aston Martin team principal Lawrence Stroll said: “Eddie Jordan was a true racer, a great leader, and one of the biggest characters in our sport.


He was a friend who I have known for more than thirty years and I will miss him greatly. My thoughts, and those of everybody at Aston Martin, are with his family and friends.”


Team principal Andy Cowell added: “Eddie Jordan was one of the all-time motorsport greats. He was a one-off, a wonderful human being, and a charismatic leader who founded this team and took it to F1 in 1991.</p></b>

                <p>George Foreman, world heavyweight boxing champion and Olympic gold medalist, died at 76.

Our hearts are broken," an announcement on Foreman's Instagram page read.
"With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones."

He won an Olympic gold medal in boxing at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City when he was 19 years old.

He won the world heavyweight championship five years later in a stunning knockout of Joe Frazier in two rounds in 1973, but he lost it to Muhammad Ali the next year in the famous "Rumble in the Jungle."

Foreman was not finished. At 45, Foreman reclaimed the heavyweight title in 1994 when he beat Michael Moorer.

He retired from boxing in 1977 and became a born-again Christian after having a religious experience in a dressing room after losing in a decision to Jimmy Young on March 17, 1977, in Puerto Rico.

He was ordained as a minister the next year and founded the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in 1980.

Foreman returned to boxing in 1987, a decade after he retired.</p></b>

                <p>A rose and an image of Pope Francis are placed at the statue of late Pope John Paul II outside Gemelli Hospital, where Pope Francis is admitted for treatment, in Rome, Italy.

Pope Francis is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital on Sunday, his doctors at Gemelli Hospital said. Francis, 88, was hospitalized for bronchitis on Feb. 14 and remained under care for more than five weeks.

At times, the pope was in critical condition and required high-flow oxygen therapy, according to the Vatican, and his changing health status captivated the world's attention. Addressing reporters outside the hospital in Rome on Saturday, the pope's doctors acknowledged that his condition had been "life threatening" on two occasions, but confirmed he has remained stable for at least two weeks.

"We have prepared to welcome him home," Dr. Luigi Carbone said. His doctors added that he will be under a "protected discharge," which will require ongoing medications, oxygen assistance as needed and a period of rest "for at least two months."

The Holy Father is improving, so let's hope that soon he will be able to continue his normal activity." Throughout his illness, the Vatican has maintained that Francis has continued to fulfill his duties. 

The Vatican said in a statement earlier Saturday that the pope will greet a crowd of gatherers outside the hospital on Sunday, marking his first public appearance since his treatment began.

Francis' hospitalization in recent weeks was not his first time battling serious ailments. In 2021, he underwent surgery for a gastrointestinal disease called diverticulitis, and again in 2023 for a hernia.</p></b>

                <p>London's Heathrow Airport reopened Saturday.

 London's Heathrow Airport was closed for most of Friday after a power outage following a fire at a nearby electrical substation, causing over 800 flights to be canceled in and out of the airport, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.

 The first flight took off from the airport late Friday local time, however, and the airport's departure board indicates that the majority of flights are due to run as scheduled on Saturday.

 "Flights have resumed at Heathrow following yesterday's power outage," the airport said on its website Saturday. 

 National Grid said Saturday that power supply had been restored to all customers, including Heathrow, allowing operations to resume.

Airlines are rushing to resume flights and get thousands of stranded passengers to their final destinations.</p></b>

                <p>Printemps' new store is located in New York City's Financial District.

A piece of Paris has landed in New York City. The retailer celebrated its opening on Friday, which coincided with the start of spring — its namesake.


The 55,000-square-foot store spans two floors and carries a wide range of merchandise, including clothing, shoes, handbags, makeup and more. About 25% of its brands are either not available or rare in the U.S., such as the Joseph Duclos brand.

In an interview with CNBC, Bellaiche said the retailer aims to stand out from other luxury players with the store's eye-catching architecture; unique mix of popular luxury brands and hard-to-find French brands; and programming and services.

Printemps Group was founded in 1865 and operates 20 department stores in France. Compared with its French stores, the U.S. location has more of an experiential bent.


For instance, one of the highlights of the Printemps store is the Red Room. The Art Deco-style room was decorated floor to ceiling with red and gold mosaics by master muralist Hildreth Meière and completed in 1931.

Printemps restored the room and turned it into a "shoe forest" where shoppers can browse for footwear or order a glass of wine at a nearby bar.


The store also will include Maison Passerelle, a fine dining restaurant steered by Gregory Gourdet. It will open in April.


Printemps is opening the U.S. store as luxury spending slows across the globe. Even some wealthier consumers have pulled back on discretionary purchases because of inflation and economic uncertainty.

In China, a key market for higher-end goods, luxury spending has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the global luxury industry are projected to grow 1% to 3% annually through 2027.


The U.S. remains an attractive market for luxury brands because of consumers' resilience. "On a relative basis, we have the healthiest economy, if you look at the major economies," he said.

"And then the other thing is, Americans love to shop."</p></b>

                <p>A nuclear power plant on the shores of Lake Michigan is aiming to make history this year by restarting operations.

The Palisades Nuclear Plant, located in Covert, Michigan, is seeking federal support to restart its operations after being closed down last year. The plant's previous owners, Entergy, sold it to Holtec for $130 million to take over the dismantling of the plant. However, backed by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Holtec applied for federal support to restart the plant just two months later.

The plant is seeking federal support through a program that allows struggling nuclear plants to receive funding from the Department of Energy. The program aims to keep the plants running and provide reliable carbon-free power to the grid. However, restarting a nuclear plant is a complex process that requires significant investment and regulatory approval.

Holtec's repair plan for the Palisades Nuclear Plant involves replacing 37 steam generator tubes that are cracked or corroded. The company plans to use a technique called "sleeving" to repair the tubes, which has been used in other heat exchangers at nuclear plants. However, the sleeve design being proposed by Holtec has not been installed in steam generators before.

The issues with the steam generator tubes raise questions about whether the aging plant should be replaced altogether. The previous owners of the plant, Consumers Energy and Entergy, knew that replacing the steam generators would be necessary but never tackled the project. It is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to replace the plant's components.

A similar incident occurred at the Indian Point nuclear plant in New York, where a steam generator tube rupture resulted in a minor radiological release to the environment. The NRC slapped Con Edison with a red citation for the leak, which was deemed to be of "high safety significance."</p></b>

                <p>Here is the summary of the news article in 24 or fewer sentences:

Being indecisive can be frustrating and unproductive, leading to doubt and resentment from others.

When you let multiple options linger, it can sap everyone's energy and make them question your ability to get things done.

You may be doing one of five things that signal indecision: avoiding and delaying, debating indefinitely, ignoring obvious decisions, trying to please everyone, or getting overwhelmed and stuck rehashing the same information.

It's one thing to be prudent in decision-making, another to be paranoid; you can take too long to decide because you're worried about making the wrong choice.

For example, you might spend weeks deciding whether to ask a friend out to dinner, worrying about rejection.

Instead of waiting, consider the cost of not deciding - like missing an opportunity to get to know someone you're interested in.

Give yourself a deadline if there isn't one imposed on you already, and create consequences for missing it.

This can motivate you to stay on track and avoid overthinking it.

Sometimes you know deep down what you need to do, but you look for justification to do something else.

Don't let confirmation bias lead you to search for signs that confirm an existing decision.

Accept inevitabilities sooner and stop trying to find support for what you want to decide.

You don't have to please everyone; leadership means being willing to make tough calls at times.

Make the best call you can with the information available, and move forward.

Know that people will appreciate your decisiveness even if they don't agree with it.</p></b>

                <p>There's no single path rich people follow to obtain their wealth. Some are born with generational wealth that gives them a head start, while others work their way up through grit, determination and well-timed career decisions. Luck may also be a factor.

But there are a few common habits among wealthy people, self-made millionaire, author and TV host Ramit Sethi wrote in a recent newsletter. "It's time to stop worshipping rich people — and start copying what they actually do," he wrote. Here are five rules Sethi said rich people live by and how you can use them to grow your own wealth.

1. Know the ins and outs of your finances

If you know how much money you make in a year, you're already a step ahead of many of the people Sethi has spoken to over the two decades he's been helping people with money. "You have to know your numbers," Sethi recently told CNBC Make It.

2. Have systems in place for making money decisions

Don't rely solely on willpower to make smart money decisions. "Willpower is great ... until your kid throws a tantrum, you catch the flu, or your entire mood tanks because last night's 'Bachelor' episode sucked," Sethi wrote.

3. Have a plan before you need one

For better or worse, life is full of unexpected surprises. But what often sets rich people apart is that they have a plan for the future, Sethi said. They not only have a healthy emergency fund, but also have a solid understanding of what they want their lives to look like.

4. Live by the 80/20 principle

"[Rich people] live by the 80/20 principle: 80% of your results come from 20% of your effort," Sethi wrote. In a business setting, this may mean that 80% of profits come from 20% of customers.

5. Focus on value over cost</p></b>

                <p>The final chapter closed on Wednesday, when Ripple announced that the SEC had officially dropped its four-year-old lawsuit against the company.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's years-long crusade against the crypto industry appears to be over, as the suit filed in 2018 has been abandoned. 

Ripple is now taking a victory lap after the announcement was made. "Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back — and won on essential legal questions — throwing a major wrench into the SEC's plans to destroy crypto in the U.S. through enforcement," Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told CNBC in an emailed statement.

XRP was created in 2012 as one of the first non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, started by the founders of the company Ripple and became the platform's native currency.

It can be bought and sold by retail investors, like bitcoin. XRP jumped about 11% after Wednesday's announcement.</p></b>

                <p>Maddy Brannon, 33, never set out to become the queen of Washington, D.C.-area estate sales.

In 2020, she bought a new home that was feeling empty, so she started looking for furniture at bargain prices.

She found an estate sale video on Instagram and became obsessed with browsing through other people's homes and shopping their items.

Brannon posted about estate sales on her account and discovered many others shared her curiosity. 

Her Instagram account has nearly 60,000 followers and she shares estate sale tours, previews, and recommendations for upcoming sales.

For now, Brannon's estate sale passion project is a fun but time-consuming hobby that isn't yet making her money.

She's driven by the prospect of helping people find great deals on hidden gems they'll love.

Estate sales often go over two or three days. For bargain hunters, the best time to go is as late as possible.

The company running things becomes more anxious to sell merchandise as the sale nears its end.

Rules may relax towards the end of the sale, allowing haggling and deals for bulk purchases.

Brannon says going on the last day can get you the absolute best deal at an estate sale.</p></b>

                <p>Luxury handbags have outperformed other collectibles in recent years and are increasingly viewed as a potential investment category in the eyes of consumers and analysts, at least according to some recent reports.

For the first time, the value proposition of designer handbags from top brands, such as Hermes, Chanel, Goyard and Louis Vuitton are growing across the board, one report by luxury resale site Rebag found last year.

"These trends signal exciting investment opportunities across both heritage and more attainable brands," the Rebag report said.

Handbags are among the least volatile of any collectible asset and offer a good risk versus reward, they have also proven to be a worthwhile hedge against inflation, according to a separate 2022 study by Credit Suisse.

However, while some designer handbags, particularly classic and sought-after styles, can potentially retain or even increase in value over time, they are not a traditional investment in the way stocks or real estate are, expert say.

Over the last two decades, luxury handbags went from being an accessory to what is now "the only female-centric collecting category," according to a 2020 report by Art Market Research.

For women, however, the evolution of such increasingly expensive purchases has come at a price, said Jasmine Tucker, the National Women's Law Center's vice president of research.

"In order to appear that you are in your place, you have to look a certain way, and that grooming can cost more for women, and they are doing that at a lower pay," Tucker said.</p></b>

Those nutrients may fill gaps in a person's daily requirements for proper immune function, but they do not have the same effect as getting vaccinated, which causes a physiological response to boost the immune system.


Bland suggests focusing on rejuvenation instead of solely boosting immunity. He notes that every four months, the cells that make up our immune systems are replaced with new cells.

The question Bland asks people is whether they want the new cells to be as good as, better than, or worse than the old ones.</p></b>

                <p>We know many of the shoppers who frequent TJX Companies' off-price chains love treasure hunting.

What entices them to keep coming back for all those discounted designer clothes and trendy home furnishings, however, is something less talked about and works even in tough economic times.

According to UBS analyst Jay Sole, it is TJX's strong relationships with 21,000 vendors around the globe that allow it to get the best deals on merchandise for its stores, which includes T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods.

"For a lot of vendors, TJX is their biggest customer," Sole told CNBC at last week's UBS consumer and retail conference in New York City.

"They want to grow with a company like TJX that's winning and taking market share, especially if some of their other retail partners are losing market share."

TJX benefits when retailers need to unload excess inventory to generate cash and mitigate losses.

"A lot of public companies are aggressive on cutting merchandise in advance because they have to grow their earnings," said TJX CEO Ernie Herrman during the company's earnings call on Feb. 26.

This trend has been intensified by a slowdown in consumer sentiment.

The University of Michigan's preliminary March index fell to 57.9 — a 10.5% drop from the prior month and a 21% decline year over year as Americans expect a higher rate of inflation within the next year driven by higher prices from tariffs imposed and threatened by President Donald Trump.

While this presents challenges for retailers, it has created an opportunity for TJX's buyers to secure high-quality inventory at better margins.

TJX is one of Jim Cramer's favorite stocks to buy right now due to its vendor relationships.

During the March Monthly Meeting, he said store closures and high levels of excess inventory bogging down the likes of Kohl's and Macy's can help TJX steal share in any economic environment.

The overall retail industry has been hard hit by tariff concerns, economic uncertainty, and the health of consumer spending, but Goldman Sachs sees the consumer as a "source of strength" and remains "constructive on off-price."

Analysts have a buy-equivalent overweight rating on the stock and a price target of $136 per share.

Goldman continues to see TJX as being "the most defensive" in the off-price sector.</p></b>

                <p>Lauren Scott, 29, an Ohio native who lived in Los Angeles for 10 years as a freelancer in the film industry, decided she was ready to buy a house. She started her search in 2019 and wanted to stay under $400,000.

The Covid-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, and Scott found herself outbid every time she put in an offer on homes in Los Angeles.

Scott realized buying in California was close to impossible, so she started looking in other states like Florida, where her family lives. She quickly realized she wouldn't be able to find a job that would match her current lifestyle.

Scott was also disappointed in the quality of life in the United States and set her sights on Mexico, Portugal, and Italy because they all had weather similar to California.

She found a two-bedroom, one-bath townhouse one hour outside of Florence. The contention between locals and expats over rising housing costs made Scott dismiss Mexico and Portugal pretty quickly.

After several weeks of searching, Scott focused on properties in Italy and set a budget of $50,000. She bought sight unseen and paid somebody to do it all for her.

The townhouse had been on the market for 32,000 euros or $34,905 USD. The previous owner told her the price was set low because the hot water boiler would need repairs.

She paid the full asking price of $34,905 and an additional 4,200 euros, or $4,581 USD, in closing costs. Not wanting to deplete her savings, Scott secured a $20,000 personal loan from a local bank to help purchase the house.

Scott closed on the townhouse in August 2022 and flew to see it in person for the first time that November. She says when she first arrived, she was overcome with emotion.

She couldn't believe she owned a home in her 20s because she didn't think this would ever happen. Scott's original plan for the house was to rent it out, but she realized she didn't want to deal with the issues that could arise with tenants or short-term renters.

Scott visits Italy twice a year now and uses the townhouse as a vacation home, but she is currently trying to secure a digital nomad visa to stay in the country for a while.</p></b>

                <p>mail was discussed in a recent Senate hearing about the Department of Veterans Affairs' backlog of disability claims.

President Trump recently spoke to Congress about his economic focus, prioritizing tax cuts and infrastructure spending over direct cash handouts.

The Treasury Department puts the country's national debt at $36.22 trillion.

Trump's speech to Congress did not mention a DOGE dividend in public comments.

Beyond tariffs policy as an economic focus, the administration is leaning into economic growth through investment and tax incentives.

Case Western Reserve University economics professor Jonathan Ernest says that now would be an unusual time to inject stimulus because all indicators show a strong economy.

It might be a good political, if not economic, strategy, but ultimately, Ernest says it might slow down the Fed's efforts to tame inflation and lower interest rates.

The Fed's Chair Jerome Powell said after its FOMC meeting on Wednesday that a good part of any higher inflation would come from tariffs, but an economic growth decline would balance out that.

Ernest also thinks paying down the deficit as an administration priority is at odds with sending out stimulus checks.

That doesn't mean the idea may not be floated again, especially if the economy slows significantly and as mid-term elections approach.

For now, the Fed says that external surveys on the risk of recession aren't a factor it pays attention to, and the economic data remains relatively solid.

But fears of recession at the back of the year are rising, and in the least, slower GDP growth is the expectation from the markets.

Meanwhile, job cuts across the federal government, as well as deportation plans, are contributing to uncertainty about a national labor market that is also holding up so far, though hiring has slowed.

One irony of a DOGE dividend, Ernest says, is that perhaps administration policy, such as the job cuts at the government level, will destabilize the economy enough that a stimulus payment would be warranted.

Typically, when we think of these things, we are in an economic slump, and we want to do a little bit of stimulating demand by putting more money in people's pockets so they can prop up the economy.</p></b>

                <p>Bank of America says investors should buy the dip in a slew of tech stocks.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fallen into correction territory, down 12% from its all-time high from December. Year-to-date, the benchmark has dropped about 8%, worse than the S & P 500's 3.6% loss.

The firm is saying for some key stocks in the sector, the selling has gone too far. They include buy-rated stocks such as: Analog Devices, Nvidia, Broadcom , Marvell and AppLovin.


Analog Devices

Investors should take advantage of the sell-off in the semis manufacturer, the firm said earlier this week. Analyst Vivek Arya says the stock is best positioned for growth after a series of meetings with management. "ADI remains optimistic on the expected 2H25 automotive and industrial market recovery, saying they have hit the bottom, but remain uncertain on the shape of growth coming out of it," he wrote, Still, the firm says the stock remains a best idea and the "trendline suggests [more] upside." Further, Arya says Analog has only a very minimal impact to the tariff uncertainty. "We reiterate Buy and top analog pick and note ADI's defensiveness...," he went on to say.

Analog Devices shares are down 4.6% this year.


Marvell Technology

Arya also sees a slew of positive catalysts for Marvell. The firm hosted CEO Matt Murphy for a series of meetings and came away with a "reassuring tone in [the] near & longer-term growth outlook." Marvell's data center opportunity also remains large, according to Arya. "We expect the overall data center TAM [total addressable market] to be raised towards ~$100bn with continued targeting of 20% share over time," he added.

In addition, Marvell has a much anticipated analyst day in June where it could raise its growth forecast, the firm says. Meanwhile, shares of the company are down 37% this year and remain attractive, Arya wrote.


AppLovin

The mobile app publishing tech company is just too attractive to ignore right now, according to the firm. Analyst Omar Dessouky also recently participated in a series of meetings with AppLovin concluding that the bullish thesis is becoming clearer. Dessouky says AppLovin has a first mover advantage and is well positioned to benefit from an increase in digital spending.

The company was the subject of several recent short seller reports, but Dessouky says he believes its hardly shaken investors. "The market's recent momentum unwind, and multiple short seller reports have in our view resulted in an opportunity to acquire a secular grower, early in its inflection, at a steep discount to GOOGL & META, profitable high growth software stocks, and AI beneficiaries..." he wrote.

The stock is down almost 5% this year.


Broadcom

"We rate Broadcom Buy due to its high-quality diversified exposure to secular product cycles in the smartphone, cloud data center, telecom and enterprise storage markets. Additionally, with 45%+ EBITDA/FCF margins, Broadcom is among the most profitable semiconductor companies, which is likely to continue to drive strong cash returns."</p></b>

                <p>The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out narrow gains on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%. 

Amid this tumultuous backdrop, CNBC Pro used its stock screener tool to identify the most oversold stocks on Wall Street, through their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI.

Stocks with a 14-day RSI reading below 30 are considered oversold, signaling a positive move higher may be in store. 

Target has a 14-day RSI score of just 19.13. Shares finished 0.6% lower on the week, and it is down more than 16% in March.

The company recently warned that February sales were soft and that it sees a "meaningful" drop in first-quarter profit compared with a year earlier. 

Analysts are optimistic on the stock's upward potential, even as Target shares have suffered. Consensus price targets call for upside of more than 32%, per LSEG.

Costco has a 14-day RSI reading of around 28.9. Shares rose 0.6% for the week, but shares are still down more than 13% in March. 

The retail giant has had a difficult month after posting an earnings miss in the fiscal second quarter. However, going by the average price target on Costco shares, the stock could see a rebound of about 19%, according to LSEG.

Analysts also largely hold a buy or strong buy rating on the stock. 

Shoe retailer Deckers Outdoor is another heavily oversold name that could soon see a comeback. Deckers, which has a 14-day RSI of about 21.6, declined 0.7% during the week. 

Shares are down 15% in March and are nearly 42% lower year to date. However, the consensus price target indicates it may be heavily oversold.

Analysts estimate shares soaring nearly 85% from current levels, and most have a strong buy or buy rating, per LSEG.</p></b>

                <p>The moment of maximum uncertainty is a time to buy, but discerning when we've reached peak uncertainty can be challenging.

Every investor knows, or should know, that the moment of maximum uncertainty is a time to buy. The only trick, then, is discerning when we've reached peak uncertainty. 

The stifling lack of clarity about the breadth or severity of the Trump administration's promised "reciprocal" tariffs due on April 2 is the obvious eye of this uncertainty storm.

But swirling around it are immigration restrictions, headlong and haphazard reductions in Federal spending and a separate but related confidence shock weighing on consumer behavior.

Friday's midday rally in the S & P 500 from an early 1% decline to a minimal gain by the close came after President Trump said there would be some "flexibility" in the application of those April 2 trade measures.

A vague and entirely reversible utterance, but the upward twitch in the index sends the message that after a month of volatile trading, the market is looking for a resolution.

Renaissance Macro Research points out that since 1928, when S & P 500 futures have risen by more than 1% during the week, they have continued to rise about two-thirds of the time in subsequent weeks.

According to Ned Davis Research U.S. equity strategist Ed Clissold, after an initial rebound rally, there is typically a period of churn and retesting.

"The duration of the retesting phase can be roughly proportional to the original decline," he says.

The Feb. 19 peak in the S & P 500 to the March 13 low was 16 trading days.

Another 16 days would bring us to April 4, near President Trump's April 2 deadline for instituting reciprocal tariffs.

Since tariff concerns were the main catalyst for the selloff, the April 2 deadline could bring a resolution, one way or the other.

The S & P 500 Volatility Index put in a nice spike, peaking near 30 and then declining below 20, often a sign the fever has broken.</p></b>

                <p>Caesars Entertainment is a diversified gaming and hospitality company operating through several segments: Las Vegas, Regional, Caesars Digital, Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other.

Earlier this month, Carl Icahn and Caesars reached an agreement in which the company consented to expanding the size of the board to 12 directors and appointing Jesse Lynn (general counsel of Icahn Enterprises) and Ted Papapostolou (chief financial officer of Icahn Enterprises) as directors to the company's board.

Icahn agreed to abide by certain customary standstill and voting provisions. This is not Carl Icahn's first foray at Caesars. He filed a 13D in February 2019 stating then that he believed the board should conduct a strategic review with a view toward a sale of the company being the optimal path to shareholder value creation.

On March 1, 2019, Icahn and Caesars entered into a director appointment and nomination agreement, pursuant to which John Boushy, Matthew Ferko, and Christopher Williams resigned from the board and James Nelson, Courtney Mather, and Keith Cozza were appointed to fill the resulting vacancies.

Caesar's stock price topped $119 per share on Oct. 1, 2021, but has since dropped below its pre-merger value in 2020, despite revenue increasing from $9.6 billion in 2021 to $11.2 billion today and operating income increasing from $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion over those respective periods.

Caesars recently entered into an agreement to expand the size of the board to 12 and appoint Jesse Lynn and Ted Papapostolou to the company's board. Icahn stated that they look forward to working with management and the Board to maximize value for all shareholders.

A spinoff or separation of Caesars' digital business could unlock a ton of value, as Digital's standalone valuation would represent 15% to 25% of the company's total current enterprise value – significantly higher than what its implied valuation is right now within Caesars.

This separation would also allow investors the option to invest in a consistent legacy casino business or a riskier high-growth digital business. The company could retain a piece of the digital business or enter into an agreement with the new entity to run the business.

Carl Icahn has a tremendous history of creating value at casinos, having acquired and sold several properties, including the Stratosphere and Tropicana. He disclosed a stake in Caesars in 2019, replaced departing CEO Mark Frissora, and orchestrated the Eldorado merger.

Caesars' management appears receptive to this strategy, and Icahn is not a micro-manager, trusting his people and management to execute effectively.</p></b>
