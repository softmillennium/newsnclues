Oops, something went wrong

Capping credit card interest rates is starting to look like the hot policy idea of the season for populist lawmakers on both the left and right.

This month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive star from New York, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a MAGA favorite from Florida, teamed up to introduce a bill to limit credit card APRs at 10%. It follows similar legislation from Sens. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont, and Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, which would put in place the same 10% rate ceiling for five years.

The cost of credit has become a more pressing issue in recent years thanks to rising interest rates, which have helped fuel increasing delinquencies: The average APR was about 21.5% at the end of last year, up from 14.7% in 2020, according to the Federal Reserve.

For now, these bills mostly seem to be political signaling exercises that are unlikely to go anywhere soon. Democrats may also see them as a way of challenging President Trump to make good on his campaign-season promise to pass a credit card cap, an idea mostly embraced by progressives in the past. (In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.)

But the bipartisan enthusiasm suggests that limiting what card issuers can charge their customers may have legs down the line. For many voters, it's a pressing pocketbook concern: About half of credit card accounts revolve a balance from month to month, while 13% of cardholders make only the minimum payment due, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

As they've hiked interest rates, credit card companies' margins have hit all-time highs. To some, that's a sign that companies could continue lending profitably to most of their customers even with a rate cap cutting a bit into their profits.

The challenge, as almost any economist will note, is that limiting rates will likely mean less access to credit for Americans with weaker credit scores since lending to them won't be as profitable.

That might be for the best for some households if it saves them from overborrowing. But many could be forced to resort to other, even less affordable types of debt to cover emergency expenses. And even without the aid of a high-APR credit card, some still find ways to make unaffordable purchases on credit, such as through buy now, pay later plans.

The question is how low is too low before restrictions do more harm than good. A 10% rate might be overly strict. But what about a 25% cap? Or 35%?

“At the end of the day, it's a trade-off,” said Breno Braga, an Urban Institute senior fellow who has studied the impact of interest caps. “You want to maximize the number of people that benefit from it and minimize the number of people that suffer from it.”

Usury laws are nothing new. At least 76 countries impose limits on lending rates, according to World Bank researchers, and at least 26 have chosen to place caps on all types of credit. In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright.

Studies on the impact of payday loan limits have yielded conflicting results. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. Others suggest the laws cut back on payday loan use without those drawbacks.

What would happen if the government tried to limit what Visa or Mastercard can charge? In the US, there's at least one recent real-world example we can draw conclusions from: The Military Lending Act, which originally capped the interest rates on payday and other loans for active-duty service members at 36%. In 2015, the law was expanded to cover revolving products like credit cards.

The change had a fairly limited impact on troops' wallets, according to a paper by Braga and his colleagues at Urban. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

The absolute riskiest borrowers appear to have felt the change more. After the reform passed, people with Vantage credit scores under 500 were less likely to have a credit card and saw their borrowing limits lowered. At the same time, their credit ratings and delinquency rates didn't improve, suggesting the group lost access to credit without much benefit.

One reason the 36% cap might not have had much effect overall is that, during the time period studied, relatively few people had credit cards with an APR above 36%. Today, with rates higher, the impact might be wider.

The cap Ocasio-Cortez and Luna have proposed would certainly bite much harder, and likely cut off access to credit for many millions more. Even among superprime borrowers with credit ratings above 720, average APRs are typically higher than 10%. There's also concern that companies might try to skirt a severe limit by charging new fees, though the bill tries to prohibit that.

Still, it's possible to imagine looser limits making some headway in Washington.

In 2019, for instance, a bipartisan bill that would have extended the Military Lending Act's 36% rate cap to all Americans was nearly reported out of committee but derailed by the pandemic. Politically, a bill like that could one day be ready for a comeback.

Oops, something went wrong

BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink orchestrated the Panama Canal port takeover that made President Trump happy, but the cost may be an angry Xi Jinping.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the Chinese leader is not happy with a $22.8 billion deal giving a BlackRock-led investment coalition control of two key ports on either end of the vital shipping lane currently owned by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison.

CK Hutchison, which is controlled by the family of 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, didn't seek preapproval from Chinese government leadership, according to the Wall Street Journal.

What's more, Chinese leaders hoped to use the ports as a bargaining chip with the Trump administration as part of larger talks between the two countries, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Other signs of displeasure emerged in articles and commentary published in pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao, arguing that Chinese ships would now face restrictions in the canal and accusing CK Hutchison of "prioritizing profit over everything, disregarding national interests and national righteousness."

The deal deserves "serious attention," Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, added earlier this week, without directly criticizing CK Hutchison.

The rumblings from Beijing add a new layer of complications to what appeared to be a big win for BlackRock's Fink, who himself reached out to the White House after Trump alleged Chinese interference in the canal and said he wanted to "take it back."

Fink argued to the White House that there would be no need to forcibly take the ports if BlackRock were to arrange a purchase on its own.

Trump referenced the deal during his address to Congress earlier this month while still reiterating that "my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal" and "taking it back."

It's not immediately clear what steps Hong Kong or Beijing could take to block the transaction, which isn't yet final and still requires consent from various regulators. The companies hope to sign a definitive agreement by April 2.

Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese authorities are examining the deal closely. Bloomberg said the review includes any signs of security breaches or antitrust violations, while the Wall Street Journal said officials have been told to see what Beijing can do to hinder the deal.

BlackRock's stock price would likely "see a little hit" if the pact falls through, according to CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert, but the bigger threat would be to the credibility of BlackRock's newly bolstered infrastructure group.

Last year, BlackRock paid $12 billion to buy private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners — a major investor in energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects — and GIP was part of the consortium that agreed to buy the ports at either end of the Panama Canal.

"There may be some pressure for this group to spin out or announce another deal to sort of regain some marketplace credibility," Seifert added.

The deal negotiated by BlackRock and GIP involves much more than just the Panama ports — it includes a total of 43 ports in 23 countries.

Fink, speaking at a Houston energy conference earlier this month, said there were some misconceptions about the deal as reported in the press. One was that BlackRock itself was buying the entire canal.

"My kids called me and said, 'BlackRock bought the Panama Canal? Can we go on it?' And I said, 'We did not buy the Panama Canal.'"

He also said the "far left" and "far right" didn't mention that there were many other ports in the deal, including six along the Suez Canal. "They mentioned we bought two" — the ones along the Panama Canal.

Those two ports, he said, represent 4% of the total value of the transaction.

He noted that ports do offer a great business for BlackRock, which will now have 100 in its portfolio if this deal goes through. They can produce returns of 15% to 16%, he said.

"Even with tariffs and other things, it means the ports will be quite active," he said.

This is not the first time CK Hutchison or Li Ka-shing, nicknamed "Superman" for his business prowess in Hong Kong, have faced criticism from Beijing.

When Li served at the conglomerate's helm in 2015, CK Hutchison faced backlash for diversifying its business to European assets. That's where the bulk of its revenue now currently comes from, according to Nikkei.

In an earnings statement on Thursday, CK Hutchison did not mention the ports deal but said that "geopolitical and trade tensions have ... risen significantly."

Victor Li, chair of CK Hutchison and son of Li Ka-shing, said in a statement Thursday accompanying the earnings release that the environment for CK Hutchison's businesses could be "both volatile and unpredictable" this year.

Oops, something went wrong

Chinese tech giant ByteDance has roughly two weeks to save its video app TikTok from a renewed US ban — and there are signs cloud computing giant Oracle (ORCL) could play a prominent role.

ByteDance faces a federal mandate to divest the popular social media app but won a reprieve from President Trump, who, on his first day in office, asked his attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days. If ByteDance can't find a buyer for TikTok's US operations, the ban passed by Congress will kick in April 5.

Vice President JD Vance told reporters this past week that a high-level agreement satisfying US national security concerns by early April was "almost" certain.

President Trump said last weekend that four bidders had emerged, but he didn't identify them. Names previously floated by Trump and others have included Microsoft (MSFT), AI startup Perplexity, a coalition of billionaire investors, and even the US government.

One prominent corporate name, however, keeps surfacing: Oracle.

The tech giant co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison already acts as TikTok's primary cloud provider and had attempted a prior purchase of TikTok that eventually fizzled during Trump's first term in 2020.

The app started routing its US traffic through Oracle's cloud in 2022 in an overhaul known as "Project Texas" that aimed to satisfy US regulatory demands to store Americans' data domestically.

Now Oracle is a leading contender to help rescue TikTok from its current predicament, the Information reported this past week. ByteDance's leaders reportedly want to retain a hands-on role with TikTok's operations in any such deal.

Bloomberg separately reported that an Oracle deal being mulled by the White House would task the tech giant with safeguarding Americans' data on TikTok in exchange for a stake in the company, while leaving app's algorithm in the hands of ByteDance.

TikTok and its CEO Shou Zi Chew have repeatedly objected to letting go of the app's proprietary algorithm. Neither TikTok nor Oracle responded to a request for comment.

On Friday, Reuters offered up yet another scenario involving Oracle. 

The news agency said the biggest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance may increase their existing stakes and acquire the US operations of TikTok as part of a new entity, while Oracle protects the US user data to ensure it is not available to China.

These investors include Jeff Yass' Susquehanna International Group and Bill Ford's General Atlantic. In such a scenario, Chinese ownership in the new business would drop below a critical 20% threshold needed to avoid the US ban.

"Every day there is another TikTok rumor," Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary, who is part of a consortium pursuing its own bid for the app's US operations, told Yahoo Finance this past week.

But "it doesn't matter what I want or what Larry wants," O'Leary said, referring to Oracle's Ellison. "What matters now is the narrative now between Xi and Trump," referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

"The question is, 'Does Xi want to sell TikTok, yes or no?'"

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, operates under Chinese Communist Party law, which requires it to share user data upon request.

US intelligence officials have expressed concern that the CCP could use Americans' data against them and use TikTok's algorithm to gain backdoor access to swaths of information on US citizens.

To address those concerns, former President Biden signed legislation last April requiring TikTok to divest or face a nationwide ban. The US Supreme Court upheld the law against a constitutional challenge from TikTok and TikTok users.

In effect, the statute outlawed app stores — like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) — and cloud services from offering the app for downloads unless it is controlled by a country that the US does not consider adversarial.

The law resulted in TikTok's short-lived shutdown on Jan. 20, Trump's first day back in office. That same day, Trump delayed enforcement of the divestment via executive order.

The order, which experts have said is legally dubious, opened a 75-day window for the Trump administration "to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way" for TikTok's US business.

Trump has said he is open to an extension of the 75-day pause if a deal isn't reached by the deadline. Trump is not empowered to repeal the law; new legislation to overturn the measure would need to be approved by a majority of federal lawmakers.

Vance told reporters this past week that "we'd like to get it done without the extension."

“I think the question is, what is the equity ownership of the new joint venture? Vance added. "How do you do the contracts for all the investors, the customers, the service providers? … The deal itself will be very clear, but actually creating those thousands and thousands of pages of legal documents, that's the one thing that I worry could slip.”

Trump has sent encouraging signals about Ellison playing a role in the TikTok situation.

"I'd like Larry to buy it too," the president said on Jan. 21, with Ellison standing next to him at a press conference held to announce a new $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure commitment.

"Larry, let's negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said as SoftBank CEO Masa Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also looked on.

"What I'm thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we'll give you the permit. And they'll have a great partner, the United States."

"Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President," Ellison said.

But Trump has also denied talks with Oracle when asked about the subject in late January after NPR reported that the company could be part of a TikTok deal.

"No, not with Oracle," he said then, adding that "I never spoke to Larry about TikTok."

CINCINNATI — More than a dozen small businesses across Cincinnati are receiving grants to help grow and overcome any obstacles they may face.

Each business will receive $20,000 from the City of Cincinnati's Commercial Tenant Improvement Program (CTIP) through the Department of Community and Economic Development.

“Helping to kind of create a more vibrant community and strengthening our regional economy would be the goal of our Commercial Tenant Improvement Program and relieving the barriers of really high construction and material cost that are being, you know, being realized right now by our small businesses,” said Gerald Fortson, senior community development officer for the city's Department of Community and Economic Development.

The grants are available to businesses that have been in business for at least one year within the city or are looking to relocate to the city.

This is the second round of CTIP grants the city has given out. In 2024, they provided grants to 11 local businesses.

One of the businesses receiving $20,000 is Selfie Cincy, located right downtown.

“We have a lot of different experiences all within this space,” said Amari Samya, CEO and owner of Selfie Cincy.

WATCH: Local business owners break down how these grants will help 

Selfie Cincy has nine different interactive rooms where customers can take all the photos and videos they want. With the grant money, Samya said they plan on moving to a new space with double the square footage of their current building.

“We'll be expanding to upwards of 15, which is like a big jump, and we'll be able to curate a space that is also meeting the need and demand of event space,” Samya said.

Renika Smiley and her business, Lusheous Collection, also received a $20,000 grant. They will be using the money to turn an old barber shop in College Hill into her dream boutique specializing in women's plus-size clothing.

“With me being a plus-sized woman, and me knowing how hard it is out there for us, I wanted to make sure that we have something of our own,” Smiley said. 

The new Lusheous Collection building will have a boutique in the front, and suites for other beauty-centered small businesses for rent in the back. 

“So we'll have more revenue come in and we'll be able to highlight other business owners and grow within College Hill,” Smiley said.

We asked both Samya and Smiley what it meant as small business owners to have opportunities like this grant to grow their business.

“A blessing, a huge huge blessing,” Smiley said. “It gives you a lot of confidence.”

“The grant opportunities, the city support, the support of the City of Cincinnati is very important to us cause it allows us to keep our footing and grow,” said Samya.
