Welcome to the weekend, folks. As ever, there's a new game of Wordle to enjoy. In case you need some help with it, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Saturday's puzzle (#1,372).

It may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that too.

What is Wordle?

Wordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. The gist is that there is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.

Wordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.

The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.

How to play Wordle

To start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard.

You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.

Wordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.

How to play Wordle more than once a day

If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.

In addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.

Some might say you've really made it when you have a certain number of social media followers, or a large-digit number in your bank account, but I think the true measure of success is when skilled manicurists make complex nail art in your honor. By that standard, Formula 1 has hit the big time.

If you're not familiar with nail art, it's a step (or 20) above the classic manicure. Nail artists use specialized gels and polishes to create 3-D sculptural effects on the tips of their clients' fingers. Nail art can be abstract, using magnetic polishes or chrome powders to make exciting patterns and textures, or it can be figurative, with designs based on themes like food, video games, fashion brands, or animals.

Or cars. I've seen plenty of car-themed nails before. Take a look around at any racetrack and you’ll see fans and engineers sporting checkered flags or the general paint schemes of their favorite teams, but when I saw Lisa Kim's recent set of Formula 1 nails, I knew F1 fandom had reached a new level.

Lisa Kim

Kim was kind enough to send me some photos of her latest work and answer my questions about creating it. The Australian artist began doing manicure art during COVID and is now in her third year of designing and applying custom sets. She told me she'd never done a car-themed set before, but when a client came in with a request for F1 nails, she was delighted by the challenge.

""I wanted to incorporate as many car-racing elements into it as possible. I wanted to include as many teams onto the 10 fingers as I could and hand-sculpt as much as possible,"" she says. ""I wanted to make it a nail set you've never seen before. I sculpted with 3-D sculpting gel, using models of Ferrari F1 cars from 2010–2015 as inspiration. Then I added a racing flag, tires with the LV [Louis Vuitton] logo painted around them, as LV is the year's main sponsor, as well as the racing helmets, spanners, and screwdrivers.""

Lisa Kim

All pretty detailed for someone who says she wasn’t even an F1 fan when the request came in. ""I did have to Google a bit for research,"" she admitted, but added that she's a fan now. While this was Kim's first F1 request, she says she tends to see more racing-themed nails when the F1 season starts, and she thinks it's a trend that will stick around, especially as more women get into motorsports. For now, Kim says she really only gets racing nail requests from women, ""Although I do want more male clients!""

If you're considering a custom set of your own, there is a cost. Kim says the pictured client's nails took about 10 hours from start to finish, and with an hourly rate of $110-$140 AUD per hour depending on complexity, showcasing your team loyalty won’t come cheap. But when you’re reaching for the chips at the GP viewing party, everyone is going to know you’re a real fan.

Lisa Kim

Personally, I love seeing these inroads of motorsport fandom into fashion and crafting culture. Pair Kim’s nails with the crocheted Ferrari sweater recently covered by Road and Track (with a hat-tip to yours truly, thanks very much) and you’ll be dressed to impress on the pit walk.

Online shopping for cars isn't a new concept, especially in a post-COVID world. But it could become even more mainstream if the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon, decides it's time to add used auto sales to its portfolio. It may be more likely than you think, considering Amazon already peddles new Hyundai vehicles to shoppers in 68 markets, including some US cities.

Hyundai and Amazon Online LaunchHyundai

Amazon considering used car sales, warranties, and more

“We’re adding more dealers, and we’re excited to add not just new inventory for those dealers but also used inventory,” said Fan Jin in talks with Automotive News. Jin is the director of Amazon Autos and revealed that the online superstore is “getting into used cars soon” following the Hyundai new car sales pilot program. And it isn't limited to car sales; Amazon Autos is bringing the entire dealership experience online. ""Our focus is really on dealers and how we serve the whole dealer—all that they want to sell in the way that they want to sell them,"" Jin says. That includes things like service contracts and maintenance packages, which are huge profit generators for dealers that often make more than the physical car itself does.

The case for online car sales is stronger than ever; it only makes sense for Amazon to get in on the action

The car sales world changed dramatically in 2020, as COVID-19 made online sales mandatory as opposed to a convenient option. If Amazon is considering moving into used car sales, they clearly have gleaned data that indicates it's worthwhile. Leveraging their already copious amounts of buyer info also allows more efficient and lucrative automotive advertising opportunities—a market apparently already worth as much as $30 billion, just in the United States. Combining all of that intel makes Amazon a great place to market cars, but there's even more value in selling aftermarket products—including warranties and service contracts—that buyers are likely to sign up for.

But even teraflops of data and advertising power notwithstanding, online car purchases are already popular. Outfits like Autotrader, CarGurus, et. all make substantial amounts of money doing exactly what Amazon is looking into. What's more, some analyses have concluded that the used car market will more than double in value by 2032 to a tremendous $885 billion. That kind of cash flow becomes impossible to ignore for a company always looking to grow, especially when Amazon seems poised to provide a more comprehensive shopping experience than the existing alternatives.

Final thoughts

There are still hurdles for Amazon as it tries to onboard dealers. For new vehicles, OEMs will be dipping their toes in carefully to ensure the brand is protected and presented well. Used vehicles will be less involved, but dealers will be closely watching their bottom line to ensure whatever traffic they're getting from Amazon's service recoups the cost of the service while paying dividends. No dealer is looking for ""just another listing service""—and Amazon Autos' scope seems to go a bit beyond that. Either way, Amazon's expansion will likely demand the competition steps things up, because rivals that offer less won't be around for long if they can't offer similar services.",yahoo
https://finance.yahoo.com,Diesel Engine Runaway Is The Scariest Thing That Can Happen To A Diesel Engine,https://autos.yahoo.com/diesel-engine-runaway-scariest-thing-202500094.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 20:25:00 GMT","Internal combustion engines are incredibly complicated machines that many of us interact with on a daily basis, but don't completely understand. You get in your car, turn the key or push the start button, and it starts up. Then you drive to your destination, and turn the key back or push the stop button and it turns off. If one of those events doesn't occur, you call the shop to fix it.

Under rare circumstances, diesel engines, especially turbocharged diesel engines, can experience a phenomenon called runaway, where turning the key or hitting the stop button doesn't turn the engine off. In fact, even after the key has been removed from the ignition, runaway can continue to worsen. This causes the engine to uncontrollably exceed its normal operating speeds until the engine fails or its fuel source is blocked. These incidents are rare, and usually occur in old, high-mileage diesel engines, but they are still terrifying and dramatic spectacles. After seeing a video that cited a diesel engine experiencing runaway as the source of ignition for the BP Texas City oil refinery explosion in 2005, I decided to do a deep dive into the phenomenon.

Important Background On Diesel Engines

Unlike gasoline-burning engines, diesel engines don't require a spark to burn fuel and operate. Most automotive diesel engines don't have any spark plugs; instead, diesel engines rely on compression to ignite the fuel. The combustion chamber inside each cylinder in a diesel engine facilitates combustion by housing air at extremely high pressures, which when compressed by the piston and combined with diesel fuel, heats up and ignites the fuel. This is why diesel engine blocks are almost always made of heavy cast iron, since cast iron has superior compressive strength and the ability to withstand intense thermal cycling.

Most diesel engines have glow plugs that function somewhat similarly to spark plugs, but don't produce a spark. These glow plugs are important tools that allow diesels to start right up, even in extremely cold temperatures. Low temperatures and a cold engine block inherently make it difficult for a diesel engine to fire since the air inside the cylinder needs to be very hot to ignite the diesel fuel. Modern diesel engines are designed to house glow plugs inside the cylinders right next to the intake and exhaust valves and use electricity from a vehicle's battery to heat up and glow hence the name glow plug. They reach optimal start-up temperatures in under four seconds, and computers control them to create the perfect temperature to induce combustion of the diesel fuel. Depending on operating conditions, some advanced diesel engine glow plugs can remain active while the engine is running to optimize the combustion process.

The Unique Operation Of Diesel Engines Makes Runaway Possible

Diesel runaway occurs when fuel is unintentionally introduced to the combustion chamber from a source other than the vehicle's dedicated fueling system. It causes the engine speed to uncontrollably increase in a self-perpetuating combustion cycle, since diesels only need air, fuel, and compression to fire. When a turbodiesel engine experiences runaway, the turbocharger feeds more and more air into the engine as it's continuously and unintentionally receiving fuel, creating the runaway reaction. Since no spark is needed for the engine to fire, turning the vehicle off, even removing the key, has no effect on the uncontrolled reaction.

Turbocharged engines, whether fueled by diesel or gasoline, can experience a phenomenon called blow-by. Blow-by occurs when compressed air and fuel in the cylinder bore is greater than the pressure in the oil pan, and fuel leaks past piston rings and down into the crankcase. Some blow-by is normal, but excessive blow-by is a sign of serious engine, more specifically piston ring wear or damage, especially on high-mileage engines. Since virtually all diesel engines are turbocharged, blow-by is virtually an ever-present possibility, and it also happens to be one potential cause of diesel runaway.

Causes Of Diesel Engine Runaway

Diesel runaway, though rare, most commonly occurs under a few different circumstances that are primarily classified as fueling failures. It can be caused by a fuel source other than the vehicle's fueling system unintentionally and uncontrollably entering a turbodiesel engine. The phenomenon of blow-by can unintentionally allow unburned engine oil to reach the combustion chamber, leading to an uncontrolled continuous fuel flow, causing the positive feedback loop that creates runaway.

Most turbochargers are internally lubricated by engine oil, and a blown seal inside a turbodiesel engine's turbocharger can cause motor oil to be unintentionally and uncontrollably drawn into the turbocharger intake. Once inside the turbo intake, the oil can enter the combustion chamber where it causes runaway. Failed diesel fuel-injection systems can also lead to the dangerous phenomenon.

I was recently introduced to the enthralling animated deep dives into chemical and work safety disasters published by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board on YouTube. The CSB's investigation into the devastating 2005 explosion at a BP oil refinery in Texas City, Texas which killed 15 workers and injured 180 others, cites a diesel pickup truck experiencing runaway as the source that ignited the explosion. In this freak accident, the diesel pickup truck was parked on the property when a disaster at the plant caused massive quantities of hot gasoline to spill. When the highly flammable vapor cloud that formed from the hot gasoline spill reached the idling diesel pickup truck's air intake, it caused diesel runaway that eventually ignited the vapor cloud causing the deadly explosion.

How To Prevent Diesel Engine Runaway

Diesel engine runaway is a rare occurrence, especially among the advanced modern turbodiesel engines that are now produced and sold on both the private and commercial market. Modern diesels often mitigate the likelihood of dangerous blow-by by using an oil separator that prevents volatile derelict oil from entering the combustion chamber.

Regular maintenance and inspection of key components such as turbochargers, fuel injectors, and air intake systems can preemptively catch a failing component that could lead to runaway. Always using the correct engine oil and fuel will create optimal running conditions for as long as possible.

Older, high-mileage diesel engines are at higher risk for engine runaway, but can be fortified against it by using a couple different techniques. There are aftermarket inline devices that shut off the engine's air supply at excessive engine speeds, thus halting the positive feedback loop that causes runaway. Some older diesel engines have a tube to ventilate extreme crankcase pressure which helps prevent flammable oils from leaving the crankcase and entering the combustion chamber. There are also some off-the-shelf oil treatment and stabilizer additives that can help to lubricate piston rings in diesel engines. This can improve the seal between the piston rings and the cylinder walls to prevent oil from entering the combustion chamber.

How To Stop A Diesel Engine Experiencing Runaway

The only way to stop diesel engines experiencing runaway is by either completely cutting off the fuel source, or the air source. Turning off the ignition and/ or removing the key will have no effect on the runaway reaction. Sometimes engines experiencing runaway can suffer catastrophic damage like seized bearings or broken rods that may stop the reaction without human intervention. Stopping a diesel engine experiencing runaway is a simple yet daunting task that can rapidly become impeded by fire, heat, or by fear of the terrifying reaction.

Stopping a diesel engine experiencing runaway is a dangerous task, and should be done at your own risk. The easiest way to stop a runaway is usually by choking it out, or finding a way to cut off the air supply. Blocking the air intake using objects like rags or t-shirts can slow down the engine speeds and choke out the engine before things get too bad. Some videos also show people using flat objects to block the flow of air into the turbocharger that's uncontrollably feeding the reaction. Fire extinguishers can sometimes be enough to eliminate the oxygen entering the engine, but this isn't always sufficient to stop the reaction.

When in doubt, remember that vehicles are replaceable, and humans are not. If initial attempts to inhibit the runaway reaction are not successful, get yourself and any other people as far away from the vehicle as possible and allow the reaction to run its course. Engine parts can dislodge or explode during a runaway reaction, so treat the situation seriously and call for help as soon as the risk of human injury due to the reaction is mitigated.

Cardoso lost control entering the top of Autodromo Velocitta's corkscrew corner and hit a barrier while sliding sideways; this lifted the No. 36 GT3 car, and his momentum sent him flying.

The right side tires barely grazed the track surface as it flew across the corner, starting its first rotation. Upside down, Cardoso flew through the air before hitting the ground on the lid of his car and bouncing back up into the sand barrels. He had at least five more points of contact with the ground before skidding to a stop, alternating from hitting the surface with the nose and the vehicle's roof mostly.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Exclusive: Inside Fox's Big Plan to Blow Up IndyCar,https://autos.yahoo.com/exclusive-inside-foxs-big-plan-193900846.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:39:00 GMT","Fox made waves among racing fans when the network announced in June of 2024 that it had acquired the television rights to IndyCar, but the major buzz started when it aired a trio of fun, driver-focused ads throughout the NFL playoffs. All three of the network's spots also aired during its broadcast of the Super Bowl, a move that sent a clear message: Not only is Fox going to broadcast IndyCar, the network is seriously invested in growing the sport's audience.

That commitment starts with the network's three-man booth, which carries over familiar analysts Townsend Bell and James Hinchcliffe from NBC's recent coverage of the series. The big change is at play-by-play, where Fox brought in F1 broadcaster and Drive to Survive staple Will Buxton. The move was a surprise to fans, but as Buxton tells Road & Track, it was a long time coming

""I got to do a couple of races when NBC had the rights to both Formula 1 and IndyCar,"" Buxton says. ""I loved it, I've always loved IndyCar, I've always been a huge fan of the series... I loved the vibe, I loved the atmosphere of IndyCar paddocks. I've been wanting to move to IndyCar for over a decade. My first forays, my first explorations out to the States back in 2012, when I was still working with Speed Channel, were done with the primary focus of shifting to IndyCar. It's taken a long time to come 'round, but it's something I've always dreamt of doing.""

As the effective voice of the series, the hire also makes Buxton the voice of the Indianapolis 500. That puts him in an unusual position. While he has covered 500 practice sessions for NBC, he has never actually attended the race itself. Buxton will call the race while experiencing it himself for the first time.

""That means everything... I had this sudden realization that I get to complete the triple crown this year, having done the Monaco Grand Prix, having done Le Mans as a pit reporter, and now the 500. It's beyond the wildest dreams of anyone. I'm very aware of the responsibility, I can't wait... I know that the emotions will be absolutely huge.""

It will also be Buxton's first time calling an oval race. He, Hinchcliffe, and Bell practiced broadcasting the race as part of a run of pre-season test broadcasts, and Buxton noted some of the unique challenges of calling a race on an oval.

""Just in those 50-odd laps that we were calling, the way that your commentary brain and race brain changes... You're not just looking at the battle you're focused on, maybe it's the battle ahead or the battle behind down the road, seeing how that's all played out. It's a very different skill set, and it's a very different demand. It's something I'm tremendously excited about and very much looking forward to.""

For Bell and Hinchcliffe, calling IndyCar is nothing new. Doing so with Fox is a different story, though. Both analysts see the network's interest in new ideas as a major differentiator.

""It's a fresh set of eyes,"" Bell says. ""They're the upstart in sports broadcasting, the L.A. guys that got aggressive and did things different and introduced the glowing hockey puck. I think there's that edge, that willingness to take chances. Maybe fail, maybe succeed, but not worried about going for it. They're putting their money where their mouths are by backing it up with huge resources.""

""It's been fun for me, and with [Hinchcliffe] and [Buxton], because we've thrown out ideas, which we've always done. Certainly, I have in my career. 'What if we did this, what if we did that.' Invariably, if it's an established network like NBC or a smaller one, sometimes 5 percent, 1 percent of those ideas see the light of day. It seems like in the past few months almost 100 percent of those ideas have been properly evaluated and considered. At least, I don't know, 50 percent of them have already been implemented. It's this fun time where, if you can think it, they're willing to try it or at least give it serious consideration.""

The ""FoxTrax"" glowing puck that the network debuted nearly 30 years ago was not universally loved, but it sent a message that the then-young network's sports division was willing to do things differently. Decades later, IndyCar is being broadcast differently, too.

""The biggest thing is coming in with a clean slate,"" Hinchcliffe adds. ""No idea was a bad idea, everything was up for debate, and open to be considered. For me, [NBC was like] walking into a well-oiled machine. It was what it was, it ran what it ran, etc. With Fox coming in, it's like [Bell] said, a fresh pair of eyes.""

Joe Skibinski

""It's the openness, to hearing ideas and trying things out. There's little inside baseball stuff to make this run smoother, all the way to things like [Buxton] coming up with this idea to warm up on couches from the paddock, which they've implemented as well. There's no idea too big or too small to throw out there that they won't consider.""

The three on-air stars are new to Fox, but producer Pam Miller is not. She has been with Fox since the network got a NASCAR deal in 2011, following time producing racing of all sorts on CBS and ESPN. Now moving back over to IndyCar, Miller is part of the team making sure that Fox plays to IndyCar's strengths rather than just copying its approach to NASCAR. As Miller tells R&T, the network is focused on highlighting key differences:

""Two things: The personalities, make them relatable, make people know by the time we get to May and the Indy 500 who they want to cheer for. Who's their guy or gal. The technology is also different. The speed is different, the approach is different.""

With those key items in mind, the Fox team can build a more cohesive brand identity for IndyCar that sets it apart from other racing series. Miller continues:

""[Fox is] giving IndyCar the best of some of the things we've seen in Formula 1, the best of some of the things we've developed in NASCAR, and finding [IndyCar's] own identity. That's the goal, it's an evolution, it keeps evolving, but we really want to make it digestible, entertaining, and make people connect with the drivers first. Then get into all the great technology, nuances, and strategy behind the scenes that make the races so exciting and so different than everything else. It has to have its own identity and its own niche.""

With two and a half months of regular IndyCar racing before the flagship Indianapolis 500, Fox is thinking about how to promote both the series on its own and its relationship with that tentpole event. Miller says that the promotion of the 500 has already started, but the network has plenty more planned over the next two months:

""The Josef Newgarden ad started the cadence, making sure everyone knows that he's won it twice in a row. You'll see us evolve with our technology over the next few weeks. You'll see us tell stories about Indy, you'll see us tell stories about how the traditions happened, what the traditions are. Educating the fans each week, in all our different shows, leading up to Indy. That's our goal: By the time we get to the Month of May, the fans are with us. They [will] know what the traditions are, who the drivers are to watch. It's the biggest sporting event in the world, and we want people to understand that and be excited for it. That's going to be the cadence and our goal each week as we move towards May.""

Fox's first IndyCar broadcast aired earlier this month. Like just about everything that airs on live television, it drew a few complaints. The most notable ones centered on problems with the network's graphics packages. International viewers were missing some graphics during the race. A heads-up display virtually implemented over a car's aeroscreen on an on-board view blocked high-value sponsor decals. Illustrated headshots of drivers, a controversial staple on Fox's NASCAR and NFL broadcasts, were as constant on the broadcast as they were out of place. Even series drivers joked about the off-key illustrations.

Not every problem is going to be fixed quickly, but the network moved quickly on all three of these. On Tuesday, the network told RACER that the technical glitch causing issues with the international feed is in the process of being resolved. Later in the week, the series shared revisions to its graphics package on social media. Not only did that post showed updates to the problematic heads-up display graphic, it demonstrated that the much-maligned illustrations had already been replaced by more conventional headshots.

The quick fixes are good, but the bigger news to come out of St. Pete was the TV rating. 1.4 million people watched the race on Fox, a 45 percent increase over the race's previous number on NBC. That makes it the most-watched IndyCar race outside of the Indianapolis 500 since 2011. In a major departure from every other major racing series in the country, every single IndyCar race is set to be broadcast live on Fox's main network throughout the rest of the season.

https://finance.yahoo.com,'Leno's Law' Aims to Relax Smog Rules for California Classic Cars,https://autos.yahoo.com/lenos-law-aims-relax-smog-180000038.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","California Senate Bill 712 aims to expand emissions exemptions to vehicles at least 35 years old.

The exemptions require the car to be insured as a collector car.

One of the bill's biggest backers is Jay Leno, to the point that it's been called “Leno's Law”.

Being a classic car enthusiast in the state of California is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, there are seemingly endless shows and meets, the weather is great, and there's always another barn find just waiting to be dug up out of the cobwebs and brought back to glory. On the other hand, forever idling in traffic isn't great, and getting an old car through emissions regulations can be tough. There's no solution on the horizon for the first part of that problem, but for the latter, there's maybe a chance that things could get a little easier.

What Is ""Leno's Law""?

California Senate Bill 712, set to go before the state's transportation committee next month, aims to provide a smog-testing exemption for cars built in 1990 and earlier. It can't just be a daily driver, either, but a vehicle insured as a collector car, and one of the biggest names in California car collection has put his weight behind the issue. In fact, SB-712 has picked up the nickname “Leno's Law,” as Jay Leno has been outspoken about the need to relax emissions regulations for classic cars.

California already had such an exemption in place back when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, a rolling 30-year exemption for older cars. This was pushed to the current pre-1976 regulation in 2005.

The average age of a car in the United States is between 12 and 14 years old, so cars that are more than 30 years old are only a small segment of what's on the road. Especially if insured as a collector car, as few of these machines are doing the kind of mileage that would have a measurable environmental impact. A vehicle that's at least 35 years old is already exempt from certain portions of the existing emissions test; the proposed bill just extends things to full exemption.

Rusty Blackwell - Car and Driver

At the same time, classic car enthusiasm supports a host of industries in California, everything from big-dollar restomod companies to mom-and-pop upholstery shops. About 14 percent of businesses in the Specialty Equipment Marketing Association (SEMA) are based in California, and California-based enthusiasts order replacement and refurbished parts from other shops all across the U.S. It's a multi-billion-dollar slice of the economy.

In neighboring Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona, a host of emissions regulations are more relaxed and often have exemptions built in for collector cars. In Nevada, for instance, there are special registration categories for collector vehicles, and many of them are exempt from emissions testing if driven less than 5000 miles per year.

Broadly, SB-712 appeals to common sense that would make life a lot easier for classic car owners in California. It can be tricky to get a European- or Japanese-market import through the emissions tests as they are written, and some shops will simply turn away older cars, as their technicians may not be trained on older smog compliance equipment. With the exemptions in place, keeping an older car on the road requires less red tape. Instead, all you need to worry about is getting up on time to make that early Sunday AM Cars and Coffee.

Pricing and availability subject to change.

Tesla is in trouble, and this time, it's not just about Elon Musk's latest headline-making moment. The company's electric vehicle sales are dropping fast, and that could put billions of dollars in revenue from a different part of the business at risk (along with its ability to compete in the EV market), as reported by Futurism.

What's happening?

Tesla's sales in Europe have taken a serious hit. In Germany, sales fell a staggering 76% in February compared to last year, according to Reuters. In France, they were down 26%.

According to Politico and Carbon Credits, the drop could also mess up a deal it made with carmakers like Toyota and Stellantis. Tesla sells carbon credits to these companies, helping them meet strict pollution rules in Europe. Last year, Tesla made $2.76 billion from these deals, a 54% jump from the year before. But if Tesla isn't selling enough cars, it won't have enough credits to sell, either.

Why does this matter for EV buyers?

If the company loses billions in carbon credit revenue, it might try to make up for it by raising prices or cutting costs in ways that hurt customers, like slower repairs or fewer upgrades.

On that note, Chinese automakers like BYD (Build Your Dreams), Nio, and XPeng are making cheaper electric cars with newer tech and features. Some models come with better driver-assist systems and fast charging, which is a big deal for buyers. BYD even passed Tesla as the world's top EV seller at the end of 2023, proving how much things are shifting — and Tesla's sales have now started dropping in China too, with a reported 28.7% drop across January and February year-over-year.

At the same time, some Tesla customers are stepping away from the brand because of Elon Musk's behavior and politics. Lately, Tesla has been dealing with protests at dealerships, more canceled orders, and a wave of social media backlash. Some longtime fans have said they're done supporting the company because of Musk

On top of that, a slowdown in Tesla's sales could hurt the broader shift to EVs. Fewer people might switch from gas cars to electric ones, which isn't great for efforts to cut pollution and address rising global temperatures.

What are some alternatives?

Plenty of other automakers are making reliable and affordable electric cars. Honda, Acura, Hyundai, and Kia are among brands that have been putting out EVs that compete with Tesla in range and price like the Prologue, ZDX, Ioniq 5, and EV6.

Ford's Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning have become increasingly popular choices, and Volkswagen's ID.4 is another hot pick, with the company also releasing a Volkswagen Bus-inspired ID.Buzz and investing in up-and-coming EV truck brands Rivian and Scout.

For budget-friendly options, BYD and UK's MG Motor are rolling out lower-cost models that are gaining traction, though they may not be available in all markets. Nissan's Leaf and Chevy's Bolt remain the top low-cost EVs in the U.S., with both retailing well under $30,000 and good driver satisfaction marks.

Hidden Square Body Truck Collection Unearthed in Pennsylvania

In Falls Creek, Pennsylvania, a gold mine of classic Square Body trucks and rare muscle cars has emerged, offering an incredible glimpse into the golden age of American utility vehicles. For enthusiasts of vintage trucks, collections like this are a rare and exciting find, showcasing vehicles that embody durability, style, and timeless appeal.

After a 210-mile road trip, car enthusiast Dennis Collins and his crew discovered the collection—a forgotten haven of 10 vehicles tucked away on an old property. Among the lineup were seven Square Body pickups, a New Body Style (NBS) truck, and two iconic muscle cars, all rich with history and collector potential.

The oldest truck in the collection is a 1971 Chevrolet Cheyenne, equipped with a 350 cubic-inch V8 engine. Surprisingly modern for its time, the Cheyenne boasts features like power steering and brakes, which made driving far more manageable compared to its mechanical counterparts of the era.

Sharing space with the trucks was a rare 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle convertible. What caught Dennis’s attention was the car’s California smog setup, a telltale sign of its West Coast origins. This detail only adds to the Chevelle’s uniqueness, as convertibles from this period are increasingly hard to find in pristine condition.

Tucked near the back of the site, the team discovered an all-black 1985 GMC Sierra, a rugged four-wheel-drive pickup with a manual transmission—a configuration highly sought after by collectors today. However, the highlight of the collection is a 1991 GMC Jimmy, one of the last models of its kind. With only 110 miles on the odometer, this Jimmy is a rare survivor and undoubtedly the crown jewel of the group.

Completing the lineup was a stunning 1963 Chevrolet Impala convertible, adding a touch of classic American muscle to the mix. These Impalas are treasured for their clean lines, open-top design, and association with Chevrolet’s storied history.

Many of these trucks and cars appear to have been sitting for decades, their value and rarity hidden until now. Vehicles like the Silverado, believed to have been idle since 1993 or 1994, tell a story of time standing still—a treasure for any restorer or collector.

Collections like this one not only celebrate America’s rich automotive history but also serve as a reminder of the enduring legacy of Square Body trucks. Known for their rugged durability and clean, boxy lines, these trucks have become some of the most coveted vehicles among enthusiasts today. For Dennis Collins and his team, the journey was well worth it, uncovering a collection that resonates with vintage truck lovers and muscle car fans alike.

From well-preserved GMCs to rare Chevelles and Impalas, this Pennsylvania discovery is a testament to the passion and pride that drives the car enthusiast community. Whether these vehicles return to the road or remain preserved for generations to admire, they stand as symbols of an era when trucks and cars were built to last—and designed to inspire.

https://finance.yahoo.com,How Three Tesla Vandals Were Caught By Law Enforcement And License Plate Readers,https://autos.yahoo.com/three-tesla-vandals-were-caught-172500805.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:25:00 GMT","While the Tesla Takedown movement and the resulting protests have remained peaceful, we've also seen several separate instances of anti-Tesla vandalism lately. Despite attempts to disguise their appearances, several of the alleged vandals have already been arrested. Authorities tracked them down pretty quickly, too. Based on recently unsealed court records, it sounds like a big reason they were able to do that was because automatic license plate readers are so ubiquitous these days, 404 Media reports.

Regardless of where you're driving and what you're doing, at this point, you have to assume your every public movement is being tracked. But the alleged vandals also reportedly gave away a lot more information on social media than they may have intended. Oh, and one person allegedly left fingerprints behind at the scene, which in this day and age, is just asking to be caught. Still, without the license plate readers and other security cameras, it's unlikely that law enforcement would have been able to piece together enough information to make arrests as quickly as they did.

Take the incident in South Carolina, where someone spray-painted ""Fu*k Trump"" and ""Long Live Ukraine"" on several chargers before throwing Molotov cocktails made out of beer bottles at them, setting a few on fire. While authorities were initially unable to identify the suspect, they did find what appeared to be a white male wearing a grey sweater, a black mask, black shorts, and black shoes on footage captured by a camera at a nearby restaurant. That person was also carrying something green.

Additional footage showed the suspect in the same area without the green object. Eventually, they figured out what it was — a cardboard carrier for Holland 1839 beer. They also found footage of someone wearing the same outfit getting into a white van in the parking lot of an outlet mall. They then used the mall's license plate reader to identify the van and searched the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles database for the license plate. That gave them a last name, while mall security was also able to provide an image of the suspect without a mask on.

Using an open source search that included social media, authorities were able to obtain a phone number that, in turn, matched with a man they were able to track further by searching for his name on another ""mobile payment app,"" presumably Venmo or something similar. Transactions listed as rent then gave authorities an address, allowing them to apply for a warrant to search his apartment and vehicle. There, they found what appeared to be the same sweatshirt worn by the Tesla vandal, as well as a receipt for Holland Lager 1839.

Same Story In Colorado

Another high-profile instance of anti-Tesla vandalism took place in Colorado, where, over several days, someone spray painted ""NAZI"" and ""FU*K MUSK"" on a Tesla showroom sign, vandalized multiple vehicles and threw a Molotov cocktail at a Cybertruck. The vandal walked to the Tesla lot and was dressed in all black with a hood up and mask on, which should have made them incredibly difficult to find. However, security footage found a car leaving a nearby parking lot around the time the vandal would have left the dealership. A license plate reader identified both the car and its owner.

Later, a second license plate reader alerted authorities that the same car was on the move again. Authorities followed the car to another Tesla showroom where the driver was seen wearing the same outfit seen in previous surveillance footage, along with carrying a similar bag. The driver didn't commit any crimes that time, but authorities arrested her anyway, believing they had enough evidence to tie her to previous instances of vandalism.

Meanwhile, the most egregious case took place in Oregon, where, in addition to throwing Molotov cocktails, the vandal later returned and reportedly fired ""an AR-15 style rifle with a suppressor"" at the same Tesla showroom. He allegedly made the mistake of leaving fingerprints on the wine bottles used to make the Molotov cocktails, but authorities also claimed to have tracked him down with the help of license plate readers.

Every Breath You Take

License plate readers aren't exactly new, nor are security cameras, although high-definition cameras that actually capture a usable image are a lot more recent. Still, even generally well-informed people may not realize just how much of their movement can actually be tracked, even without law enforcement having access to their phone's location data. Nor do they necessarily realize how much their social media presence reveals about where they live or where they go. Even a relatively small amount of information can give away far more than you ever intended.

If you aren't out there committing any crimes, at least theoretically, license plate readers shouldn't be a major concern, but that doesn't mean they can't be abused. Cops don't always follow the rules, and all it would take is a willing accomplice with the right access for an abuser to track a victim to their new address. Really, though, the more immediate concern is just how much information is available for free on the internet. A first name and a job can be all someone needs from a dating app to find your last name, and once someone has your name, they can find your social media accounts and possibly even where you live. Due to open property tax records, renting is typically safer than owning, but even a selfie by the pool can be enough for someone to find your apartment without much effort.

Odds are, anyone staying on the right side of the law — something Jalopnik strongly encourages — doesn't have anything to worry about. Still, by the time you realize that's not actually the case, it may be too late. At the very least, be sure to lock down your social media accounts and stop posting publicly on Venmo. Even then, you still need to be incredibly careful about posting anything that might even possibly include identifying details. For anyone looking to learn more about keeping themselves safe out there, whether you use dating apps or not, I've been a fan of Natalia Antonova's work for years and can't recommend her highly enough. At the very least, it's worth it to read up on online security a little more, even if you never need to use what you learn.

https://finance.yahoo.com,"Dollars to Donuts, Auto Racing Draws In Carmakers Despite the Cost",https://autos.yahoo.com/dollars-donuts-auto-racing-draws-170100452.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:01:00 GMT","From the March/April 2025 issue of Car and Driver.

The adage ""Win on Sunday, sell on Monday"" justified automakers' NASCAR efforts in the 1950s. But is boosting car sales still the reason manufacturers invest in motor racing? With sky-high budgets to compete in Formula 1, any additional sales attributable to a Sunday win likely aren't enough to cover the massive costs. Automakers unable to stomach the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual spending it takes to field a competitive F1 team have plenty of other racing series to compete in, but even sales linked to success in one of these still may not net enough of a profit to cover the expense of competition. However, factor in potential vehicle sales from brand exposure in racing with the earnings from sponsorship deals, potential prize money, and—in some series—revenue-sharing models, and motorsports involvement can help an automaker stay in the black.

Genesis

""The potential benefits can outweigh the costs,"" says James Picariello, senior automotive analyst at BNP Paribas, about F1 racing. Most F1 teams operate out of the U.K., a country that legally requires companies to disclose certain financial and accounting information to the public. Thanks to this, we know the true costs of fielding a modern F1 team. For instance, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 spent north of $530 million during the 2023 season but ultimately ended the year with more than $104 million in profits. Not all F1 teams are profitable, though. The Aston Martin– affiliated AMR GP, for instance, shelled out more than $300 million in 2023, only to end the season almost $37 million in the red after taxes.

TRACKING NEW TECH: Government regulations and consumer demand limit just how much of a race car's mechanicals make their way to an automaker's road cars, but competition continues to drive innovations that go beyond the track. Manufacturers may approach racing as a place to test proofs of concept or the general reliability of new technologies or ideas, be it in the form of a powertrain setup, thermal management, or a tire compound.

Chevrolet

Compared with F1, the tens of millions of dollars it costs to field a two-car team in the FIA World Endurance Championship's (WEC) Hypercar class and the International Motor Sports Association's (IMSA) GTP class is a relative pittance. Though the potential profits from top-level endurance racing are a fraction of those from a large global series like F1, so are the possible losses. For automakers, some of which have multibillion-dollar marketing budgets, operating an endurance-racing team at a potential small loss can be a risk worth taking to increase brand exposure and awareness.

Evidently, Genesis thinks so. In December, Genesis Magma Racing revealed the GMR-001 LMDh-spec endurance racer that will compete in both WEC's and IMSA's flagship classes starting in the 2026 and '27 seasons, respectively. Along with promoting the upcoming Magma line of performance vehicles, the effort aims to increase overall awareness of the barely 10-year-old luxury brand. ""Motorsport is known for raising brand awareness,"" says Genesis chief brand officer Luc Donckerwolke. ""But that's not the only factor. The main factor for me is to learn from motorsports and get experience and know-how for our high-performance products.""

Cadillac reentered endurance racing 25 years ago. Come 2026, a GM/Cadillac effort will contest Formula 1.

AT ALL COSTS: Since 2023, F1 has enforced a $135 million cap covering almost every aspect of the development and manufacturing of a team's car, the salaries of most team personnel, and garage equipment costs. The sport holds engines to a separate $95 million max. Starting in 2026, those caps will rise to $215 million and $130 million. There are no limits on driver salaries or marketing budgets. Thanks to generous sponsorship deals, ample prize money, and revenue sharing, F1 teams can operate in the black.

""We sold approximately 700 to 800 General Motors vehicles through our IMSA racing platform in 2024,"" says Meagan Quinn, a marketing manager for GM who works on Cadillac Racing. The company can track just how many sales are directly attributable to leads generated at on-site vehicle displays at races. ""If somebody tells us they're in the market right now, a dealer reaches out to them immediately,"" Quinn adds.

Though IMSA does not share attendance figures, association president John Doonan claims 11 of 12 events in the 2024 season had record attendance. Meanwhile, NBC Sports said last year that viewership of its IMSA broadcasts grew 37 percent in five years, with the network claiming more than 12 million viewers last season.

Cadillac

To Doonan, who before joining IMSA served as the director of motorsports for Mazda in North America, the continued enthusiasm for motorsports—including the growing interest in endurance racing—from automakers and fans alike is little surprise.

""For me, in my heart of hearts,"" Doonan says, ""the most authentic way to market and advertise an automobile brand is through motorsport.""

The pair of NASA astronauts only received an extra $1,430 for the nine-month ordeal, but at least a pod of dolphins gave them a warm welcome home. The paltry sum is a reminder that they are still government employees despite how high-profile and harrowing their occupation is.

Understandably, NASA doesn't give overtime, weekend or holiday pay to its astronauts on the ISS. It's not like the space agency can operate a weekly or daily commute to low Earth orbit so spacefarers can spend the weekend lounging at home on the couch. However, NASA pays a $5 per diem for incidental expenses. As a result, Wilmore and Williams received an extra $1,430 for their extra 286 days in space, according to the New York Times. Now, there isn't any way to have incidentals on the ISS. There isn't a mini-bar, and astronauts don't have to pay for meals. They did have to pay for laundry because there's no way to clean clothes on the ISS.

The Astronaut Spirit Will Never Die

NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is helped out of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft onboard the SpaceX recovery ship MEGAN after he and fellow NASA astronauts Nick Hague and Suni Williams, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov landed on the water on March 18, 2025 off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida. - Nasa/Getty Images

While Wilmore and Williams were rationing their clothes, engineers were attempting to figure out how to make the Boeing Starliner safe to return crewed. The spacecraft suffered from failing thrusters that could cause a loss of control in orbit. The worst case scenario had the Starliner tumbling into the space station, a catastrophe that would have destroyed the ISS and sent everyone onboard scrambling to escape on the other spacecraft docked to the outpost. The wait drastically lengthened the eight-day mission.

The underwhelming per diem has an annual salary to match. NASA astronauts are paid $152,258 a year, compensation that doesn't quite match the position of someone who could step foot on the Moon. For comparison, the salary of a member of Congress is $174,000. At the current rate, every astronaut will do more for the country than any given Congressmember over the next four years despite the potential cancellation of the Artemis program.

Wilmore, Williams and everyone else in the Astronaut Corps knew what they signed up for when they applied to join NASA. The space agency might be five decades removed from the Apollo era, but astronauts are still thrilled to live in space. The experience alone makes up for the hardships and lackluster pay. The Starliner crew enthusiastically did their duties to help keep the ISS running, like cleaning toilets, despite the predicament. They were willing to make sacrifices that engineers on the ground weren't to get their Boeing spacecraft fully functional. The Trump administration's indiscriminate cuts might kill NASA's return to the Moon, but the astronaut spirit will never die.

It was his first car…

Michael Kehoe was ready to buy his first car in 1980, and he was trying to decide between a 1980 Chevy Corvette and a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am. He had just graduated high school and had the cash for his first vehicle, and chose the Corvette. After having to sell it for tuition, he never forgot about the car, and finally found it.

Watch the latest Motorious Podcast here.

“My dad owned J&J Sheet Metal in Warren,” said Kehoe, who grew up in Sterling Heights. “I worked there in middle school and high school and saved every penny I earned.”

Kehoe got the Corvette red car that had been owned by a GM exec, who drove it for about six months before he bought it.

“It had 2,500 miles when I bought the car,” Kehoe said. “In 1980, the car was ultra-modern. The T-tops were mirrored. It cost $65 to undercoat the car. It is a four-speed stick shift.”

Three years after buying the car, he needed money to enroll in the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, and sold the car to pay for the first year of tuition. Selling the car wasn’t easy, as he described handing over the keys as being a devastating experience. After 11 years of schooling, he became on Orthodontist, opening Kehoe Orthodontics, and retiring in December 2020.

Kehoe got a phone call from his brother, Bob, last summer about a Craigslist post. His brother was certain the post was about the Corvette Michael once owned. Michael was sleeping when the call came in, but he jumped out of bed and checked. After some digging, it was verified to be Michael Kehoe’s Corvette.

“I repurchased the car in August of 2021 for the same price I sold it for in 1983. When I found this car, I was like a kid in a candy store. I was so excited,” Kehoe said. “It’s the sentimental value. The sentimental value is priceless.”

Kehoe is now very protective of his Corvette, and has a scrapbook of the history of the car. Including himself and the GM exec, the Corvette has had 5 owners and only driven 94k miles.

As an internationally-recognized Honda driver, Senna was conscripted to star in a series of commercials for the Japanese market, including this recently-uncovered ad for the then-brand-new fourth-generation Honda Prelude. I'm sure it was part of his contract with Honda to promote Honda products, but did he have to get so dang sexy with it?

""Driving, for me,"" says Senna, ""is a way of expressing myself; my personality, my character, my way of life. Driving safely and careful, with style and comfort, is my personal goal. Just move it.""

The baggy pleated pants and matching oversized turtleneck is pure early-1990s fashion, and Senna's elegantly disheveled hair tousles with carefree ease. The clean-cut Brazilian ace gives a wry smile and the smallest hint of a wink to let you know he's got his eye on you. His carefree laissez-faire lean on the trunk lid isn't begging, but it is a little slutty. This isn't an ad for a Prelude, this is one of the fastest men on earth doing his damnedest to convince you that driving a Honda is sexy. Look, I like the Prelude a lot, but Senna didn't have to get all bedroom eyes with it.

Senna had a stranglehold on the Japanese market in 1991, and as long as he kept delivering wins for the Honda home team in F1, he was the pride of the nation, despite being from Brazil. And the new Prelude was a pretty big deal, so Honda wanted to throw everything it had at the promotion of its new mid-tier sports coupe. With new electronic four-wheel steering and a 2.2-liter engine, yeah, it was almost as impressive to drive as it was to look at. With 197 horsepower in the uprated VTEC Si model, the Prelude was a quick and attractive little thing, much like Senna himself.

Lamborghini Urus Destroyed in Crash Involving a Mustang on I-95

According to The Auto Wire, a severe car crash involving a Lamborghini Urus and a Ford Mustang occurred on I-95 in Broward County, Florida. The collision left the exotic crossover severely damaged, raising questions about the events leading up to the accident and the aftermath.

Footage shared by NBC Miami revealed the devastating impact on the Lamborghini Urus, which had collided with a guardrail, leaving it nearly unrecognizable and destined for a parts yard like Copart. The luxury SUV, known for its high price tag and performance, now faces a significant insurance claim. In stark contrast, the Mustang appeared almost untouched from certain angles, though closer inspection showed flaring on the driver’s side fender, indicating more extensive damage along the vehicle's side.

Details about the crash remain scarce as NBC Miami did not provide specifics about the incident. Speculation suggests that some form of contact occurred between the Lamborghini and the Mustang, but the circumstances—whether speeding, road rage, or involvement of other vehicles—are unknown. The lack of clarity leaves room for various theories about how such a dramatic accident unfolded.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of cautious driving, especially during the warm summer months when road conditions can vary, and traffic incidents are more frequent. Drivers are urged to stay alert, drive defensively, and be mindful of their surroundings to avoid similar accidents. Factors such as aggressive driving, impaired judgment due to alcohol, and fatigue from long-distance travel contribute to the risk of accidents, making vigilance essential for road safety.

As the investigation continues, the focus remains on understanding the cause of the crash and preventing future occurrences. The collision on I-95 highlights the vulnerability of even the most robust and expensive vehicles when involved in high-speed impacts. The incident underscores the need for all drivers to prioritize safety and exercise caution on the roads.

In conclusion, the crash involving a Lamborghini Urus and a Ford Mustang on I-95 in Broward County serves as a sobering example of the potential consequences of reckless driving. The severe damage to the Lamborghini and the hidden extent of the Mustang's injuries illustrate the unpredictability and dangers of the road, reinforcing the necessity for defensive driving practices.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Honda Strikes Deal With Toyota to Avoid Tariff Risks,https://autos.yahoo.com/honda-strikes-deal-toyota-avoid-150000962.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Navigating roadblocks

Honda is making an unexpected move to navigate the shifting landscape of U.S. tariffs — buying hybrid batteries from longtime rival Toyota. The deal, reported by the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, allows Honda to sidestep hefty import tariffs on components sourced from China and Japan while giving Toyota’s new $14 billion North Carolina battery plant an early win.

A rivalry set aside for survival

Toyota and Honda have been fierce competitors for decades, battling for dominance in the hybrid market. But with the Trump administration’s new tariffs — including a 10% levy on Chinese imports that took effect this month and an expected jump from 2.5% to 25% on Japanese-built vehicles — Honda is under pressure to rethink its supply chain. Rather than absorb the costs or pass them to consumers, the company is securing 400,000 Toyota-built hybrid battery packs per year starting in April 2025.

2026 Toyota C-HR+Toyota

The move makes sense for both automakers. Honda, which sold over 308,000 hybrids in the U.S. last year, is planning to expand its hybrid lineup and needs a stable, tariff-free battery supply. Toyota, meanwhile, gets a major customer to help justify its massive battery investment in North Carolina. The deal also signals a broader trend of Japanese automakers reducing dependence on Chinese suppliers in favor of domestic or U.S.-based production.

Will Honda’s hybrids get a Toyota boost?

While details on which Honda models will use Toyota-supplied batteries remain unclear, the popular CR-V Hybrid is a strong contender. With Honda aiming to grow hybrid sales, securing a U.S.-based battery source helps ensure production remains uninterrupted, even if tariffs on foreign-built components continue to rise.

2025 Honda CR-VHonda

However, this isn’t an alliance in the traditional sense. Honda is simply purchasing batteries from Toyota without a reciprocal deal in place. Toyota’s North Carolina plant, covering over seven million square feet, will be a key supplier not just for its own hybrid and EV models but also for a competitor.

Tariffs force carmakers to adapt

Honda and Toyota aren’t the only manufacturers reconfiguring supply chains to avoid tariffs. Volkswagen and Porsche are weighing U.S. production to bypass import duties, while Volvo delayed the launch of the EX30 to dodge a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs. Meanwhile, domestic automakers like GM and Stellantis have already cut production at plants in Canada and Mexico, where tariffs could soon hit hard.

Final thoughts

For Toyota, the deal with Honda helps justify its $14 billion U.S. battery investment. For Honda, it’s a way to avoid price hikes and maintain competitiveness in a rapidly changing market. As trade policies continue to shift, more automakers may find themselves making similar unexpected partnerships to keep their businesses running smoothly.

Whether this deal evolves into something more remains to be seen. If tariffs continue to escalate, we could see further collaboration between automakers that once saw each other strictly as rivals. For now, it’s a pragmatic business decision — one that underscores just how much the global automotive landscape is shifting.",yahoo
https://finance.yahoo.com,1965 Buick Riviera on Bring a Trailer Is a Former Auto-Show Model,https://autos.yahoo.com/1965-buick-riviera-bring-trailer-150000325.html,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Back in the 1960s, Buick built genuinely beautiful cars. Perhaps the best of them was the Riviera.

The first-gen Riviera is widely considered the best of the lot, and the hidden headlights that arrived for 1965 make that year the pick of the first-gen cars.

This is a Gran Sport model, fitted with the most powerful V-8 on offer.

At the 1964 New York auto show, Buick showed off a refreshed version of its already stunning Riviera coupe. Formerly fitted with fixed quad headlights up front, the lights were now hidden behind clamshell covers, such that the car presented a cleaner appearance with a wide, unbroken grille. With the '66 getting a full redesign for a second-generation car, this was a one-year-only design and is now highly sought after. Now, you can get your hands on the exact model that dropped jaws when the covers came off in NYC.

Bring a Trailer





This 1965 Buick Riviera is the very same car that sat in Buick's display at the 1964 auto show, and it's up for sale on Bring a Trailer (which, like Car and Driver, is part of Hearst Autos). It's a Gran Sport model, which means a bump in power thanks to two four-barrel carburetors, and it's been recently refinished in its original Verde Green. Naming a car after the French Riviera might seem a bit high-falutin' for Buck's marketing department, but a car as stunning as this lives up to the implied European-style elegance.

Bring a Trailer





One noted Riviera fan was Leonard Nimoy, who bought his first car—an early 1963 model—and regularly drove it to the set during the filming of Star Trek. William Shatner had a Corvette, of course, just like the Apollo astronauts, but the man who played Spock wanted something that had a little more restraint along with V-8 performance. A Riviera was the only logical choice.

Bring a Trailer





This example had the same owner for four decades, a Naval fighter pilot who is said to have cared for it the way you'd expect. A comprehensive cosmetic refinishing in 2023 refreshed the paint and chromework, and also replaced the Gran Sport badging out back.

Underneath, the suspension has been gone through with replacement bushings and ball joints. The car has Bilstein shock absorbers, and while a Riviera is more luxury coupe than sports car, it should ride and handle quite well for a car from this period. The brakes are four-wheel drums.

Being a Gran Sport, this Riv's got the most powerful engine available, a 425-cubic-inch V-8 with the aforementioned twin carburetors. From the factory, it was good for 360 horsepower and a stout 465 pound-feet of torque. The V-8 was overhauled in 2012 and presents well. A three-speed automatic handles shifting duties, and the car wears its original 15-inch Rally wheels.

With a power driver's seat, power windows, and cruise control, this Riviera is a nicely optioned driver. As a single-year example, it'll be collectible, but more so it's just a fantastic looking machine that's set up to cruise as well as it did in the mid-sixties. It's the kind of car that might even get a smile out of Spock.

What do you do after amassing a fortune from cryptocurrency? Build a space station, of course.

That’s exactly what Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb is doing, according to a report by Bloomberg.

While crypto investors say they’re “going to the moon” when Bitcoin surges, McCaleb, a longtime industry pioneer, is aiming for the real thing.

“It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” McCaleb told Bloomberg. “There’s not that many folks that are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am.”

McCaleb’s $1 billion bet, entirely self-funded, is that Vast Space—the California-based aerospace company he founded in 2021—can build and launch a functioning station. The goal is to become a candidate to replace the International Space Station, which is scheduled for decommissioning in 2030.

McCaleb, who co-founded the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox in 2010, Ripple in 2011, and then Stellar in 2014, is now investing his estimated $3.2 billion fortune—largely from XRP sales—into Vast Space.

“This is a big, bold vision by Jed McCaleb,” Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen wrote on X. “America used to pursue new frontiers like this before skidding into bureaucracy and doubt. I’m rooting for Vast’s success.”

Vast develops artificial gravity space stations. Many of its employees bring aerospace experience, including refugees from Elon Musk’s SpaceX. These orbital habitats are designed to simulate gravity by rotating to create centrifugal force while offering the comforts of home.

The company recently revealed the final design for Haven-1, its first station module. To put Haven-1 into orbit, Vast is partnering with SpaceX, which will use its Falcon9 rockets to carry Vast’s Haven-1 modules into space. According to the Vast website, the first launch of Haven-1 is scheduled for May 2026 for a two-week mission above the Earth.

Haven-1/Image Vast Space

The concept of artificial gravity stations has long been a staple in science fiction, ranging from Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 sci-fi classic film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film ""Interstellar.""

While Haven-1 is a single module designed to operate independently or dock with SpaceX boosters, the next-generation Haven-2 is being developed as a modular system. Several Haven-2 units could be connected to form a larger, expandable station.

Public-sector space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are increasingly turning to private-sector companies to get the astronauts and the resources they need into space and back. McCaleb is among a growing number of private citizens stepping up to meet that need, including Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos.

They represent a growing roster of private companies and national space agencies—including Axiom Space, Blue Origin, Voyager Space, Airbus, and China’s CNSA—that are racing to build the next generation of space stations tailored for research, manufacturing, tourism, and long-term habitation.

https://decrypt.co,Swedish Film 'Watch the Skies' Set for US Release With AI 'Visual Dubbing',https://decrypt.co/311114/swedish-film-watch-skies-ai-visual-dubbing,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 16:01:03 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

When Swedish UFO film “Watch the Skies” hits U.S. cinemas this May, audiences won’t be able to tell that it wasn’t made in English.

The film is the first full theatrical release to showcase “visual dubbing” technology from AI firm Flawless, which enables actors’ performances to be digitally lip-synced with foreign-language dubs.

“Watch the Skies” follows rebellious teenager Denise, who teams up with a club of UFO watchers to solve the mystery of her missing father. The film was shot in Swedish, and released there under the title ""UFO Sweden."" However, for its U.S. release, the original cast have re-recorded their performances in English, with Flawless using its TrueSync machine learning technology to digitally alter their lip movements so that they sync up with the English dialogue.

“Flawless and their technology gives us the opportunity to release the film for a much larger audience,” said writer-director Victor Danell in a making-of featurette.

The filmmakers stress that the use of the technique has “full endorsement from SAG,” the actors’ union, which went on strike in 2023 amid concerns over the “threat” posed by AI to the profession.

“A lot of filmmakers and a lot of actors will be afraid of this technology at first, but we have the creative control, and to act out the film in English was a real exciting experience,” said Danell, adding that, “It’s still our movie, it’s still the actors’ performance, and that’s the key part.”

What is TrueSync?

In a 2023 presentation, Flawless co-founder Scott Mann explained that the company’s TrueSync technology uses deep learning to create a volumetric 3D representation of the actors’ faces throughout a film, which can then be altered to match the dubbed dialogue.



TrueSync was previously used on the 2022 film “Fall” to remove swearing for a PG-13 edit, while another of the company’s products, DeepEditor, enables an actor’s performance to be extracted from one scene and applied to another scene, without the need for reshoots.

The company has partnered with distributor XYZ Films to release a slate of features localized using TrueSync, including “Run Lola Run” director Tom Tykwer’s upcoming “The Light,” horror feature “Vincent Must Die,” and South Korean film “Smugglers.”

https://decrypt.co,This Week in Bitcoin: Volatility Rises as ETFs Rebound and SEC Gives OK to Mining,https://decrypt.co/311107/this-week-bitcoin-volatility-rises-etfs-rebound,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:14:51 GMT","It was another up-and-down week for Bitcoin, after news from the central bank sent the biggest cryptocurrency up, then back down again. And we've basically landed right back where we started.

Right now, Bitcoin's price now stands at $84,150 per coin after not budging over a seven-day period, according to CoinGecko data. It's up 0.2% on the day, but totally flat on the week.

The asset jumped briefly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that everything was under control and that President Trump's tariffs would have a ""transitory"" effect on inflation.

Bitcoin had been dipping—just like stocks—whenever President Trump abruptly announced tariffs over the past month. But investors seemed to like the news from Powell.

ETF action

American Bitcoin investors had been fast cashing out of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, but that all changed this week, Farside Investors data shows.

Every day this week, money has flooded back into the new vehicles, with over half a billion entering the funds by Wednesday. About $734 million worth of funds reentered Bitcoin ETFs this week as investor sentiment has changed as speculators expect interest rates to lower this year.

Note that the positive sentiment hasn't extended to all crypto ETFs, as Ethereum funds are collectively nursing a now 13-day losing streak (including Friday's fresh data)—even as Bitcoin funds show green over the last six days.

Choppy waters here to stay

Still, investors could still be in for a bumpy ride as data shows that Bitcoin's volatility is at a six-month high due, as worries about the U.S. economy and geopolitical tensions push people to adopt a more ""risk-off"" mindset.

Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt that volatility—in the short-term, at least—was likely here to stay.

SEC continues to clean up 'mess'

And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it would put right the previous administration's ""mess"" by being clearer on rules for the digital asset industry, made a statement that applies to Bitcoin mining: proof-of-work mining operations do not need to register their actions as they ""do not involve the offer and sale of securities.""

According to the regulator, as a miner's ""expectation to receive rewards is not derived from any third party's managerial or entrepreneurial efforts upon which the network's success depends,"" the activity does not come under the SEC's jurisdiction.

Under crypto-friendly President Donald Trump, the regulator appears to be adopting a more relaxed approach to the space, and and has already scrapped a number of lawsuits and investigations targeting firms in the space.

BlackRock talks Bitcoin

Meanwhile, BlackRock—the world's biggest asset manager—has tried to clear the air about Bitcoin... again. In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, the firm's Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said that calling the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap a ""risk-on"" asset was not exactly accurate.

""What we've seen lately seems to be self-fulfilling and actually a self-inflicted wound by some of the research and commentary that the industry does, leaning into this idea of it as a risk-on asset at times,"" Mitchnick said.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has been one of the most successful BTC ETFs since its launch last January. Is the Wall Street giant trying to get more clients for its fund?

https://decrypt.co,Elon Musk and DOGE: What You Need to Know About the Department of Government Efficiency,https://decrypt.co/291957/elon-musk-and-doge-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-department-of-government-efficiency,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:49:57 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is helming a new U.S. government initiative aimed at lowering the federal budget deficit.

Called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the initiative—which has an acronym identical to the ticker of Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin—will “slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” according to President-elect Donald Trump.

Here's everything you need to know about DOGE.

What is DOGE?

DOGE is a U.S. government initiative that Elon Musk first tweeted about in August.

Musk originally intended to run the agency alongside fellow billionaire and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. However, Ramaswamy stepped back from DOGE in January, amid reports he planned to run for Ohio governor.

While the project initially appeared to be a joke—created as a gag, and unsurprisingly pumping the price of Dogecoin whenever mentioned by Musk—Trump threw his support behind DOGE’s push to curtail government spending, saying that the once-fictitious department would actually become a real-life U.S. government-affiliated entity.

“Together, [Musk and Ramaswamy] will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies—essential to the 'Save America' movement,"" Trump said in a statement.

The project will be active until “no later than July 4, 2026,"" Trump said; that’s the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

President Donald J. Trump announces the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — headed by @elonmusk and @VivekGRamaswamy pic.twitter.com/Ya2o45qlV8 — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) November 13, 2024

Notably, DOGE is not an official U.S. government department in the traditional sense, as only Congress—not the president—can approve the creation of new federal government departments, according to the U.S. Congress’ website.

Rather, Musk's meme-linked brainchild will exist “outside” of the government system, Trump said. That means DOGE will likely not receive government funds. It also means that the project's ability to directly control U.S. government agency budgets will be minimal, although DOGE’s directives could be implemented by Trump's supporters in Congress.

Who is running DOGE?

Musk is leading the charge at the Department of Government Efficiency. He will not receive compensation for his work, according to a Twitter post that Musk published.

Musk, of course, is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and the owner of X—the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

Indeed, this will be tedious work, make lots of enemies & compensation is zero. What a great deal! 😂 https://t.co/16e7EKRS6i — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 14, 2024

The initiative is staffed and shepherded by at least 30 people, ProPublica reported. Its roster includes former X and SpaceX employees, venture capitalists, lawyers, and young tech founders.

Meanwhile, billionaire Marc Andreessen of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz has been recruited to act as DOGE’s “key networker for talent recruitment,” the Washington Post reported, citing an anonymous source.

Musk has also allied with several Silicon Valley bigwigs to address “technical challenges to collecting data about federal employees and programs”—a major problem that the initiative aims to resolve, according to the same report. Those advisors include Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the paper reported, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia is also consulting for DOGE.

What does DOGE actually do?

DOGE’s mandate is to streamline the U.S. government by issuing reports that provide advice and guidance on trimming government regulations and spending, according to Trump.

“Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that. We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook,"" Musk said in October at a rally for Trump at New York City's Madison Square Garden.

The quasi-department plans to accomplish that task by pushing its cost-cutting proposals through Congress. Musk and Ramaswamy could also present their ideas directly to Trump, who has the power to circumvent Congress and issue executive orders that would call for the implementation of DOGE directives.

While critics have expressed doubts as to how much change DOGE will be able to effect, it has become increasingly likely that its budget-slashing measures will get at least some play in Congress. In late November, GOP congressmen formed the Congressional Delivering Outstanding Government Efficiency (DOGE) Caucus, which will champion DOGE directives on Capitol Hill.

Musk has given differing statements over the extent to which the U.S. federal government's spending should be slashed. He previously suggested reducing federal expenditures by $2 million—a third of the U.S. federal government's total budget.

However, he has since backtracked on his grandiose claims, saying in January that cutting $2 trillion from the federal government was actually unlikely. He called it a ""best-case scenario"" in a video interview on X, but said instead that there's a ""good shot"" of finding $1 trillion worth of cuts.

Despite the uncertainties, DOGE's work is well underway. Under Musk, the initiative has slapped an agency tracking U.S. students’ academic progress with $900 million in cuts, along with slashing more than $100 million for funding DEI initiatives spearheaded by the Education Department.

Its plans also include axing scores of federal government employees and several U.S. agencies, such as the Department of Education and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to cut costs. An NBC News report in February said that DOGE will use AI tools to evaluate federal employees to determine whether or not they should keep their jobs. This comes after Musk's headline-dominating emails to employees, demanding that they share what they'd accomplished the previous week.

“The magnitude of the [government funds] waste is beyond what the public could possibly imagine,” Musk tweeted last November, referencing U.S. federal government spending, which topped $6 trillion in 2023.

To facilitate its cost-cutting efforts, DOGE has gained access to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's systems, which distribute roughly $5 trillion in payments to federal workers and other payees.

However, 13 states sued DOGE in February to block its access to those government payments systems, leaving unclear the extent to which Musk's team has access to federal data.

Why is it called DOGE?

The faux department's initialism, DOGE, appears to be a cheeky reference to the ticker for Dogecoin (DOGE), a high-market-cap meme coin beloved by Elon Musk. That link was reinforced by an official t-shirt sold by Trump featuring the president-elect, Musk, and a Shiba Inu dog.

BREAKING: Trump campaign launches D.O.G.E. merch. with a shiba inu on it. pic.twitter.com/lAPpDWAKtM — DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) November 8, 2024

The meme, which is famous for its Shiba Inu mascot, was invented in 2013 by a pair of software engineers. Musk has said that he owns a “bunch” of Dogecoin, and he has tweeted and spoken about the coin routinely over the past years. He even called himself the “Dogefather” in 2021 and mentioned the coin while hosting Saturday Night Live.

Dogecoin's value climbed amid Musk’s support for Trump on the campaign trail, and then skyrocketed after Trump’s win and amid the official announcement of DOGE leadership. The coin hit a three-year-high price in December and has helped spur other notable meme coins to surge in value, as well.

In January, the official DOGE government website displayed the familiar Doge meme image—a move that helped pump the coin yet again. However, it was a short-lived jump that was reversed when the image was pulled the following day.

Musk's DOGE push has proven to be divisive amongst ardent fans of the Doge meme and Dogecoin, as Decrypt reported in March, as the agency's cuts carry political weight and have potentially dramatic consequences—a real shift from the fun, vibes-driven approach of the community.

What's the latest on DOGE?

DOGE's deep cuts to federal government agencies’ workforce have continued in recent weeks.

As of this writing, the initiative claims to have terminated more than 5,600 government contracts worth $20 billion, and also claims to have scrapped 7,616 grants worth roughly $18 billion for the Department of Education, Environmental Protection Agency, USAID and the Department of State, among other agencies, according to the DOGE website.

In early March, Musk's team caused a major uproar when it successfully pushed for President Trump to order the Department of Education to terminate nearly 50% of its workforce.

Experts expect the cuts to complicate the maintenance of the federal financial aid system, including the authorization of new loans. The department's resources for fielding thousands of student and teacher harassment and discrimination complaints have also been largely stripped.

Beyond the staffing cuts, DOGE has courted controversy elsewhere.

DOGE has received access to Treasury Department records on millions of Americans’ personal data, including bank account numbers and Social Security numbers, the Washington Post reported in early February.

The publication also reported that DOGE has fed sensitive information into AI software to guide its federal spending cut proposals.

A federal judge in early February moved to block DOGE’s digging, however. And for a few weeks after the order was issued, DOGE workers were no longer allowed to wield their influence over the Treasury system, while all records that the team copied so far were ordered to be destroyed.

However, a federal judge in early March sided against the complaint, fueling the DOGE team’s hopes that it might continue using government data for its cost-slashing initiatives. A court battle over the extra-governmental department’s access to the sensitive information is still brewing, leaving it unclear whether DOGE will continue to have access to federal government data.

Outside of the courts, challenges to DOGE's work have also emerged. Notably, President Donald Trump allegedly told Cabinet secretaries in early March that they—not DOGE—would have final say on staffing decisions across federal agencies.

Meanwhile, other lawmakers have also taken aim at reigning in DOGE. U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee called “Delivering on Government Efficiency” held its first meeting on February 12. During the meeting, Democrats alleged that Musk is violating laws to pare down the government's spending, while Republicans contested that assertion.

https://blockonomi.com,This $0.02 Crypto Is Gaining Momentum—Could It Be the Next Big Breakout?,https://blockonomi.com/this-0-02-crypto-is-gaining-momentum-could-it-be-the-next-big-breakout/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 08:00:53 GMT","As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, early-stage tokens with solid use cases and strong investor backing often present the best growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly attracting attention, drawing comparisons to some of the most successful tokens in the market. With a structured DeFi framework, an expanding community, and impressive presale traction, many are wondering: Could MUTM rise to prominence like other top-performing assets?

Understanding Mutuum Finance

Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform that facilitates lending and borrowing, offering sustainable financial solutions within the DeFi sector. Unlike speculative tokens driven purely by hype, MUTM operates within an active ecosystem, ensuring continuous token demand.

Through the platform, users can either supply assets to earn passive income or borrow funds by securing collateral. This dual utility fosters long-term stability, as increased borrowing activity boosts liquidity usage while rewarding lenders with competitive returns.

A standout feature of Mutuum Finance is its mtTokens system, which allows users to generate passive income without relying on traditional staking models that can dilute token value. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, which automatically accumulate interest over time—growing in redemption value without requiring active trading.

Mutuum Finance also incorporates a buy-and-distribute mechanism using platform fees to repurchase MUTM tokens, ensuring continuous buy pressure. These tokens are then redistributed to mtTOKEN holders, incentivizing participation and reinforcing sustained demand as the platform expands.

Strong Presale Performance and Future Price Potential

The Mutuum Finance presale has been highly successful, already raising over $4.25 million, with 55% of Phase 3 sold out. The current token price stands at $0.02, but with each presale stage featuring structured price increases, early investors are securing entry at the lowest available rates before widespread market exposure.

The upcoming phase will introduce a 25% price hike, making this one of the last opportunities to acquire MUTM at a discounted rate. With the launch price set at $0.06, investors who enter now could see an immediate 3x return upon listing—even before potential post-launch momentum takes effect.

Could MUTM Replicate the Success of Top-Tier Tokens?

Dogecoin, which began as a meme coin, gained significant adoption due to its strong community and expanding real-world use cases. Mutuum Finance offers an even stronger value proposition—a structured financial model that drives continuous demand through its lending ecosystem.

Additionally, the Mutuum Finance team is actively developing an overcollateralized stablecoin that will enhance liquidity and expand borrowing options. This additional utility is expected to attract more users, further strengthening MUTM’s market demand while reinforcing price stability.

Furthermore, upcoming exchange listings are set to increase visibility, boost liquidity, and accelerate adoption. Once MUTM is listed on major platforms, its market reach will expand significantly, potentially triggering a strong price surge.

With a well-structured DeFi model, strong presale momentum, and rising investor interest, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of the most promising tokens of 2024. The low entry point of $0.02 combined with a guaranteed 3x return at launch makes it an attractive opportunity for investors seeking both short-term gains and long-term growth.

As the project continues to evolve, MUTM could solidify itself as a major player in the DeFi sector, following in the footsteps of past crypto success stories. For those looking to capitalize on a high-potential token, now may be the ideal time to secure a position before the next presale phase sells out.

https://blockonomi.com,Rexas Finance Crypto Price Prediction: Why RXS Has a Higher Ceiling Than Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2025,https://blockonomi.com/rexas-finance-crypto-price-prediction-why-rxs-has-a-higher-ceiling-than-solana-sol-and-shiba-inu-shib-in-2025/,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:39:14 GMT","Reflecting more general market anxiety, Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have seen dramatic falls as of February 28, 2025. Investors increasingly seek alternatives offering tangible use cases and long-term growth potential. Among these, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out as a unique initiative since it positions itself as a significant participant in the crypto market by using real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing. With its original value offer, RXS should surpass SHIB and SOL in 2025.

The Struggles of Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)

Solana has shown notable volatility. On February 24, it dropped below $150 and reached its lowest price for the year—$137.77. This slump persisted until SOL dropped to $126 before rebounding to $145. Worries over network disruptions, security flaws, and more general economic issues exacerbated Solana’s problems, along with a 36.28% monthly drop.

Once driven by community buzz, Shiba Inu has also witnessed a sharp fall. Its price dropped 24%, from $0.000019 to almost $0.000013. As transaction volumes drop and investor interest declines, this bearish trend emphasizes SHIB’s reliance on speculation rather than utility. The company’s inability to sustain critical support levels further questions its long-term survival.

Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Is Poised for Greater Growth

While Solana and Shiba Inu battle market demands, Rexas Finance is becoming one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies in 2025. Built on a firm foundation of real-world asset tokenization, RXS allows investors to hold fractional shares of real estate, commodities, and other valuable assets via blockchain technology, unlike meme currencies or network-reliant initiatives. Experts estimate that the RWA tokenizing market will surpass $50 billion by the end of the year, establishing Rexas Finance as a leader in this rapidly expanding field. RXS has attracted notable investor interest and demand by offering actual economic value and fixing conventional financial inefficiencies. Launched in September 2024, the RXS presale has been unprecedentedly successful, rising 567% from its starting price of $0.03 to its present price of $0.20. Sales of over 453 million tokens have generated $46.89 million, and Stage 12—its last presale stage—is now 90.90% complete. The outstanding presale performance shows great investor belief in the project’s long-term viability. Analysts credit RXS’s success to its concrete use cases, elevating it beyond speculative value. Unlike many crypto initiatives that depend on hype, Rexas Finance provides a complete ecosystem, including staking, yield farming, and distributed governance. Its adaptability makes it one of the most well-rounded blockchain initiatives to watch in 2025.

Unique Features Driving Adoption

With its creative tools, the Rexas Finance ecosystem continues to grow and attract developers and users. The Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot let companies and individuals quickly develop and use their tokens, hastening the acceptance of blockchain-based asset ownership. Furthermore, the Rexas Launchpad is an indispensable financial venue for developing blockchain initiatives. The Launchpad gives early-stage funding prospects so RXS holders can access high-potential projects before they find general use. Rexas Finance’s ability to be a natural participant in the DeFi and startup funding scene has helped to define it. The project has also created buzz with its $1 million RXS token giveaway, in which 20 participants would receive $50,000 worth of RXS apiece. The giveaway has raised involvement and reinforced community interest in the token, with over $1.58 million in entries.

Anticipation for the June 19th Exchange Listing

One of the main drivers of the price increase is RXS’s upcoming June 19, 2025, exchange listing. On at least three of the top 10 exchanges worldwide, the token will open at $0.25, guaranteeing instantaneous liquidity and exposure to a more extensive investor base. High-utility tokens have historically experienced significant increases following the listing; analysts predict RXS will follow in the same direction. Given the presale’s incredible momentum, analysts estimate a notable price swing once RXS becomes generally available for trading.

RXS vs. SOL and SHIB: A Higher Ceiling for Growth

Although Solana and Shiba Inu still face market challenges, Rexas Finance is one initiative with a better 2025 growth ceiling. Real-world use cases, a burgeoning ecosystem, and high investor demand distinguish RXS from conventional altcoins and speculative meme coins. Given the tokenization of actual assets, which is expected to transform the financial sector, Rexas Finance is positioned for long-term success. As RXS prepares for its exchange launch, the project can surpass Solana and Shiba Inu and rank among the top winners in the upcoming crypto bull run.

Cosmos (ATOM), often heralded as the “Internet of Blockchains,” has made significant strides in enhancing interoperability, further cementing its role as a key player in the decentralized ecosystem.

Meanwhile, BinoFi’s record presale and hybrid exchange innovation have made it a standout investment opportunity. Here’s a closer look at what makes these two projects the talk of the crypto world this March.

Cosmos (ATOM) Drives Blockchain Interconnectivity to New Heights

Cosmos has long been recognized for its mission to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems, and its recent advancements continue to push boundaries.

The rollout of Interchain Enhanced Protocols (IEP) introduced more sophisticated tools aimed at facilitating seamless interaction between blockchains within its ecosystem. This update builds upon the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, making cross-chain transfers faster, more secure, and scalable.

BinoFi Becomes 2025’s Rising Star with Hybrid Exchange Innovation

While Cosmos focuses on connecting the blockchain world, BinoFi is revolutionizing how it’s accessed and traded. The platform’s hybrid exchange model, which blends the best features of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges, has garnered significant attention from the crypto community.

What sets BinoFi apart is its ability to resolve longstanding issues in crypto trading, such as liquidity fragmentation and high transaction fees. Its cross-chain trading capability enables users to trade assets across multiple networks without relying on wrapped tokens or third-party bridges. Combined with AI-powered analytics, users can make better-informed trading decisions, enhancing their profitability.

Security is another pillar of BinoFi’s popularity. Its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets ensure funds remain safe while giving users full custody of their assets. The platform also eliminates gas fees for transactions, a feature that has been especially appealing to traders who seek efficiency without added costs.

BinoFi’s presale, which recently crossed the 20-million token mark at $0.02 per token, has been nothing short of a phenomenon. With early adopters looking at an launch price of $0.30, investor enthusiasm is peaking.

When projections hold true, early participants could enjoy returns of over 1,400%, right out the gate. This meteoric interest reflects trust in BinoFi’s ambitious roadmap and its potential to dominate the crypto exchange market.

Cosmos and BinoFi Lead the Charge Toward an Interconnected Future

March 2025 serves as a reminder that innovation in blockchain isn’t slowing down. Cosmos (ATOM) continues to act as the bridge for blockchain networks, expanding the boundaries for developers and institutions alike.

At the same time, BinoFi is transforming how digital assets are traded, making it easier, safer, and more profitable to participate in the crypto ecosystem.

For investors, both projects offer something unique. Cosmos provides a foundation for the future of blockchain interoperability, while BinoFi delivers a glimpse into the next generation of trading platforms. Together, they represent the evolving opportunities in a fast-changing industry, making 2025 an exciting year for seasoned investors and newcomers alike.
