                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, mounting evidence suggests that this approach may be insufficient for patients with mild but symptomatic carotid stenosis. Despite being classified as 'low-risk' due to having less than 50% carotid artery narrowing, a significant number of patients with mild carotid stenosis continue to experience recurrent ischemic events, even when receiving appropriate medical therapy. To address this gap, a team including Lecturer Daina Kashiwazaki and Dr. Satoshi Kuroda from Toyama University, Japan, aimed to tackle this knowledge gap via their 'Mild but Unstable Stenosis of Internal Carotid Artery (MUSIC)' study. This multicenter prospective cohort study, which was published online on February 21, 2025, in the Journal of Neurosurgery, investigated the clinical features, radiological findings, and treatment outcomes of patients with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis. The researchers enrolled 124 patients who had experienced cerebrovascular or retinal ischemic events ipsilateral (same side) to mild carotid stenosis. While all participants received the best medical therapy (BMT) for their condition, carotid endarterectomy (CEA)-the surgical removal of plaque-or carotid artery stenting (CAS) was performed in 63 patients. The findings were quite striking: approximately 81% of patients had radiologically unstable plaque, with 59.5% exhibiting intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). Additionally, the incidence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke was markedly higher in the group receiving only BMT compared to those who also underwent CEA (15.1% vs. 1.7%). "The distinctive clinical and radiological features in high-risk patients strongly indicate that plaque composition, namely IPH, but not degree of stenosis, plays a key role in subsequent ischemic events in patients with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis," explains Kashiwazaki. This study challenges current medical guidelines, which typically do not recommend CEA for patients with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis. The results demonstrated that CEA significantly reduced the incidence of both primary and secondary endpoints during the two-year follow-up period, with CEA emerging as a protective factor and IPH as a risk factor for recurrent events. Moreover, it is also particularly noteworthy that approximately half of the study participants had been receiving antithrombotic therapy prior to enrollment but still experienced cerebrovascular or ocular events. This suggests that certain patients with mild carotid stenosis may be resistant to conservative medical therapy alone, calling for more proactive interventions. Overall, the implications of this study could fundamentally alter how physicians approach stroke prevention. "In the very near future, the evaluation of plaque composition will be an essential examination to predict the risk of further events and to determine treatment strategies in each patient with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis," notes Kashiwazaki. In this way, by shifting focus from stenosis degree to plaque composition, clinicians may be able to better identify high-risk patients who would benefit from surgical intervention. With any luck, this revised approach could potentially reduce stroke incidence and improve outcomes for a previously underrecognized at-risk population. This research underscores the need for personalized stroke prevention strategies that go beyond measuring stenosis severity alone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New evidence highlights how the Mediterranean diet's anti-inflammatory nutrients, like extra-virgin olive oil and omega-3-rich fish, can help manage both joint and thyroid autoimmune disorders, offering a low-cost lifestyle intervention with clinical benefits. A recent study published in the journal  Nutrients reviews the effects of the Mediterranean diet (MD) on both systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders, particularly rheumatic and thyroid diseases. Autoimmune diseases are systemic or organ-specific diseases that are associated with the development of anomalous immune responses against self-antigens. Systemic autoimmune diseases may include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), seronegative spondyloarthritis (SpA), and autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs), whereas Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and Graves' disease (GD) are considered organ-specific diseases. Autoimmune diseases are triggered by genetic and environmental factors that activate the immune system through various mechanisms, including the production of interferon type I, molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, post-translational modification of proteins, or the presentation of superantigens. T- and B-lymphocytes are involved in the manifestation of autoimmune diseases, as demonstrated by the synthesis of autoantibodies against self-antigens. Non-immune cells, such as epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblast cells, also damage tissues through the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The MD is rich in fiber, olive oil, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and vegetables, as well as a moderate intake of fish, poultry, and wine. In comparison to Western dietary habits, the MD recommends a moderate consumption of red meat, processed foods, and refined sugar. Previous studies have highlighted the potential of MD in modulating inflammation due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The MD has also been shown to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of various MD components on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic widespread arthritis (CTD), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and autoimmune thyroiditis. Moreover, the intake of oily fish rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as various fruits and vegetables containing different classes of bioactive compounds, has been shown to mitigate the effects of certain autoimmune diseases. The high intake of fiber enhances the proliferation of fermenting bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate. Furthermore, a recent clinical trial also revealed that ω-3 PUFA supplementation could positively impact the progression of RA by suppressing the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, modulating T-cell differentiation, and reducing the production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by neutrophils. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) contains a wide range of bioactive compounds, such as carotenoids, phenolics, sterols, and triterpenic alcohols. Several preclinical studies have investigated the potential anti-inflammatory properties of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) and its components. For example, oleocanthal (OL), a typical phenolic component of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), exhibits preventive effects against rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) recently reported that individuals who consume a pro-inflammatory diet had higher levels of total T4 and total T3. Similarly, HT patients adhering to an anti-inflammatory diet exhibited lower TSH levels, higher free T4 levels, and lower body mass index (BMI) values. Higher adherence to MD also improved thyroid autoimmunity and related dysfunction. Recently, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) revealed that patients with RA who underwent the MD intervention for 12 weeks exhibited a significant reduction in their disease activity score on 28 joints (DAS28) compared to controls. These patients also experienced improvements in cardiometabolic parameters, including body composition, body weight, blood glucose levels, and plasma vitamin D levels. Encouraging adherence to the MD could serve as an effective, cost-efficient lifestyle approach to reduce the burden of autoimmune disorders in modern societies.” In vitro and in vivo studies, along with clinical trial data, have confirmed the potential of MD as a complementary tool for managing rheumatic and thyroid autoimmune diseases; however, combining MD with exercise has the potential to provide more robust and durable improvements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Italian study challenges the "white meat is safer" notion, showing that high poultry consumption, over 300 g weekly, may double gastrointestinal cancer death risk, particularly among men. Study: Does Poultry Consumption Increase the Risk of Mortality for Gastrointestinal Cancers? In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers investigated the relationship between consuming poultry meat and the incidence of gastrointestinal cancers (GCs) and other causes of mortality. According to the 2013 Instituto di Servizi per il Mercato Agricolo Alimentare (ISMEA) report, conducted in Italy, weekly poultry consumption was estimated to be 13.3 kg per capita worldwide. Rising rates of poultry consumption have also been reported in Italy over the past decade, increasing from 11.7 kg per capita to the current rate of 12.7 kg per capita. Poultry is a broad term that encompasses all forms of birds, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guineas, and game birds such as quail and pheasants. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends 100 g as a standard portion for poultry that can be consumed between one and three times each week. Compared to meat from other sources, poultry is typically lower in fat content. However, widespread industrial processing of poultry products has reduced their nutritional value by adding sodium, saturated fat, sugar, and preservatives into these foods. In fact, current estimates indicate that 26% of the poultry products are processed in the form of hamburger meat, kebabs, rolls, and bites. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has defined meat as carcinogenic to humans, with red meat probably carcinogenic to humans. Existing evidence indicates that the association between meat consumption and cancer risk is primarily attributed to the intake of red and processed meat. However, it remains unclear whether consuming white meat may also increase the risk of cancer, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract. A total of 4,869 participants from the MICOL and NUTRIHEP study cohorts were included in the current analysis. Food and beverage consumption was recorded using the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer (EPIC) Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The overall mean age at death was 81 years, with men and women dying at a mean of 80 and 83 years, respectively. The remaining deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia. Among individuals who died of non-GC cancers, red meat accounted for over 65% of their total meat intake as compared to 56% and 58% among those who died of GC and other causes, respectively. White meat consumption was highest among those who died of GC, with poultry intake accounting for 33% of their white meat intake. Study participants who died of other causes reported total meat intake in the second-highest category. High red meat consumption was also associated with non-GC cancer deaths. In contrast, a weekly meat intake of 200-300 g was associated with an overall 20% reduced mortality risk from all causes, with this risk further reduced to 27% among men. Study participants who consumed 150-250 g of red meat every week were 29% less likely to die from all causes. White meat consumption, specifically poultry, correlated with GC deaths. Mortality from all causes rose by 27% among those who consumed over 300 g of poultry weekly, with this risk particularly high at 61% among men. Deaths from other causes and cancers were associated with lower levels of poultry consumption. Consuming 100-200 g of poultry weekly was associated with a 65% increased risk of dying from GC, as compared to other cancers, which was dose-dependent. Individuals who consumed over 300 g of poultry every week were 127% more likely to die from GC, with this risk even greater at 161% among men. Compared to other risks, GC mortality was 54% less likely among those who consumed between 200 and 300 g of total meat weekly, as compared to those who consumed more than 200 g. This risk reduction was particularly evident among men, at a rate of 68%. Poultry consumption above 300 g/week is associated with a statistically significant increased mortality risk both from all causes and from GCs.” Future studies are needed to validate these findings and elucidate the role of processed poultry in the increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer-related mortality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Each of the underlying single-celled parasites - Trypanosoma brucei and its relatives - has one flagellum, a whiplike appendage that is essential for moving, infecting hosts and surviving in different environments. Now, a research team at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA, or CNSI, has applied leading-edge atomic imaging and AI-driven modeling to create the most detailed 3D map yet of the flagellum on Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness. By capturing the molecular motors that drive the parasite's movement during a key transitional state, the investigators developed a new model for how they swim through blood and tissue. The findings shed light on a critical mechanism essential to Trypanosoma brucei's survival, transmission to hosts and disease processes. Our study provides a complete molecular blueprint of the flagellum's structural framework, explaining how its movement is powered at an atomic level. By leveraging AI-driven structural modeling, we uncovered unique parasite-specific proteins that contribute to flagellar architecture and function." Z. Hong Zhou, co-corresponding authorprofessor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the UCLA College and founding director of CNSI's Electron Imaging Center for Nanosystems, or EICN The imaging technique used in the study was cryogenic-electron microscopy, or cryoEM, in which frozen biological samples are probed with electrons to reveal details impossible to capture with visible light. Maps generated with cryoEM received further analysis using artificial intelligence tools, such as an algorithm for predicting a protein's shape based on the amino acids that make it up. The scientists found that tiny motor-like structures in the microbe's flagellum create motion by acting in a coordinated fashion, similar to the way rowers in a dragon boat synchronize their strokes to move through water. "Trypanosomes have evolved specialized motion to survive in both the tsetse fly and the human bloodstream, making their flagellum a central feature of their biology," said co-corresponding author Kent Hill, a UCLA professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and a CNSI member. "By understanding how their unique structural features contribute to movement, we gain insight into fundamental aspects of parasite adaptation and host interactions." This movie shows a three-dimensional map of the basic structural unit in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei's flagellum, with various mechanical and motor proteins labeled. Sleeping sickness initially manifests as fever, headaches, joint pain and itching. The study may provide potential targets for therapies that effectively eliminate the parasite or block its transmission to humans, as well as give clues about how to address illnesses caused by other related microbes. Beyond medical treatment, the insights into an understudied microbe could have impacts such as elucidating details of earlier stages in evolution and inspiring engineers who borrow from nature to inform their designs.
