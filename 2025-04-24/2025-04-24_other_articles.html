Meta did not specify how many people were impacted by the layoffs but said that the cuts impacted people working on Quest products, including Supernatural, a VR exercise app. “These changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today.” Meta has reported billions of dollars in operating losses on Reality Labs each year since rebranding from Facebook and emphasizing its commitment to the “metaverse.” These layoffs come in advance of Meta's first-quarter earnings report next week, when the company may face scrutiny for the mounting costs of Reality Labs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"If he wants to have hearings on 9/11, (Johnson) could have them examine the cuts to World Trade Center Health Program by the Trump administration that are happening today and the impact these cuts will have on 9/11 responders and survivors suffering from the attacks, rather than fringe topics from decades ago," said Benjamin Chevat, executive director Citizens for Extension of the James Zadroga Act, Inc. The World Trade Center Health Program provides medical monitoring and treatment for some 140,000 9/11 responders and survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. "My guess is there's an awful lot being covered up, in terms of what the American government knows about 9/11," Johnson said in an April 21 interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson. "With this administration, I think President Trump should have some interest, being a New Yorker himself." Another GOP New Yorker, though, questioned Johnson's call. "Respectfully, Senator Johnson should stop peddling conspiracy theories about the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history and one that forever altered the lives of so many of my fellow New Yorkers," said U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican whose 17th District includes Rockland and Putnam counties and parts of Westchester and Dutchess, areas that lost many residents in the attacks. John Feal, a longtime advocate for 9/11 first responders, on CNN called the idea for new hearings pathetic: "Ron Johnson's a silly man." The World Trade Center Health Program and the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund have faced funding shortfalls practically since they launched in 2011. A plan to fix cyclical funding shortfalls was included last year's end-of-year budget deal. But in December 2024, then-President-elect Donald Trump pushed GOP leaders in Congress to scrap spending items, including 9/11 health program commitments. Democrats and Republicans in both chambers across New York are co-sponsors; Johnson is not. Meanwhile, WTCHP jobs have twice been on the chopping block this year. In February, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, slashed jobs at WTCHP; the Trump administration restored them amid backlash. In April, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced sweeping cuts to CDC and NIOSH, which includes the WTCHP. While key staff were again restored amid backlash, advocates have said they are concerned cuts throughout the HHS will impact 9/11 healthcare. Johnson in the April 21 interview raised a long debunked theory that Building 7 within the World Trade Center complex had been taken down by planted explosives. Congress also held hearings in 2021 — two decades after Sept. 11 — where intelligence and security officials gave insight into the attacks and intelligence failures before 9/11.</p>

In the worst cases, this can mean dangerous disruption to our power grids and communications satellites. The team behind this technological marvel recently hit a major milestone, finally turning on one of DKIST's most powerful cameras — known as the Visible Tunable Filter, or VTF — after more than a decade working on its creation. VTF's first image shows a major clump of sunspots, dark blobs on the sun's surface caused by its intense magnetic field, each blob measuring wider than the continental United States. This impressive camera can see details down to a resolution of about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) per pixel on the solar surface — an absolutely wild resolution given that the sun is tens of millions of miles away from us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actress and mom is loving her new role on the quirky SyFy show 'SurrealEstate', which she says is 'Scandal meets Ghostbusters' It's been exactly five years since Sarah Levy said farewell to the hit show Schitt's Creek, where she played the waitress, Twyla. Since then, she's gotten married, become a mom, and now stars on SyFy's SurrealEstate, which she says is a total blast. "I kind of look at it as Scandal meets Ghostbusters," Levy, 38, says of the series, now in its third season. (The first two seasons stream on Hulu.) "The characters are so rich and fleshed out, and there is a common theme through what they're going through in their lives, but then every episode is different and a new case," she continues. I read a story in the New York Times about a woman who actually does this exact thing — she became popular for selling haunted houses. Levy says she's a firm believer in the paranormal herself. "You can't help but think there's so much to the world than just us. I haven't personally had a ghost experience, but we shot the first two seasons in Saint John in Newfoundland, Canada, which is notoriously haunted. They say it's because there was a huge fire there in the late 1800s that killed a lot of people, so there are a lot of stuck souls." "Luke has an ability to speak to spirits, and when I come on board, I learn from him. He's created an entire world of how to communicate with these entities: we have the researcher, we have the physicist who assembles devices to then communicate with these metaphysically engaged properties. While Levy says she's happy to be on a totally new series, she does miss Schitt's Creek — and completely understands why so many fans loved it so much. "There's just such a comfort in it," she says, adding that she and her husband like to rewatch Arrested Development themselves for the same reasons. "It's just like a world that creates this comfort, where nothing really bad happens. It's a way to tune out and laugh.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers may have discovered Mississippi's largest ever mosasaur after pulling a Cretaceous-aged fossil out of a riverbed south of Starkville. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A giant "sea dragon" backbone plucked from a riverbank in Mississippi could belong to the largest mosasaur ever found in the state, scientists say. Researchers only found a single vertebra from the creature and aren't sure exactly how large the mosasaur was in total, but it is estimated to have been at least 30 feet (9 meters) long, Hattiesburg American reported. James Starnes, a geologist at the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, spotted the fossil protruding from a stream bed just south of Starkville on April 15, he told Live Science in an email. His fellow geologist, Jonathan Leard, then carefully pulled it out of the sediment. Related: 'Red flags' raised over ancient sea monster pulled from Moroccan mine Mosasaurs were a diverse group of marine reptiles. Researchers are still figuring out the sizes of the largest mosasaur species, but they likely reached a maximum length of around 50 feet (15 m).

The giant mosasaur that left behind this particulare vertebra likely had no shortage of food in what is now Mississippi, which had a very different environment towards the end of the Cretaceous. "Mississippi was completely covered at the time by warm shallow tropical sea that was teaming with life, including a wide diversity of sharks, fish, marine lizards, and ammonites," Starnes said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FORT WORTH — Lauren Yee's ability to tame her wild imagination into coherent narratives anyone can relate to has made her not only popular with theater companies but also an in-demand writer of series television. Circle Theatre's regional premiere of her widely produced play The Hatmaker's Wife is the latest example of how Yee strikes a credible balance between crowd-pleasing entertainment and a deeper look at the human condition. A comedy with serious undertones about the nature of relationships, Hatmaker's is structured as a story-within-a-story with gently applied supernatural elements as the glue. Pages of text fall from the ceiling. A young couple (Sky Williams and Jon Garrard) is moving into their first house. Boxes sit haphazardly in the living room. Before they're introduced, an older man (Randy Pearlman) clutches a hat, raising it to his head with a sigh. The audience's view is partially blocked by window frames in front of the stage suggesting we're privy to intimacies that don't often see the light of day. “Have you seen my hat?” he inquires in a thick Eastern European accent. “You think I look at you every day,” his wife retorts in the specifically similar tones of 20th-century Jewish immigrants. Williams, whose character is a copy editor of safety manuals, follows the action as pages of the Hetchmans' story begin dropping into her hands. Her boyfriend Gabe, a schoolteacher, cannot. Whooshing sounds signal the arrival of this strangely comic dimension. As she begins her off-stage journey, Mrs. Hetchman rolls out of the fireplace with the missing hat, a cloud of fog trailing her like a train leaving the station on a winter morning. It's funny because the supernatural is rendered with such low-tech effects. The play even feels lighthearted — including a talking wall (Daniel Ruelas) that Hetchman and his friend Meckel are aware of — until it doesn't. They have secrets from each other that will eventually emerge. But Scott's character, quietly stewing under an engulfing wig, glasses and frumpy clothing, stands out. Bynane's chatty, upbeat Meckel also charms. It's not a happy ending but more of an attempt at a plausible explanation for why these people have been drawn together. Yee and Circle have created an amusing, otherworldly scenario that also comments on the difficulties of loving the people closest to you. Through May 10 at 230 W. Fourth St., Fort Worth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wretched Blessing is back and heavier than ever with their new EP “Psychic Barriers to Entry”, out today (April 24) via their own label, Two Mongrels Recordings. The opening track “Decalcified” sets the tone with a ruthless blend of d-beat grooves and doomy chaos, capped by a crushing finale. Amitay says the song draws influence from RFK Jr.'s infamous brain worm story and Ministry's “TV II”, which pretty much sums up how unhinged and intense it sounds. With thunderous production and punchy riffs, this one hits hard from start to finish.

The New Zealand's metal act Alien Weaponry stands out incredibly for their authentic image and songs fully based on Maori culture. Their new album “Te Rā” was released on the 28th of March via Napalm Records. Chaoszine had a great chat with band's bassplayer Turanga Edmond about pros and cons of singing in native language,... It's already been twenty years since YouTube was born. The band's success speaks for itself, distinguished by superior live shows and especially Jeff Waters, who takes on the role of guitarist, vocalist, studio bassist, songwriter, producer, as well as mixing and mastering... After splitting from Slowplay/Republic Records, Wargasm is now a free artist. They are also planning to embark on their first-ever... Some bands like to keep busy, and honestly we can't blame them. New metal supergroup Paradise Slaves, featuring past and present members of 36 Crazyfists, Diecast and Pentagram, have dropped the fourth taste of their upcoming debut album. The latest single is called “Swim North” and features Unearth vocalist Trevor Phipps as a guest artist.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From your WhatsApp messages to your work emails, it can sometimes feel like emoji are everywhere you look. But tonight, a rare astronomical display will take this to new levels - as an extraterrestrial emojii forms in the night sky. Experts say this alignment of Venus, Saturn, and the thin crescent moon will bear a striking resemblance to a smiling face turned on its side. The good news is that you won't need a telescope to see this spectacular celestial display - you'll just need to make an early start. The conjunction should slide into place from 05:00 BST and remain visible until just before the sun rises at 05:45 BST. Jess Lee, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told MailOnline: 'You can see this just with your eyes and without any special equipment, but you'll need to be awake at 5 am and have a clear view of the east. As the planets orbit the sun, from our perspective there are times when they seem to come very close together although, in reality, they are still millions of miles apart. On some occasions, two or more planets move closer to the moon in an event which astronomers call 'massing'. The moon, having been full on April 13, is now waning - growing smaller - towards the new moon on April 27 which will leave a very thin crescent visible tonight. Saturn is also visible but will be fainter and later rising, staying closer to the horizon. In order to see this rare alignment all you need to do is look towards the East early in the morning. However, its atmosphere is radically different to ours — being 96 per cent carbon dioxide and having a surface temperature of 867°F (464°C) and pressure 92 times that of on the Earth. The inhospitable planet is swaddled in clouds of sulphuric acid that make the surface impossible to glimpse. In the past, it has been suggested that Venus likely had oceans similar to Earth's — but these would have vaporised as it underwent a runaway greenhouse effect. Find a spot that gives you a clear, unobstructed view of the horizon free of any trees or buildings that might block your view. Starting from about 05:00 am, you will then need to wait and watch as the conjunction slowly rises over the next half an hour. Above the Moon, Venus will be bright and easily visible. Saturn will be faint and hard to see, so it will be a challenge to spot but give it a go!' For this reason, it is recommended that you do not use binoculars or a telescope to try and look at the planets since this could magnify the sun's light and cause serious eye damage. Unfortunately for many British stargazers, the weather forecast for early tomorrow morning does not look particularly promising. The Met Office forecasts cloud cover over large parts of the UK with a few breaks over parts of the Southeast, Southwest, and southern parts of Scotland. Keen skywatchers in Northern Ireland will fare particularly poorly as heavy rain is forecast over the entire region. Ms Lee says: 'The planets pass through the same area of sky where we see the Moon, and so it won't be rare for Saturn or Venus to be near the moon - however how often we can interpret them as smiley faces, I think depends on individual imaginations.' There will be another great opportunity to see the conjunction of Saturn and Venus on April 28. Since this conjunction is after sunset you will also be able to safely use binoculars or a telescope to get a better view. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with some heavy elements. While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life. Moons: 82 with formal designations; innumerable additional moonlets</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ghost Town delivers a brilliant supernatural puzzle adventure that you won't want to miss. Mysteries are one of my oldest loves in fiction, and that's only grown through video games. Watching detectives pour over a murder case is one thing, yet user controlled spaces like games can sometimes struggle without the narrative luxury of pre-defined pacing. It's not enough to simply have a great story, you need to make the player an active participant who can feel accomplished without making it too difficult. It's a fine line, one that Ghost Town walks almost flawlessly. The team's flagship puzzle series immediately left an impression in VR with its rich production values and satisfying puzzles, and Ghost Town builds upon these fine foundations well. Gameplay footage from the first level captured by UploadVR Ghost Town takes a supernatural approach that immediately intrigues, only this time we're in the '80s as an Irish witch turned exorcist and ghost hunter, Edith Penrose. Joined by our paranormal detective agency partner, Rina, what follows is a thoroughly gripping narrative that sees us searching for Edith's missing brother. Fireproof's not afraid to have some fun with this story, balancing good humor while effectively building up suspense. Understandably, you can't leave an area during an active cutscene without getting a warning flash up, though a particularly striking incident occurs midway through. My favorite example is when you're receiving crucial information about a suspect, with the information projected around you while placing your hand on an orb. All very atmospheric until I accidentally discovered that removing your hand causes the scene and music to fade, while the other character continues talking. Moments like these add crucial immersive depth, and there's every chance someone unaware of this could miss that entirely. Edith doesn't spend her entire journey simply chatting away and holding strange orbs. What I can say is that most of these are well-designed without too much hand holding; the environmental storytelling merges nicely with exploration to provide the answers. There's enough thought required to make you feel accomplished, and I'm impressed at how intuitive solving many of them feels. I've only been stuck on two occasions, assisted by the optional hint system that provides useful advice in three parts. These puzzles are only boosted by some great interactivity with good physicality. My only major complaint is that I wish there was more here, and Ghost Town takes roughly five hours to complete. It's just that good, and I'd love to see more in a sequel, which I hope happens given the game ends with some open-ended threads. Ghost Town offers two movement options; artificial stick-based locomotion and teleportation. You can adjust the speed with an 'analog movement' setting that gradually increases the acceleration instead of using a constant movement speed. Snap fade can also be implemented for additional comfort alongside movement vignettes. Still, Ghost Town's a visual treat for Quest 3 that pushes the limits of this headset. Each environment is great to explore, character models look nice, resolution seems sharp and I never encountered any performance issues. I haven't had the chance to check how Ghost Town runs on Quest 2 by comparison right now, and I'm keen to see how the Steam and PlayStation VR2 versions compare when those editions launch later this year. When it's already looking this good in standalone VR, I'm feeling optimistic for higher spec hardware. It's not a stretch to say that Ghost Town is one of the best VR games so far this year. I do wish the journey lasted just a little longer, but what's here is an essential experience that you won't want to miss.
