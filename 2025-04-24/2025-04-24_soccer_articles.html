While it's no secret that the United States men's national team have been in less than ideal form recently, losing their last two matches to Panama and Canada during Concacaf Nations League play, former USMNT manager Bruce Arena isn't happy with the appointment of coach Mauricio Pochettino. On the "Unfiltered Soccer" podcast hosted by Tim Howard and Landon Donovan, Arena talked about Pochettino's need to learn the culture while taking over the USMNT. "You know if you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach," Arena said. I'm sure our coach is a very good coach, but coaching international football is different than club football. "If you ask me if we lack pride, well, I'm watching and I'm shocked. I'm shocked we can't beat Panama and Canada. Call it What You Want: A twice weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. While this is Pochettino's first international role after managing Chelsea in the Premier League, part of why only domestic coaches usually manage international teams is that only eight nations have ever won the World Cup --  Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina, France, Uruguay, England, and Spain. Every other nation is looking to catch up to those sides, and it has been one of the reasons why Argentine managers are more prevalent than ever, given the success of their international sides and club teams managed by them. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it, especially in our country, because we're so different." Similar concerns came up in the past when Jürgen Klinsmann was bringing in dual-national players, and it was claimed that some of them didn't care about the badge as much as those born in the United States. As soccer has continued to grow in the United States, it has only become more likely to add dual-national players, and they've become some of the most talented players on this roster. Antonee Robinson, Sergino Dest, Yunus Musah, and Folarin Balogun have all switched allegiances to represent the USMNT and become some of the most critical players on the roster. This has been a rough period for the USMNT, and they've earned some of the criticism coming their way, but it only makes the upcoming Gold Cup more important. This is a team that is expected to win every Concacaf competition in sight, and if they aren't doing that, the criticism will only continue to mount ahead of a critical World Cup on home soil.

He has a pair of Olympic gold medals as well. Lauren Holiday will serve as an advisor and ambassador for the NWSL club. “This club represents the future of women's soccer — not just in how we play the game, but in how we empower athletes, connect with communities, and build a sustainable future for the sport,” Lauren Holiday said in a statement. “I believe deeply in the mission and vision of the Courage, and I'm excited to contribute in meaningful ways — especially when it comes to player development and overall culture.” Shortly after the birth of her daughter, she underwent surgery and Jrue Holiday took a leave of absence to care for her and their child.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In what was quite a prolific week for U.S. Men's National Team pool players, it was difficult to keep up with those who were either filling the net or setting up teammates for their respective sides. The list boasted Josh Sargent (Norwich City) , Paxten Aaronson (FC Utrecht), Gianluca Busio (Venezia), Jordan Pefok (Reims) and Tanner Tessmann (Lyon) in Europe, and Brandon Vazquez (Austin FC), Ben Cremaschi (Inter Miami), Djordje Mihailovic (Colorado Rapids), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC) and Brian Gutiérrez (Chicago Fire) in Major League Soccer. In addition, goalkeeper Sean Johnson earned his second consecutive clean sheet of the season for Toronto FC. Josh Sargent scored his 15th goal of the English Championship season for Norwich City but was forced out of a 5-3 home loss to Portsmouth with a shoulder injury at halftime on Friday, April 18. Forward Jordan Pefok's first goal of the French Ligue 1 season was all Reims needed in its 1-0 victory over 10-man Toulouse on Sunday, April 20. As it turned out, McKenzie was one of three U.S. players who were awarded red cards over the weekend. Gianluca Busio tallied his second goal of the Italian Serie A season for Venezia in its 2-2 draw at Empoli on Sunday, April 20. It appeared that Brandon Vazquez was going to be the goat-of-the-game when LA Galaxy goalkeeper John McCarthy saved his 67th-minute penalty kick. Some nice timing by Ben Cremaschi as his first goal of the season boosted Inter Miami CF to a 1-0 road triumph over the Columbus Crew in a game played in Cleveland, Ohio in a battle of the last two MLS unbeaten squads on Saturday, April 19. He cut the deficit to one, putting away a penalty kick past goalie Roman Celentano. Ferreira recorded two assists in the 3-0 home victory over Nashville SC on Saturday, April 19. Defender Marlon Fossey set up Dennis Eckert Ayensa's 58th-minute goal in Standard Liege's 1-1 home draw with Westerlo on Saturday, April 19. Goalkeeper Sean Johnson recorded his second consecutive shutout for Toronto FC in its 1-0 win at Real Salt Lake on Saturday, April 19. On March 29, he kept his net empty in a 2-0 home victory against Minnesota United. -- Kellyn Acosta (Chicago Fire; MLS) - 20 minutes as a substitute in 3-2 loss vs. FC Cincinnati (April 19) -- Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; MLS) - 90 minutes in 1-0 loss vs. Inter Miami CF (April 19) -- Folarin Balogun (Monaco; French Ligue 1) – 10 minutes as a substitute in 0-0 draw vs. Strasbourg (April 19) -- Gianluca Busio (Venezia; Italian Serie A) - 90 minutes, GOAL, in 2-2 draw at Empoli (April 20) -- Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis; La Liga) – 90 minutes, GOAL, 1-3 loss at Girona (April 21) -- Cade Cowell (Guadalajara; Liga MX) – 1 minute as a substitute in 1-1 draw at Atlas (April 19) -- Ben Cremaschi (Inter Miami CF; MLS) – 87 minutes, GOAL, 1-0 win at Columbus Crew (April 19) -- Jesús Ferreira (Seattle Sounders; MLS) - 90 minutes, TWO ASSISTS, in 3-0 win vs. Nashville SC (April 19) -- Marlon Fossey (Standard Liege; Belgian Pro League) - 90 minutes, ASSIST, in 1-1 draw vs. Westerlo (April 19) -- Julian Gressel (Inter Miami CF; MLS) – Not in 18, DNP 1-0 win at Columbus Crew (April 19) -- Brian Gutiérrez (Chicago Fire; MLS) - 90 minutes, GOAL, in 3-2 loss vs. FC Cincinnati (April 19) -- Ethan Horvath (Cardiff City; English Championship) - 90 minutes in 2-0 loss at Sheffield United (April 18) -- Sean Johnson (Toronto FC; MLS) - 90 minutes, SHUTOUT, in 1-0 win at Real Salt Lake (April 19) -- Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; MLS) - 60 minutes, RED CARD, in 1-0 loss vs. Toronto FC (April 19) -- Kristoffer Lund (Palermo; Italy Serie B) – 89 minutes in 2-1 loss to Bari (April 11) -- Weston McKennie (Juventus; Italy Serie A) – 66 minutes in 2-1 win over Lecce (April 12) -- Mark McKenzie (Toulouse; French Ligue 1) - 27 minutes, RED CARD, in 1-0 loss at Reims (April 20) -- Djordje Mihailovic (Colorado Rapids; MLS) - 90 minutes, GOAL, ASSIST, in 2-2 draw at Houston Dynamo (April 19) -- Shaq Moore (FC Dallas; MLS) - 90 minutes in 0-0 draw at Minnesota United (April 19) -- Jordan Morris (Seattle Sounders; MLS) - 27 minutes as a substitute in 3-0 win vs. Nashville SC (April 19) -- Jalen Neal (CF Montreal; MLS) – Injured, DNP in 0-0 draw vs. Orlando City SC (April 19) -- Bryan Reynolds (Westerlo; Belgian Pro League) - 90 minutes in 1-1 draw at Standard Liege (April 19) -- Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; MLS) - 90 minutes in 3-2 win at Chicago Fire (April 19) -- Josh Sargent (Norwich City; English Championship) - 45 minutes, GOAL, in 5-3 loss vs. Portsmouth (April 18) -- Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew; MLS) - 90 minutes in 1-0 loss vs. Inter Miami CF (April 19) -- Zack Steffen (Colorado Rapids; MLS) - 90 minutes in 2-2 draw at Houston Dynamo (April 19) -- Timmy Tillman (Los Angeles FC; MLS) - 90 minutes in 3-3 draw at Portland Timbers (April 19) -- John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel; Bundesliga) - 90 minutes in 1-1 draw at RB Leipzig (April 19) -- Brandon Vazquez (Austin FC; MLS) - 90 minutes, GOAL, in 1-0 win vs. LA Galaxy (April 19) -- Tim Weah (Juventus; Italy Serie A) – 23 minutes as substitute in 2-1 win vs. Lecce (April 12) -- Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps; MLS) - 90 minutes in 0-0 draw at St. Louis CITY (April 19) -- DeAndre Yedlin (FC Cincinnati; MLS) - 86 minutes in 3-2 win at Chicago Fire (April 19) -- Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC; MLS) - Injured, DNP in 3-0 loss at Seattle Sounders (April 19)</p>

Greensboro will host SE Palmeiras, one of the most popular club teams in Brazil. “We have long since owned our Tournament Town title, but this honor puts us at a completely different level,” Greensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan said in a statement. “Greensboro is now officially part of the world's most popular sport. This is not just an economic win  — it elevates our status as a premier host for sporting events at levels we've never experienced.” “Greensboro has a rich history in youth and amateur soccer over many years,” says Richard Beard, President of the Greensboro Sports Foundation. “Hosting a team for the 2025 Club World Cup adds to our stellar resume hosting major soccer events. The international exposure World Cup Soccer brings to Greensboro is unmatched in any sports event held worldwide.” In addition to training in Greensboro, SE Palmerias also plans to launch a "comprehensive community program for the local neighborhood." Starting on June 6, Greensboro will host free community-focused activities at Smith Soccer Complex "aimed at introducing the club and its history to local people."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin De Bruyne will not extend his stay at Manchester City to play at the Club World Cup this summer. De Bruyne's contract is due to expire at the end of June - midway through the summer tournament. The Belgian's 10-year stint at the Etihad Stadium is coming to an end, with his exit coming as a surprise to some - including De Bruyne himself. He delivered a pointed assessment of the club chiefs, questioning the decision to let him leave, and doubt is being cast on his Club World Cup involvement. As revealed by the Daily Star Sport, De Bruyne is reluctant to play and risk an injury which might hamper his chance of finding a new club, and is also unhappy with how his imminent departure was handled. Teams involved in the Club World Cup are permitted to seek special dispensation to continue using players in situations like that faced by De Bruyne. There have also been changes made to Premier League transfer rules, with teams permitted to sign players between June 1-10 before the window opens in earnest later that month. City manager Pep Guardiola recognised the situation facing De Bruyne is a complex one. “I think he has to decide, he has to talk, because now with the World Cup, it's a new contract, legally, you know," Guardiola said in early April. City's Club World Cup campaign begins against Moroccan side Wydad on June 18, nearly a month after the final Premier League match of the season. Their group is completed by Al Ain and Juventus, with all three group games scheduled for before the end of June. "It was Txiki [Begiristain] and Ferran [Soriano] who told me," De Bruyne said, referencing the club's outgoing sporting director and current CEO respectively. "You have to accept people taking decisions. I'm open for anything (including staying in the Premier League). "I don't know what it is. It depends on when you speak to people about projects and things. Clubs in Europe, Saudi Arabia and the United States are understood to be keen on signing De Bruyne on a free transfer. Inter Miami hold the player's discovery rights if he does choose to move to Major League Soccer, though this doesn't necessarily mean he'll end up with the Florida club.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga has suffered a left abductor tear. He came on as a substitute at half-time, replacing David Alaba who was feeling discomfort himself, and ended the match limping. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said after the game that both players were dealing with “muscular problems” before the club confirmed Camavinga's injury on Thursday. “Following tests carried out today on Eduardo Camavinga by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a complete tear of the tendon in his left abductor muscle,” Madrid said in a statement. Madrid's first game of the expanded Club World Cup is set to take place on June 18 against Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal. Camavinga has made 34 appearances in all competitions this season, scoring twice, in what has been an injury-disrupted campaign. He injured his hamstring again in January, sidelining him for another three weeks. This is the latest injury setback for Madrid, who have had a host of players miss time this season, including Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao who are out with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Left-back Ferland Mendy has been out since mid-March with a hamstring injury, though the club say that he is making good progress and has a chance to feature on Saturday alongside Kylian Mbappe, who missed the Getafe game. Tchouameni is at risk of being suspended for Madrid's clash with Barcelona in La Liga on May 11 if he is booked in the side's next league fixture against Celta Vigo. Camavinga has been in and out of the team this season, but his injury only underlines what a torrid campaign this has been for Real Madrid. Raul Asencio, Luka Modric, Arda Guler and Endrick are their only players not to have missed games through injury this term. Right-back Carvajal and Militao are out with long-term knee injuries while Mendy has missed nine matches with his hamstring injury. Camavinga might have been in line to start at left-back in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona before this latest setback. That is not the Frenchman's preferred position but he has often performed better there than Fran Garcia, who struggled against Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-finals. But this is also another blow for the versatile Camavinga, who has yet to fully establish himself at Madrid since moving to the Spanish capital in 2021. Madrid are still struggling to move on from Toni Kroos in midfield after the German's retirement last summer — they need all the help they can get in that department if they are to have any hopes of winning the Copa del Rey or La Liga before the revamped Club World Cup in the United States this summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino is under fire from former USMNT and current MLS team San Jose Eartquakes coach Bruce Arena, who questioned if the Argentine is the right man to lead the Stars and Stripes. U.S. Soccer hired Pochettino back in September to develop a talented U.S. men's national team into a real contender ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Despite getting off to a winning start, the Stars and Stripes under the Argentine have once again failed to impress. The USMNT suffered a shocking 1–0 defeat to Panama in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and then lost a third-place match to Canada just three days later. The two poor results prompted harsh criticism from USMNT greats Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, and now Arena is joining in the conversation surrounding Pochettino's early leadership. "You know if you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach," Arena said on an episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan & Tim Howard. I'm sure our coach is a very good coach, but coaching international football is different than club football, it's a completely different job." German Jurgen Klinsmann was in charge of the Stars and Stripes from 2011 to 2016 and led the team to a second-place finish in a group with Germany, Portugal and Ghana at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Pochettino, though, has no previous experience coaching a national team. The 53-year-old spent his entire career coaching at the club level throughout Europe, most notably at Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it, especially in our country, because we're so different." It is clear that he, along with plenty of other critics, are unsatisfied with the current state of the USMNT, especially for a squad often heralded as the country's "golden generation." I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada," Arena said. I want them to do great in the World Cup, there's no question about it. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they got to get going." Before the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the USMNT must first compete in the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer, where they will hope to put in a better performance than their disappointing Concacaf Nations League campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>La Liga giants Real Madrid have on Thursday announced a heavy injury blow in the club's first-team ranks. This comes amid confirmation that Eduardo Camavinga suffered a serious setback during Real's most recent outing. Los Blancos marked their return to action on Wednesday, making the short trip to the Estadio Coliseum for a La Liga meeting with Getafe. En route to an eventual 1-0 victory for the visitors on the evening, however, the France international was too forced into a premature departure from proceedings. After a heavy challenge in the middle of the park, Camavinga could immediately be seen to be in serious pain, hooked by Carlo Ancelotti despite his best efforts to run the problem off. And a day on, confirmation of the nature of the 22-year-old's injury has been provided. As per a statement across Real Madrid's website and social media platforms: ‘Following tests carried out today on Eduardo Camavinga by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a complete tear of the tendon in his left abductor muscle. 🎙️ Informa @AranchaMOBILE 💥 Camavinga sufre una rotura completa del tendón del adductor izquierdo❌ Se pierde lo que resta de temporada incluido el Mundial de Clubes 📻 #PartidazoCOPE pic.twitter.com/JwT1bOSOnc — El Partidazo de COPE (@partidazocope) April 24, 2025</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Sky Sports, Chelsea are tracking some of Europe's best centre backs and attackers and want deals done before the Club World Cup. The Blues came from a goal down to score two very late goals to win the game 2-1 against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon in what was a very dramatic game of ups and downs. But he has explained his reasoning for this in the post match press conference, although it wont wash. Pedro Neto responded to the fan anger in his post-match comments after the game on Sunday. The Blues are also set for another very busy transfer window this coming summer as they look to add players to a number of positions yet again in more big spending expected. Sky reports that Chelsea are tracking some of Europe's best centre-backs and attackers in an effort to try and complete some deals before they play at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. They also say that we can expect another busy summer at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea targeting the arrivals of a forward, a winger and a central defender. They've mentioned 11 names including Liam Delap, Victor Osimhen, Dean Huijsen, Marc Guehi, Nico Williams, Jamie Gittens, and more… Your email address will not be published.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Guardian can reveal that as part of a cross-promotional deal finalised this week, 23 of the 63 matches will be shown on Channel 5 as well as on Dazn – 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The remaining 40 games will be shown exclusively by Dazn, which has committed to making every match in the new expanded tournament available free-to-air globally via its app. The Club World Cup, which includes Chelsea and Manchester City, will be the highest-profile sports event televised by Channel 5, which has held live rights to the Europa League and numerous highlights packages. Channel 5 is also in talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board about buying two men's and two women's England T20 matches this summer as it seeks to expand its sports coverage. It is owned by the American film giant Paramount. Dazn paid $1bn (£787m) for global Club World Cup rights in February in a surprise deal that appears to have been largely funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, with the kingdom's Surj Sports Investment group last month confirming it had taken a minority stake in the streaming company valued at $1bn. The Dazn/Surj partnership spared Fifa's blushes after a lengthy TV rights sales process which had concluded with it failing to find rights partners. Although Dazn's latest accounts say it has 300 million monthly users globally, it remains a challenger company in certain markets, including the UK, which led to an agreement to sublicense the rights to ensure larger viewing figures for Fifa and its commercial partners. Warner Bros has a sublicensing deal in the United States. The Guardian reported this month that the BBC and ITV had opted not to bid because their main football focus will be their joint coverage of England's defence of the Women's European Championship. Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami are among the participants in the competition, which runs from 14 June to 13 July.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former head coach of the US Men's National Team has openly criticized US Soccer for hiring Mauricio Pochettino as manager. Bruce Arena, who coached the USMNT in two separate stints, from 1998-2006 and then again from 2016-2017, thinks the job should have gone to an American manager. Discussing the current state of the team and program with former players Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, Arena made the case that Pochettino, who was born in Argentina, doesn't understand the unique culture and structure of US soccer. "If you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach," Arena said. And listen, (Pochettino) is a very good coach. When you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it. Especially in our country, because we're so different. Pochettino's appointment was widely heralded as a coup for the program. After years of mediocrity and mostly underwhelming leadership, Pochettino brought a world-class track record with him. But it's been a mixed bag of results thus far, including a disastrous showing in losses to Panama and Canada earlier in 2025. "You're asking me if we lack that kind of pride," said Arena. I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada. I don't want to be disrespectful, I want them to do great in the World Cup. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they gotta get going." It isn't even in the top three or four. He's also right that it's very different coaching international teams relative to high-end clubs. And that wrong direction has been directed by American-born managers. When what you're doing isn't working, it's nonsensical to not try something else. Most countries would be thrilled to have Pochettino managing their national soccer teams. Whether it works out remains to be seen, but the process was and is good.
