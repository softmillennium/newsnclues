                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Facebook will begin lowering the reach of accounts sharing spammy content and making them ineligible for monetization, Meta announced on Thursday. The company is also increasing efforts to remove Facebook accounts that coordinate fake engagement and impersonate others, it says. Meta admits that some accounts on its platform try to game the algorithm to increase views or gain unfair monetization advantages, which results in spammy content flooding users' feeds. To remedy this, it's cracking down on accounts that exhibit certain types of spammy behavior. It also includes accounts that post content with captions that are unrelated to the content, such as an image of a dog with a caption about airplane facts. Meta says that while the intention behind these sorts of posts isn't always malicious, it does lead to spammy content that ends up overshadowing original content from creators. The crackdown on spammy content comes as AI slop is becoming a serious problem across social media platforms, including Facebook. Facebook says it's aware of the concerns around AI slop cluttering users' feeds and says it will address the issue as part of its broader focus on improving users' feeds. Plus, Facebook will start testing a comments feature that will allow users to signal which comments are irrelevant or don't fit in the context of the conversation. In addition, Facebook announced that it's updating its comment management tool to detect and auto-hide comments from people who may be using a fake identity. Both the new Friends tab and the crackdown on spammy content show that Facebook is trying to improve users' feeds and show them content that they actually want to see.

You might often think of processors as being relatively small, but TSMC is developing a version of its CoWoS technology that will enable its partners to build multi-chiplet assemblies that will be 9.5-reticle sized (7,885 mm^2) and will rely on 120×150 mm substrates (18,000 mm^2), which is slightly larger than the size of a CD case. TSMC claims these behemoths could offer up to 40 times the performance of a standard processor. Virtually all modern high-performance data center-grade processors use multi-chiplet designs, and as demands for performance increase, developers want to integrate even more silicon into their products. Currently, TSMC CoWoS offers chip packaging solutions that enable interposer sizes of up to 2831 mm^2, which is approximately 3.3 times larger than the company's reticle (photomask) size limit (858 mm^2 per EUV standard, with TSMC using 830 mm^2). This capacity is already utilized by products like AMD's Instinct MI300X accelerators and Nvidia's B200 GPUs, which combine two large logic chiplets for compute with eight stacks of HBM3 or HBM3E memory. Sometimes next year, or a bit later, TSMC plans to introduce the next generation of its CoWoS-L packaging technology, which will support interposers measuring up to 4,719 mm^2, roughly 5.5 times larger than the standard reticle area. The company expects that solutions built on this generation of packaging will deliver more than three and a half times the compute performance of current designs. While this solution may be enough for Nvidia's Rubin GPUs with 12 HBM4 stacks, processors that will offer more compute horsepower will require even more silicon. Looking further ahead, TSMC intends to scale this packaging approach even more aggressively. The company plans to offer interposers with an area of up to 7,885 mm^2, approximately 9.5 times the photomask limit, mounted on a 120×150 mm substrate (for context, a standard CD jewel case measures approximately 142×125 mm). This represents an increase from an 8x-reticle-sized multi-chiplet assembly on a 120×120mm substrate that TSMC presented last year, and this increase likely reflects the requests from the foundry's customers. However, TSMC has customers who demand extreme performance and are willing to pay for it. For them, TSMC offers its System-on-Wafer (SoW-X) technology, which enables wafer-level integration. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Without a doubt, 9.5-reticle-sized or wafer-sized processors are hard to build and assemble. But these multi-chiplet solutions require high-current kilowatt-level power delivery, and this is getting harder for server makers and chip developers, so it needs to be addressed at the system level. To address processors with kilowatt-class power requirements, TSMC wants to integrate monolithic power management ICs (PMICs) with TSVs made on TSMC's N16 FinFET technology and on-wafer inductors directly into CoWoS-L packages with RDL interposers, enabling power routing through the substrate itself. TSMC claims that its N16-based PMIC can easily handle fine-grained voltage control for dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) at the required current levels, achieving up to five times higher power delivery density compared to conventional approaches. In addition, embedded deep trench capacitors (eDTC/DTC), built directly into the interposer or silicon substrate, provide high-density decoupling (up to 2,500 nF/mm^2) to improve power stability by filtering voltage fluctuations close to the die and ensure reliable operation even under rapid workload changes. This embedded approach enables effective DVS and improved transient response, both of which are critical for managing power efficiency in complex, multi-core, or multi-die designs. In general, TSMC's power delivery approach reflects a shift toward system-level co-optimization, where power delivery to silicon is treated as an integral part of the silicon, packaging, and system design, not a separate feature of each component. The move to much larger interposer sizes will have consequences for system design, particularly in terms of packaging form factors. Beyond physical constraints and power consumption, these huge multi-chiplet SiPs generate an enormous amount of heat. However, TSMC can't address that problem on the chip or SiP level — at least for now. Tom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.</p>

AMD is reportedly set to launch its latest and most affordable RX 9070 series graphics card, the RX 9070 GRE (Great Radeon Edition). Videocardz reports that it has official photos of the RX 9070 GRE, indicating that the cards are ready for launch and countering allegedly previous rumors that the GRE variant would be delayed until Q4 2025. Videocardz obtained pictures of two (out of three) RX 9070 GRE variants from PowerColor, a Red Devil model and a Reaper version, each sporting triple-fan cooler designs with a red and black color scheme. The GRE variant allegedly sports a 650W minimum power supply requirement. Videocardz also states that previously leaked specs for the RX 9070 GRE are true. The RX 9070 GRE will come with the same Navi 48 GPU die as the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, but it will be severely stripped down, sporting just 3,072 enabled cores, and a stripped-down memory interface sporting a 192-bit bus and 12GB of GDDR6 memory, with a maximum boost clock of 2.79 GHz. AMD has not officially announced the RX 9070 GRE nor which RDNA3 GPU it is aimed to replace. If Videocardz's information is legitimate, the RX 9070 GRE will launch before the RX 9060 XT, which has a rumored launch date of May 18th.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Considering how Carrie Bradshaw doesn't give a damn about technology ecosystems in her later years (she uses a MacBook Pro and dual wields an iPhone and BlackBerry Key2 in the Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That), I'd say there's a good chance she'd rock these Motorola Moto Buds Loop in “Pantone-curated French Oak” with Swarovski crystals. If not for the bling embedded in each open-ear wireless earbud, she'd probably wear AirPods like every basic bitch walking around Manhattan. She definitely wouldn't be caught wearing the non-Swarovski version of the Moto Buds Loop that come in “Pantone-curated Trekking Green” aka forest green. Instead of the buds sitting snuggly inside of your ears, pumping sound straight into your ear canal, the Buds Loop clip onto your ears like oversized earrings and gently beam audio into them. The upside to an open-ear designs is that you can hear your surroundings without needing to turn on any transparency/ambient modes. A klutz like Carrie would appreciate this given her penchant to not pay attention to what's happening in the streets. The Swarovski special edition is no doubt aimed at fashion-conscious consumers. I wasn't about to get an ear infection trying them out at Motorola's packed media pre-briefing so I can't speak to how they sound. But in case you're not turned off by the shininess and you're curious about tech specs, here's what Motorola has shared. They have 12mm “ironless drivers,” feature spatial sound for multi-directional audio, and battery life is up to 8 hours with a single charge and up to 37 hours with the case. And because you gotta throw in some AI support these days, Motorola says the buds can also do stuff like read you AI-summaries of your notifications, though you do need a compatible Motorola phone with Moto AI built-in. I asked Motorola for pricing and release date on the Buds Loop (including the Swarovski version), and was told by a PR representative that they'll share that information “closer to availability.” Hopefully the regular models are competitively priced with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, which retail for $300. The Swarovski model—that's gonna cost a pretty penny for sure! Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two things were glaringly clear to me after sitting through a 2.5-hour event yesterday where Motorola pre-briefed press on its new trio of Razr Android phones. The company really believes in the flip-style foldable form factor popularized by Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip and it thinks more AI, shoved ever deeper into the software, will rescue us from the cruelty of pecking on apps and buttons with our fingers. You can think of them as good, better, and best. They all look pretty similar, but here's how you can spot the difference without pulling up a comparison chart. Upgrades over the other Razrs that you can't eyeball right away: 50 megapixels for the main, ultra-wide, and selfie cameras; a large 4,700mAh battery; 68W wired charging; 30W wireless charging; and 5W reverse wireless charging. The Razr+ looks nearly identical to the Razr Ultra, but comes with a slightly smaller 6.9-inch internal screen, no physical AI button, a smaller 4,000mAh battery, slower charging (45W wired and 15W wireless), and a lower-resolution selfie camera (32 megapixels). It also has a less powerful Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. Sitting at the entry-level, the plainly named Razr has a smaller 3.6-inch external display (there's a “forehead” bezel not present on the Razr+ and Razr Ultra), lower-resolution cameras (50-megapixel main, 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and 32-megapixel selfie), and a mid-range MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chipset. I got to play with all three briefly and they all felt well-built to me, with the only major physical quality difference being the materials and finishes. Motorola boasted other quality-of-life upgrades for the new Razrs. The hinges are titanium, which the company says is four time stronger than before and can handle “up to 35% more folds” compared to previous generation Razr flip phones. Motorola also says the crease on the internal folding display is 30% less visible (unclear how Motorola arrived at that number but it does seem less visible), and the Razr Ultra supposedly has the strongest external screen thanks to it being Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. Rather than develop its own AI—and risk embarrassing itself like a certain fruit-named tech giant—Motorola is partnering up with AI leaders and using their large language models and logic reasoning in the background for various tasks. Perplexity, the AI “answer engine” that's been chipping away at Google's search relevance, is deeply integrated into the Android 15 operating system. Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, Microsoft's Copilot, also power different aspects of Moto AI, assisting with general AI features like tasks suggestions (i.e. calling an Uber on your behalf or drafting an email), summarization, memory recall (think surfacing information from notes and screenshots), and more. The cameras also have Moto AI baked in with a feature called Signature Style. The phones use AI to automatically adjust tone and colors and then learns based on how you edit your shots. It sounds neat, but that also diminishes the whole point of photos which is that they usually don't have the same uninspired look to them. I want to mix it up with my photos! Fact is, every phone maker is promising game-changing AI features that they're touting as more convenient or efficient. AI will save you from hundreds of taps every day. AI will finally fulfill the “intelligent” promises that voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant failed at. That's the AI dream everyone (including Motorola) is selling. The AI in these new Razr phones is better and more useful, but also not quite capable enough to fully offload everything to just yet. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thankfully, Nvidia doesn't seem to be pushing the 5060 Ti 8GB cards very hard. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Both of these are mainstream GPU offerings, ostensibly priced in the $430–$500 range. We weren't particularly impressed with the 4060 Ti 16GB at launch, but our feelings have tempered over time — helped by an unofficial $50 price cut — with both having appeared on our list of the best graphics cards. The Nvidia Ada Lovelace 4060 Ti 16GB card originally launched over a month after the initial RTX 4060 Ti 8GB card, with a $100 price premium. Conversely, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and 8GB variants technically launched at the same time on April 16, 2025, with only a $50 price gap. In theory, this should be a very easy win for the new Nvidia Blackwell GPU, but let's see how they actually stack up. Specifications for the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and RTX 4060 Ti 16GB are mostly similar, with a few key upgrades for the newer GPU. However, clock speeds also factor into performance, and the 5060 Ti comes with a 2,572 MHz boost clock compared to 2,535 MHz on the 4060 Ti, another 1.5% advantage. In practice, across our 21-game test suite, the 5060 Ti 16GB averaged clock speeds of 2,776 MHz compared to 2,725 MHz on the 4060 Ti 16GB — a slightly larger 1.9% advantage in favor of the newer card. Combined with SM and core counts, that gives the 5060 Ti 16GB an 8% advantage in raw compute. That's pretty negligible in terms of a gen-on-gen increase, but architectural updates can further impact the real-world performance. That means the newer part has a 56% advantage in raw memory bandwidth — though architecture and timings can still play a role. Taken together, based on the specifications, you should expect to see the newer GPU outperform its predecessor by anywhere from 8% to 56%, depending on whether a particular game or workload relies more on raw compute, memory bandwidth, or a blend of the two. In practice, compute tends to be the more important metric. As such, we'd expect a 15~25 percent lead from the 5060 Ti. Let's see how things go in actual benchmarks. Upscaling and frame generation are disabled for all these tests, as we view those as "performance enhancers" rather than baseline features that should be compared. Both the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and RTX 4060 Ti 16GB support Nvidia's various DLSS features, though the 5060 Ti also offers MFG (Multi Frame Generation) — which can smooth out performance but definitely doesn't improve the actual feel of games that support it as much as the numbers might suggest. The experience of DLSS 3 framegen in our view tends to be inflated by about 50–60 percent (meaning, divide the resulting number by 1.5–1.6 to get a realistic view of what it feels like), while MFG 4X is about a 170–200 percent inflation (divide by 2.7–3.0). Those are fuzzy approximations, but basically if you get less than a 50% "increase" in framerates via framegen, we would argue that it actually feels like a step backward. Or to put hard numbers on it, if the base performance is 60 FPS, framegen needs to run at 90 FPS or more and MFG 4X needs to run at 160 FPS or more. Some would argue even those figures are too generous, but our main point is that "FPS" inflation via frame generation techniques has been heavily abused as a true indication of performance. The charts and tables provide all the important numbers, so we're not going to dig into every single result. We're mostly interested in the overall trends, recognizing that individual games can come in above or below the averages. That's why we have an extensive 21 game test suite, with equal weighting given to each result via a geometric mean calculation. The nice thing about comparing two Nvidia GPUs, even though they're different architectures, is that relative performance ends up being pretty consistent across both rasterization and ray tracing games. AMD and Intel GPUs vary quite a bit more, depending on what specific games are used. Looking at the individual games, the 5060 Ti 16GB leads by 6% (Assassin's Creed Mirage) to as much as 29% (A Plague Tale: Requiem). Bumping up to 1080p ultra settings, most of the deltas are virtually unchanged. Minimum FPS ends up slightly closer overall at 18%, but with a wider 23% spread in our ray tracing tests and 16% in the rasterization games. Across all 21 games, we measured an 8% (Starfield) to 26% (Plague Tale: Requiem and Space Marine 2) delta in favor of the 5060 Ti. Given the memory bandwidth advantage, the 5060 Ti 16GB should increase its overall lead at higher resolutions, and it does — just not by much. The various games show an advantage of 9% (Starfield) to 29% (Plague Tale and Space Marine 2, again). Looking at other potential workloads, we have various disciplines that all loosely fall under the content creation umbrella. We also have 3D rendering via Blender, video transcoding using SPEC Workstation 4.0, and the Viewport test suite from SPEC Workstation 4.0. Many people — particularly gamers — may never do any of these tasks on their PC, though it's worth nothing that Nvidia's push for "neural rendering" techniques can also extend into AI-powered NPCs. That's not something we can directly benchmark at present, but there's potential for the AI performance to become more important in the coming years if AI NPCs catch on in some major games. As noted above, such workloads could become a bigger part of how people use their PCs and graphics cards in the future, even within games. It's also worth mentioning that none of these AI tests at present leverage the FP4 support that was added to the tensor cores in the Blackwell architecture, so there's potential for even more of an AI deficit if future applications make use of that number format. Video transcoding ends up being a virtual tie, indicating there's not a huge difference between the NVENC/NVDEC blocks in Ada and Blackwell. The 5060 Ti takes a 4% lead by virtue of running at slightly higher clock speeds, though Nvidia did supposedly improve the encoding quality — that's not something these tests measure, unfortunately. 3D modeling using Blender basically matches what we saw in gaming performance. SolidWorks agrees with that number, while 3ds Max shows an even larger 31% lead for the 5060 Ti. Those last two are part of the SPEC Workstation 4.0 Viewport tests, which show a 17% lead overall for the 5060 Ti, with a range of 1% (Creo) to as much as 31% (3ds Max). Most of the SPEC Workstation tests are truly for professionals, however, so we wouldn't put too much weight on them. Most paid professionals will have a workstation equipped with a workstation GPU (e.g. Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation or the new RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell). Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. As such, it's easy to think that the two are "tied" in features. First, the Blackwell RTX architecture adds support for Multi Frame Generation. We don't love the way the numbers are used to indicate massive performance improvements (i.e. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tried to claim that an "RTX 5070 is as far as an RTX 4090" at the launch event), but MFG isn't inherently bad. It's a nuanced discussion, in other words, and not the "fake frames BAD" mentality that often gets tossed around. Blackwell RTX, and by extension the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, is also supposed to have better support for so-called neural rendering (i.e. Microsoft's Cooperative Vectors API). We don't yet know precisely how much better it might be compared to older GPUs, but we do know Cooperative Vectors is supposed to work with all RTX GPUs — and that it's supposed to be better on Blackwell RTX. As noted earlier, the RTX 5060 Ti also has support for FP4 (and FP6) numerical formats in its tensor cores. Making proper use of FP4 presents challenges for AI models, but various algorithms have demonstrated superior performance and reduced memory requirements with a "negligible" drop in overall inference quality. However, Nvidia's new DLSS Transformers algorithms for upscaling (super resolution) and ray reconstruction appear to leverage native FP8 support. It's why the performance hit for DLSS Transformers tends to be substantially lower on RTX 40- and 50-series GPUs compared to RTX 30- and 20-series GPUs. Blackwell graphics cards no longer have PhysX support, so the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB simply can't run PhysX in older games that used the feature. (Not many recent games have used GPU PhysX, so this mostly applies to games like the Batman: Arkham series and Mirror's Edge, all of which are at least 10 years old now.) 32-bit CUDA support was likewise retired, which again mostly impacts older apps that are no longer being actively updated. The RTX 5060 Ti 16GB came out in April 2025 with a $429 MSRP. On paper, that clearly suggests a pricing advantage for the 5060 Ti 16GB. Since both GPU lines are made using TSMC's 4N process node, there's no reason for Nvidia to continue producing the older chips, and in fact all indications are that wafer orders for Ada Lovelace may have ended in the fall of 2024. At present, the least expensive RTX 5060 Ti 16GB card we can find is an Asus Dual RTX 5060 Ti 16GB for $492.98 at Newegg. That's about 15% above the base MSRP that Nvidia set, but Nvidia can't force its add-in board (AIB) partners to actually sell cards at MSRP. With ongoing GPU shortages, it's little surprise that nearly all 50-series GPUs are "overpriced" relative to MSRP. With production of those GPUs likely halted last year, only limited supplies remain. Mostly, it's third-party marketplace resellers on Newegg, Amazon, and similar storefronts trying to make some serious money. Yeah, that's a bad choice unless for some reason you specifically need the older hardware. This was pretty much a foregone conclusion, but the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB easily beats the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB in every conceivable metric. There's only one potential advantage to the 4060 Ti, and it's nebulous at best: It supports PhysX and 32-bit CUDA (though both are likely deprecated and will fade away in the coming months). In contrast, the 5060 Ti 16GB offers about 20% higher gaming performance on average, across nearly all tested resolutions and settings. It's also about 20% faster in AI workloads and 3D rendering, and about 17% faster in a selections of professional applications. That's largely thanks to having 56% more memory bandwidth, courtesy of GDDR7, though other architectural upgrades and slightly increased core counts also factor into things. Unless you're lucky enough to find an RTX 4060 Ti 16GB on a steep discount, the 5060 Ti 16GB costs quite a bit less at popular online retail sites like Newegg and Amazon. Slower performance, missing new features, and a price that's currently 38% higher? If you're wondering about power use and efficiency, even though the TGP (Total Graphics Power) on the 5060 Ti 16GB is 15W higher on paper, in practice it averaged lower power use in our testing. With 21% higher performance at 4K, that works out to much improved overall efficiency. Hopefully it goes without saying, but just because the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB offers more performance and costs less than a new 4060 Ti 16GB, that doesn't mean people who already own the prior generation card should be in a rush to upgrade. Let's also not forget that there are 8GB variants of both GPUs. Unless you can score a particularly impressive deal, the lack of VRAM is increasingly becoming a problem for 8GB cards. Sure, older and lighter games can run just fine on such GPUs, but it's the newer games that need faster hardware, and they're having problems. The 4060 Ti 16GB and 8GB offer nearly identical performance in our test suite at 1080p, but the 16GB card pulls ahead by 7% at 1440p, and by 36% at 4K — with the most demanding newer games exceeding those averages. That's about 40% more performance per dollar, which beats any of the other RTX 50-series GPUs. Jarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

The shot above—in all its mesmerizing, dull-yellow grandeur—captures our Sun's million-degree corona in ultraviolet light. Taken on March 9, 2025, from about 47.8 million miles (77 million kilometers) away, this image isn't a single pretty picture. In fact, it's a mosaic—stitched together from 200 individual shots of the Sun, each of them captured by the spacecraft's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The result is a 12,544-by-12,544-pixel megaportrait that lets you zoom in (on the ESA site) and nerd out like never before. As detailed on the site, the image showcases some fundamental components of our solar host. The prominences are roughly 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (10,000 degrees Celsius), a far cry from the million-degree corona. The joint Solar Orbiter mission is part of a larger effort to decode the chaotic dynamics of the solar atmosphere—including how magnetic fields twist, snap, and sometimes launch solar storms that can mess with satellites and power grids back home. While this image dazzles our naked eyes, it's also rich in data for researchers chasing questions about solar heating, plasma behavior, and space weather forecasting. But let's be real: It's also just cool as hell. Beyond that, it's paying back the favor with gloriously high-res imagery. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A detailed investigation by 3elife, a Chinese tech and news publication, purports these SoCs are derivatives of Intel's Panther Lake design, with their successor allegedly based on Nova Lake. Software-defined vehicles are automobiles where a majority of the functionality is handled through software, rather than traditional physical, mechanical, or electronic components. Compared to desktops, x86 has seen limited adoption in the automotive industry, primarily due to stringent power consumption requirements, real-time processing demands, and safety and security concerns. However, as ADAS, autonomous driving, in-car experiences, and the need for high-performance computing in vehicles grow, Intel is positioning itself to gain traction in this market. The Raptor-Lake-based Malibou Lake platform represents Intel's latest SDV offering, featuring up to 14 cores (6P+8E), 24MB L3 cache, 96 EUs, and support for eight cameras, slated for a Q4 2024 launch. Yesterday, Intel shared several slides detailing Frisco Lake, officially poised to deliver 10 times better AI performance and 61% higher efficiency than current offerings, presumably Malibou Lake. In addition, the inclusion of an Xe3 (Celestial) graphics IP block strongly suggests these SoCs are indeed derived from Panther Lake, a connection that is supported by the source and kernel patches (via Harukaze at X). So... -----------202x ApolloLake (Atom-N) 2020 AshCreekFalls (SkyLake-SP-Auto) 2025 MalibouLake (RaptorLake-P-Auto) 2026 FriscoLake (PantherLake-P-Auto) 2028 GrizzlyLake (MonumentPeak) with [NovaLake Only E-Core???] That's not all, as 3elife secured an alleged roadmap detailing Intel's future product offerings from a third party. Apparently, Malibou Lake was in line to be superseded by Grizzly Lake, which is now expected to serve as Intel's third-generation SDV SoC design. This time frame coincides with Nova Lake, and one rumored configuration of that architecture includes 32 efficient cores (16P+32E+4LPE), likely based on the Arctic Wolf microarchitecture. So, if these rumors hold true, Intel is porting its consumer-grade architectures to the automotive industry with a one-year cadence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In January, Meta announced its stand-alone video editing app for making Reels, simply called Edits. The new video-creation tool is clearly inspired by the success of ByteDance's similar CapCut app for TikTok, with tools dedicated to streamlined editing of vertical clips. Instagram's Reels feed of algorithmically selected clips was launched five years ago, also in direct response to TikTok's expanding influence at the time. Meta has never shied away from its mimetic tendencies; the company tends to adopt the buzzy software features of other apps by building those same features into its platforms. So, Edits, a creator-focused tool that makes it even easier to pump out social videos, is an unsurprising release designed to keep pace with competition. Are you interested in getting started with Edits from Meta? I've been exploring the app since it dropped earlier this week. Here's what you need to know about Instagram's video-editing tool, how it generates Reels, as well as how Edits differs from CapCut. The Edits app is now available to download on both Apple and Android phones. After you first open Edits on your phone, you will be required to log into the app using an Instagram account, which is frustrating but not shocking. In the Projects tab, you can see all of your recorded videos, and you can upload videos from your phone's camera roll. Here is where you can jot down notes and brainstorm ideas for future Reels, and also watch over your saved videos from Instagram. Next is the Inspiration tab that shows a scrollable feed of videos that use trending audio tracks, plus a button that makes it easy for you to snatch one of those songs and use it in your own video. The middle tab is where all of your in-progress video Projects are located, and this is also the tab where you can upload any clips already stored on your camera roll that you want to turn into Reels. The Inspiration tab plays Reels that use trending songs and gives you a quick way to make your own video with a popular song. The Ideas tab is like a scrapbook for things you want to incorporate into new Reels. You don't need to have experience with TikTok's CapCut to get the hang of Edits, although those familiar with existing tools for editing vertical videos will immediately recognize most of this user interface: a timeline of clips in the middle with various tools along the bottom. Here you can also add text, stickers, and image overlays to your video creation. Long-press on a clip and drag it to shuffle everything up. While the purposes of these two apps are almost identical, there are a few key differences between Meta's Edits apps for Instagram and ByteDance's CapCut app for TikTok. Mainly, Edits is more streamlined and doesn't feel as cluttered—at least for now. There's no subscription option in Edits to unlock extra features, which is the case with CapCut, though Meta could add subscription tiers to Edits in the future. There's also not an overwhelming amount of AI-powered editing tools in Edits, which CapCut definitely has, although those could potentially be added at a later date. Edits is initially more approachable as an app, but picky creators may find CapCut's additional options for video editing gives them a more fine-tuned level of control over the final product. You can clip out specific objects or people in videos and isolate them. There's an automated captioning feature for videos with speech. There are multiple languages and styles available for captions.

Mainly, Edits is more streamlined and doesn't feel as cluttered—at least for now. There's no subscription option in Edits to unlock extra features, which is the case with CapCut, though Meta could add subscription tiers to Edits in the future. There's also not an overwhelming amount of AI-powered editing tools in Edits, which CapCut definitely has, although those could potentially be added at a later date. Edits is initially more approachable as an app, but picky creators may find CapCut's additional options for video editing gives them a more fine-tuned level of control over the final product. You can clip out specific objects or people in videos and isolate them. There's an automated captioning feature for videos with speech. There are multiple languages and styles available for captions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tech behemoth is betting that planting millions of eucalyptus trees in Brazil will be the path to a greener future. Some ecologists and local residents are far less sure. The grove grew as if indifferent to certain unspoken rules of botany. There was no understory, no foreground or background, only the trees themselves, which grew as a wall of bare trunks that rose 100 feet or so before concluding with a burst of thick foliage near the top. I had no service out here—we had just left a remote nature preserve in southwestern Brazil—but I reached for my phone anyway, for a picture. The concern on the face of my travel partner, Clariana Vilela Borzone, a geographer and translator who grew up nearby, flicked to amusement. My camera roll was already full of eucalyptus. Across the dirt path where we were stopped, another pasture had been cleared for planting. The sparse bushes and trees that had once shaded cattle in the fields had been toppled and piled up, as if in a Pleistocene gravesite. Borzone's friends and neighbors were divided on the aesthetics of these groves. Some liked the order and eternal verdancy they brought to their slice of the Cerrado, a large botanical region that arcs diagonally across Brazil's midsection. Its native savanna landscape was largely gnarled, low-slung, and, for much of the year, rather brown. And since most of that flora had been cleared decades ago for cattle pasture, it was browner and flatter still. “Green deserts,” they called the groves, suggesting bounty from afar but holding only dirt and silence within. These were not actually forests teeming with animals and undergrowth, they charged, but at best tinder for a future megafire in a land parched, in part, by their vigorous growth. This was in fact a common complaint across Latin America: in Chile, the planted rows of eucalyptus were called the “green soldiers.” It was easy to imagine getting lost in the timber, a funhouse mirror of trunks as far as the eye could see. The timber companies that planted these trees push back on these criticisms as caricatures of a genus that's demonized all over the world. They point to their sustainable forestry certifications and their handsome spending on fire suppression, and to the microphones they've placed that record cacophonies of birds and prove the groves are anything but barren. Whether people like the look of these trees or not, they are meeting a human need, filling an insatiable demand for paper and pulp products all over the world. Much of the material for the world's toilet and tissue paper is grown in Brazil, and that, they argue, is a good thing: Grow fast and furious here, as responsibly as possible, to save many more trees elsewhere. But I was in this region for a different reason: Apple. I was here because tech executives many thousands of miles away were racing toward, and in some cases stumbling, on their way to meet their climate promises—too little time, and too much demand for new devices and AI data centers. Not far from here, they had struck some of the largest-ever deals for carbon credits. They were asking something new of this tree: Could Latin America's eucalyptus be a scalable climate solution? New research shows that California's climate policy created up to 39 million carbon credits that aren't achieving real carbon savings. But companies can buy these forest offsets to justify polluting more anyway. On a practical level, the answer seemed straightforward. Nobody disputed how swiftly or reliably eucalyptus could grow in the tropics. Each tree was roughly 47% carbon, which meant that many tons of it could be stored within every planted hectare. Come back and look at these young trees tomorrow, and you'd see it: fresh millimeters of carbon, chains of cellulose set into lignin. They were exerting their wealth and technological oversight to try to make timber operations more sustainable, more supportive of native flora, and less water intensive. Still, that was a hard sell to some here, where hundreds of thousands of hectares of pasture are already in line for planting; more trees were a bleak prospect in a land increasingly racked by drought and fire. Critics called the entire exercise an excuse to plant even more trees for profit. “Who wants to disappoint me first?” Mother Nature asked with a sly smile. It was a third of the way to 2030—a date embraced by many corporations aiming to stay in line with the UN's goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels—and where was the progress? A limited supply of the devices were already carbon neutral, thanks to things like recycled materials and parts that were specially sent by ship—not flown—from one factory to another. These special watches were labeled with a green leaf on Apple's iconically soft, white boxes. Critics were quick to point out that declaring an individual product “carbon neutral” while the company was still polluting had the whiff of an early victory lap, achieved with some convenient accounting. Apple claimed that changes like procuring renewable power and using recycled materials had enabled it to cut emissions 75% since 2015. “We're always prioritizing reductions; they've got to come first,” Chris Busch, Apple's director of environmental initiatives, told me soon after the launch. The company also acknowledged that it could not find reductions to balance all its emissions. Since the 1990s, companies have purchased carbon credits based largely on avoiding emissions. Take some patch of forest that was destined for destruction and protect it; the stored carbon that wasn't lost is turned into credits. But as the carbon market expanded, so did suspicion of carbon math—in some cases, because of fraud or bad science, but also because efforts to contain deforestation are often frustrated, with destruction avoided in one place simply happening someplace else. Corporations that once counted on carbon credits for “avoided” emissions can no longer trust them. (Many consumers feel they can't either, with some even suing Apple over the ways it used past carbon projects to make its claims about the Apple Watch.) But that demand to cancel out carbon dioxide hasn't gone anywhere—if anything, as AI-driven emissions knock some companies off track from reaching their carbon targets (and raise questions about the techniques used to claim emissions reductions), the need is growing. So the new move is to invest in carbon “removal” rather than avoidance. None of these technologies work at the scale and price that would help Apple and others meet their shorter-term targets. For that, trees have emerged again as the answer. To expand those efforts in a way that would make a meaningful dent in emissions, Apple determined, it would also need to make carbon removal profitable. A big part of this effort would be driven by the Restore Fund, a $200 million partnership with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, a US environmental nonprofit, to invest in “high quality” projects that promoted reforestation on degraded lands. Profits would come from responsibly turning trees into products, Goldman's head of sustainability explained when the fund was announced in 2021. But it was also an opportunity for Apple, and future investors, to “almost look at, touch, and feel their carbon,” he said—a concreteness that carbon credits had previously failed to offer. The Brazilian timber plans were by far the largest in scale, and were managed by BTG Pactual, Latin America's largest investment bank. Busch connected me with Mark Wishnie, head of sustainability for Timberland Investment Group, BTG's US-based subsidiary, which acquires and manages properties on behalf of institutional investors. After years in the eucalyptus business, Wishnie, who lives in Seattle, was used to strong feelings about the tree. “Has the idea that eucalyptus is invasive come up?” he asked pointedly. (It's an “exotic” species in Brazil, yes, but the risk of invasiveness is low for the varieties most commonly planted for forestry.) Using eucalyptus for carbon removal also offered a new opportunity. Wishnie was overseeing a planned $1 billion initiative that was set to transform BTG's timber portfolio; it aimed at a 50-50 split between timber and native restoration on old pastureland, with an emphasis on connecting habitats along rivers and streams. In a part of Brazil that historically gets little conservation attention, it would potentially represent the largest effort yet to actually bring back the native landscape. It's about, really, the business that you can optimize.” So far, BTG has raised $630 million for the initiative and earmarked 270,000 hectares, an area more than double the city of Los Angeles. It didn't take very much digging into municipal land records in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where many of the company's Cerrado holdings are located, to turn up a recently sold farm that matched the size. It was called Fazenda Engano, or “Deception Farm”—hence the rebrand. The land was registered to an LLC with links to holding companies for other BTG eucalyptus plantations located in a neighboring region that locals had taken to calling the Cellulose Valley for its fast-expanding tree farms and pulp factories. I wasn't sure if I could visit Project Alpha and see whether Apple and its partners had really found a better way to plant, but I started making plans to go to the Cerrado anyway, to see the forests behind those little green leaves on the box. In 2015, a study by Thomas Crowther, an ecologist then at ETH Zürich, attempted a census of global tree cover, finding more than 3 trillion trees in all. A useful number, surprisingly hard to divine, like counting insects or bacteria. A follow-up study a few years later proved more controversial: Earth's surface held space for at least 1 trillion more trees. That represented a chance to store 200 metric gigatons, or about 25%, of atmospheric carbon once they matured. (The paper was later corrected in multiple ways, including an acknowledgment that the carbon storage potential could be about one-third less.) The study became a media sensation, soon followed by a fleet of tree-planting initiatives with “trillion” in the name—most prominently through a World Economic Forum effort launched by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at Davos, which President Donald Trump pledged to support during his first term. But for as long as tree planting has been heralded as a good deed—from Johnny Appleseed to programs that promise a tree for every shoe or laptop purchased—the act has also been chased closely by a follow-up question: How many of those trees survive? Consider Trump's most notable planting, which placed an oak on the White House grounds in 2018. To critics, including Bill Gates, the efforts were symbolic of short-term thinking at the expense of deeper efforts to cut or remove carbon. (Gates's spat with Benioff descended to name-calling in the New York Times. Soon after arriving in São Paulo last summer, I drove some 150 miles into the hills outside the city to see the outdoor lab Brancalion has filled with experiments on how to plant trees better: trees given too many nutrients or too little; saplings monitored with wires and tubes like ICU admits, or skirted with tarps that snatch away rainwater. Brancalion works part-time for a carbon-focused restoration company, Re:Green, which had recently sold 3 million carbon credits to Microsoft and was raising a mix of native trees in parts of the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest. While most of the trees in his lab were native ones too, like jacaranda and brazilwood, he also studies eucalyptus. The lab in fact sat on a former eucalyptus farm; in the heart of his fields, a grove of 80-year-old trees dripped bark like molting reptiles. Eucalyptus planting swelled dramatically under Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1960s. Still, that campaign is also said to have done just as Wishnie described, easing the demand that would have been put on regions like the Amazon as Rio and São Paulo were built. Today's saplings are the products of decades of tinkering with clonal breeding, growing quick and straight, resistant to pestilence and drought, with exacting growth curves that chart biomass over time: Seven years to maturity is standard for pulp. If the goal is a trillion trees, or many millions of tons of carbon, no business is better suited to keeping count than timber. It might sound strange to claim carbon credits for trees that you plan to chop down and turn into toilet paper or chairs. Whatever carbon is stored in those ephemeral products is, of course, a blip compared with the millennia that CO2 hangs in the atmosphere. But these carbon projects take a longer view. What's more, because the timber is constantly being tracked, the carbon is easy to measure, solving a key problem with carbon credits. Most mature native ecosystems, whether tropical forests or grasslands, will eventually store more carbon than a tree farm. Eucalyptus can be planted immediately, with great speed, and the first carbon credits are issued in just a few years. “It fits a corporate model very well, and it fits the verification model very well,” said Robin Chazdon, a forest researcher at Australia's University of the Sunshine Coast. A 2019 analysis published in Nature found that 45% of carbon removal projects the researchers studied worldwide involved single-species tree farms. In 2023, the nonprofit Verra, the largest bearer of carbon credit standards, said it would forbid projects using “non-native monocultures”—that is, plants like eucalyptus or pine that don't naturally grow in the places where they're being farmed. The idea was to assuage concerns that carbon credits were going to plantations that would have been built anyway given the demand for wood, meaning they wouldn't actually remove any extra carbon from the atmosphere. The uproar was immediate—from timber companies, but also from carbon developers and NGOs. How would it be possible to scale anything—conservation, carbon removal—without them? It would allow non-native monocultures so long as they grew in land that was deemed “degraded,” or previously cleared of vegetation—land like cattle pasture. And it took steps to avoid counting plantings in close proximity to other areas of fast tree growth, the idea being that they wanted to avoid rewarding purely industrial projects that would've been planted anyway. Brancalion happened to agree with the criticisms of exotic monocultures. But all the same, he believed eucalyptus had been unfairly demonized. He had been testing ways to turn eucalyptus from perceived foes into friends of native forest restoration. It's never like that with eucalyptus, which are wonderfully predictable growers. In practice, foresters have generally preferred to keep things separate. And with a bank better known locally as a major investor in industries, like beef and soy, that contributed to deforestation than any efforts for native restoration. “You can come interview me in five, six years. You don't have to be super smart to realize what will happen after planting too many eucalyptus in a dry region.” He wished me luck on my journey westward. As I headed with Borzone toward a small nature preserve called Parque do Pombo, she told me that young Brazilians are often raised with a sense of dislike, if not fear, of this land. When Borzone texted her mother, a local biologist, to say where we were going, she replied: “I hear that place is full of ticks.” (Her intel, it turned out, was correct.) What can be easy to miss is the fantastic variety of these plants, the result of natural selection cranked into overdrive. Species, many of which blew in from the Amazon, survived by growing deep roots through the acidic soil and thicker bark to resist regular brush fires. The Cerrado is home to 12,000 flowering plant species, 4,000 of which are found only there. Each stop on our drive seemed to yield a new treasure for Borzone to show me: Guavira, a tree that bears fruit in grape-like bunches that appear only two weeks in a year; it can be made into a jam that is exceptionally good on toast. Pequi, more divisive, like fermented mango mixed with cheese. Others bear names Borzone can only faintly recall in the Indigenous Guaraní language and is thus unable to google. Certain uses are more memorable: Give this one here, a tiny frond that looks like a miniature Christmas fir, to make someone get pregnant. At that time, even prominent ecologists, fearing total destruction of the Amazon, advocated moving industry here, invoking what Brazilians call the boi de piranha—a myth about casting a cow into infested waters so that the other cows could ford downstream. Toby Pennington, a Cerrado ecologist at the University of Exeter, told me it remains a sacrificial zone, at times faring worse when environmentally minded politicians are in power. Some ecologists warn that this ecosystem could be entirely gone in the next decade. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there's a certain prickliness among grassland researchers, who are, like their chosen flora, used to being trampled. In 2019, 46 of them authored a response in Science to Crowther's trillion-trees study, arguing not about tree counting but about the land he proposed for reforestation. Much of it, they argued, including places like the Cerrado, was not appropriate for so many trees. It was too much biomass for the land to handle. “With Cerrado, you have to forget everything that you learn about ecology, because it's all based in forest ecology. It's not good.” The Cerrado contains a vast range of landscapes, from grassy fields to wooded forests, but the majority of it, she explained, is poorly suited to certain rules of carbon finance that would incentivize people to protect or restore it. While the underground forest stores plenty of carbon, it builds up its stock slowly and can be difficult to measure. “They are using the carbon discourse as one more argument to say that business is great,” Durigan told me. “They are happy to be seen as the good guys.” Bringing the Cerrado back would be hard work—usually requiring fire and hacking away at invasive grasses. But even simply leaving it alone could allow the ecosystem to begin to repair itself and offer something like the old savanna habitat. In recent years, Durigan had visited hundreds of eucalyptus farms in the area, shadowing her students who had been hired by timber companies to help establish promised corridors of native vegetation in accordance with federal rules. Durigan saw plants in isolated patches growing taller than they normally would, largely thanks to the suppression of regular brush fires. The result was an environment gradually choking on itself, at risk of collapse during drought and retaining only a fraction of the Cerrado's original diversity. If this was what people meant by bringing back the Cerrado, she believed it was only hastening its ultimate disappearance. In a recent survey of the watershed around the Parque do Pombo, which is hemmed in on each side by eucalyptus, two other researchers reported finding “devastation” and turned to Plato's description of Attica's forests, cleared to build the city of Athens: “What remains now compared to what existed is like the skeleton of a sick man … All the rich and soft soil has dissolved, leaving the country of skin and bones.” The Parque do Pombo groundskeeper looked over at his rusting fuel tank and apologized. It had been spoiled by the last rain. At least, he said, it was all downhill to the highway. We only made it about halfway down the eucalyptus-lined road. After the car huffed and left us stranded, Borzone and I started walking toward the highway, anticipating a long night. We remembered locals' talk of jaguars recently pushed into the area by development. But after only 30 minutes or so, a set of lights came into view across the plain. After talking to a worker, we boarded the empty tour bus and were taken to a cluster of spotlit tents, where women prepared eucalyptus seedlings, stacking crates of them on white fold-out tables. A night shift like this one was unusual. “You don't do this work without a few birds at home to feed,” a driver remarked as he watched his colleagues filling holes in the field by the light of their headlamps. After getting permission from his boss, he drove us an hour each way to town to the nearest gas station. On TikTok, workers post selfies and views from tractors in the nearby groves, backed by a song from the local country music duo Jads e Jadson. “I'm going to plant some eucalyptus / I'll get rich and you'll fall in love with me,” sings a down-on-his-luck man at risk of losing his fiancée. Later, when he cuts down the trees and becomes a wealthy man with better options, he cuts off his betrothed, too. The race to plant more eucalyptus here is backed heavily by the state government, which last year waived environmental requirements for new farms on pasture and hopes to quickly double its area in just a few years. The trees were an important component of Brazil's plan to meet its global climate commitments, and the timber industry was keen to cash in. What's top of mind for everyone, though, is worsening fires. Even when we visited in midwinter, the weather was hot and dry. Suzano would be forced to make a rare pause in its planting when soil temperatures reached 154 °F. In other places struck by megafires, like Portugal and Chile, eucalyptus has been blamed for worsening the flames. (The Chilean government has recently excluded pine and eucalyptus farms from its climate plans.) But here in Brazil, where climate change is already supersizing the blazes, the industry offers sophisticated systems to detect and suppress fires, argued Calmon of Conservation International. “You really need to protect it because that's your asset,” he said. (BTG also noted that in parts of the Cerrado where human activity has increased, fires have decreased.) Eucalyptus is often portrayed as impossibly thirsty compared with other trees, but Calmon pointed out it is not uniquely so. Another hope, Wishnie told me, is that by vastly increasing the forest canopy, the new eucalyptus will actually gather moisture and help produce rain. That's a common narrative and one that's been taught in schools here in Três Lagoas for decades, Borzone explained when we met up the day after our rescue with Marine Dubos-Raoul, a local geographer and university professor, and two of her students. If this idea about rain was in fact true, they hadn't seen it here. They crouched around the table at the cafe, speaking in a hush; their opinions weren't particularly popular in this lumber town. Dubos-Raoul had long tracked the impacts of the waves of planting on longtime rural residents, who complained that industry had taken their water or sprayed their gardens with pesticides. “People would have tears in their eyes,” she said. Shortly after talking with Dubos-Raoul, we ventured to the town of Ribas do Rio Pardo to meet Charlin Castro at his family's river resort. With thousands of workers arriving, mostly temporarily, to build the factory and plant the fields, the sleepy farming village had turned into a boomtown, and developed something of a lawless reputation—prostitution, homelessness, collisions between logging trucks and drunk drivers—and Castro was chronicling much of it for a hyperlocal Instagram news outlet, while also running for city council. The factory was transforming the town into a “a real place,” as he put it, even if change was at times painful. His father, Camilo, gestured with a sinewy arm over to the water, where he recalled boat races involving canoes with crews of a dozen. It was impossible to imagine now as I watched a family cool off in this bend in the river, the water just knee deep. But it's hard to say what exactly is causing the low water levels. Perhaps it's silt from the ranches, Charlin suggested. Upstream, Ana Cláudia (who goes by “Tica”) and Antonio Gilberto Lima were more certain what was to blame. Streams were dry, and the old pools in the pastures where they used to fish were gone, replaced by trees; tapirs were rummaging through their garden, pushed, they believed, by lack of habitat. They were surrounded by eucalyptus, planted in waves with the arrival of each new factory. “The trees are sad,” Gilberto said, looking out over his few dozen pale-humped animals grazing around scattered Cerrado species left in the paddock. Tica told me she knew that paper and pulp had to come from somewhere, and that many people locally were benefiting. But the downsides were getting overlooked, she thought. Perhaps, she hoped, it could reach American investors, too. A few weeks before my trip, BTG had decided it was ready to show off Project Alpha. The visit was set for my last day in Brazil; the farm formerly known as Fazenda Engano was further upriver in Camapuã, a town that borders Ribas do Rio Pardo. It was a long, circuitous drive north to get out there, but it wouldn't be that way much longer; a new highway was being paved that would directly connect the two towns, part of an initiative between the timber industry and government to expand the cellulose hub northward. For now, though, it was still the frontier. That distance was important evidence that the trees would store more carbon than what's accounted for in a business-as-usual scenario. It wasn't good business to buy land and not plant every acre you could with timber. It was made possible only with green investments from Apple and others. That morning, Wishnie had emailed me a press release announcing that Microsoft had joined Apple in seeking help from BTG to help meet its carbon demands. I was set to meet Carlos Guerreiro, head of Latin American operations for BTG's timber subsidiary, at a gas station in town, where we would set off together for the 24,000-hectare property. A forester in Brazil for much of his life, he had flown in from his home near São Paulo early that morning; he planned to check out the progress of the planting at Project Alpha and then swing down to the bank's properties across the Cellulose Valley, where BTG was finalizing a $376 million deal to sell land to Suzano. Guerreiro defended BTG's existing holdings as sustainable engines of development in the region. (BTG says it will protect more land on future farms to arrive at its 50-50 target.) We stood over trenches that had been planted with native seeds just weeks before, shoots only starting to poke out of the dirt. The approach of largely letting things be was already yielding results, he noted: In parts of the property that hadn't been grazed in years, they could already see the hardscrabble Cerrado clawing back with a vengeance. They'd been marveling at the fauna, caught on camera traps: tapirs, anteaters, all kinds of birds. The land wouldn't be sold to another rancher and go back to looking like other parts of the property, which were regularly cleared of native habitat. He was planting at a rate of 40,000 seedlings per day in neat trenches filled with white lime to make the sandy Cerrado soil more inviting. In seven years or so, half of the trees will be thinned and pulped. Guerreiro described a model where clusters of farms mixed with preserves like this one will be planted around mills throughout the Cerrado. This experiment, Wishnie told me later, could have a big payoff. The important thing, he reminded me, was that stretches of the Cerrado would be protected at a scale no one had achieved before—something that wouldn't happen without eucalyptus. He strongly disagreed with the scientists who said eucalyptus didn't fit here. “We talk about restoration as if it's a thing that happens,” he said. When I asked Pilon to take a look at satellite imagery and photos of the property, she was unimpressed. It looked to her like yet another misguided attempt at planting trees in an area that had once naturally been a dense savanna. (Her assessment is supported by a land survey from the 1980s that classified this land as a typical Cerrado ecosystem—some trees, but mostly shrubbery. As Lucy Rowland, an expert on the region at the University of Exeter and another BAD signatory, put it: “Under no circumstances should planting eucalyptus ever be considered a viable project to receive carbon credits in the Cerrado.” Over months of reporting, the way that both sides spoke in absolutes about how to save this vanishing ecosystem had become familiar. Chazdon, the Australia-based forest researcher, told me she too felt that the tenor of the argument over how and where to grow has become more vehement as demand for tree-based carbon removal has intensified. Chazdon had been excited to hear about BTG's project. It was, she thought, the type of thing that was sorely needed in conservation—mixing profitable enterprises with an approach to restoration that considers the wider landscape. “I can understand why the Cerrado ecologists are up in arms,” she said. “They get the feeling that nobody cares about their ecosystems.” But demands for ecological purity could indeed get in the way of doing much of anything—especially in places like the Cerrado, where laws and financing favor destruction over restoration. While there is, in fact, a limit to how much additional land the world needs for pulp and plywood products in the near future, there is virtually no limit to how much land it could devote to sequestering carbon. It was true, Chazdon said, that planting eucalyptus in the Cerrado was an act of destruction—it'd make that land nearly impossible to recover. The areas preserved in between them would also likely struggle to fully renew itself, without fire or clearing. And it might not fit the profit model—the flywheel that Apple and others are seeking in order to scale up carbon removal fast. Barbara Haya, who studies carbon offsets at the University of California, Berkeley, encouraged me to think about all of it differently. The improvements to planting eucalyptus here, at this farm, could be a perfectly good thing for this industry, she said. Perhaps they merit some claim about greener toilet paper or plywood. Haya would leave that debate to the ecologists. But we weren't talking about toilet paper or plywood. There seemed to be many plausible scenarios for where this land was heading. Was eucalyptus the only feasible route for carbon to find its way here? Haya is among the experts who argue that the idea of precisely canceling out corporate emissions to reach carbon neutrality is a broken one. That's not to say protecting nature can't help fight climate change. Conserving existing forests and grasslands, for example, could often yield greater carbon and biodiversity benefits in the long run than planting new forests. But the carbon math used to justify those efforts was often fuzzier. This makes every claim of carbon neutrality fragile and drives companies toward projects that are easier to prove, she thinks, but perhaps have less impact. One idea is that companies should instead shift to a “contribution” model that tracks how much money they put toward climate mitigation, without worrying about the exact amount of carbon removed. “Could they put that same amount of money and really make a difference?” Such an approach, she pointed out, could help finance the preservation of those last intact Cerrado remnants. Or it could fund restoration, even if the restored vegetation takes years to grow or sometimes needs to burn. The approach raises its own questions—about how to measure the impact of those investments and what kinds of incentives would motivate corporations to act. But it's a vision that has gained more popularity as scrutiny of carbon credits grows and the options available to companies narrow. Before we left the farm, Borzone and I had one more task: to plant a tree. The sun was getting low over Project Alpha when I was handed an iron contraption that cradled a eucalyptus seedling, pulled from a tractor piled with plants. “There's nothing wrong with the trees,” Borzone had said earlier, squinting up at the row of 18-month-old eucalyptus, their fluttering leaves flashing in the hot wind as if in an ill-practiced burlesque show. “I have to remind myself of that.” But still it felt strange putting one in the ground. We were asking so much of it, after all. It poked out at a slight angle that I was sure someone else would need to fix later, or else this eucalyptus tree would grow askew. The worker grabbed the tool from my hand and headed toward it, pushing seedlings down as he went, hurried but precise, one tree after another. Gregory Barber is a journalist based in San Francisco.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adobe on Thursday launched the latest iteration of its Firefly family of image generation AI models, a model for generating vectors, and a redesigned web app that houses all its AI models, plus some from its competitors. There's also a mobile app for Firefly in the works. Alexandru Costin, VP of Generative AI at Adobe, said that the company trained the models with a higher order of compute magnitude to enable them to generate more detailed images. He added that, as compared to previous generation models, the new models improve text generation in images and have features that let users use images of their choice to get the model to generate pictures in that style. The company is also making its Firefly video model, which launched in limited beta last year, available to everyone. It lets users generate video clips from a text prompt or image, use camera angles, specify start and end frames to control shots, generate atmospheric elements, and customize motion design elements. The model can generate video clips from text at resolutions up to 1080p. It lets users generate or import images, remix them, and collaborate with others — similar to what you can do with other AI-based ideaboards from Visual Electric, Cove, or Kosmik. The company said these new models would soon be integrated into its product portfolio, but didn't give a timeline for the rollout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. You might have already made up your mind about lining up outside a GameStop to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. Or maybe, if you're like me, you're wondering whether it's smart to shell out $450 for Nintendo's console when prices are jumping everywhere. Whatever you decide, the first thing to know is that, as of April 24, Nintendo has launched preorders in the US and Canada. In today's age of scalpers, preordering a Nintendo Switch 2 isn't as simple as adding it to your cart when the website goes live. Don't worry, we break it all down in this guide. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Everything you play on it will look better, thanks to a custom Nvidia graphics card. The LCD screen might feel like a step back from the Switch OLED version—OLED typically offers better contrast and vibrant colors, but LCD is often brighter. That said, the 7.9-inch screen now sports a 1080p resolution with HDR support. It also has a 120-Hz variable refresh rate, meaning you'll see more frames in a single second, making everything on the screen feel more fluid. The Joy-Con 2 controllers are larger to accommodate the bigger console, and now, you can use them as mice in certain games like Drag X Drive. That might also mean that shooting in a first-person shooter can feel more precise, and it can enhance the gameplay of a real-time strategy game like Civilization VII, if your arms don't get tired first. Nintendo confirmed the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not use Hall effect sensors, but are still more durable and smooth. They now connect to the Switch 2 via magnets. The Switch 2 comes with two USB-C ports, allowing you to charge it in handheld mode when it's on a table, and also connect peripherals like the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, which lets you bring your face into games when socializing with friends. These GameChat features require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. On the front are two USB-A ports to connect accessories. You cannot use your old microSD card—microSD Express is significantly faster, which affects download speeds and how quickly games load. The only game bundle at launch is with Mario Kart World. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. It doesn't look like you'll be able to preorder the Switch 2 through Amazon, but this could change. You can keep an eye on Nintendo's Amazon storefront. There's some risk involved in preordering a Switch 2 from one of the big retailers. Scalpers and bots could get to them first, a plague we've seen before with graphics cards. Thankfully, Nintendo has a solution to prevent all the Switch 2 stock from going to scalpers if you buy directly from the company. First, sign in to your Nintendo Account here and register your interest in purchasing the console (you need to be at least 18 years old). You'll then receive an email when it's your time to purchase, and the company says the first batch of invites will go out on May 8. Orders will be shipped to your address of choice in the US and Canada. Nintendo says “release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times,” so you might not have a Switch 2 on June 5. While Nintendo announced a bevy of games during the Switch 2 Direct on April 2, only a select number will be available on June 5. There will be several other games launching over the summer, like Donkey Kong Bananza, Drag X Drive, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. However, Nintendo has announced a handful of “Switch 2 Edition” games that will take advantage of the Switch 2's hardware for enhanced graphics, smoother gameplay, and in some situations, new content. There are several first-party accessories you can snag for the Switch 2 console. Some of these have seen price hikes due to the tariff trade war. You might be better off holding onto your original Nintendo Switch, but if you want to reduce the sting of buying a Switch 2 even a little bit, GameStop will have special trade-in values that start on April 24. The catch is they need to be in pretty good condition—GameStop will not accept Switch consoles with Joy-Con drift. You also need everything that came in the original box. One of the big announcements from the April 2 Nintendo Direct was that GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. Just like how you've been able to enjoy SNES and Game Boy games, now you can relive the glory days of the GameCube. These games will look better and play at higher resolution, though they're not remasters. These GameCube games will launch on June 5 alongside the Switch 2, and you'll need to subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online: Expansion Pack. (That's a separate, pricier tier from the standard Switch Online membership.) Unfortunately, you will need a Switch 2 console to play these GameCube games.
