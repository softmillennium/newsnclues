Valerie Bertinelli is embracing everything about herself as she celebrates her 65th birthday. On Wednesday, the "One Day at a Time" star posted a video montage of dozens of photos, writing, "Went through it all in the last handful of years and I'm so grateful for the downs as much as I am for all of the ups I am blessed to experience. I love all of you out there supporting me and being a part of our community here.I am one lucky and grateful mofo." Among the images Bertinelli shared was a throwback to a lingerie photo she took in a bathroom last year, one she posted as part of feeling "acceptance" of her life and body. "At some point I will talk about the madness my body has been through this year," she wrote at the time. "But right now every lump bump wrinkle and saggy part of me just feels acceptance and simple appreciation to be standing in front of a mirror in a hotel bathroom in downtown Manhattan ready to color my roots late on a Monday night." A post shared by Valerie Bertinelli (@wolfiesmom) Part of that journey involved abstaining from alcohol and focusing on the future. Valerie Bertinelli admitted on "The Drew Barrymore Show" that she's been told in the past that she's "too much." During a segment celebrating an audience member's makeover, relationship expert Damona Hoffman offered the advice, "If someone thinks you're too much, then they are not enough, and that is not your problem." Bertinelli asked the panel and crowd, "How many people have been told they're too much?" She, Barrymore and others in the studio all raised their hands. The 65-year-old split from her boyfriend, Mike Goodnough, last fall after dating for 10 months. Bertinelli and Mike Goodnough dated for 10 months in 2024 before parting ways. Goodnough recently spoke out on social media, accusing the former Food Network star of taking "backhanded swipes" at him in her Instagram posts when he spoke out about speculation that the two were engaged in a subtle online feud. He responded to the many "messages and replies" he said he had received, which implied that the duo "appear to be communicating with each other via our Instagram posts and stories." "That is not the case," he wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post. "I have never at any time posted something on social media for the purposes of communicating with someone indirectly when I know them personally and have ample ways to reach them directly." He asserted that he still cared for Bertinelli despite their split, writing, "I have love for her and I always will." In a February Instagram post, Bertinelli reflected on what makes relationships work, writing that she had "fumbled the last true good man I met." Bertinelli heaped praise on Goodnough in a since-deleted post that she shared last month. According to People magazine, the Delaware native wrote that she felt "so lucky to have gotten to know him," and she had been "irreversibly changed by him for the better."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump holds a signed an executive order relating to school discipline policies as Education Secretary Linda McMahon listens in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, April 23, 2025, in Washington. CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump administration directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs. A second judge on Thursday postponed the effective date of some U.S. Education Department anti-DEI guidance, ruling in a separate case filed by the American Federation of Teachers in Maryland. In February, the department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. Earlier this month, it ordered states to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.” The directives do not carry the force of law but threaten to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools were warned that continuing such practices “in violation of federal law” could lead to U.S. Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts. U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty in New Hampshire said the April letter does not make clear what the department believes a DEI program entails or when it believes such programs cross the line into violating civil rights law. “The Letter does not even define what a ‘DEI program' is,” McCafferty wrote. “A professor runs afoul of the 2025 Letter if she expresses the view in her teaching that structural racism exists in America, but does not do so if she denies structural racism's existence. An Education Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. States were given until the end of Thursday to submit certification of their schools' compliance, but some have indicated they would not comply with the order. Education officials in some Democratic-led states have said the administration is overstepping its authority and that there is nothing illegal about DEI. She found it was improperly issued and forces teachers to choose between “being injured through suppressing their speech or through facing enforcement for exercising their constitutional rights.” “The court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history and knowledge itself,” Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT, said in a statement. The lawsuits argue that the guidance limits academic freedom and is so vague it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed. President Donald Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon, has warned of potential funding cuts if states do not return the form by Friday. Schools and states are already required to give assurances to that effect in separate paperwork, but the new form adds language on DEI, warning that using diversity programs to discriminate can bring funding cuts, fines and other penalties. The form threatens schools' access to Title I, the largest source of federal revenue for K-12 education and a lifeline for schools in low-income areas.

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. A federal judge in New Hampshire on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from cutting funding to public schools that maintain diversity programs, a setback to its broader crackdown on DEI. U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty said the effort by Trump's Education Department to block federal funding to public schools that continue to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs likely violates the First Amendment, presenting what she described as "textbook viewpoint discrimination." At issue is a memo sent by the Education Department this month to public schools nationwide, threatening to withhold Title I federal funds from public schools that continue to "unfairly" promote DEI views or programs. The effort sparked an immediate wave of concern, and lawsuits, across the country from education groups that cited the importance of Title I funds as a critical source of funding for many low-income public schools. Two other U.S. courts are slated to hear similar challenges to the Education Department's effort, with one case in Washington, D.C., expected to be heard as early as this week. McCafferty's ruling stopped short of issuing a nationwide injunction to block the policy in all 50 states. Rather, it blocks the Trump administration from halting the disbursement of Title I funds to any schools that employ or contract with plaintiffs in the lawsuit. "The right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is ... one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes," McCafferty said in her 82-page opinion, adding that the actions taken by the Education Department "threate[n] to erode these foundational principles." President Donald Trump holds an education-related executive order in the Oval Office as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Education Secretary Linda McMahon watch. That agreement was slated to expire Thursday, prompting the court to rule on the matter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge significantly curtailed the Trump administration from implementing a policy that threatens to withhold federal funding from schools for engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion – or DEI – programs or if they incorporate race in certain ways in many other aspects of student life. US District Judge Landya McCafferty said in a scathing opinion that the administration's policy, laid out by the Department of Education in a letter to educators earlier this year, was “textbook viewpoint discrimination,” likely violating the First Amendment's Free Speech protections. McCafferty declined to issue a nationwide order blocking the policy, but is halting the administration from enforcing it against any school that employs members of the National Education Association and receives federal funding. That agreement was set to expire on Thursday. At least two other courts are considering challenges to the policy, including a DC judge who is hearing arguments in the lawsuit before her on Thursday. During the two-week enforcement pause, the administration was not allowed to bring any enforcement actions or investigations under a so-called “Dear Colleague” letter sent to schools in February that threatened to withhold federal funding from schools if they engaged in diversity, equity and inclusion programs or if race played a role in other aspects of student life. The letter was geared toward all preschool, elementary, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, as well as state educational agencies that receive financial assistance from the federal government. The National Education Association and its New Hampshire chapter sued over the policy, alleging the letter as both impermissible vague and encroaching “on teaching and academic freedom.” Trump has waged war on DEI efforts since the start of his second term and has taken action against several elite universities, demanding changes to their DEI programs. The administration has already rolled back DEI programs, arrested international students and revoked their visas, and frozen federal funding for schools that refused to submit to its demands. The administration froze over $2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts at Harvard University after its leaders refused to make key policy changes, including eliminating DEI programs, resulting in a clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight as Harvard sued the federal government. Policy changes were also demanded of Columbia University, though the school later announced several changes to address the Trump administration's demands, an apparent concession to the federal government.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Young people are watching environmental disasters, school shootings, and economic and political uncertainty, all with a level of media (or at least social media) coverage that would have been unimaginable for previous generations. Against this backdrop, they're also expected to have their lives figured out by an early age, and rack up a laundry list of achievements to cite in an increasingly lengthy and comparison-filled college application process. “You almost have to start working on your college career in middle school,” Jennifer Rothman, director of youth and young adult initiatives at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told me. Given all this, it's perhaps no surprise that kids need a break. Mental health days — a day off to deal with depression or anxiety, or simply to tend to mental well-being, gained currency among adults during the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic — and they've taken off among young people as well, with at least 12 states passing laws allowing excused absences for mental health reasons. But as chronic absenteeism remains a problem around the country, some school officials are worried that giving kids mental health days could encourage an attitude that school attendance is optional. While concerns about mental health are far from gone, they're also being joined by fears of learning loss and the acknowledgement that missing even a few days of school can be detrimental to kids' education. Some experts also caution that taking a day off for the wrong reasons could actually make matters worse. “When you get yourself in the trap or downward slide of school avoidance, that's really hard, and it happens really quick,” Sarah Cain Spannagel, a clinical psychologist in Cleveland who works with children and families, told me. How do we support kids through a time that's often scary even for adults, while also making sure they get an education? I posed these questions to experts this week, and the answers I got suggested that while a day off won't cure a kid's depression or anxiety (sadly, that doesn't work for grown-ups, either), time for reset and recovery can help protect kids from getting to a crisis point in the first place. Doctors and teens alike have been especially concerned with young people's mental health in the last five years, with Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general under President Joe Biden, warning in 2021 of a mental health crisis among adolescents. More recent surveys have shown some improvement in the prevalence of teen sadness and depression, but clinicians are still seeing “alarming rates” of anxiety and depression, as well as suicidality and self-harm, Amber Childs, a psychiatry professor at Yale School of Medicine who works on youth mental health, told me. Allowing mental health days can also help destigmatize mental illness, and encourage young people to be open about any struggles they're going through, rather than hiding them, kids and experts say. Among teens, mental health days have emerged as a popular coping strategy. Students began advocating for them even before Covid hit, and lawmakers in states from Oregon to Utah have agreed, giving kids a designated number of mental health days per year, or simply changing the definition of an excused absence to include psychological reasons. While hard numbers on how many days kids are actually taking are hard to come by, the practice seems to be increasing, perhaps driven by a growing awareness that psychological well-being is as important as physical health, Spannagel said. The concept of a mental health day might sound pretty foreign to previous generations. Growing up, “I never got any days off,” Rothman of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who has three teenagers, told me. Being able to unplug “not only from our digitally enabled lives, but also from the routine things that happen in the social and academic space” can be positive, “whether or not something bad is happening.” Allowing mental health days can also help destigmatize mental illness, and encourage young people to be open about any struggles they're going through, rather than hiding them, kids and experts say. Rather than using them when a child is already in crisis — “taking the release valve off of the pressure cooker,” as Childs put it — families and schools should use them as “a preventative tool” to keep that pressure from building up in the first place. Instead, Rothman suggests getting outside, reading, drawing, or playing card games — “whatever is calming and helps them feel more like themselves.” For teenagers especially, a day off could be a time to just catch up on sleep, something they're often lacking due to early high school start times. What kids feel the need to do on a mental health day can also give adults “clues about what might be crowded out during a typical school day or week,” and help build those activities back in on ordinary days so kids don't get as stressed out and depleted, Childs said. Childs suggests that parents look for patterns — if kids keep asking for a mental health day on a Monday, it's an opportunity to delve deeper into what's happening at school on Mondays that might be stressing them out. A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North. If requests for a day off are very frequent, or if feelings around them are intense, it could be a sign that “you're getting avoidance of a problem that most likely is going to be there in two days” when the kid goes back to school, Spannagel said. Kids with ADHD, autism, or learning differences might need the reset of a mental health day more than the average kid, to help them recover from sensory overload or fatigue, Spannagel said. When it comes to concerns about absenteeism and academics, families and teachers can have a conversation about making up any work a child misses on an occasional day out, Spannagel said. Experts don't recommend leaving kids home alone if they're struggling mentally, and many parents don't have the job flexibility to take extra time off with their kids. But schools can help by building aspects of a mental health day into the school week, adding time to shift the focus “away from academics and performance into exploration of self,” Childs said. Having resources in the classroom, like a quiet corner where kids can take a moment to themselves, can also help support kids' mental health day-to-day, Rothman said. (My older kid's teacher brought this calming dog stuffie to their classroom in the fall, and I honestly would like one for myself.) Talking about mental health in school is also crucial, whether that's part of a formal program or just a teacher “being open about the things that they're feeling,” Rothman said. Seventy-four percent of teens say social media helps them feel more connected to their friends, but 48 percent also say the platforms harm people their age, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The Trump administration is reportedly seeking to eliminate Head Start, the federal program that provides early education to more than half a million kids from low-income families. One graduate calls the program “one of the few times in my early life where I felt truly loved, seen and supported in a place of learning.” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s remarks about children with autism who “will never pay taxes” recall the dark history of eugenics, writes Jessica Grose at the New York Times. Two weeks ago, I wrote about how tariffs could drive up the cost of items like strollers and car seats, making it harder to have a kid in America. “Raising children has always required commitment, support, and resilience — not consumerism,” Braley wrote. But the truth is, our instincts and community matter more than any fancy product.” Thanks to Braley, and a reminder that you can always reach me at anna.north@vox.com! Many of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Her organization has operated a hotline for 10 years through a DOJ grant, and connects victims of heinous crimes to specialists that help them navigate everything from legal assistance to state bureaucracies. “I genuinely believed that this administration had victims in the forefront of their mind,” Williams told CNN. “But to get that email to see that they were cutting out victims, and that this hotline – which we know is a lifesaving resource to so many people – was no longer a priority was just stunning.” It is not unusual for new administrations to review applications for federal grants, or award grants based on their political preferences. “People who have been hurt by crime are just going to be hurt again when they try to get help,” Kristina Rose, the former director of the Biden Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime, which oversees billions of dollars in grant funding. “Everyone eventually will feel the impact of this.” “This Department of Justice is focused on prosecuting criminals, getting illegal drugs off of the streets, and protecting American institutions from toxic DEI and sanctuary city policies,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in response to CNN's questions about the cuts. Among programs whose grants were cancelled are organizations who work to protect and help individuals who were the victims of a crime. Those groups – many of which have received bipartisan support in the past – say that without their funding, the victims they support could be left without legal help, safe housing, medical and trauma support, or even funeral expenses to bury a loved one who had been murdered. Copies of several grant termination letters shared with CNN say the DOJ has “changed its priorities,” and want these federal grants to be “more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and better coordinating law enforcement efforts at all levels of government.” One program at risk of immediate shutdown is a group who sends advocates to the bedside of someone in the hospital who has been injured from gunshot or other type of assault. Another DOJ grant that funded trauma recovery centers in Iowa was also cancelled, as were grants that put kennels in domestic violence shelters so that victims could bring their pets with them when they fled. When news of the cuts first surfaced Tuesday, dozens of grantees gathered on a videoconference to discuss their options, including whether to take legal action. Many of the organizations found that they had already been cut off from the financial systems from which they could access their grant money, one official said. Others tried to contact their grant managers at the Justice Department. “I want to believe, and I want to hope it's a mistake, and that mistake will be rectified,” said Williams. The terminated grants also touch local government groups whose efforts are focused on research, statistics and efforts to reform things like policing and the juvenile justice system. “Instead of helping to keep our residents safe, the Trump Administration is once again cruelly clawing back critical public safety funding for our state,” wrote Democratic New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin in a statement. In Kansas City, Missouri, officials in city hall learned Wednesday a grant that funded counseling and treatment programs through their mental health court had been terminated. “It takes away a tool that we have to give people treatment and then break the cycle of recidivism that we see on nuisance offenses,” Democratic Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN. Lucas argued that judges cannot jail people with mental health issues for an extended amount of time for nuisance crimes, and that without treatment, those offenders will be back on the street without help and resources.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) on Thursday, July 22 reported second-quarter net income of $19 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier. Major U.S. airlines are reducing their flight schedules and revising or withdrawing their profit outlooks for the year due to less domestic travel demand as sentiment about the national and global economies sours. American Airlines pulled its financial guidance for 2025 on Thursday, joining rivals Southwest and Delta in declaring the economic outlook too uncertain to provide full-year forecasts. All three airlines cited weakening sales among economy class leisure travelers. “We came off a strong fourth quarter, saw decent business in January, and really domestic leisure travel fell off considerably as we went into the February time frame,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC. Consumer reluctance to book vacations would correspond with a new poll that showed many people fear the U.S. is being steered into a recession and that President Donald Trump's broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said in a client note that anti-American sentiment could be spurring a travel dropoff, with data showing that international visitors to the U.S. are running about 5% lower than a year ago. “In recent weeks there have been numerous news stories about tourists canceling trips to the U.S. in protest of the perceived heavy-handedness of recent trade policies,” he wrote. Some economic indicators point to expectations of a slowdown. However, fears of a downturn have not translated into layoffs. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2 that triggered panic in financial markets and generated recession fears, leading consumers and businesses to start pulling back on spending, which includes travel. Beijing increased its import tax on American goods to 125% in retaliation. On Thursday China denied Trump's assertion that the two sides were involved in active negotiations to end or mitigate their trade war. American Airlines said it would give an update on its full-year guidance “as the economic outlook becomes clearer.” Airline executives said sales among business travelers and for premium seats on long-haul international flights remained solid. Southwest Airlines reported late Wednesday that it would trim its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. United Airlines last week gave two different financial forecasts for how it may perform this year, one if there's a recession and one if not. The airline said it planned to reduce its scheduled domestic flights by 4% starting in July in response to lower-than-expected demand for economy fare tickets. “We think there is a reasonable chance things can weaken from here,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. Earlier this month, the airline scratched its performance expectations for 2025 and said it was putting a planned flight schedule expansion on hold. “With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said at the time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ashley Dayer's dream of winning a National Science Foundation grant to pursue discoveries in bird conservation started when she was an early-career professor with an infant in her arms and a shoestring laboratory budget. It took three failed applications and years of preliminary research before the agency awarded her one. Then came a Monday email informing Dayer that President Donald Trump's administration was cutting off funding, apparently because the project investigating the role of bird feeders touched on themes of diversity, equity and inclusion. Hundreds of other university researchers had their National Science Foundation funding abruptly canceled Friday to comply with Trump's directives to end support of research on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the study of misinformation. It's the latest front in Trump's anti-DEI campaign that has also gone after university administrations, medical research and the private sector. More than 380 grant projects have been cut so far, including work to combat internet censorship in China and Iran and a project consulting with Indigenous communities to understand environmental changes in Alaska's Arctic region. One computer scientist was studying how artificial intelligence tools could mitigate bias in medical information, and others were trying to help people detect AI-generated deepfakes. NSF, founded in 1950, has a $9 billion budget that can be a lifeline for resource-strapped professors and the younger researchers they recruit to their teams. Some scientists saw the cuts coming, after Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz last year flagged thousands of NSF-funded projects he says reflected a “woke DEI” or Marxist agenda, including some but not all of the projects cut Friday. A collaboration with other institutions, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, it tapped into Project Feederwatch, a website and app for sharing bird observations. Dayer's team had collected data from more 20,000 Americans on their birdwatching habits, fielding insights on how outdoor feeders were affecting wildlife, but also people's mental well-being. “We thought, if anything, maybe we'd be told not to do that broader impacts work and to remove that from our project,” Dayer said. “We had no expectation that the entire grant would be unfunded.” The NSF declined to share the total number of canceled grants, but Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, run by billionaire Elon Musk, posted on X that NSF had canceled “402 wasteful DEI grants” amounting to $233 million. It didn't say how much of that had already been spent. Caren Cooper, a North Carolina State University professor of forestry and natural resources, said she expected her work would be targeted after it made Cruz's list. Her grant project also sought to include people of color and people with disabilities in participatory science projects, in collaboration with the Audubon Society and with the aim of engaging those who have historically been excluded from natural spaces and birdwatching groups. “We've been trying to make contingency plans,” Cooper said. Along with eliminating DEI research, NSF said it will no longer “support research with the goal of combating ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' and ‘malinformation' that could be used to infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advances a preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.” Several researchers said they weren't sure why their funding was terminated, other than that their abstracts included terms like “censorship” or “misinformation.” “The lack of transparency around this process is deeply concerning,” said Eric Wustrow, an engineering professor at the University of Colorado Boulder whose grant aims to study and combat internet censorship in countries like China and Iran. NSF said on its website that “there is not a list of words” to avoid, but that misinformation research is no longer aligned with NSF's priorities. Meanwhile, he's looking at potentially working for free this summer without a grant to fund his salary. Cornell University's Drew Margolin said his work set out to help people find ways to combat social media harassment, hate speech and misinformation without the help of content moderators or government regulators. The NSF declined to say if more cuts are coming. A group of scientists and health groups sued the NIH earlier this month, arguing that those cuts were illegal and threatened medical cures. The cuts at NSF so far are a tiny portion of all of the agency's grants, amounting to 387 projects, said Scott Delaney, a research scientist at Harvard University's school of public health who is helping to track the cuts to help researchers advocate for themselves. Some received termination letters even though their projects had already ended. “And it's really unclear if this is everything that's going to get terminated or if it's just the opening salvo.” Dayer is still figuring out what to do about the loss of funding for the bird feeder project, which cuts off part of summer funding for four professors at three universities and their respective student teams. She's particularly worried about what it means for the next generation of American scientists, including those still deciding their career path. “It's just this outright attack on science right now,” Dayer said. I'm also just afraid that people aren't going to go into the field of science.” Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump holds a signed an executive order relating to school discipline policies as Education Secretary Linda McMahon listens in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, April 23, 2025, in Washington. CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump administration directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In February, the U.S. Education Department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. Earlier this month, the department ordered states to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.” The directives do not carry the force of law but threaten to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools were warned that continuing such practices “in violation of federal law” could lead to U.S. Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts. “The Letter does not even define what a ‘DEI program' is,” McCafferty wrote. The judge also said there is reason to believe the department's actions amount to a violation of teachers' free speech rights. “A professor runs afoul of the 2025 Letter if she expresses the view in her teaching that structural racism exists in America, but does not do so if she denies structural racism's existence. States were given until the end of Thursday to submit certification of their schools' compliance, but some have indicated they would not comply with the order. Education officials in some Democratic-led states have said the administration is overstepping its authority and that there is nothing illegal about DEI. The lawsuit filed in March argues the Feb. 14 memo, formally known as a “Dear Colleague” letter, would limit academic freedom by dictating what students can be taught. It dramatically expands the interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the use of race in college admissions to all aspects of education, including, hiring, promotion, scholarships, housing, graduation ceremonies and campus life. Both lawsuits argue that the guidance is so vague that it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed. President Donald Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon, warned of potential funding cuts if states did not return the form by Friday. In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there's no discrimination that's happening in any of the schools,” she said. Schools and states are already required to give assurances to that effect in separate paperwork, but the new form adds language on DEI, warning that using diversity programs to discriminate can bring funding cuts, fines and other penalties. The form threatens schools' access to Title I, the largest source of federal revenue for K-12 education and a lifeline for schools in low-income areas.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. GOP Sen. John Kennedy said Sunday during an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker that the Trump administration deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is in an El Salvadoran megaprison, was a "screw up." U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, on Wednesday ruled that the Trump administration violated a settlement agreement DHS reached last year with a group of young asylum seekers when it deported a 20-year-old man, referred to in court filings as "Cristian," to El Salvador last month. He was part of a group of migrants who had entered the U.S. illegally as unaccompanied children and who later filed asylum claims to remain in the U.S. DHS agreed in the settlement that it would refrain from deporting any of the individuals in the class until their asylum claims could be fully adjudicated by a U.S. court. Trump holds a photo of Abrego Garcia's hand tattoos at the White House. Gallagher stressed in her ruling that, unlike other court challenges to Trump's deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, this one centers on a "breach of contract" by the government. Her ruling also alluded to the deportation of Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member living in Maryland who was deported to El Salvador last month. The Trump administration, meanwhile, told the court it had determined that Cristian was eligible for removal under the Alien Enemies Act because he had been arrested and convicted for cocaine possession earlier this year. They told the court that his designation as an "alien enemy pursuant to the AEA results in him ceasing to be a member" of the class that had negotiated a settlement. Inmates at the Counter-Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT) mega-prison, in Tecoluca, El Salvador on Jan. 27, 2025. That agreement did not appear to hold water with Gallagher, who ordered the government not to remove any other members of the class until their asylum claims are properly adjudicated. She also granted a temporary restraining order to another member of the class, an 18-year-old referred to as Javier, whom counsel for the group said was in "imminent danger" of being deported earlier this month, as ABC reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was confronted by some pro-Palestinian demonstrators Wednesday night in New Haven, Connecticut, according to a statement and videos shared by Ben Gvir's office. In one video, an item that was apparently thrown is heard hitting the ground. People standing next to Ben Gvir shout “whoa” as they realize items are being thrown. Ben Gvir was not injured and is in “good health,” his office said. CNN has reached out to New Haven police for comment and details about detainments or arrests. Related article 50,000 killed in Gaza since start of Israel-Hamas war, health ministry says Renewed protests have spread at college campuses this spring over Israel's handling of its war in Gaza. But international groups have said Israel's attacks in Gaza have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians – mostly women and children – and caused an ongoing humanitarian crisis. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also gathered at Yale University on Tuesday night to protest Ben Gvir's visit. A Yale spokesperson told CNN an “unregistered group” of 200 people not “affiliated with any recognized student organization” gathered Tuesday and set up eight tents in Beinecke Plaza, a central square on Yale's campus. Protesters were given cards with QR codes that linked to Yale University's policies for peaceable assembly, such as keeping everyone physically safe, not blocking entrances and exits and not disrupting the university's operations. Related article US colleges are making substantial progress on campus antisemitism, but work remains, ADL says Some students who were warned by campus officials in previous incidents that violated school policy were given written notices and “are subject to immediate disciplinary action,” the spokesperson said. But the university didn't say how many received such notices. Yale has since revoked the group's status as a registered student organization, as officials say they are also investigating concerns about “disturbing antisemitic conduct at (Tuesday's) gathering,” the university said Wednesday. Ben Gvir – a far-right firebrand – has been public about his adoration for US President Donald Trump, proudly extolling his plan to resettle Gazans outside of the Palestinian territory.

The new protest on the New Haven campus comes exactly a year after 45 protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing when they refused orders to leave Beinecke Plaza, part of a wave of demonstrations across US campuses last spring. Related article A pro-Israel group says it gave US list of protesters to deport, drawing alarm from students' supporters As part of their support for Palestinians in Gaza, protesters at the Yale campus demanded the university get rid of investments in businesses with connections to Israel's military effort there. In recent weeks, another Ivy League university, Harvard, has been at the forefront of the Trump administration's effort to stop campus protests, contending they are examples of antisemitism. The Trump administration is demanding Harvard give it access to all university reports on antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias on campus generated since October 2023, as it ramps up a confrontation with the school that risks billions in federal money amid a broader push to bring elite US colleges in line with its political demands.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A conversation with Sen. Chris Van Hollen about Kilmar Abrego Garcia's detention — and where America goes from here. Since being deported to El Salvador last month, Kilmar Abrego Garcia has had very little contact with the outside world — something that Democratic Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen tried to change. Last week, Van Hollen flew to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who the Trump administration has admitted was deported from Maryland in error. But the White House has since doubled down on claims that he is a member of the MS-13 gang, with Stephen Miller, a top Trump domestic policy adviser, saying, “This was the right person sent to the right place.”Van Hollen was initially denied access to Abrego Garcia. But officials in El Salvador eventually relented, and arranged a meeting at the senator's hotel. Abrego Garcia told Van Hollen about his experience at El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT), a massive prison, and his traumatic isolation from the outside world. “This goes to the heart of protecting people's rights and what bullies do and what authoritarian leaders do,” Van Hollen told Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram. “And what Donald Trump is doing is beginning by picking on the most vulnerable and refusing to bring his case in the courts, and when the courts rule, ignoring them.” Van Hollen talked to Today, Explained about what he heard from Abrego Garcia, and why he believes this case has pushed the United States into a constitutional crisis. Below is a transcript of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. I wanted to let him know, number one, that I was bringing greetings from his family who haven't heard from him since he disappeared. In fact, until this moment, I'm the only one who's communicated with him before or since. So I wanted to, number one, see if he was alive. But I also wanted him to know that his case was something that was meaningful to every American who cares about the Constitution. And I wanted to ask the government of El Salvador to stop being complicit with the Trump administration in this illegal scheme. So it was to defend the rights of this person because if we don't defend the right of this individual, we do threaten rights for everybody who lives here. The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has allied himself with President Donald Trump, has called Abrego Garcia a terrorist, and said he would never return him. How hard did that make it for you to actually sit down with him? When I met with the vice president of El Salvador, I asked him if they had any evidence that he had committed any criminal acts. We've got him in our jail” — and he was originally at CECOT, which is one of the most notorious prisons in Latin America — “we've got him there because the United States is paying us to do it.” That was his answer. And I said, “Do you really want to be part of this illegal scheme with Donald Trump in violation of constitutional rights in the United States?” His answer was, “We got to deal with them, they're paying us and if the Trump administration tells us, we'll let them go. And so we're gonna keep them locked up.” And so how did you end up getting to meet him? “Well, maybe I could get him on the phone?” No. So the next day, I decided not to give up. I drove towards CECOT prison, about three kilometers out, and I was waved to the side of the road by soldiers. So then we had some events in El Salvador with local press. And I think that even Bukele recognized that it was a bad look for El Salvador to not allow anybody to meet or talk with this guy, to even know whether he was alive. As I was sort of getting ready to go to the airport on the way home, we got a call and I ended up meeting with him. First and foremost, he told me he missed his family and I told him how much his family missed him. And he said that thinking of them is what gave him strength every day. And then of course he landed in this really awful CECOT prison. I informed him — because he'd been in a total news blackout — his case was now representative of the fight for constitutional rights and due process for everybody who lives in America, and that a lot of people were working to get him out of prison in accordance with the Supreme Court order to facilitate his return. He said, if I recall right, there were about 25 prisoners in his cell. He said he was scared and traumatized by other prisoners in other cells, and these cells are packed. I mean, they sometimes have more than 100 prisoners, and he says that they would call out to him and taunt him and that did make him feel very much at risk. This is when I met with them, which were sort of better conditions, but still, and I wanna stress this, still no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world and to learn anything about what's happening. So that's where he is sitting as we speak. At first they wanted to stage the meeting by the pool, to create this impression, to deceive people, thinking that he was in some tropical paradise when he'd been in one of the worst prisons in El Salvador. During our conversation, the government folks from Bukele instructed the waiters to set two taller-looking glasses on our table, making it look like margaritas. I have no idea what's in them because neither of us touched them, but they had a little cherry on top and they had either salt or sugar on the rim. I think it shows the lengths that Bukele and Trump will go to deceive the American people about what's happening, right? Here's a guy, illegally abducted, ends up in the worst prison — and they want to create this impression that, “Hey, he's just in paradise.” Republicans are leaning into this message that Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang. You know, my point on all of this, Sean, is that they should bring those facts before the court and Trump should not just be spending all his time on social media. And I wanna quote the federal judge in this case: She said that the Trump administration had presented, quote, “no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or to any terrorist activity.” Period. You're not only saying we have to focus on constitutional rights. You're saying this situation with Abrego Garcia is a constitutional crisis. How do we reconcile those two assessments of this very serious situation? This is a fundamental constitutional issue, and it is a crisis because the Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration has to help facilitate his return to the United States. I also do just want to briefly quote what the Fourth Circuit said. This is a three-judge panel, and the chief judge who wrote it is a guy called Judge Wilkinson — he was appointed by Reagan. But in this case, it's not hard at all. The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.” And what Donald Trump is doing is beginning by picking on the most vulnerable and refusing to bring his case in the courts, and when the courts rule, ignoring them. So this is a very important moment to protect everyone's constitutional rights. As Trump wages war against Harvard, something unprecedented is happening on Florida's college campuses. Ted Kaczynski's apocalyptic vision still has a following, 30 years later. The online personality has millions of young fans. Now prominent Democrats are seeking out his advice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) on Thursday, July 22 reported second-quarter net income of $19 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier. Major U.S. airlines are reducing their flight schedules and revising or withdrawing their profit outlooks for the year due to less domestic travel demand as sentiment about the national and global economies sours. American Airlines pulled its financial guidance for 2025 on Thursday, joining rivals Southwest and Delta in declaring the economic outlook too uncertain to provide full-year forecasts. All three airlines cited weakening sales among economy class leisure travelers. “We came off a strong fourth quarter, saw decent business in January, and really domestic leisure travel fell off considerably as we went into the February time frame,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC. Consumer reluctance to book vacations would correspond with a new poll that showed many people fear the U.S. is being steered into a recession and that President Donald Trump's broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said in a client note that anti-American sentiment could be spurring a travel dropoff, with data showing that international visitors to the U.S. are running about 5% lower than a year ago. “In recent weeks there have been numerous news stories about tourists canceling trips to the U.S. in protest of the perceived heavy-handedness of recent trade policies,” he wrote. Some economic indicators point to expectations of a slowdown. However, fears of a downturn have not translated into layoffs. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2 that triggered panic in financial markets and generated recession fears, leading consumers and businesses to start pulling back on spending, which includes travel. Beijing increased its import tax on American goods to 125% in retaliation. On Thursday China denied Trump's assertion that the two sides were involved in active negotiations to end or mitigate their trade war. American Airlines said it would give an update on its full-year guidance “as the economic outlook becomes clearer.” Airline executives said sales among business travelers and for premium seats on long-haul international flights remained solid. Southwest Airlines reported late Wednesday that it would trim its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. United Airlines last week gave two different financial forecasts for how it may perform this year, one if there's a recession and one if not. The airline said it planned to reduce its scheduled domestic flights by 4% starting in July in response to lower-than-expected demand for economy fare tickets. “We think there is a reasonable chance things can weaken from here,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. Earlier this month, the airline scratched its performance expectations for 2025 and said it was putting a planned flight schedule expansion on hold. “With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said at the time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, after news broke that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was using Signal to discuss sensitive military operations in violation of Pentagon policy, one of his closest military aides made an unusual inquiry to the Defense Department's chief information officer: Would they grant an exception so Hegseth could keep using Signal freely? The question came from Col. Ricky Buria, a former aide to previous Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who has rapidly established himself as a key member of Hegseth's inner circle, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN. The Signal inquiry raised eyebrows among other senior Pentagon officials, who wondered whether the request was appropriate — especially from a uniformed officer, rather than Hegseth's civilian chief of staff. Weeks earlier, before The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had been using the app to discuss detailed military plans, Buria had pushed to get Hegseth an extra desktop computer in his office that he could use Signal on, ostensibly for personal communications so he could more easily text friends and family from the Pentagon, the sources said. The Secretary's office is considered a secure space, where cell phones are not typically permitted. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency recommends that highly targeted individuals use Signal, but DoD policy says Signal is “NOT authorized to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information.” It notes that requests for exceptions to that policy can be submitted to the chief information officer. It is not clear whether Hegseth was ever given an exception to use Signal freely, or if he has continued to use it for sensitive military planning in the fallout of the Signalgate episode. However, we can confirm that the Secretary has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer.” Buria, a career Marine with multiple combat deployments who served as both Austin and Hegseth's junior military assistant, has for months been straddling the line between military aide and civilian adviser, the sources said. Buria did not respond to repeated requests for comment about his increasingly influential position in Hegseth's inner circle, including his role in helping to facilitate Hegseth's use of Signal inside the Pentagon. Hegseth is even considering appointing Buria as his new chief of staff, now that his former chief of staff Joe Kasper is moving into a new role at the department, the sources added. Buria's transition from military assistant to senior adviser was extremely unusual, particularly since he worked so closely with Austin, according to officials that served in the Biden and second Trump administration. And Hegseth moved quickly to root out other “holdover” military officials upon taking office, including former Joint Chiefs Chairman CQ Brown; former Air Force vice chairman Gen. Jim Slife; former Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti; and Jen Short, a three-star general who was appointed senior military assistant under Austin. Underscoring the trust Hegseth placed in him, Buria, not even a general officer, filled the crucial senior military assistant role on an acting basis, current and former officials said. The sources all said that Buria's rise appears to largely be a function of how much Hegseth has narrowed his inner circle, as he has become increasingly paranoid about leaks and concerned about being undermined. Hegseth also likes Buria's “yes, sir” attitude, said one defense official who has observed their interactions. Under Secretary Austin, Buria was “cool, calm, collected, never got ruffled, and had a good attitude,” a former senior Pentagon official in the Biden administration told CNN, adding that he was “very good and capable.” But he was also essentially a “body man” for Austin — carrying his bags and appearing only in the background of official photos, if at all. Buria has routine access to Hegseth's personal and government phones, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN, and is often seen working out with the secretary in photos posted on X. He has even started sitting at the table with foreign leaders, most recently during official meetings in Panama and with El Salvador's defense minister at the Pentagon. “He would never sit in on bilats or meetings or anything like that, like he is now,” the former official said, referring to official bilateral meetings between the secretary and his counterparts. Current and former officials have also raised questions about whether Buria is experienced enough to serve as Hegseth's chief of staff — and whether the White House would accept that, given Buria's history working under Austin and Trump's push to root out Biden-era “holdovers” from his administration. It could be a tough adjustment, the first former senior official said. “You need someone with a political background who understands the political context, someone who can call up a four-star and yell at them for not being on message or not doing things the right way,” this person added. A third former senior DOD official who served under Austin agreed, saying the chief of staff has to be comfortable holding their own against career political operators who are working at senior levels of other government agencies. While he seemed ambitious, this person added, there was “no indication he would be interested in leaving the military service and becoming a Trump political appointee.” As he has risen in Hegseth's inner circle, Buria has gotten bolder in advising Hegseth on political and policy matters, the current defense official and a former official said. And he has sometimes ruffled feathers in the way he's spoken to more senior military officers, including at least two combatant commanders, the sources added. In a sign of his increasingly political role, Buria joined X in January, and three days ago began regularly reposting Trump, Hegseth, and Vance, as well as posts from DoD's rapid response account criticizing the media coverage of Hegseth — including one calling NPR a “fake news propaganda machine.”</p>

'Kids First' director Billy Moges discusses the ongoing Supreme Court battle over parents' rights to remove their children from LGBTQ+ curriculum. A huge majority of states have implemented some form of school choice in recent years, but only a little more than a dozen have adopted programs that make private school choice universally available to K-12 students. A map of US states that offer universal private school choice programs. Alabama passed its CHOOSE Act in 2024, which establishes an education savings account (ESA) that will soon be open to all families in the state. Arizona became the first state to offer universal school choice for all families in 2022, launching an $800 million program that gives parents $7,000 to put toward their children's tuition. 294 established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status. The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials. Bill Lee told Fox News Digital a universal school choice proposal is not intended to neglect the need to support public schools in the state. 1, passed in 2023, established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status. The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials. Idaho launched its first private school choice program through a refundable tax credit. Families can receive up to $5,000 per child for private educational expenses, with $7,500 available for students with disabilities. The program is capped at $50 million annually and prioritizes families earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level (about $96,450 for a family of four). Iowa's H.F. 68, passed in 2023, established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status. The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials. The Indiana Choice Scholarship Program grants a voucher to qualifying K-12 students that they can put toward private school tuition. In order to qualify, students must be residents of Indiana and a member of a household that makes an "annual income of not more than 400% of the amount to qualify for the federal free and reduced price lunch program." Montana has two major school choice programs, but only one of them is universally available. The more restricted program is a standard ESA, but students must have special needs or have some other form of disability in order to qualify. The more expansive program is a statewide tax credit scholarship program that "allows individuals and corporations to claim a 100% tax credit for contributions to approved Student Scholarship Organizations," according to EdChoice. The average scholarship value for participating students is $2,190. North Carolina has a major voucher program that is available to all students across the state, but is limited by a budget cap. Qualifying students will get an average voucher value of $5,701 to put toward private school tuition costs, transportation, equipment or other costs associated with attending school. Students must meet one of a series of qualifications in order to receive the award, and parents must submit their income information. Like Montana, Oklahoma employs a tax credit system to allow for school choice in the state. Greg Abbott speaks to students, parents and staff at Nolan Catholic High School about his school choice plan on April 19, 2023. Tennessee passed the Education Freedom Act of 2025, creating a universal ESA program. Families receive $7,000 per student, which must first be used for tuition but can also cover other educational expenses. If at least 75% of scholarships are awarded, the cap will rise to 25,000 students in 2026. 215, passed in 2023, established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status. The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials. West Virginia employs an ESA program to allow universal school choice for private schools, and it also has "intra-district and inter-district public school choice via open enrollment," according to EdChoice. The ESA program grants an average of $4,299 toward private school tuition costs. Wyoming passed HB 199 in 2025, expanding its ESA program by removing income restrictions and making it fully universal starting in 2025-26. Renamed the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship, the program will provide families with $7,000 and be funded through a $30 million appropriation. Participating students must be assessed on academic progress. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? President Donald Trump has been sending undocumented immigrants to a mega prison in El Salvador without due process. Most of these deportees have no criminal record, yet our government has condemned them to indefinite incarceration in an infamously inhumane penitentiary. In 2019, a court had ruled that Abrego Garcia could not be sent to El Salvador, as he had a credible fear of being persecuted in that country. The White House attributed his deportation to an “administrative error.” Some Democrats believe that their party must call attention to this lawless cruelty. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and four progressive House members have traveled to El Salvador in recent days to check on Abrego Garcia's condition and advocate for his due process rights. But other Democrats fear their party is walking into a political trap. Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. In this case, you get a situation where you're giving the White House and the Republicans a lot of images and visuals that they think are compelling for them.” Democrats have a moral responsibility to defend both America's constitutional order and its most vulnerable residents. It does not follow, however, that they have a moral duty to hold press events about Abrego Garcia's case — even if such photo ops do nothing to abet his liberation, while doing much to boost Trump's political standing. In my view, the argument that Democrats are doing more harm than good by taking a high-profile stand in favor of due process is not immoral, but simply mistaken. Van Hollen's trip has plausibly benefited US residents unlawfully detained in El Salvador. And the political costs of such dissent are likely negligible, so long as Democrats keep their messaging about immigration disciplined and eventually shift their rhetorical focus to Trump's economic mismanagement. So far as I can tell, no Democrat is arguing that the party should acquiesce to Trump's lawless deportations. The concerned strategist who spoke with CNN stipulated that “Democrats should stand up for due process when asked about it.” Therefore, anything Democrats do to increase the salience of immigration plausibly aids Trump. What's more, elevating Abrego Garcia's cause above other issues could give voters the impression that Democrats are not prioritizing their own economic concerns. Or at least, this is what Republican strategists seem to believe. Following House progressives' trip to El Salvador, National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement, “House Democrats have proven they care more about illegal immigrant gang bangers than American families.” The NRCC proceeded to air digital ads against 25 swing-district Democrats, in which it offered to buy the representatives' airfare to El Salvador if they promised to “livestream the whole thing and snap plenty of selfies with their MS-13 buddies.” In this view, Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador did not actually help Abrego Garcia, whose fate still lies with America's court system and the White House. If Democrats teach him that they will do precisely that — so long as he violates immigrants' due process rights — then they will have made such violations more likely in the future, not less. Meanwhile, this faction of wary strategists insist that their party has a genuine image problem. And as their economic impacts surface, the president's trade policies are liable to become more salient, no matter what Democrats say or do. Yet in a Quinnipiac poll taken after Trump single-handedly engineered an economic crisis with his “Liberation Day” tariffs, the two parties are tied on that question. Democrats have time to improve their image; the midterms are well over a year away. So some might wonder why the party should fret about increasing the salience of an unfavorable issue so far from Election Day. But there's an argument that the party should be doing everything in its power to increase its popularity — and reduce Trump's — right now. Thus, from this vantage, message discipline is a moral imperative. Centering Democratic messaging on Abrego Garcia's case might help ambitious Democrats earn small-dollar donations and adoration among the party's base. On the substance, Democratic officials flying to El Salvador to check on Abrego Garcia's condition could plausibly deter abuses against him and other immigrant detainees in that country. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele may be a reactionary aligned with Trump, but he is surely aware that the United States has a two-party system. His government therefore must give some thought to its relationship with a hypothetical future Democratic administration. Thus, by advocating so forcefully for US residents unlawfully imprisoned in El Salvador, the Democratic Party has given Bukele some incentive to, at a minimum, keep Abrego Garcia and others like him alive (something that his government routinely fails to do with its prisoners). In an interview with Vox's Today, Explained podcast, Van Hollen said that Salvadoran authorities have not allowed Abrego Garcia to communicate with his family or his lawyers. Only through Van Hollen's intervention was Abrego Garcia's wife able to send her greetings to him, or even confirm that her husband was still alive. If an elected official has the power to serve a constituent in this way, it seems worthwhile that they do so. The prospect that Van Hollen might have effectively encouraged more unlawful deportations by taking this course of action — since Trump wants his opponents to do photo ops on behalf of undocumented immigrants — merits consideration. One could just as easily posit that Democrats ducking this issue entirely would have emboldened Trump to ramp up unlawful deportations. It seems possible — perhaps, even likely — that Democrats loudly advocating for Abrego Garcia is politically suboptimal, relative to a monomaniacal focus on the economy. But so long as Democrats act strategically on other fronts, I think the political costs of taking a stand on due process are likely to be negligibly small, for at least five reasons: First, as far as progressive immigration positions go, “The Trump administration should honor court orders and the due process rights of longtime US residents” is pretty safe territory. And an Economist-YouGov poll released Wednesday found voters specifically agreeing that Trump should bring Abrego Garcia back by a 50 to 28 point margin. If Democrats frame Abrego Garcia's case as a question of Americans' civil liberties — while reiterating their party's commitment to enforcing immigration law and securing the border — they should be able to mitigate any political cost inherent to elevating this issue. Second, there does seem to be some scope for eroding Trump's advantage on immigration. On March 1, polls showed voters approving of the president's immigration policies by more than 10 points. Surveys taken in the last 10 days, by contrast, show that margin has fallen to 2.5 points. But given the timing, that possibility cannot be summarily dismissed Third, some influential right-wingers endorse the Democratic position on Abrego Garcia. Last Thursday, pro-Trump podcaster Joe Rogan detailed his misgivings about the president's violations of due process: What if you are an enemy of, let's not say any current president. Let's pretend we got a new president, totally new guy in 2028, and this is a common practice now of just rounding up gang members with no due process and shipping them to El Salvador, “You're a gang member.” “No, I'm not.” “Prove it.” “What? Defending a principle mutually endorsed by Joe Rogan and the Roberts Court does not seem like the riskiest stand that Democrats could take. Fourth, I'm not sure that the media's coverage of this controversy looks all that different in the alternate dimension where Democrats voiced opposition to Trump's actions when asked, but otherwise spoke exclusively about his failed economic policies. This is a much more shocking and unprecedented event than the House GOP's quest to cut Medicaid, even if the latter will ultimately inspire more voter backlash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? President Donald Trump has been sending undocumented immigrants to a mega prison in El Salvador without due process. Most of these deportees have no criminal record, yet our government has condemned them to indefinite incarceration in an infamously inhumane penitentiary. In 2019, a court had ruled that Abrego Garcia could not be sent to El Salvador, as he had a credible fear of being persecuted in that country. The White House attributed his deportation to an “administrative error.” Some Democrats believe that their party must call attention to this lawless cruelty. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and four progressive House members have traveled to El Salvador in recent days to check on Abrego Garcia's condition and advocate for his due process rights. But other Democrats fear their party is walking into a political trap. Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. In this case, you get a situation where you're giving the White House and the Republicans a lot of images and visuals that they think are compelling for them.” Democrats have a moral responsibility to defend both America's constitutional order and its most vulnerable residents. It does not follow, however, that they have a moral duty to hold press events about Abrego Garcia's case — even if such photo ops do nothing to abet his liberation, while doing much to boost Trump's political standing. In my view, the argument that Democrats are doing more harm than good by taking a high-profile stand in favor of due process is not immoral, but simply mistaken. Van Hollen's trip has plausibly benefited US residents unlawfully detained in El Salvador. And the political costs of such dissent are likely negligible, so long as Democrats keep their messaging about immigration disciplined and eventually shift their rhetorical focus to Trump's economic mismanagement. So far as I can tell, no Democrat is arguing that the party should acquiesce to Trump's lawless deportations. The concerned strategist who spoke with CNN stipulated that “Democrats should stand up for due process when asked about it.” Therefore, anything Democrats do to increase the salience of immigration plausibly aids Trump. What's more, elevating Abrego Garcia's cause above other issues could give voters the impression that Democrats are not prioritizing their own economic concerns. Or at least, this is what Republican strategists seem to believe. Following House progressives' trip to El Salvador, National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement, “House Democrats have proven they care more about illegal immigrant gang bangers than American families.” The NRCC proceeded to air digital ads against 25 swing-district Democrats, in which it offered to buy the representatives' airfare to El Salvador if they promised to “livestream the whole thing and snap plenty of selfies with their MS-13 buddies.” In this view, Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador did not actually help Abrego Garcia, whose fate still lies with America's court system and the White House. If Democrats teach him that they will do precisely that — so long as he violates immigrants' due process rights — then they will have made such violations more likely in the future, not less. Meanwhile, this faction of wary strategists insist that their party has a genuine image problem. And as their economic impacts surface, the president's trade policies are liable to become more salient, no matter what Democrats say or do. Yet in a Quinnipiac poll taken after Trump single-handedly engineered an economic crisis with his “Liberation Day” tariffs, the two parties are tied on that question. Democrats have time to improve their image; the midterms are well over a year away. So some might wonder why the party should fret about increasing the salience of an unfavorable issue so far from Election Day. But there's an argument that the party should be doing everything in its power to increase its popularity — and reduce Trump's — right now. Thus, from this vantage, message discipline is a moral imperative. Centering Democratic messaging on Abrego Garcia's case might help ambitious Democrats earn small-dollar donations and adoration among the party's base. On the substance, Democratic officials flying to El Salvador to check on Abrego Garcia's condition could plausibly deter abuses against him and other immigrant detainees in that country. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele may be a reactionary aligned with Trump, but he is surely aware that the United States has a two-party system. His government therefore must give some thought to its relationship with a hypothetical future Democratic administration. Thus, by advocating so forcefully for US residents unlawfully imprisoned in El Salvador, the Democratic Party has given Bukele some incentive to, at a minimum, keep Abrego Garcia and others like him alive (something that his government routinely fails to do with its prisoners). In an interview with Vox's Today, Explained podcast, Van Hollen said that Salvadoran authorities have not allowed Abrego Garcia to communicate with his family or his lawyers. Only through Van Hollen's intervention was Abrego Garcia's wife able to send her greetings to him, or even confirm that her husband was still alive. If an elected official has the power to serve a constituent in this way, it seems worthwhile that they do so. The prospect that Van Hollen might have effectively encouraged more unlawful deportations by taking this course of action — since Trump wants his opponents to do photo ops on behalf of undocumented immigrants — merits consideration. One could just as easily posit that Democrats ducking this issue entirely would have emboldened Trump to ramp up unlawful deportations. It seems possible — perhaps, even likely — that Democrats loudly advocating for Abrego Garcia is politically suboptimal, relative to a monomaniacal focus on the economy. But so long as Democrats act strategically on other fronts, I think the political costs of taking a stand on due process are likely to be negligibly small, for at least five reasons: First, as far as progressive immigration positions go, “The Trump administration should honor court orders and the due process rights of longtime US residents” is pretty safe territory. And an Economist-YouGov poll released Wednesday found voters specifically agreeing that Trump should bring Abrego Garcia back by a 50 to 28 point margin. If Democrats frame Abrego Garcia's case as a question of Americans' civil liberties — while reiterating their party's commitment to enforcing immigration law and securing the border — they should be able to mitigate any political cost inherent to elevating this issue. Second, there does seem to be some scope for eroding Trump's advantage on immigration. On March 1, polls showed voters approving of the president's immigration policies by more than 10 points. Surveys taken in the last 10 days, by contrast, show that margin has fallen to 2.5 points. But given the timing, that possibility cannot be summarily dismissed Third, some influential right-wingers endorse the Democratic position on Abrego Garcia. Last Thursday, pro-Trump podcaster Joe Rogan detailed his misgivings about the president's violations of due process: What if you are an enemy of, let's not say any current president. Let's pretend we got a new president, totally new guy in 2028, and this is a common practice now of just rounding up gang members with no due process and shipping them to El Salvador, “You're a gang member.” “No, I'm not.” “Prove it.” “What? Defending a principle mutually endorsed by Joe Rogan and the Roberts Court does not seem like the riskiest stand that Democrats could take. Fourth, I'm not sure that the media's coverage of this controversy looks all that different in the alternate dimension where Democrats voiced opposition to Trump's actions when asked, but otherwise spoke exclusively about his failed economic policies. This is a much more shocking and unprecedented event than the House GOP's quest to cut Medicaid, even if the latter will ultimately inspire more voter backlash. In a world where Van Hollen and his House colleagues never go to El Salvador, the general subject of immigration might have received marginally less media attention over the past week. Fifth, Democratic officials are not speaking out on this entirely at their own direction. Their party's base is understandably alarmed by the president's lawlessness. Florida Rep.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? American campuses, the video warns, had become hotbeds of anti-Israel extremism: safe spaces for students to attend “Jew-hating conferences and anti-American rallies.” To fight this, Canary Mission would build an extensive database of students and professors who engaged in anti-Israel activity. “These individuals are applying for jobs within your company,” the Canary Mission video warns. “It is your duty to ensure that today's radicals are not tomorrow's employees.” People listed in the database have been harassed, disciplined, and even fired. Israeli intelligence has used Canary Mission profiles as justification for detaining listed visitors at the border. After plainclothes officers arrested Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk on the streets of Boston in late March, Öztürk's attorneys claimed the sole reason for her arrest was her Canary Mission profile. While the Trump administration claims she had engaged in activity “in support of Hamas,” the private Homeland Security memo justifying her detention only cited an op-ed she had written in support of boycotting Israel, using language very similar to her Canary Mission page. After Öztürk's arrest, Canary Mission's X account posted a celebratory tweet claiming “sources point to her Canary Mission profile as the primary cause.” It currently maintains a list of seven other students and professors who it believes should be targeted for deportation. Two of these, Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, are currently in ICE custody. Canary Mission's rise is not really a story about one organization, or even the toxic climate of America's Israel-Palestine debate. And when such groups can align themselves with a friendly government, the danger rises exponentially. But Canary Mission is unusual in two respects: its opaque structure and extremely aggressive tactics. On paper, its headquarters are in Israel — specifically Beit Shemesh, a medium-sized city near Jerusalem. Yet the address listed on its paperwork is in a padlocked, seemingly abandoned building. Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them. It's an unusual setup that effectively allows Canary Mission to keep its funding sources fully anonymous. “I can't think of another one that hides their funding like this.” But it is necessary, in part, because Canary Mission has been a lightning rod for controversy even within the pro-Israel community. And many of these groups engage in political activity — like documenting Jewish students' concerns about campus antisemitism or creating new right-leaning Middle East studies journals — that are within the confines of legitimate debate and activism in a democratic society. But Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them. Lila Corwin Berman, a historian of Jewish philanthropy at New York University, dates this approach to roughly the early 2000s. During that time, pro-Israel organizations like Campus Watch and the David Project began publicly targeting professors and students that they believed had engaged in unacceptable speech. These efforts were haphazard at the outset, publishing specific attacks on allegedly problematic scholars rather than maintaining a full-on blacklist. Canary Mission's database, first unveiled in 2014, represented a qualitative escalation — one explicitly aimed at creating professional problems for anti-Israel activists. In 2018, pro-Israel campus groups at five major universities published a joint op-ed calling on the movement to repudiate Canary Mission. This internal criticism did not do much to stop the Canary Mission's growth, fueled as it was by unaccountable backers. Today, Canary Mission's searchable database is vast — containing entries for over 2,000 individuals across 38 states, DC, and five Canadian provinces. To understand why Canary Mission is so controversial, start by looking at how its blacklist works. Each individual listing contains both a dossier documenting the target's alleged offenses and their contact information, including direct links to their social media accounts that can facilitate targeted harassment campaigns. Some Canary Mission targets have said or done something that many would find offensive, such as endorsing the October 7, 2023, massacre. But the vast majority of profiles I could find were individuals who either attended a pro-Palestinian rally or wrote something critical about Israel's policies towards the Palestinians. Canary Mission will describe this banal activity in threatening terms, like “attending a pro-Hamas rally.” But the speech in question is more than just legally protected: It is exactly the sort of political activity that people in a democracy are supposed to use as a vehicle for expressing their opinion. The Mission's database isn't primarily about identifying examples of extreme anti-Israel speech or political violence — it is about trying to silence any criticism of Israel by labeling it antisemitic or pro-terrorist. Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student facing deportation, is a case in point. There is no plausible case that people like Öztürk constitute any kind of threat to Jews on campus. That she is listed by Canary Mission — and that the organization publicly cheered her arrest — reveals its primary interest in policing speech critical of Israel by any means necessary. The American Jewish community is fairly left-wing; roughly two-thirds disapprove of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government. While a strong majority supports Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state, large numbers of American Jews believe its occupation of Palestinian territory is both strategically unwise and morally indefensible. There is also a minority of anti-Zionist American Jews, more prominent in younger generations, who support the dissolution of Israel and its replacement with a binational state. Reading their dossiers, like the profile of eminent Holocaust historian Omer Bartov, their alleged offenses include everything from criticizing the Netanyahu government's approach to judicial reform to attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration. If Canary Mission were truly about protecting Jews' rights to participate freely in campus life, then it wouldn't include them on a database explicitly designed to hurt their career prospects. We don't know for a fact that the Trump administration is using Canary Mission's database to identify deportation targets. There is suggestive evidence: The wording in the State Department memo justifying Öztürk's deportation, for example, is very similar to what appeared on her Canary profile). But so far, there is no direct proof of a link. Yet regardless of whether Canary Mission entries are currently directing policy, it's clear they wish to be seen as doing so. They do this not only by maintaining their list of seven people they wish were deported, but also posting messages in support for actual deportations with slogans like “pro-Hamas extremism has consequences” and “no more safe havens for terror supporters.” Canary Mission has graduated from “merely” advocating professional consequences for pro-Palestinian voices to endorsing outright state repression against them. The idea of trying to silence political opponents rather than debate them is dangerous. There are certainly cases where speech merits consequences: If a professor says discriminatory things about Jewish students, for example, or an activist advocates violence against her peers. But these are generally seen as exceptions rather than rules in free societies: the “boundary cases” where toleration for political expression runs up against other important values. Canary Mission was founded on the opposite principle: that an entire category of speech, pro-Palestinian advocacy, should be treated as presumptively illegitimate. They believe the cause of defending Israel is best served not by engaging in rigorous debate and advocacy, but by making a giant list of people who believe the “wrong” things and ensuring they suffer consequences for those beliefs. No elected leader can turn a democracy into an authoritarian regime on their own. They need partners, influential people and organizations that can operate to weaken resistance to democratic backsliding and help create a climate of fear in which anti-government activity is perceived as costly. However, Chambers and Kopstein warned, this doesn't mean they'll always be irrelevant. Even if “illiberal forces cannot destabilize the state,” the authors write, “they can still “contribute to an insidious erosion of values that leaves liberalism vulnerable to all sorts of threat.” Canary Mission's behavior in the past 10 years shows that this warning was prescient. A conversation with Sen. Chris Van Hollen about Kilmar Abrego Garcia's detention — and where America goes from here. With near daily strikes against Yemen's Houthis, is there an end in sight?</p>

FIRST ON FOX -- U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young, who successfully sued CNN for defamation earlier this year, filed a lawsuit against U.S. News & World Report on Wednesday as he continues to fight to clear his name. In January, a Florida jury found that CNN defamed Young by implying he illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan on the "black market" during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021. Young was awarded $4 million in lost earnings, $1 million in personal damages such as pain and suffering, and the jury found that punitive damages are also warranted against CNN. Young, who has since sued the Associated Press and Puck over coverage of the CNN trial, filed his latest lawsuit against U.S. News & World Report. The dust-up started in January when AP media reporter David Bauder wrote that "Young's business helped smuggle people out of Afghanistan" when covering the CNN trial. Bauder's report is at the center of Young's separate lawsuit against the AP, and U.S. News & World Report republished the story, which is common practice for news outlets, before eventually retracting it. A jury found  earlier this year that CNN defamed U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Bay County, Florida which has been obtained by Fox News Digital, Young's lawyer, Daniel Lustig, wrote that U.S. News & World Report's retraction didn't go "far enough," and his client gave the outlet a chance to correct the mistake before a lawsuit was filed. They had already issued a retraction, but it didn't go far enough. Once Young objected to the AP accusing him of smuggling people, U.S. News & World Report removed its pickup of the story and chalked it up to a "possible misunderstanding." Zachary Young is seeking the same venue for his lawsuits against the Associated Press and U.S. News & World Report as he had with CNN: Bay County, Florida. "RETRACTION: U.S. News & World Report has removed the article previously available at this URL that had been published on January 17, 2025, entitled ‘Florida Jury Says CNN Defamed Navy Veteran in Story About Endangered Afghans.' As an AP subscriber, U.S News regularly republishes multiple AP articles on a daily basis," U.S. News & World Report wrote on the page where the AP report used to exist. "The AP article reported that the jury found that a CNN report on Mr. Young had falsely implied he had engaged in illegal conduct," U.S. News & World Report continued. "The AP article also stated that ‘Young's business helped smuggle people out of Afghanistan.' Mr. Young subsequently contacted U.S. News and objected to the word ‘smuggle' as accusing him of engaging in criminal activity. In republishing the article, U.S. News had no intention to suggest that Mr. Young's actions were unlawful. Nevertheless, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, U.S. News has removed and retracts the AP article." The retraction did not sit right with Young. The media has a profound responsibility to the public, and if they can't be trusted to acknowledge what words mean and the damage they can cause, we will continue holding them accountable in court. U.S. News & World Report did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Plaintiff Zachary Young successfully alleged that CNN smeared him by implying he illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan on the "black market" during the military withdrawal from the country in 2021. In the court filing, Young's attorney said it's "categorically false" to say that Young smuggled anyone and noted that "human smuggling" is a felony under U.S. law and courts ruled he did nothing illegal during his Afghanistan evacuation effort. "AP's story was a factual and accurate report on the jury verdict finding in Zachary Young's favor," an AP spokesperson previously said. Young is seeking compensatory and other damages, and will likely seek to amend the lawsuit to include punitive damages at a later date. Brian Flood is a media editor/reporter for FOX News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Pakistani astronaut will become the first foreign national aboard China's Tiangong space station, as Beijing steps up space diplomacy amid a burgeoning battle with the United States for supremacy in orbit. The mission of the Pakistani astronaut – who is yet to be selected – tightens already close space ties between Beijing and Islamabad. Last year, Pakistan sent a satellite to the Moon aboard China's lunar explorer, alongside payloads from the European Space Agency, France, and Italy, according to Chinese state media. During a press conference on Wednesday, the China Manned Space Agency announced the astronaut selected will be a payload specialist, handling daily tasks during the mission, as well as scientific experiments for Pakistan. Amjad Ali, deputy director of Pakistan's space agency SUPARCO, lauded the news as a milestone for the South Asian nation, whose government is taking a renewed interest in its more than 60-year-old space program. “It is very important for Pakistan, being the first foreign country whose astronauts are entertained by China and taken by the Chinese mission,” he told Reuters news agency on Wednesday. The pair will then go through training in China for six months to a year, with one eventually being sent to space as early as October next year, while the other acts as a reserve, Ali said. The two countries' growing space ties coincide with their increasing economic collaboration and trade on Earth. Under Beijing's China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a major project within its broader Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested heavily in infrastructure in the north and south of Pakistan, including a deep-water port in the southwestern city of Gwadar, as well as multiple technological projects between the two countries. An agreement signed in February between the two countries on space cooperation was a precursor the mission announced Wednesday. On Tuesday, a delegation from Chinese space tech company Galaxy Space met with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according  to a statement from Sharif's office. The delegation expressed a “keen interest in investing in Pakistan's space technology industry and joint ventures with Pakistani space technology institutions and private telecom companies,” the statement added. Sharif, calling China his country's “most reliable friend and strategic partner,” said that Pakistan was “looking to increase cooperation with China in the fields of space technology, space satellites and satellite internet.” Amer Gilani, who oversees human spaceflight cooperation at SUPARCO, told CNN that the experiments to be conducted during the planned mission were still being selected, but will have “high scientific, industrial and social impact.” China has rapidly advanced its space power in recent decades through ambitious lunar and deep-space exploration programs, as well as expanding its space station. On Thursday, another manned mission will launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China, carrying three astronauts to Tiangong. The Shenzhou-20 crew is scheduled to blast off at 5:17 p.m. on Thursday local time (5:17 a.m. While in space, the astronauts will conduct science and application experiments, install a space debris protection device, as well as extravehicular payload and equipment, and perform recovery tasks, according to the agency. They will include zebrafish, flatworms known as planarians, and streptomyces bacteria. China has signed nearly 200 intergovernmental space cooperation agreements with foreign countries and international organizations, covering fields from satellite development and lunar exploration to manned space flight, state media reported in December. China's space administration announced Thursday it has also approved loans of lunar samples collected by China's earlier moon exploration mission to seven institutions across six countries, including Pakistan.</p>
