                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every crypto project claims to fix something. But the ones worth watching are specific; they know what they're rebuilding and why the original model no longer works. At $0.1677, the HBAR token reflects steady utility, though forecasts point to a drop toward $0.1499 without new adoption. Cardano prioritizes decentralized governance, embedding decision-making into its protocol. Unstaked (UNSD) isn't addressing coordination between users or institutions; it's confronting a far newer imbalance: centralized control over artificial intelligence. Its presale is now officially live, launching at a starting price of just $0.0065. Hedera isn't trying to reinvent the internet, it's focused on making business transactions faster, safer, and less painful. Without new partnerships or an external push, the token could dip around 11% to $0.1499 by mid-May. In a space that moves fast, is technical strength enough? Cardano is built like it's here for the long haul , serious tech, real-world use cases, and a $20.11 billion market cap to show for it. But at $0.6281, down just over 5% this week, the short-term story feels less about momentum and more about waiting around. A clean break above $0.62 could flip that script, but until then, Cardano looks caught between confidence and caution. Some still believe it could track the growth paths of Ethereum or Bitcoin. But for now, Cardano is doing what it's always done , building slow and aiming steady. OpenAI proved something the world didn't want to admit until it was too obvious to ignore: Intelligence has value, and whoever owns it, controls the narrative. That control, however, now sits squarely in the hands of centralized giants,closed systems, backroom partnerships, and API pricing that changes without warning. It offers something OpenAI never will: total ownership. Not just a dashboard , fully autonomous, AI-powered agents that learn, adapt, and deliver value under the command of their deployers. It's the kind of price that rarely survives the early stages of a platform with actual utility and real-world use cases. Value like this tends not to wait around. The mechanisms are in place, and adoption is just a matter of time. It's about offering what centralized platforms never could: a system that acts with intelligence and accountability, built on-chain, owned by its users, and still available at a cost most will look back on in disbelief. For anyone watching the top crypto presale market right now, this one checks every box. Analysts warn that the HBAR token could dip 11% by mid-May without new partnerships. ADA's price prediction is just as uncertain, despite solid use cases; it still lingers at $0.6281, with momentum yet to follow through. In a market where major tokens are stalling, Unstaked isn't waiting. It's not refining what already works or promising future relevance. It's busy building AI agents that adapt, execute, and generate value under full user control. Currently priced at just $0.0065 in presale stage 1, Unstaked is quickly becoming one of the top crypto presale opportunities in the market today, and the current entry point won't be around for long!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RTFKT, Nike's abandoned digital brand pronounced “artifact,” lost its CloneX art overnight. The art for all 19,500 Ethereum NFTs in the collection was replaced with a black background with white text that reads: “This content has been restricted. This is because every second of a typical video requires as much bandwidth as loading a full web page,” the page reads. “Unfortunately, while most people respect these limitations and understand they exist to ensure high quality of service for all Cloudflare customers, some users attempt to misconfigure our service to stream video in violation of our Terms of Service,” the post continues. Others, like Yuga Labs blockchain lead 0xQuit, speculated that RTFKT may have forgotten to pay their Cloudflare bill and saw their service cancelled (RTFKT lead Samuel Cardillo told me it has “nothing to do” with an unpaid bill). Other RTFKT collections — like its NFTs with artist Fewocious, its Animus Eggs, and its Nike Dunk Cryptokicks — still had visible video art live as of Thursday at 10:30am ET white the CloneX art was gone. “And some of you thought this was the next @cryptopunksnfts since it was abandoned,” Ape Ventures founder Xeer wrote early Thursday morning. Unlike most NFT collections, CryptoPunks art is stored fully onchain on Ethereum. Because NFTs can use art or visual data that's hosted by a centralized company — like Cloudflare or AWS — they are inherently more mutable and censorable than decentralized data storage options. RTFKT Head of Tech Samuel Cardillo said the CloneX and Animus NFTs are moving to decentralized blockchain storage platform Arweave. The team had been trying to switch their storage infrastructure since December, but the switch took longer “because of internal corpo [sic] process.” “Somehow this morning Cloudflare decided to move to the Free plan [a] few days before the end of the contract which also triggered that bug in which Cloudflare refuses to stream images and videos,” Cardillo said. RTFKT shut down operations in December, spurring a slew of over 3,300 CloneX sales in one day as traders gave up hope on the future of the collection. RTFKT's post about its shutdown at the time didn't offer much of an explanation. It's a bitter end for those who lost money on the NFTs as well as those who had longer-term hopes for the December 2021 collection. The CloneX floor price hit an all-time low earlier this month, with NFTs selling for roughly $230 worth of ETH, per NFTPriceFloor data. In April 2022, RTFKT CloneX NFTs had a floor price of over $60,000 per NFT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BTC reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have fallen to the lowest level since November 2018. Bitcoin reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have dropped to their lowest level in more than six years, as publicly traded companies ramp up their accumulation of the digital asset following the US presidential election, according to Fidelity Digital Assets. “We have seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to public company purchases — something we anticipate accelerating in the near future,” Fidelity reported on the X social media platform. More than 425,000 BTC have moved off exchanges since November, a trend often viewed as a signal of long-term investment rather than short-term trading. Over the same period, publicly-traded companies acquired nearly 350,000 BTC, Fidelity said. Related: Bitcoin exchange buying is back as 'Spoofy the Whale' lifts $90K asks While Fidelity noted significant corporate Bitcoin purchases, most of the accumulation has been driven by Strategy, the business intelligence firm-turned-Bitcoin bank co-founded by Michael Saylor. Strategy's latest purchase of 6,556 BTC was disclosed on April 21. Outside the United States, publicly traded companies in Asia have adopted a similar Bitcoin treasury strategy, with Japan's Metaplanet and Hong Kong's HK Asia Holdings increasing their Bitcoin allocations. Metaplanet currently holds 5,000 BTC, with CEO Simon Gerovich saying his goal is to double that amount this year.</p>

We can also assure our customers that the virtual assets we are offering on our ruya investment platform are Shari'ah-compliant, providing much-needed certainty.” “Partnering with ruya is a big step towards making virtual assets a seamless part of everyday banking,” said Mohammed Ali Yusuf (Mo Ali Yusuf), Co-Founder and CEO of Fuze. “Together, we're combining Fuze's cutting-edge infrastructure with ruya's commitment to ethical Islamic banking.” Unlike other platforms that encourage speculative crypto trading, ruya's offering is embedded within a curated investment framework designed to support long-term financial growth, the company stated in the announcement. It will focus on transparency, fairness, and ethical investing—core tenets of Islamic finance. To ensure accessibility and informed decision-making, ruya is also offering support through community centers and hybrid call centers, where customers can receive expert guidance on virtual asset investing.</p>

Moreover, the top 25 $TRUMP coin holders will also be invited to a private VIP reception with Trump and a separate special VIP tour. With the biggest PolitiFi meme coin, $TRUMP, offering such non-financial yet prestigious perks, we've included the best altcoins you can invest in for similar exclusive benefits below. Trump launched his proprietary meme coin just a few days before swearing in as president. This will further dilute $TRUMP's market capitalization and offer sell-side opportunities. It's an excellent tactic not only to boost demand but to ensure that the additional daily supply is absorbed by investors. For starters, you can't be from a KYC watchlist country and must pass a background check after you're selected for the invitation. However, $TRUMP isn't the only token offering exclusive benefits. We've gone hunting, and here are the top three cryptos with additional perks. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is arguably the best crypto to buy now if you're looking for a project offering top-notch benefits. While free tokens and governance rights are great, $MIND's roadmap shows it could offer more, allowing you to invest in a project that has the potential to create a money-making crypto portfolio on your behalf. MIND of Pepe is an autonomous AI agent that will track online crypto trends and community hype to identify crypto projects with the potential to explode. It will do so by talking to crypto influencers on dApps and social media sites like X and assessing their biases. As we noted above, MIND of Pepe will be launching its own tokens based on social sentiment trends and market fundamentals. With over $8.2M raised so far, you can get in for just $0.0037365 per coin. For more, here's how to buy $MIND tokens. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the newest crypto subscription platform, but it's unique because it's the first one ever to integrate AI into its ecosystem. For starters, creators on SUBBD get access to futuristic AI tools, like AI image, video, and voice generators, that they can use to automate the entire process of creating content and mundane tasks such as scheduling. $SUBBD token holders, aka the fans, get access to the exclusive content of their favorite creators, on-platform discounts, and loyalty rewards — plus, early access to new features. As a new cryptocurrency on presale, each token is available for just $0.05525. And with predictions that $SUBBD could jump over 1,200% and reach $0.668 by 2026, this is a project many are keeping an eye on. $FARTCOIN holders might not get the kind of VIP benefits offered by $MIND or $SUBBD, but its extremely positive future outlook could result in double- or triple-digit gains in your investment. Well, it's not strong fundamentals or a large-scale revolutionary goal. It's something simpler but perhaps more important: amusement and the community's shared love for stinking farts. Token holders get free $FARTCOIN tokens if they submit hilarious fart jokes. Even then, though, the crypto market's volatility and unpredictability are such that no returns can be guaranteed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined AFK Letters Co Ltd (AFK) £90,000 for making more than 95,000 unsolicited marketing calls to people registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), in a clear breach of electronic marketing laws. Despite AFK claiming it could not provide evidence of consent because it deleted all customer data after three months, when challenged by the ICO, it was also unable to provide consent records for several calls made within a three-month timeframe. “…claimed she had information showing I might be due a refund in relation to my solar panels as the supplier had gone bust (which isn't true.) She knew my name… I explained I had not consented to receive such a call which was an intrusion and asked her to remove me from the list.” Additionally, AFK's  own privacy policy only mentioned contact by email, and did not state that people would also receive phone calls. An ICO investigation found that AFK failed to comply with Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), which requires organisations to have clear, informed and specific consent before making unsolicited direct marketing calls. Andy Curry, Interim Director of Enforcement and Investigations at the Information Commissioner's Office, said: This is a fundamental requirement of responsible and legally compliant direct marketing. “This fine should serve as a clear warning to and learning for other organisations: if you cannot demonstrate valid consent for people on the Telephone Preference Service, you should not be contacting people. “It is vital that other companies utilising direct marketing have robust systems in place to protect people's privacy and comply with the law.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While early promises of decentralization and accessibility sparked global excitement, today's reality tells a different story: overloaded networks, exorbitant fees, and scaling limitations continue to block true growth. We started with a simple question: what kind of network can keep up with the speed of the modern internet? A full rebuild — from scratch, with no shortcuts. One of our engineers, with a background in Qualcomm technologies, recognized early on that Web3 could reshape the internet. None of the current networks could deliver the speed and reliability needed for real-time games, DeFi protocols, AI-driven systems, or autonomous applications. Speed is important, but it should never come at the cost of stability. Solana ran into architectural vulnerabilities: congestion, outages, and reliance on a narrow group of validators. From day one, we had one goal: build a network that handles tons of transactions fast, while staying secure and decentralized. This isn't about benchmarks in a testnet. It's about building a system that performs in the real world — and keeps up as demand grows. The way we approach architecture is simple: keep roles clearly separated, avoid unnecessary bottlenecks. We're developing a modular system where validation and execution work independently. That separation helps us process transactions in parallel, without sacrificing resilience or security. The use cases that inspire us aren't theoretical. They're real-world problems that existing chains fail to solve: • Real-time games with a large number of concurrent players • DeFi protocols that stay stable under peak load • Infrastructure for AI agents making on-the-fly decisions • Autonomous systems that need dependable, stable coordination We're laying a foundation — a blockchain you can depend on when real value and real users are on the line. We're building an architecture where scalability, reliability, and real-world utility come first. We have a clear technical strategy, a deep understanding of the market, and insights gained from analyzing the failures of previous networks. Now, we're looking for partners who share this vision — and are ready to invest in foundations, not fads.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The skyward movement was driven by investor optimism around its proposed merger with Twenty One Capital a bitcoin (BTC) native investment vehicle backed by Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank. Led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers and Brandon Lutnick, Twenty One Capital is being positioned as a public proxy for bitcoin, potentially holding over 42,000 BTC at launch and introducing metrics like Bitcoin Per Share (BPS) and Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR) to measure shareholder value in BTC terms. Public SPAC shareholders will retain just 2.7% ownership, underscoring the extreme dilution but significant upside if BTC rises. With BTC trading near $94,000, and the entity holding nearly $4B in BTC exposure, investors are re-rating CEP as a high-leverage bet on institutional bitcoin adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum breaks key levels but struggles at $1,800. Could growing network activity and increasing long positions spark a move toward $2,000? As the crypto market recovery pauses, Bitcoin drops below $93,000, while Ethereum continues to struggle below the $1,800 level. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $1,769, showing an intraday pullback of nearly 1.5%. While Ethereum continues to face resistance, optimistic traders anticipate a post-retest bounce. On the 4-hour price chart, Ethereum's trend showcases a bullish breakout from a long-standing supply zone, surpassing the 38.20% Fibonacci level near $1,675. However, the uptrend failed to maintain momentum above the $1,834 mark, resulting in short-term consolidation and a minor pullback. This current pullback may be a potential retest of the 200 EMA line and the 50% Fibonacci level. Notably, the recovery has positively influenced the 50 and 100 EMA lines, hinting at a possible bullish crossover. Such upward momentum would also increase the chances of a golden crossover between the 50 and 200 EMA lines—a strong bullish signal. Amid Ethereum's recent bullish recovery, a new analysis by Carmelo Alemán, an analyst at CryptoQuant, highlights a major boost in network activity. Carmelo projects a potential expansion in the broader Ethereum ecosystem, which could serve as a launchpad for multiple projects built on Ethereum. As the ecosystem grows, demand for ETH is expected to rise, potentially driving prices higher. As price action analysis suggests a potential rebound, bullish sentiment in Ethereum's derivatives market continues to grow. According to Coinglass data, long positions in the derivatives market are nearing 55%. This marks a notable increase over the past three hours, up from 46.3%. With renewed optimism for a breakout rally, derivatives traders are betting big on Ethereum. According to the Ethereum exchange liquidation map, a breakout above $1,800 could lead to significant short liquidations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Revolut saw its revenue jump 72 per cent to £3.1bn in 2024, fuelled by a bounce in its subscription and crypto offerings. Europe's most valuable private tech company reported pre-tax profits of £1.1bn in 2024, more than double the previous year, and added 15 million new users. Revolut now has 52.5 million retail customers across the world. Nik Storonsky, Revolut CEO and co-founder, heralded 2024 as a “landmark” year for the UK-headquartered challenger bank. This was driven by strong growth in customer deposits and increased balances. Its revenue uplift was helped by subscription revenue hitting £423 million, a 74 per cent year-on-year increase, while wealth revenue grew 298 per cent driven by increased crypto trading activity and the launch of Revolut X, its standalone crypto exchange, last year. Revolut has also been rumoured to be gearing up for an IPO. Storonsky added: “2024 was a landmark year for Revolut. We not only accelerated our customer growth, welcoming nearly 15 million new users globally, but critically, we also saw customers engaging more deeply by adopting a wider range of our services across both our retail offering and Revolut Business. "This performance earned us the status of Europe's most valuable private technology company, reflecting the confidence of existing and new investors in our trajectory. We're making strong progress towards 100 million daily active customers across 100 countries, driven by growth in the UK, Europe, and our expansion markets. This ambitious goal will keep us focused on revolutionising global financial access through innovative products and seamless user experiences." Would you like to write the first comment?</p>

This uptick indicates increasing network participation at a time when ETH is beginning to regain some bullish momentum. Although they are not a guarantee of upward movement, spikes in address activity can be an early sign of shifting sentiment and frequently indicate growing investor interest, especially when combined with rising price action. Following a strong green daily candle breakout, ETH price has crossed $1,790, breaking away from the short-term range in which it had been stuck. At just over 50, the relative strength index indicates mild bullish momentum without being overbought. The moving average convergence/divergence has also started to show early signs of a trend shift, turning slightly positive. The network's fees remain unusually low, around $0.31 on average, as per YCharts data. Still, with active addresses rising and ETH holding above previous resistance, the short-term outlook looks better than it has in weeks. If momentum continues, the next major test will be whether ETH can make a run toward $2,000.

The Bank of Korea has recently pointed out several misunderstandings regarding its digital currency usage test "Project Hangang River," which is conducted from April 1 to June. The central bank emphasized that this project is more about experimenting with "deposit tokens," a stablecoin issued by domestic commercial banks, rather than the central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Bank of Korea.

At a briefing held at the Bank of Korea on April 21, Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryul stated, “There is concern that the CBDC might allow the Bank of Korea to access personal information, but due to the possibility of privacy infringement during the research process, we decided to use deposit tokens issued by banks in 2023 in a way that actual users can utilize them.” He added, “The term ‘token' was used because stablecoins were negatively perceived during the Luna-Terra incident, and ultimately, the digital currency test is a test of the deposit tokens issued by banks.”

Furthermore, Lee mentioned, “Deposit token users provide their personal information to the banks, not to the Bank of Korea,” and “Whether stablecoins and (central bank digital currency) can coexist is something the Bank of Korea has considered when designing the digital currency system ecosystem.”

Lee Byung-mok, director of financial settlement at the Bank of Korea, stated, “Even in the digital financial world, the concept of digital legal currency is to convert even stablecoins into legal currency,” and “The basic concept of the CBDC pursued by the central bank is to coexist with payment methods that are circulated and used by the private sector.”

Project Hangang River is the first test, and plans have emerged to link it with personal remittances and more local government voucher projects in the future.

Yoon Sung-kwan, head of the Digital Currency Research Office at the Bank of Korea, said, “We are considering a second follow-up test,” and “We are conducting meetings in working groups with financial institutions, discussing first personal remittances and expanding usage.”

Deputy Governor Lee added, “We are gradually expanding even in the first phase,” and “There are plans to use deposit tokens for scholarships given to freshmen at Silla University, which can be used at local or campus stores.”

As of the morning of that day, 51,766 electronic wallets capable of using deposit tokens had been opened, and a cumulative total of 29,251 transactions had occurred from April 1 to April 20.
