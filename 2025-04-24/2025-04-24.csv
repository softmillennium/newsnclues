            President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.”
    


            “It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social.
    


            Any move to recognize Russia's control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy and could upset the widely held post-World War Two consensus that international borders should not be changed by force.
    


            Russian missiles struck Ukraine's capital city Kyiv and the country's second largest city Kharkiv hours after Trump's post, Ukrainian authorities said, with at least nine people killed and some 70 wounded in the latest attacks.
    


            Trump's comments came after a meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine had been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he wouldn't attend.
    


            Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues,” though a US official and two European diplomats familiar with the matter said the top US diplomat didn't go because the administration did not feel that they were at a decisive point in the ongoing talks and Rubio didn't feel attending would be the best use of his time.
    


            “It was better to let talks play out than create the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent,” said one of the European diplomats.
    


            “Emotions have run high today,” Zelensky said on X Wednesday after the talks.
    


            In what seemed to be an indirect response to Trump's criticism of Zelensky being unwilling to recognize Russian control of Crimea, Zelensky vowed Kyiv would abide by its constitution: “Ukraine will always act in accordance with its Constitution and we are absolutely sure that our partners - in particular the USA - will act in line with its strong decisions.”
    


            Zelensky shared a screenshot of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's 2018 Crimea Declaration which rejected Russia's occupation of the peninsula.
    


            Britain's Foreign Office had confirmed earlier on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists.
    


            The developments throw new uncertainty over the diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations on Wednesday, telling reporters during a visit to India: “We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process. We've engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”

            But Ukraine's European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire.
    


            After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead.
    


            Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, a US official said.
    


            The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. It would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the war, the official said.
    


            Zelensky made clear Tuesday that he was open to talks with Russia, but that Kyiv would not accept a deal that recognizes Moscow's control of Crimea.
    


            “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. “There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution.”
    


            Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. What I said is the current line, somewhere close to them is where you're ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict. Now of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.”
    


            The war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching.
    


            The talks in London were scheduled as US officials publicly voiced frustration over the lack of progress at bringing an end to the war.
    


            Trump has said he would “have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it” from both sides for the US to continue negotiations, after Rubio warned last week that Washington could walk away from its efforts to end the conflict if there were no signs of progress.
    


            The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. There are still pieces of the framework to be filled out and the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that this week, the official told CNN.

            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the negotiations were “hopefully moving in the right direction,” and declined to say what “stepping back” from the peace efforts might look like for the US.
    


            Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv.
    


            However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022.
    


            On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target.
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.

            From immigration fights to defending President Donald Trump's federal government cutbacks, the Justice Department has responded to more than a hundred emergency lawsuits in the first hundred days of the presidency with surprising consistency.
    


            The approach: Defend whatever Trump wants. And when that's not working, muddy the waters.
    


            At times, that includes skipping or fast-tracking the established order of when cases can be appealed in federal civil cases, with the Justice Department pushing some ongoing disputes from trial-level courts up to the Supreme Court or other appellate courts as soon as it can.
    


            At other times, it's included an approach filled with “fallacy,” or a very selective reading of a court order, as Judge Paula Xinis of the federal court in Maryland wrote recently in an immigration case.

One thing the modern Supreme Court can agree on is disagreeing over religion



            In the Xinis case, regarding the mistakenly deported immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration was told by the Supreme Court that Xinis at the trial level could order the US to “facilitate” his return. Xinis has said the way the Justice Department interpreted that order – by doing nothing except stating they would be willing to send a plane to Latin America to retrieve him – is “redefining ‘facilitate' contrary to law and logic.”
    


            “The administration appears to be driven not by any legal theory but by a theory of power,” one former Justice Department official from Democratic administrations told CNN.
    


            The Supreme Court has said the Trump administration must give notice to detainees who are being sent to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act so they have the opportunity to challenge their deportations. But courts are now questioning whether the administration's notice is enough.
    


            The ACLU, representing the detainees, has alleged they may not even get 24 hours' notice of removal. The group has also raised the concern that the notices are being given in English rather than the detainees' first language, Spanish, though a Justice Department lawyer denied this in court on Friday.
    


            A refrain in court from administration lawyers since Trump took office has been to argue that the power of the president is nearly irreproachable – a theory that is likely to be tested by Trump at the Supreme Court.
    


            At times, this means the administration has argued – in public and in court – that Trump may derive more power than judges because he was elected president. This argument of a mandate from voters most recently came up this week during court arguments on Trump's aggressive immigration program.
    


            “The president was elected on this exact program, and it remains his most popular policy, despite the media's attempts to turn it otherwise,” Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told a federal judge in New York.
    


            Judge Alvin Hellerstein responded, “We're not talking about popularity. I understand the desire to remove but there's also due process of law.”

            That argument has also arisen as Justice Department lawyers have defended the data-seeking and funding-slashing efforts of Trump's adviser Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, the attempts to shutter agencies including USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the firing of federal appointees and career civil servants.
    


            It also came up as the Justice Department defended a Trump executive order targeting a law firm that represented his political opponent. At a hearing, a top DOJ official told the judge that courts could not second guess decisions made by the president, in the name of national security, to revoke lawyers' security clearances or take other actions that undermine their ability to their jobs.
    


            In response to an inquiry about legal strategy, a Justice Department spokesman said, “This Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend President Trump's agenda and Article II authority in court.”
    


            Ty Cobb, who represented Trump during his first term in the special counsel investigations, said on CNN's “Erin Burnett OutFront” that the Justice Department lawyering in the immigration case before Xinis was filled with “obfuscation and bad faith.”
    


            He added that the bolder Justice Department lawyers become in difficult-to-defend cases, they may lose credibility in court.
    


            “This is the first judge who has so far in the Trump world cases finally abandoned the presumption of regularity that normally attaches to the representations of government lawyers,” Cobb said on Tuesday. “She doesn't believe them. She doesn't trust them.”
    


            In some cases, this administration's actions wouldn't have been approved by legal checks within the executive branch, several former officials say.
    


            One former Justice official, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, pointed to how the administration has ordered restrictions on law firms for political reasons, which multiple judges already have said are unconstitutional.
    


            Those unprecedented executive orders against firms like Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale were unlikely to have been approved by lawyers in the White House counsel's office or the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel under any previous administration of either party.
    


            An executive order signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 dictates how the Justice Department must look at presidential proposals to clear them legally. Historically, administrations use the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to form legal opinions on policies and executive action, and the White House counsel's office also plays a role in examining whether and how president's prerogatives can be done.
    


            “That balance is really out of whack here,” a Biden-era Justice Department official told CNN.
    


            The current administration is “asking a different question” than previous ones internally in their approach to the law, the former employee of multiple administrations said. “It's not, can we do this, but, is anyone going to stop us?”
    


            A federal appellate judge this month, J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who has been on the bench in Richmond, Virginia, since the Reagan administration, sounded this alarm as well in a recent opinion. Wilkinson wrote about President Dwight Eisenhower's willingness to set aside his opinions when the Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of schools in 1955.
    


            “Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around,” Wilkinson wrote. “The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions … We yet cling to the hope that it is not naive to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”
    


            In the case where Perkins Coie is suing over Trump's retaliation, a Justice Department lawyer on Wednesday highlighted another approach in some of the cases, where the administration's lawyers are unprepared and can't or won't give answers to factual questions.
    


            This has both hurt and helped the administration at times, such as in DOGE privacy cases and immigrant deportation battles.
    


            On Wednesday, the Justice Department lawyer, Richard Lawson, sparred for several minutes with federal Judge Beryl Howell over whether there are even written agreements between the administration and some law firms to provide free legal work in line with Trump's priorities, and he couldn't answer whether Perkins Coie would have been spared from an executive order if it had agreed to pledge pro bono work.
    


            “I can't speak to it,” Lawson told the judge repeatedly. “I wasn't coming briefed for the matters outside of Perkins Coie … I just don't have that information.”
    


            Similarly, Justice Department lawyers have struggled to provide answers when judges have asked point-blank questions about who at DOGE was in charge, and the role there of Musk.
    


            And in the immigration cases, administration lawyers have stumbled rather than giving answers on who was involved in setting the controversial immigrant removal policies, and in one case taking several days to muster Cabinet official declarations that some publicly available flight data and other details were so-called “state secrets.”

Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana has scrapped the 0.5% Value Added Tax (VAT) hike that was set to kick in on May 1. VAT will remain at 15%.

The decision to forgo the increase follows extensive consultations with political parties, and careful consideration of the recommendations of the parliamentary committees, the National Treasury confirmed in a statement on Wednesday night.

By not increasing VAT, the estimated revenue will fall short by around R75 billion over the medium-term, his ministry said.

According to Treasury, Godongwana has also written to the Speaker of the National Assembly Thoko Didiza, informing her that he is withdrawing the plan.

It added that Parliament will be requested to adjust expenditure in a manner that ensures that the loss of revenue does not harm South Africa's fiscal sustainability.

”The decision not to increase VAT means that the measures to cushion lower-income households against the potential negative impact of the rate increase now need to be withdrawn and other expenditure decisions revisited.

“To offset the unavoidable expenditure adjustments, any additional revenue collected by SARS may be considered for this purpose going forward,” the statement reads.

However, Godongwana will introduce a revised version of the budget without the VAT increase.

The initial proposal for a VAT hike was motivated by an urgent need to restore the funding of the frontline services that had suffered reductions.

Pakistan has announced the closure of its airspace to all Indian airlines and the suspension of trade with New Delhi with immediate effect, following a National Security Committee meeting in Islamabad on Thursday.

The move comes after New Delhi downgraded diplomatic ties with Islamabad and suspended a treaty on the use of the waters of the Indus River system by the two nations.

“Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance… Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty… will be considered as an Act of War and responded with full force,” Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif's office said in the statement. The treaty contains no provision for unilateral suspension, it noted.

Pakistan's retaliatory measures include the suspension of key bilateral agreements and cross-border links, including the Wagah border post. The statement added that Pakistan's airspace would be closed immediately to all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines. All trade with India, including shipments to and from third countries through Pakistan, was also suspended.

The authorities added that all visas issued to Indian nationals under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) have been suspended. Indian citizens currently in Pakistan under SVES, excluding Sikh pilgrims, have been instructed to leave within 48 hours.

Islamabad further declared India's defense, naval, and air advisers based in the Pakistani capital persona non grata. It also ordered the reduction of staff at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to 30 diplomats and personnel, effective April 30.

The measures mirror those taken by New Delhi on Wednesday. The move came in response to a brutal attack in the India-administered Kashmir region which left 26 people dead – most of them tourists – and injured dozens more. The assault occurred on Tuesday afternoon in Baisaran Valley, a scenic destination in Pahalgam known as a ‘mini Switzerland'. The Resistance Front, a militant group believed to be linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, has reportedly claimed responsibility.

New Delhi said its measures will remain in place “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.”

Islamabad rejected India's allegation that Pakistan was linked to the violence in Kashmir, accusing New Delhi of oppressing the region and its majority-Muslim population.“In the absence of any credible investigation and verifiable evidence, attempts to link the Pahalgam attack with Pakistan are frivolous, devoid of rationality and defeat logic,” the prime minister's office stated.It added that India “must resist the temptation to exploit such tragic incidents to its advantage and take full responsibility for its failure to provide security to the people.”

“India's worn-out narrative of victimhood cannot obfuscate its own culpability in fomenting terrorism on Pakistan's soil, nor can it distract attention from its systematic and state sponsored oppression and human rights violations,” Islamabad added, claiming that it has “incontrovertible proof” of Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan.

Kashmir, a restive region along the India-Pakistan border, has long been a flashpoint between the two countries, with both claiming it as their own. New Delhi has repeatedly accused Islamabad of backing cross-border terrorism, while Islamabad accuses India of committing human rights violations against the region's Muslim-majority population.

Russia has never had any problems with Finland or Sweden joining NATO, but will respond to the expansion of the bloc's military infrastructure as it “deems necessary,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.

Finland abandoned its longstanding policy of neutrality and became a NATO member in April 2023, citing security concerns over the Ukraine conflict. Sweden followed suit in 2024 on the same pretext. In response, Moscow vowed to adjust its defensive posture in northwestern Russia, and stressed that unlike Ukraine, their accession does not pose an existential threat to Russia.

NATO military infrastructure has been “gradually appearing on Finnish territory” in recent years, Peskov said in an interview with French weekly Le Point published on Wednesday.

“How is Russia reacting? It takes measures to improve its security that our military deems necessary,” he stated.

The Kremlin spokesman stressed that Russia never had “any problems” with Finland or Sweden joining NATO and has no intention of launching any attacks. “Fortunately, neither the Baltic countries nor Finland are firing at Russians from tanks and airplanes, in contrast to what has been happening in Donbass since 2014,” Peskov added.

According to a NATO policy update published last month, the bloc is “continuing to integrate NATO's newest members – Finland and Sweden – into plans, forces, and command structures, including by developing a presence in Finland.” The document praised Sweden for assuming the “framework nation role in the enhanced forward presence in Finland.”

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said earlier this month that member states are also “working together” in the Arctic to “defend this part of NATO territory.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the issue at the International Arctic Forum last month, saying Moscow has been “closely monitoring” the region and responding accordingly.

“We are, of course, concerned by the fact that NATO countries as a whole are more frequently designating the far north as a bridgehead for possible conflicts, practicing the use of troops in these conditions, including their new recruits from Finland and Sweden,” Putin said.

He added that Russia has responded “by increasing the combat capabilities of the armed forces and modernizing military infrastructure facilities.”

WASHINGTON, April 24. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has said that he may meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin shortly after his visit to the Middle East in May.

MOSCOW, April 24. /TASS/. Moscow maintains the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of the West's aggression, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu said in an interview with TASS.

""In November 2024, revisions were introduced to the Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence, according to which Russia reserves the right to use nuclear arms in the event of aggression against it or the Republic of Belarus, including with the use of conventional weapons,"" he noted. According to Shoigu, Russia is ""carefully monitoring Europe's military preparations.""

""In accordance with Russia's National Security Strategy, in the event of foreign countries carrying out hostile actions representing a threat to Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, our country considers it legitimate to take appropriate symmetric and asymmetric measures necessary to thwart such actions and prevent them from repeating,"" he reiterated.

According to the official, nuclear deterrence ""is being carried out with regard to countries and military coalitions that consider Russia a potential enemy and possess weapons of mass destruction or conventional armed forces with substantial military capabilities.""

Additionally, such actions also involve countries who provide their territory and resources for preparing and carrying out aggression against Russia.

""The goals of ensuring the integrity of Russia and Belarus' unified defensive space and joint implementation of events on strategic deterrence were enshrined in the Security Concept of the Union State and the Treaty on security guarantees between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus approved in December 2024, which were developed with direct participation of security councils of both countries,"" Shoigu concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Critics fear decision to list Brazil-based firm JBS, long linked to Amazon's deforestation, will add to the climate crisis

Environmental groups are outraged that the world's biggest meatpacking company, JBS, which has long been linked to Amazon's deforestation, has received approval from US authorities to list on the New York Stock Exchange.

The decision, announced on Tuesday by the Securities Exchange Commission, follows reports that JBS subsidiary Pilgrim's was the biggest donor to the inauguration committee of Donald Trump. Since taking power, Trump has reduced the independence of the SEC and other agencies, demanding their work be “controlled” by the president.

The Brazil-based company's shares elsewhere hit a record high on Tuesday when news broke of the SEC ruling on the contentious application, which has been tussled over for several years, and is a joint listing with Amsterdam.

Last week, JBS filed a report to the SEC saying it would hold a general shareholders meeting about the listing on approximately 23 May, and that the first day of trading of its shares in New York could be as early as 12 June.

The joint listing is expected to raise the value of the multinational, which started as a family business and grew globally with the support of Brazil's national development bank. Almost half of its revenue now comes from the United States, where it sells household brands including Pilgrim's, Moy Park, Seara and Primo. It also has a significant presence in Australia and strong sales in Europe and China. The company website boasts: “We feed the world with the best.”

But it has alarmed conservation groups, who fear JBS will use the extra financial resources to expand its market and environmental footprint.

JBS has been linked to deforestation on multiple occasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit last year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. That lawsuit was dismissed in February.

A bipartisan group of 15 US senators had urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS's application for a share listing. “Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,” they wrote in an open letter.

JBS – which is dominated by two brothers from the founding family, Joesley and Wesley Batista – had promised to clean up its supply chain in the Amazon rainforest, but a year-long investigation published last week by the Guardian, Unearthed and Reporter Brasil found widespread scepticism by frontline workers that the company's new cattle tracing system will be ready by the deadline commitment of the end of this year. JBS has told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions of that investigation which it said were drawn from “a limited sample of 30 farmers”, saying it was irresponsible to disregard that JBS has “over 40,000 registered suppliers”.

The company has also had to pay fines or make plea bargains in several high-profile corruption cases in Brazil and the United States.

A recent Federal Election Commission filing revealed JBS subsidiary Pilgrim's made the largest single donation of $5m to Trump's inaugural committee for his second term.

Environment groups linked the listing decision to Trump's executive order for the SEC and other formerly independent regulatory agencies established by Congress to be accountable to the White House. That decree states: “In order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials' accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch … Officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people's elected President.”

Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of the Mighty Earth environmental watchdog group, said: “Given the company's long rap sheet of illegal and corrupt conduct, it's hard to see how the SEC could have confidence that JBS won't deceive US investors. The approval of JBS's IPO shows this is no longer the independent SEC that has upheld honest practices on American markets for nearly a century.”

Others echoed the risks a listing posed to both investors and communities around the world. “By almost every metric, a company like JBS has a detrimental impact on society. Allowing it to list on the world's largest stock exchange – unlocking vast opportunities for expansion and profit – shows the deep failures of the US financial regulatory system. This decision is a disaster for both people and the planet,” said Alexandria Reid of Global Witness, an environmental justice organization.

Greenpeace UK said JBS's plans for global expansion threaten to tip the planet further towards climate chaos. “JBS built its meat empire on a history of corruption, broken promises and environmental destruction, including emissions that would make even fossil fuel companies raise an eyebrow,” campaigner Daniela Montalto, said. “This listing will benefit only the billionaire Batista brothers who sit at the helm of JBS, while ordinary people pick up the tab for climate chaos and environmental destruction that industrial agriculture is driving.”

Asked about the criticism from the green groups, JBS said in a statement: “JBS believes the dual listing presents a compelling opportunity for stakeholders interested in the performance and sustainable growth of the company. The proposal creates value for our team members, the communities where we operate, and investors. We've maintained ongoing disclosures with domestic and foreign investors and partners, who have repeatedly demonstrated their confidence in the credibility and robustness of our policies.

“JBS will continue to partner with farmers, NGOs, universities, customers, and other stakeholders to identify ways to reduce agricultural emissions, combat global food insecurity, and enhance the sustainability of food systems. Agriculture has an essential role to play in the climate change solution, and companies like JBS can and should help lead collective action.”

The company repeated its comment on the investigation published by the Guardian last week about deforestation, saying that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks”.

Asked about the listing on the New York stock exchange, the SEC declined to comment, a spokesperson said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Blaze in Pine Barrens expected to grow before forecast rain as commercial building and some vehicles destroyed

A fast-moving wildfire engulfing part of New Jersey's Pine Barrens has not resulted in any injuries, officials said on Wednesday, though it is expected to grow before forecast rain later this week.

The fire in southern New Jersey's Lacey and Ocean townships has grown to more than 20 sq miles (52sq km) and could continue to burn for days, officials said. No one has been injured so far in the blaze, and 5,000 residents were evacuated but have been permitted to return home. A single commercial building and some vehicles were destroyed in the fire, while 12 structures remained threatened on Wednesday evening.

“This is still a very active fire,” said Shawn LaTourette, the department of environmental protection commissioner. “As we continue to get this under full control the expectation is that the number of acres will grow and will grow in a place that is unpopulated.”

Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in the last two decades, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 sq miles (67sq km).

The Garden State Parkway, one of New Jersey's busiest highways, reopened on Wednesday morning after officials closed a roughly 7-mile (12km) stretch in the southern part of the state.

The acting governor, Tahesha Way, declared a state of emergency early on Wednesday as officials said they had contained about 50% of the wildfire.

Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation, authorities said.

Forest fires are a common occurrence in the Pine Barrens, a 1.1m-acre (445,000-hectare) state and federally protected reserve about the size of the Grand Canyon lying halfway between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. The region, with its quick-draining sandy soil, is in peak forest fire season. The trees are still developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.

It is a vast wilderness in the country's most densely populated state. LaTourette said the fire was straddling an area on the edge of wilderness and residential areas.

“It's the interface where the environment and development meet,” he said.

The area had been under a severe drought until recently, when early spring rains helped dampen the region, but officials cautioned recent low humidity and a dry stretch have heightened the risk of fire.

The Jersey Central Power and Light Company cut power to about 25,000 customers at the request of the forest fire service and the wildfire's command post on Tuesday evening. By late Wednesday afternoon, power had been restored.

On Tuesday, Debi Schaffer was caught in gridlocked traffic after evacuating with her two dogs while her husband agreed to stay with their 22 chickens, the Press of Atlantic City reported.

“I wanted to take them in the car with me; can you imagine 22 chickens in a car?” she told the newspaper.

The area around her Waretown house was “like a war zone”, she said, describing smoke, sirens and the buzz of helicopters.

The site of the fire is near an alpaca farm. The farm said in a Facebook post that the property was not threatened and all of the animals were safe.

The blaze is the second major forest fire in the region in less than a week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

China again biggest jailer of writers in 2024, followed by Iran – with Israel in fifth place, says organisation's annual report

Writers in the US are at growing risk amid a worldwide crackdown on free speech that has begun to spread to countries previously renowned for unfettered expression and openness, according to a leading writers' advocacy group.

PEN America said it was concerned about an emerging threat from the Trump administration as it published its annual Freedom to Write index report, which showed that the number of writers jailed worldwide had jumped for the sixth year running to 375 in 2024, compared with 339 the year before.

Covering a period ending before Donald Trump took office on 20 January, the 35-page report records China as once again the biggest jailer of writers, with 118 behind bars, up from 107. Iran is the second highest incarcerator, with 43, down from 49 a year earlier, although those released had been freed with conditions that forced them into silence.

Israel is in fifth place, with 21 writers behind bars, including eight in administrative detention – statistics at odds with the country's self-proclaimed status as a democracy that tolerates dissent. Other prominent incarcerators are Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, a Nato ally and ostensibly still a democracy under the leadership of its strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

The index has been published for the past six years and has hitherto generally highlighted the dangers faced by writers living under repressive regimes, although Israel also appeared in the previous year's report.

While making no explicit mention of threats to free speech under the US president following a spate of arrests of foreign students who have campaigned for Palestinian rights and accusations of trying to curtail academic freedom, its text clearly hints at the potential for a future clampdown.

“As geopolitics continue to shift and authoritarian tendencies spread to countries that were once considered safely anchored in openness, we are seeing that free expression, and therefore writers, are increasingly in the crosshairs of repression in a much wider range of countries,” says the index.

“[Governments] recognize the power of words to affirm historical truths, give voice to those whose narratives have been excised from the historical ledger, develop or maintain culture, and hold institutions to account … Democracies have been slow to understand that attacks on writers are both the precursor to and a consequence of broader attacks on human rights, democracy, and free expression.”

In an interview, Karin Deutsch Karlekar, PEN America's director of writers, said the comments reflected a fear for writers on the domestic front, saying that the US had not witnessed such a “broad and deep attack on ideas” since the McCarthyite anticommunist witch-hunts of the 1950s.

She cited the case of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in the US on a Fulbright scholarship, who was detained and earmarked for deportation after co-authoring an opinion article criticizing Israel's military offensive in Gaza.

“People are being detained for their ideas and their writing in the US. This is definitely worrying,” she said.

“I would say it's only probably a matter of time when writers that we would include in our database and index in the US being detained as well. I fully expect that next year, we may well have cases in the United States in our index.”

PEN's index generally includes fiction authors, poets, singer-songwriters, online writers and opinion writers, while excluding journalists who write news reports.

Karlekar said the threatening atmosphere – which has seen university authorities pressured to crack down on views perceived as antisemitic – had already led to self-censorship.

“I think, particularly on issues concerning Israel and Palestine over the past year and a half, there has been already a chilling effect,” she said. “Given what's happening with the Trump administration, there may well be more issues that people are afraid to take on.

“If someone is interested in looking at climate issues or transgender issues or women's rights, those are in the crosshairs of the administration [and] there may well be more self-censorship on some of these issues as well.”

Restrictions on free speech in the US were likely to worsen the situation for writers elsewhere, especially if Washington were to retreat from its traditional status as champion of human rights.

“The US has traditionally been a strong supporter of free expression around the world” Karlekar said. “It really helps when governments like the US or Britain speak out about these cases. If the US is really stepping back in terms of its role of defending free expression and being a standard bearer for this issue, that's big blow in terms of global trends and getting writers out of jail in other countries.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Strikes kill 22, reports say

Israeli airstrikes yesterday killed at least 22 people, including a family of six whose home was struck in Gaza City, Gaza rescue teams and medics said. The family — a couple and their four children — were killed when an airstrike leveled their home in northern Gaza City, Gaza's civil defense agency said in a statement. Deaths were also reported in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza and in the southern city of Khan Yunis. Since Israel resumed its military operations last month, at least 1,928 people have been killed in Gaza, raising the total death toll to at least 51,305 since the war began, the health ministry in Gaza said.

Possible China meddling: NSC

The National Security Council (NSC) yesterday said it found indications China is conducting a “state-sponsored” campaign to interfere in next month's mid-term elections. The accusation emerged at a Senate hearing where Senator Francis Tolentino said that Beijing's embassy in Manila was “paying Filipinos to work in troll farms” to undermine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's administration. The May 12 poll will decide hundreds of seats in the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as thousands of hotly contested local positions. NSC Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said his agency believed China was likely behind online attacks aimed at influencing the polls, adding that the agency had identified a list of local proxies known to be amplifying Beijing's messaging.

Cardinal allowed to leave

Outspoken Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen (陳日君) was allowed to leave the territory to attend Pope Francis' funeral in the Vatican City. Zen, a 93-year-old retired bishop, left Hong Kong on Wednesday night after applying at a court to get back his passport, his secretary said in a text message yesterday. Authorities confiscated his passport after his controversial arrest under the Beijing-imposed National Security Law in 2022.

Tooth draws huge crowds

Buddhist devotees flocking to see a sacred tooth yesterday were urged by police to stay clear after hundreds of people fell sick and a woman died. Lines in the city of Kandy were already 10km long to worship what Buddhists believe to be a tooth of the Buddha — a special showing of the relic that will end on Sunday, regional police chief Lalith Pathinayake said. Officials estimated that about 450,000 people yesterday morning had lined up to see the relic, more than double the expected daily number of 200,000. The city's main state-run hospital reported that nearly 300 people had been admitted after falling ill while spending days in cramped conditions. One woman was pronounced dead on admission.

Oasis fans lose ￡2m in scams

Oasis fans wishing to see the reunited band live in concert have collectively lost more than ￡2 million (US$2.7 million) from ticket scams, mostly on Facebook, Lloyds Bank said yesterday. The chaotic scramble for the prized tickets followed the announcement in August last year that brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had ended their infamous 15-year feud and were reuniting for a worldwide tour. Working from figures based on its own customers, “the bank estimates that across the UK there are likely to have been at least 5,000 victims since tickets went on sale, with over ￡2 million lost to fraudsters” — an average of ￡436 per person.

State lawmakers across the US have introduced at least 240 anti-China proposals this year, aiming to ensure public funds do not buy Chinese technology or even T-shirts, coffee mugs and key chains for tourists. They are also targeting sister-city relationships between US and Chinese communities.

After years celebrating trade ties with China, states do not want police to buy Chinese drones, government agencies to use Chinese apps, software or parts, or public pension systems to invest in Chinese companies.

A new Kansas law covers artificial intelligence and medical equipment, while in Arkansas, the targets include sister-city ties and state and local contracts for promotional items. Tennessee prohibits health insurance coverage for organ transplants performed in China or with organs from China.

“Either the United States or China is going to lead the world in the next few decades,” Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said after pushing a wide-ranging “Communist China Defense” package into law. “For me, I want it to be the US.”

The push started well before US President Donald Trump imposed 145 percent tariffs on China, but his posture is encouraging state officials, particularly fellow Republicans.

Anti-China proposals have been introduced this year in at least 41 states, but mostly in Republican-controlled legislatures, an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural showed.

Trump's rhetoric encouraged the push since his first term, said Kyle Jaros, an associate professor of global affairs at the University of Notre Dame who writes about China's relationships with US states.

Then, the COVID-19 pandemic soured American attitudes.

“The first Trump administration had a very different message than the preceding [Barack] Obama administration about state and local engagement with China,” Jaros said. “It tended to not see the value.”

Playing a “patriotism card” against China resonates with US voters, said David Adkins, a former Kansas legislator who is CEO of the nonpartisan Council on State Governments.

“Politicians of both parties, at all levels of government, pay no price for vilifying China,” Adkins said in an e-mail.

John David Minnich, a modern China academic and assistant professor at the London School of Economics, attributed states' measures largely to “targeted, strategic lobbying,” not popular pressure.

Critics see China as more anti-US and authoritarian under Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), and US officials say China has a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem to collect overseas intelligence.

Some state officials also began seeing China as a concrete threat when a Chinese balloon flew over the US in 2023, said Sara Newland, an associate professor of government at Smith College who conducts research with Jaros.

“There is this idea that a Chinese investment is actually going to result in the Chinese government spying on individual people or threatening food security in a particular area,” she said.

Kansas House of Representatives Majority Leader Chris Croft, a retired US Army colonel, said that countering China is a “joint effort” for states and the US government.

He championed a law greatly limiting property ownership within 160km of a military installation in Kansas by firms and people tied to foreign adversaries — China, but also Cuba, Iran and North Korea.

“All of us have a part to play,” he said.

Further limiting foreign property ownership remains popular, with at least 46 proposals in 24 states, but critics liken imposing restrictions to selling snow shovels to Miami residents.

Together, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean and Cuban interests owned less than 1 percent of the nation's 514 million hectares of agricultural land at the end of 2023, a US Department of Agriculture report showed.

Chinese interests' share was about 112,100 hectares, or two-hundredths of 1 percent.

Minnich said that if Trump's tariffs get China to reset relations with the US, that would undercut what states have done, but if Trump seeks “sustained decoupling,” state measures would likely have minimal effects on China in the short term, compared with Trump's policies.

Yet states do not seem likely to stop.

Joras said states have valid concerns about potential Chinese cyberattacks and whether critical infrastructure relies too heavily on Chinese equipment.

“The vast majority of China's threats to the US are in cyberspace,” he said. “Some of those defenses are still not solid.”

Armed with 4,000 eggs and a truckload of sugar and cream, French pastry chefs on Wednesday completed a 121.8m-long strawberry cake that they have claimed is the world's longest ever made.

Youssef El Gatou brought together 20 chefs to make the 1.2 tonne masterpiece that took a week to complete and was set out on tables in an ice rink in the Paris suburb town of Argenteuil for residents to inspect.

The effort overtook a 100.48m-long strawberry cake made in the Italian town of San Mauro Torinese in 2019.

El Gatou's cake also used 350kg of strawberries, 150kg of sugar and 415kg of cream.

To claim the record in the Guinness World Records, the cake had to be at least 8cm wide and 8cm tall.

The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, the chef's wife, Nadia El Gatou, said.

Youssef El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record.

“I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he said.

Residents of Argenteuil who went to see the calorie-packed record-breaker were given a piece to take away.

Ukrainian forces have liberated approximately 16 square kilometers of territory near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in recent weeks, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi said on April 17.

There has been a notable slowdown in Russia's offensive operations after months of steady territorial gains across eastern Ukraine. According to battlefield monitoring group DeepState, Russian troops have captured just 133 square kilometers in March, the lowest monthly total since June 2024.

The recently recaptured territory by Ukrainian troops includes areas near the settlements of Udachne, Kotlyne, and Shevchenko, according to Syrskyi. He made the announcement after a three-day visit to the Operational-Tactical Group Donetsk, which he described as the strongest formation within the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

""Over the course of three days, I visited almost all brigades of this most powerful grouping of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, which bears the brunt of the enemy's spring offensive and destroys its best forces and means,"" Syrskyi said.

According to Syrskyi, Ukrainian forces are halting around 30 Russian assaults daily in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, inflicting significant losses on Russian troops.

During his visit, Syrskyi met with commanders at front-line command posts and reviewed operational plans with Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, commander of the operational-tactical group. He said that on-site problems related to logistics, ammunition supply, and combat organization were being addressed.

Despite continued Russian efforts to push Ukrainian troops out of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and reach the administrative borders of these regions, Syrskyi said those objectives remain unfulfilled.

""We continue our defensive operation, carry out counteroffensive actions, and are achieving certain successes,"" Syrskyi said.

As of late 2024, Russian forces controlled around 60% of Donetsk Oblast and approximately 98.5% of Luhansk Oblast.

Moscow does not fully control any of the four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson – that it illegally claimed to annex in 2022. According to media reports, including from The Moscow Times, Russia is seeking full control over these regions in the negotiations on ending the war with the United States, which started in March 2025.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

A team of Polish and Ukrainian researchers on April 24 began exhuming Polish victims of the World War II-era Volyn massacres in what is today western Ukraine, the Polish media reported.

Forensic experts, archeologists, and geneticists began their work at 9 a.m. local time at the site of the destroyed Puzhnyky (Puzniki in Polish) village in Ternopil Oblast.

This is the first such exhumation since 2017, when Ukraine imposed a moratorium in response to the destruction of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland.

The Volyn massacres, which peaked in 1943-1944, took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. UPA members killed tens of thousands of Poles, while thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.

The massacre represents one of the most painful chapters of the Polish-Ukrainian history and has continued to strain mutual relations to this day.

UPA fighters are believed to have killed between 50 and 120 Poles in Puzhnyky overnight on Feb. 13, 1945. The settlement no longer exists, and the area has been overgrown with vegetation, but close to 80 victims may remain buried here. 

The research team includes Polish experts from the Freedom and Democracy Foundation, the Pomeranian Medical University, and the Institute of National Remembrance, as well as Ukrainian researchers from the Society of Volyn Antiquities.

Maciej Wrobel, state secretary at the Polish Culture Ministry, told Polsat News that the goal is to identify the victims and ensure dignified burial. He also said that the work is complicated by Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, and warned against possible Russian disinformation operations. 

In recent months, the Polish and Ukrainian governments have made efforts to resolve the issue of the Volyn exhumations, with Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk announcing a ""breakthrough"" in January.

Multiple Polish government and opposition officials have said that Warsaw would block Ukraine's entry into the EU and NATO unless the matter is resolved.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump said there is a ""very good"" chance of a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, he told reporters during an Easter event at the White House on April 21.

""I will be giving you full details over the next three days, but we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia,"" the U.S. president said. ""There is a very good chance (to reach a ceasefire)."" 

The comments follow a report by the Wall Street Journal on April 20 that outlined a U.S. proposal for ending Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. 

According to a document obtained by the outlet, the proposal includes recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and a guarantee that Ukraine would not join NATO — two key Kremlin demands.

The proposals, outlined by senior Trump administration officials in a confidential meeting with Ukrainian and European counterparts in Paris on April 17, were confirmed by Western officials to the publication.

Ukraine's feedback is expected at a follow-up meeting in London later this week. If there is alignment between Kyiv, Washington, and European allies, the proposals could be formally introduced to Moscow.

U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox News on April 20 that ""NATO isn't on the table,"" further confirming that Washington is considering excluding Ukraine's potential accession as part of the peace deal.

Kyiv has consistently said it would not recognize Russia's occupation of any Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. 

The U.S. proposal would mark a dramatic shift from a decade of bipartisan policy in Washington and contradict international law, which considers the 2014 annexation illegal.

Trump has repeatedly urged both sides to reach a deal, warning that he may pull U.S. support from the peace process if negotiations stall. 

""Hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,"" he posted on Truth Social. ""Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune.""

Despite Trump's push for a ceasefire, Moscow rejected a U.S. proposal for a 30-day truce and continues its offensive. On April 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a one-day Easter ceasefire, which President Volodymyr Zelensky said was violated roughly 3,000 times.

Putin has not extended the truce, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 20.

Zelensky has proposed a 30-day ceasefire focused on halting long-range drone and missile strikes against civilian infrastructure. Putin said the Kremlin needs to ""look into"" the proposal.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Ontario's police watchdog says a 30-year-old man was shot dead by police at Toronto Pearson International Airport Thursday morning.

The Special Investigations Unit says three officers fired at the man outside the departures level at Terminal 1.

Peel Regional Police said a man was shot in a “police-involved shooting” at Terminal 1 and the officer was not injured.

Kristy Denette, a spokeswoman for the SIU, said in a statement, “There in no threat to the public.” 

Police said it was an isolated incident. 

Peel Regional Police officers began investigating a man in distress in an SUV a little before 7 a.m., the SIU said in a press release. After officers located the man, he produced a firearm. Officers then fired at the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

At around 11 a.m., a yellow tarp covered a body on the ground, next to a grey SUV, with more than a dozen police vehicles nearby. There were evidence markers scattered around the scene and yellow police tape draped over the front wheel of an empty First Students school bus that was parked nearby. 

The roadway to the Terminal 1 Departures is currently closed but the parking garage remains open, according to a post on X by Toronto Pearson.

The airport said due to the investigation outside its departures level, it is rerouting passengers to enter and exit Terminal 1 through the arrivals area.

The SIU has assigned six investigators and three forensic investigators to the case. An SIU van has arrived on the scene. 

Peel Regional police say to expect delays at the airport.

A shopper browses phone accessories at a mall in Toronto on April 23.Cole Burston/The Globe and Mail

Consumers on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border are bracing for blowback from potential American tariffs on electronics and their components alongside existing levies on Chinese imports.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday showed signs of backpedalling on his threats in the global trade war. If he doesn't, however, shoppers can expect the price of smartphones, gaming devices, rice cookers, washing machines and a host of tech gadgets to rise, likely within months.

But that doesn't mean now is the time to buy the coveted electronics on your wish list.

Here's what you need to know.

More than 90 per cent of the world's iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and other Apple products are made in China. According to the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, Taiwan produces more than 60 per cent of the globe's semiconductors – used in everything from rice cookers to smartphones – while a 2023 U.S. International Trade Commission working paper found that about 92 per cent of advanced chip manufacturing capacity is located on the island.

Earlier this month, Mr. Trump exempted a range of electronics and key components used to make them from so-called reciprocal tariffs of as much as 145 per cent on China and baseline tariffs on other Asian countries. The U.S. maintains a 20-per-cent “fentanyl tariff” on China.

Electronics were exempted just as U.S. tech stocks plummeted, with shares of Apple taking a 9-per-cent nose dive in the two preceding weeks.

But last week, Mr. Trump suggested smartphones and other tech gadgets would be targeted in a forthcoming sector-specific suite of tariffs focused around the semiconductor industry.

His administration launched an investigation on the effect of imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and derivative products (think digital cameras and cars) on U.S. national security. 

The investigation may ultimately lead to the imposition of U.S. tariffs or quotas on some or all products under investigation. 

If tariffs are imposed on semiconductors or other components and equipment needed to manufacture electronics, the increased costs borne by importers will almost definitely cascade through the supply chain, said Sylvain Golsse, national global trade leader at EY Canada.

Semiconductors conduct the flow of electric current in microchips, which power iPhones, Androids, rice cookers, air conditioners, cameras, LED light bulbs, EVs, refrigerators and washing machines – even rocket ships. 

“If the price of a chip increases because new tariffs need to be paid, any intermediate components powered by the chip will become more expensive and, ultimately, the finished good purchased in a store,” Mr. Golsse said.

The most recent projections out of the U.S. after Mr. Trump's introduction of a 54-per-cent cumulative tariff on China pegged the price hike for an iPhone at 43 per cent. According to analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, this would mean the cost of a basic iPhone 16 model currently priced at around US$799 would spike to US$1,142. The cost of a MacBook and AirPods were estimated to rise 39 per cent.

The calculations hinge on whether Apple passes that cost on to consumers. 

Canadians will likely bear some of the brunt of U.S. tariffs on tech products and the resulting price increases on U.S.-imported goods. 

“Supply chains are globalized, so you'd expect to see ripple effects,” said Jenna Jacobson, an associate professor at Toronto Metropolitan University focused on retail.

Major electronics companies will need to brace for overall added costs and uncertainty. And it can be easier for multinational companies to raise prices slightly across the board to reduce costs, instead of unilaterally, according to Jean-Luc Geha, associate director at the HEC Montréal Sales Institute.

“Once prices for items like tech go up, they usually don't go down unless obsolescence or competition force them to do so,” he said.

The cost to repair everything from smartphones to laptops might also go up as components become more expensive. 

Tech accessories are likely to become pricier as well: China-based Anker, one of Amazon's largest sellers of gadgets such as power banks and phone cases, raised prices by 18 per cent on average on a fifth of its products sold on Amazon.

A current investigation into semiconductor imports issued by the Trump administration gave 270 days to publish its findings. But it's possible the investigation is completed before the deadline.

Experts say it's unlikely semi-conductor-specific tariff-related price hikes would be introduced before new semiconductor levies are actually implemented. 

But consumers in Canada and elsewhere purchasing technology products might still notice higher prices within the next few months as a result of businesses managing significant uncertainty stemming from impactful and fast-changing trade and tariff developments, Mr. Golsse said.

Even if the Trump administration slapped tariffs on tech gadgets tomorrow, experts say it would likely take a few months for price hikes to trickle down to the retail level.

“There's typically some lag … between the announcement and the enforcement, so that would give consumers some time to make decisions,” Dr. Jacobson said. Retailers will also often go through existing inventory before raising prices.

“Sales drive people to stores to buy things, often in cases that they don't need it – just because it's on sale,” said Adam Chapman, a London-based certified financial planner. “We have the reverse thing happening right now where they're anticipating higher prices in the future. … It feels like all of a sudden, it's cheaper than it will ever be.”

Good savers in particular may be susceptible to panic-buying as they love a deal, he said.

But sales aren't always a good reason to buy. Instead, Mr. Chapman recommends buying quality products – even if they're more expensive – from the start, and using them for as long as they last: “There's a lot of people that have iPhones that are six years old and they still work.”

He added that this argument also works in reverse: If your phone is on its last legs, you should buy the premium product now instead of skimping later.

The US president has ordered a review of US-funded international organizations, which he claims unfairly benefit other nations. As the IMF and World Bank hold their Spring summits this week, are their futures secure?

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank rarely capture headlines outside periods of significant upheaval. A Google search for debt-laden Argentina, for instance, is as likely to bring up articles about IMF loans as it is to celebrate Lionel Messi's latest football triumph.

The IMF's latest $20 billion (€17.4 billion) debt relief for Argentina, its largest debtor nation, was announced last week to help libertarian President Javier Milei continue reforming the South American country's economy after decades of wasteful spending.

However, the World Bank's work tends to fly under the radar. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it quietly delivered $170 billion in loans and grants to over 100 countries, according to its website, reaching some 70% of the world's population.

As the IMF and World Bank convene for their Spring Meetings in Washington, DC, from Thursday, they face significant uncertainty. First, US President Donald Trump's tariff policy is threatening to derail global economic growth. Second, the future of the United States backing of these organizations is up for question.

Speculation has been rife since Project 2025, a hard-right Republican policy framework tied to Trump's second term, proposed a US withdrawal from both institutions, labeling them ""expensive middlemen"" that redirect US funds globally.

Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization, coupled with an order in February to review all US-funded international organizations within 180 days, has further fueled concerns about the US's future involvement in the IMF and World Bank. The White House has yet to name executive directors to both bodies, signaling a deliberate pause in engagement.

The US has, however, reaped substantial benefits from these institutions, both economically and through soft power projection. With the largest voting share in both the IMF and World Bank, the US has effective veto power over major decisions. Loans to indebted nations often come with conditions like market liberalization that align with US interests.

Robert Wade, a professor of political economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), thinks a US withdrawal would have serious implications for its global standing.

""Successive US administrations and Congress have long operated as if the World Bank and IMF were agents or arms of the US state,"" Wade told DW. ""In one way or another, Washington exercises a great deal of influence over their policies.""

Trump's century-high tariffs, announced earlier this month, created significant uncertainty in the global economy, with stock markets selling off sharply. Critics now fear an inward-looking Trump administration could unravel the entire post-Bretton Woods global financial system, which supports trade and stability through floating exchange rates, the US dollar's dominance and institutions like the IMF and World Bank.

""The Trump administration does not have a coherent position about reforms to the World Bank, IMF, or any other international institution,"" Constantin Gurdgiev, an associate professor of finance at the University of Northern Colorado, told DW. ""This is a transactional populist, inwardly focused agenda of scoring quick wins at the expense of the international system."" 

Any US withdrawal may create an immediate liquidity crisis for the IMF and World Bank, whose combined $1.5 trillion in resources depend heavily on US contributions. Gurdgiev forecast a ""significant impact"" on their ability to fund effective responses to future crises and said a US pullout would be a strategic gift to China, which has already invested heavily to expand its global influence.

""Both institutions are extremely cost-effective for the US and help it to deliver on its longer-term agenda of pairing the risks from countries like China,"" Gurdgiev said.

A tally by Boston University's Global Development Policy Center estimates that China made nearly $500 billion in loan commitments to 100 countries between 2008 and 2021. With a weakened IMF or World Bank, countries in debt distress or seeking infrastructure funding may increasingly turn to China's institutions, amplifying Beijing's geopolitical leverage.

In 2015, China and other BRICS nations of the Global South launched the New Development Bank (NDB), often seen as a rival to the World Bank. The NDB offers loans with fewer conditions and promotes lending in non-dollar currencies, challenging Western financial dominance.

A US exit would also prompt the relocation of the IMF and World Bank's headquarters from Washington, DC, potentially to Japan, the second-largest backer. Wade notes that China, underrepresented in voting shares (6.1% in the IMF), would fiercely oppose this.

""Trump could argue, 'Increase your funding, and you'll gain a larger vote share,'"" Wade said of the US president's possible negotiation tactic. ""It's more likely that the US would make at least a serious threat to leave the World Bank [rather than the IMF].""

While regional banks like the Asian Development Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank could partially fill the World Bank's role, alternatives to the IMF are scarce. BRICS efforts to create an IMF counterpart have stalled.

Gurdgiev argues that Trump is looking to the IMF and World Bank to be ""cheerleaders"" for his high-tariff, America First policy agenda and sees Washington making moves to curb China and other BRICS nations' influence in both organizations.

""But those institutions have enough intellectual integrity to understand how dangerous these policies are to both the US and global economy,"" he added.

Indeed, there are growing concerns that Trump's aggressive trade policies, if fully enacted and retaliated against, have the potential to trigger a major global financial crisis. The IMF is due to lower its growth forecast for dozens of countries on Tuesday as the choking of global trade puts pressure on the debt burdens of many nations.

""The global financial situation now is very fragile and could easily tip into a financial crisis,"" warned Wade, the political economy professor. He predicted that Trump would be forced to ""pull back"" from any talk about leaving the IMF and World Bank ""if clear signs of a debt crisis emerge.""

Gurdgiev, meanwhile, warns that a lack of engagement by Washington in both institutions only adds to the current pessimism about Trump's economic policies and the US's future role in global affairs. This precariousness, he believes, could create a systemic crisis at a time when both the IMF and World Bank are severely weakened. 

""We are neutering the ability of institutions that act as a lender of last resort to do their jobs,"" Gurdgiev, who is also a visiting professor at Trinity College Dublin, warned. ""It's a complete and utter nonsense.""

India says it will shut a key land border with Pakistan and stall a water-sharing treaty as part of a round of punitive measures. It cited ""cross-border linkages"" to the worst attack on civilians in Kashmir in years.

India's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said it would suspend a key water-sharing treaty with Pakistan and close a key border crossing as part of a suite of diplomatic measures against its neighbor. 

New Delhi said Islamabad needed to end ""cross-border terrorism"" after an attack in the Kashmir region killed 26 civilians.

World leaders condemned the violence that followed after gunmen opened fire on tourists near the picturesque town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmirin the region's worst attack on civilians in years.

Foreign Minister Vikram Misri said ""cross-border linkages"" to the attack had been revealed in a security cabinet meeting, before citing a raft of measures that India would be taking against Pakistan.

The minister said the Indus Water Treaty would be halted with immediate effect.

""The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect, until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism"", Misri told reporters.

Pakistan is heavily dependent on the water from the Indus River and its tributaries for agriculture and drinking water. The treaty's suspension could mean Pakistan faces severe water shortages.

Misri also said India would close the mainland border,  at Attari-Wagah,  ""with immediate effect.""

Pakistan relies heavily on the Attari-Wagah crossing for trade and is more dependent on it than India.

Meanwhile, he said, Pakistani nationals would not be allowed to travel to India under a regional visa exemption scheme — and that Pakistani nationals in India traveling as part of it had 48 hours to leave the country.

Misri said there would be diplomatic consequences with defense advisors to the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi being declared persona non grata and having a week to leave India. India would be withdrawing its advisors from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, he added.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would hold a meeting of the National Security Committee on Thursday to respond to India's statement.

The committee of senior civil and military officials is summoned in cases of external threats or major terror attacks.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cut short his trip to Saudi Arabia and returned to New Delhi on Wednesday following the attack for a meeting of the cabinet security council.

Security in the region has been beefed up since Tuesday's attack, which targeted civilians, resulting in the death of at least 26 people, with another 17 injured, in what appears to be the worst civilian attack in years.

A spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said his country was concerned about the loss of lives in the region, adding it wished the injured a speedy recovery.

Nevertheless, the violence has raised the threat of increased tensions between India and Pakistan, with many fingers pointed at Pakistan for the ongoing conflict in Kashmir.

Tuesday's attack drew widespread condemnation and came at a time when US Vice President JD Vance was visiting India on a four-day trip.

US President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were among the leaders who expressed support to the Indian people.

The violence was one of the deadliest episodes in a long history of conflict in the disputed region that is divided principally between India and Pakistan. 

Modi was briefed by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar upon his arrival at the airport, according to local reports.

Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, part of the body responsible for domestic affairs, also cut short her trip to the US and Peru.

Interior Minister Amit Shah met with family members of those who were killed and injured in the attack in the nearby city of Srinagar.

Meanwhile, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh vowed to ""not only trace those who perpetrated the attack but also trace those who conspired to commit this nefarious act on our soil.""

Tens of thousands of security forces were deployed to patrol the region and set up additional checkpoints, as former militants were brought in for questioning.

Cars were searched at checkpoints, as the military and police carried out missions to locate the attackers.

The Resistance Front (TRF), an affiliate of the banned terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, according to local reports.

The TRF group reportedly formed after the Modi government scrapped the special status that granted special privileges to the people of the former state of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.

The assault on civilians on Tuesday has been described as a ""terror attack"" by Indian officials, with the region's top elected official, Omar Abdullah, posting to social media that the assault ""is much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years.""

The suspected terror attack came as a shock as the picturesque Himalayan region has been relatively safe for civilians during the decades-long conflict.

The number of domestic tourists visiting Kashmir, officially called the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, has increased in recent years.

The last major assault in the region took place in 2019, when a suicide bomber killed 40 members of Indian security forces.

A major earthquake with dozens of aftershocks caused panic in Istanbul. The quake hit at noon during a public holiday.

Turkey's largest city Istanbul was hit by a magnitude 6.2 earthquake on Wednesday, leaving at least 151 people injured. 

The office of Istanbul's governor said most of the injuries were a result of people trying to jump from buildings, adding that ""their treatments are ongoing in hospitals, and they are not in life-threatening condition.""

According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers (about 6 miles).

The quake's epicenter was located about 40 kilometers southwest of Istanbul, in the Sea of Marmara, but it was still felt strongly in Istanbul.

DW correspondent Julia Hahn witnessed ""shock and panic"" among many Istanbul residents. 

""We saw people leaving buildings and gathering outside in the open air. The fear is very understandable because Turkey is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries,"" Hahn added.

""Istanbul was affected by a powerful quake in 1999. In 2023, two massive tremors devastated large parts of southeastern Turkey. This is on people's minds,"" Hahn added.

""This is the risk we live within this city, this is part of life here in Turkey, unfortunately,"" she said.

Panicked residents rushed from homes and buildings into the streets and into the city's parks, many shell-shocked by the quake.

Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the quake, which started at 12:49 pm local time (9:49 UTC/GMT), lasted some 13 seconds and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks.

The quake hit the city during a public holiday, the National Sovereignty and Children's Day.

Children were out of schools and families out and about on the streets when the quake hit.

""Thank God, there does not seem to be any problems for now,"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during an event marking the holiday. ""May God protect our country and our people from all kinds of calamities, disasters, accidents and troubles.""

The tremor was felt in the neighboring provinces of Tekirdag, Yalova, Bursa and Balikesir and in the city of Izmir, some 550 kilometers south of Istanbul.

American electric vehicle sales have continued to inch up, from 7 per cent of new cars sold last year to 7.5 per cent this year. But no one now expects that they will reach the more than 50 per cent mandated by the Biden administration by 2032. President Donald Trump has upended the EV landscape – sending shockwaves through the industry that are reverberating not just in the United States, but globally.

During the campaign, candidate Trump was consistent in his determination to restore to Americans the right to buy whatever car they want. At a 2024 campaign rally in Waco, Texas, he said: “We are a nation whose leaders are demanding all electric cars, even though they can't go far, cost too much, and whose batteries are produced in China with materials only available in China, when an unlimited amount of gasoline is available inexpensively in the United States of America, but is not available in China.”

He hasn't wasted any time in putting in place a five-pronged approach to make his policy a reality.

First, on Jan 20, in an executive order entitled “Unleashing America Energy”, the president removed the requirement, put in place by Biden-era Transportation Department and Environmental Protection Agency regulations, for car companies to sell a certain share of vehicles that are battery-powered electric, effectively cancelling the mandate.

Second, Trump pledged in the same executive order to consider cancelling the $7,500 tax credit to buy EVs. The credit, signed into law by Joe Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, would have cost $105.7 billion over the next 10 years.

Third, Trump paused producer tax credits for clean energy, including advanced battery technology, estimated to cost between $30 billion and $200 billion over the next decade.

Fourth, President Trump's transportation department is suspending billions allocated to build electric charging stations all over the country. These charging stations were supposed to overcome the main disadvantage of EVs: that drivers might run out of range before they found somewhere to recharge their vehicle.

Fifth, President Trump pledged to end “state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles,” such as California's clean car regulations. The transportation department and the Environmental Protection Agency are working together to roll back state waivers.

The effects of Trump's policies are being felt domestically, as car companies quietly drop their Biden-era plans to go all-electric. Assaults against Toyota for insisting that it would sell any car that its customers wanted to buy have stopped.

But the consequences of the president's agenda are set to be wider than that.

The European Union can surely no longer ignore the costs of banning new gas-powered car sales by 2035. The EU is still allowing Chinese companies to sell low-priced electric cars into its market, admittedly with tariffs of 17 to 38 per cent, while some analysts have suggested that the German car industry could lose as many as 400,000 of its 800,000 jobs over the next decade.

In the UK, Labour politicians are partially backtracking on Conservative promises to require 80 per cent of new cars sold to be electric by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035, introducing a number of new exemptions. Aston Martin, which scheduled its first EV for 2026, has postponed the new model until later this decade.

Just as President Reagan's 1986 tax cuts forced other countries to lower their taxes to keep up, President Trump's common-sense attitude towards gasoline-powered cars is likely to throw a spanner in the works for European EV plans.

Rolling back mandatory EVs also increases pressure on China, which produces over three-quarters of global EV batteries. At the same time as he's liberating drivers, President Trump is casting a blow at the Chinese economy.

The automotive industry wants predictability. It is grappling with the practicalities of transitioning to electric vehicles within a myriad of different national laws. The complexity of producing EVs at a price that average households can afford, while holding off Chinese imports and preserving domestic auto industries, presents a formidable challenge for political and business leaders alike.

But the heart of the matter is that drivers should have a choice over which car to buy, based on their own preferences and needs. People do not want to be dictated to by governments, hence the rise of Right-wing politicians across Europe who have promised liberation from environmental regulations. America is about to become an even more powerful example of the advantages of leaving car purchases to consumer choice.

President Trump has said that he doesn't want to take away Americans' choice of vehicles — and he's standing up for drivers in other countries too by hitting the brakes on the EV mandate.

The Interior Department said new permitting measures would “take a multi-year process down to just 28 days at most.”

The Trump administration announced late Wednesday that it is moving to implement new permitting procedures designed to speed up reviews and approvals of oil and gas development, a plan that environmentalists called an attack on the public's right to weigh in on projects that would directly impact communities across the United States.

The U.S. Department of the Interior, led by billionaire oil industry ally Doug Burgum, said the new permitting measures would “take a multi-year process down to just 28 days at most,” citing President Donald Trump's declaration of a “national energy emergency” at the start of his second term.

“In response, the Department will utilize emergency authorities under existing regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act,” the agency said.

The expedited permitting procedures will apply to crude oil, fracked gas, coal, and other energy sources favored by the president, according to the Interior Department.

Notably absent from Interior's list are wind and solar, which accounted for a record 17% of U.S. electricity generation last year. As it has moved to boost the fossil fuel industry — the primary driver of the global climate emergency — the Trump administration has canceled grants and halted construction for renewable energy projects.

Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International, said in a statement that the Interior Department's announcement of accelerated permitting procedures for dirty energy “is an attempt to silence the public's voice in decision-making, taking away tools that ensure our communities have a say in the fossil fuel project proposals that threaten our water, land, and public health.”

“The announcement is another giveaway to the fossil fuel billionaires who spent millions to put Trump back in the White House, justified by a fake ‘energy emergency,'” said Rees. “The U.S. is the largest oil and gas producer and is expanding extraction faster than any other nation. The real national emergency is the cabal of oil and gas CEOs harming working people and wrecking the climate to line their pockets.”

Alejandro Camacho, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Irvine, wrote on social media that the Trump administration is “once again disregarding the law, environment, and even market data. Ignoring environmental laws to approve dirty projects claiming an energy emergency that does not exist.”

“Meanwhile, he's killing massive private wind power projects,” Camacho added. “Sounds like an emergency to me.”

The permitting announcement comes days after an internal document, leaked on Earth Day, showed that Trump's Interior Department intends to prioritize weakening environmental protections and opening federal lands to fossil fuel extraction.

The department is also “looking at whether to scale back” national monuments, including Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon, Ironwood Forest, Chuckwalla, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Bears Ears, and Grand Staircase-Escalante, The Washington Post reported Thursday.

“Interior Department officials are poring over geological maps to analyze the monuments' potential for mining and oil production and assess whether to revise their boundaries,” according to the Post.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Hold the line and don't give up your rights; what rights you lose today you will not get back, says Maria Ressa.

As the Trump administration goes after universities, law firms and more, some argue that the free press will eventually become a target. Trump's attacks on the press have already begun, with the president filing a number of baseless lawsuits against organizations like ABC and CBS, including a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS over how the network edited an interview with Kamala Harris last year on 60 Minutes. The White House has also banned the Associated Press from covering some presidential events over its refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. “I didn't want to be an activist, but when it's a battle for facts, journalism is activism,” warns Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa, whose new site Rappler faced attacks from former president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.

“I don't feel safe when the government posts my address,” Jennifer Vasquez Sura said in an interview.

The family of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is currently imprisoned in El Salvador after being errantly deported by the Trump administration, has gone into hiding after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted their home address online.

Jennifer Vasquez Sura, Abrego Garcia's wife, expressed grave fears over her family's safety in an interview with The Washington Post this week. The attention her family has received due to her husband's case is worrying, she said — especially after DHS shared details about the family's whereabouts to millions of social media users.

Earlier this month, the department published a copy of a temporary civil protective order that Vasquez Sura had filed against Abrego Garcia in 2021. That order expired after one month, when Vasquez Sura declined to renew it.

In a statement regarding that action, Vasquez Sura said that she had requested the order out of “caution after a disagreement” the two had at the time. She had filed the request for the order due to her experience with domestic violence in past relationships, she said — and DHS using that record to attack Abrego Garcia's character was out of line.

“No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect,” Vasquez Sura said earlier this month. “That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.”

DHS shared the record on its X account in an attempt to justify Abrego Garcia's deportation. The department failed to block out personal details about Vasquez Sura, including her home address — forcing her and her family to move to a safe house, Vasquez Sura told The Post.

“I don't feel safe when the government posts my address, the house where my family lives, for everyone to see, especially when this case has gone viral and people have all sorts of opinions,” Vasquez Sura said.

DHS has defended its decision to publicize her personal info, telling The Independent that “these are public documents that anyone could get access to” — despite the fact that members of the Trump administration have previously denounced the doxxing of right-wing figures.

The administration, which admitted earlier this year that Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported, has sought to justify continuing his incarceration in El Salvador by baselessly claiming that he is a member of a violent gang, a characterization his family has vehemently denied. The White House has failed to put forward evidence to back their claims, instead sharing photos of Abrego Garcia's hand tattoos and citing the types of hats he wears in an attempt to somehow bolster their case. 

Meanwhile, legal experts have sounded the alarm on Abrego Garcia's deportation, noting that the administration violated his due process rights by denying him the ability to defend himself against the White House's allegations.

President Donald Trump is considering potential tariff exemptions for automakers, a White House official confirmed to The Epoch Times on April 23, following weeks of intense lobbying by industry leaders warning of disruptions to supply chains and rising consumer costs.

Although the official did not provide specifics, the confirmation comes as automakers and suppliers voice growing concerns over the Trump administration's 25 percent tariff on imported passenger vehicles and light trucks—effective April 3—and a similar 25 percent tariff on auto parts set to take effect by May 3.

“Automaking is America's largest manufacturing sector,” Bozzella said. “Automakers, battery makers, and parts suppliers have invested billions in American manufacturing and directly support communities and American workers in Michigan, Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Texas, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, New York, and more.”

He said that higher tariffs would raise costs for consumers, reduce U.S. auto exports, and lower vehicle sales—“all before any new manufacturing or jobs are created in this country.”

Meanwhile, the president said on April 23 that the 25 percent tariff imposed on cars imported from Canada could well increase.

“I put tariffs on Canada—they're paying 25 percent—but that could go up, in terms of cars,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “All we're doing is we're saying, ‘We don't want your cars, in all due respect. We want, really, to make our own cars.'”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

The federal judge overseeing the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant deported to his home country despite a court order, has paused her order demanding details on the U.S. government's efforts to facilitate his return to the United States.

Xinis previously ordered the government to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States. When the government declined to provide details, she ordered officials to file daily updates with the court on its efforts.

The judge had also granted the plaintiff's request for expedited discovery on the matter, including the terms of the agreement the United States reached with the Salvadoran government to house immigrants deported from America.

“For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders,” she wrote in an order.

The government then filed a motion to stay that ruling. It was filed under seal, meaning it is not available to the public.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia filed a sealed response to the motion.

Xinis referenced both sealed filings while entering the pause.

Garcia, who illegally entered the United States in 2011, was arrested in 2019. An immigration judge concluded that evidence showed he was a member of the MS-13 gang. A different immigration judge ordered Garcia deported but also issued a withholding of removal, which prevented the U.S. government from deporting him to his home country.

Garcia continued living in the United States until he was taken into custody by immigration agents on March 12. He was soon deported to El Salvador.

U.S. officials have said that the deportation there was a mistake because the withholding order was not listed on the flight manifest. They have more recently said the deportation was allowed because MS-13 was designated a terrorist group by President Donald Trump. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia say he should not have been deported to El Salvador and that he should be brought back to the United States to be with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and children.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

President Donald Trump praised Elon Musk on April 23 after the SpaceX founder announced he would be stepping back from his time in Washington with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

“I can't speak more highly about any individual,” Trump told reporters. ”He's an incredibly brilliant guy. He's a wonderful person.”

As a special government employee, Musk has fewer than 130 days to work with the administration, as stated in Trump's January executive order. He announced on April 22 that he would be taking a step back from his work in Washington to spend more time running his electric car company, Tesla.

“Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done,” Musk said during a call with investors.

The company has taken several hits recently, including a drop in stock price, a decline in car sales, and cars and dealerships becoming a target for protests, vandalism, and arson incidents. Musk previously said that his work with the Trump administration to audit federal agencies and reduce wasteful government spending caused those hits.

“What [protesters and vandals are] trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla, I guess, to you know … stop doing this,” he said.

“These were sick people that thought they were doing something,” Trump said, adding that Musk was a patriot and the damages that befell Tesla never should have happened.

“He loves the country,” Trump said of Musk. “He didn't need to do this. He did it. And I told him, I said, you know, whenever you're ready, I'd like to keep him for a long time, but whenever you're ready.”

Musk said he is not stepping away from DOGE completely, adding during his call with investors that he would continue “to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back.”

“Automatic status updates and a user-friendly interface will empower federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal agencies to prevent non-citizens from exploiting taxpayer benefits or voting illegally.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

In the weeks since the explosive revelation that top U.S. officials inadvertently shared attack plans in Yemen with a journalist on a Signal group chat, fresh questions about the Trump administration's lax approach to digital security have continued to emerge. On April 20, The New York Times reported that the security breach is even worse than initially understood: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had also shared many of the same details about the imminent U.S. bombing strike in Yemen in a second group chat with several family members, a personal lawyer, and others, using his private phone.

The fiasco now known as SignalGate raises many urgent issues related to national security. Communicating classified information via nonapproved channels potentially violates the U.S. Espionage Act, setting messages to automatically disappear contravenes U.S. federal laws on preservation of official records, and officials' family members and journalists should certainly not be privy to this kind of information. These are huge lapses. But by focusing on National Security Adviser Mike Waltz's unwitting inclusion of The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the first chat group, much of the debate has downplayed an even larger problem: the very real possibility that a foreign government or other hostile power was snooping on the devices through which those communications were taking place.

Convened by Waltz, the first Signal group included not only the defense secretary but also CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Vice President JD Vance, White House adviser Stephen Miller, and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, among others. Every one of these figures is an extremely high-value target for foreign espionage. Moreover, at least some of the participants were communicating on personal electronic devices (as was the defense secretary, and at least some of the participants, in his second group chat), and several were traveling overseas at the time. Witkoff, for instance, was in Moscow (although he denies using a personal device during that leg of the trip), while Gabbard was in Southeast Asia. It is highly likely that one or more of the participants' devices was already being targeted by a U.S. adversary armed with advanced spyware capabilities. And the compromise of just one phone is all it takes. One weak link and all of the chat groups' discussions could be exposed.

These episodes point to a looming digital security crisis. Even as high-level officials, for convenience or other reasons, rely more on personal devices for sensitive communications, those devices have become increasingly vulnerable to targeted exploitation and surveillance. Once a device is compromised, hostile regimes and other malicious actors can spy on communications regardless of whether the information in question is encrypted. Thankfully, there are steps that the United States and other governments can take to mitigate this risk. But to do so, they must first recognize the real problem with SignalGate: how exposed sensitive communications and private information have become for anyone reliant on a modern smartphone.

It is important to clarify that the security failures at the heart of SignalGate were not related to potential weak points in Signal itself. Signal is the gold standard of secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging and employs the highest standard of cryptography. Its codebase is open source and widely peer reviewed. For all these reasons, many government agencies, such the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, now recommend using Signal for nonclassified communications.

But that does not mean that Signal or any other app is appropriate for discussing highly sensitive plans about imminent military operations on regular, unsecured personal devices. Governments, including the United States, have developed very strict procedures for handling classified information. They require personnel to use tightly managed “work” devices to which access is strictly limited, even within the national security hierarchy. Many governments also create protocols to ensure that officials' discussion of classified information is restricted to sensitive compartmented information facilities, known as SCIFs, which are structurally designed to prevent outside eavesdropping, guarded by sentries and other access controls, whether inside an agency's headquarters, in mobile situations (such as in vehicles or aircraft), or in foreign embassies.

By using Signal to discuss U.S. plans for bombing Yemen, Waltz and the other 18 members of the “Houthi PC Small Group” were effectively trying to create a do-it-yourself SCIF. According to The New York Times, the information that Hegseth shared on the two group chats, including “the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen,” originated from a secure government system at the U.S. military's Central Command, a system designed for handling classified information. As is now clear, sharing this information proved far from secure. Many of the participants presumably connected to Signal on their personal devices, as evidenced by the fact that Waltz had a journalist in his contact list and Hegseth set up his group, which included his brother, his lawyer, and his wife, before being appointed Pentagon chief. Given strict access controls that are typically implemented on devices cleared for classified communications, it is likely that many of the other senior government officials who were members of these groups were using their personal phones to connect, as well. In doing so, the Signal group members exposed the Pentagon, and the United States itself, to a slew of sophisticated digital security risks.

Ever since the advent of the smartphone, governments have developed capabilities to surreptitiously hack into those devices. As I described in a 2022 Foreign Affairs essay, “The Autocrat in Your iPhone,” for many intelligence services, smartphones are irresistible targets: not only do users tend to organize their communications, contacts, financial activities, and general digital presence around their personal phones, they tend to carry them wherever they go. Moreover, efforts to make messaging apps more secure have paradoxically fueled even more invasive forms of surveillance.

Traditionally, governments sought to eavesdrop on individuals by gathering data directly from the telecommunications or Internet service providers' networks through which their communications passed. But beginning around 2013, following the Edward Snowden disclosures about U.S. government surveillance programs, robust encryption protocols began to spread to ordinary consumer communications, and users began to adopt secure applications such as Signal. That rendered the old approach less productive, pushing intelligence and law enforcement to seek ways to get inside devices themselves. Rather than try to crack advanced encryption protocols, why not find access to the unencrypted end of an end-to-end encrypted communication? To acquire the necessary technology, they turned to a growing number of private mercenary firms, such as NSO Group, a notorious Israeli firm that has over the past decade sold its spyware technology to governments around the world. Mercenary spyware firms employ highly skilled engineers to either develop in-house or purchase software vulnerabilities from gray market firms, known as exploits or zero days, of which manufacturers of consumer devices and applications are not yet aware. They or their clients then use those exploits to hack into the target's personal phones.

The most advanced phone-hacking technology sold by mercenary firms requires no target interaction and leaves no indication that the device has been tampered with. The technology does not require targets to click on a link or download an attachment in order to trigger an infection. Instead, it takes advantage of flaws in hardware, operating systems, or apps to gain silent access to the inner workings of a device, allowing attackers to then implant their spyware surreptitiously. If the attack is successful, targets are unaware that anything about their device has been compromised and simply continue using it, but now with someone peering over their shoulder.



At their most sophisticated, tools such as NSO's Pegasus can then offer a “god's-eye view” of a target's entire life. Once inside a device, a remote operator can turn on the camera, activate the microphone, and track the location of the device's owner. The operator can look back in time, too, scrolling through camera rolls or observing previous communications to gather information on a target's personal relationships and past activities. Most important, with this surreptitious access to the device itself, they can read messages that are end-to-end encrypted. When spyware firms boast that they can “crack” Signal, what they really mean is that they can compromise a device on which Signal is loaded.

Consider the case of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist who was executed in a Saudi consulate in Turkey in 2018. Before his execution, Khashoggi had been communicating for months with the exiled Saudi activist and Canadian permanent resident Omar Abdulaziz over what they assumed was a secure, end-to-end encrypted app. But research by the Citizen Lab, the research team I direct that specializes in investigating digital threats, revealed that Abdulaziz's phone had been hacked with Pegasus, rendering both sides of the conversation completely transparent to Saudi operatives.

This mercenary spyware industry is almost entirely unregulated, and over the last decade and a half, security agencies around the world have used its wares to go on an unbridled hacking spree. Along with other groups, Citizen Lab has shown how spyware such as Pegasus has been used by governments in multiple countries to hack into the devices of political opposition members, activists, investigative journalists, and government officials themselves. Although authoritarian regimes are the most prolific abusers of such technology, our research has uncovered domestic espionage and abuse of spyware in the West, as well, including by the governments of Greece, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland, and Spain.

In principle, senior U.S. government officials' work devices are managed in accordance with NSA standards and may include NSA-developed technology that is resistant to these infections. But privacy regulations justifiably forbid the NSA from checking the personal devices of government officials—a gap in defenses obvious to any adversary armed with mercenary spyware and contemplating where to aim their precious cyber-espionage assets. Rather than try to break into an NSA-secured device, an undertaking that would be technically complex and extremely expensive, they can simply aim at the target's personal phone. Why bother clambering over a wall topped with barbed wire when you can just stroll around it and enter through an unlocked gate? Thus, the personal device of any high-level official presents a juicy opportunity for intelligence gathering—bringing into relief the dangerous risks posed by the Houthi PC Small Group chat.

The risks posed by using personal devices extend well beyond the threat of spyware. Most personal smartphones are loaded with apps whose underlying purpose is to harvest information about their users. Every digital scrap is sucked into a huge data vacuum: a user's location information, WiFi networks, SIM card, and other device identifiers are routinely collected by apps and browsers and fed into a vast data bazaar. Primarily, this data is used for marketing purposes—sold to “big data” firms that target consumers with advertisements. When consumers receive advertisements for a vacation spot shortly after they were casually searching for one online, that's today's personal data surveillance economy at work.

But these properties also lend themselves to a more sinister application. Another mercenary surveillance industry has emerged alongside spyware, known as “advertising intelligence” or ADINT, that packages this type of advertising data on potential targets into intelligence products to help governments spy. One such firm, the U.S.-based Fog Data Science, brags in its marketing materials that it can collect “15 billion location signals each day” from “250 million devices” and “tens of thousands” of mobile apps. It touts that it can provide security agencies with the ability to see all the identifiers associated with every device active in a given location in a given time frame.



Although the scale of the industry is unclear because of secrecy, it is clear from their own advertising that ADINT firms can gather sweeping intelligence on particular targets of interest. Fog Data Science claims that it can track a specific device's location history over months or even years, analyzing patterns to identify what the firm creepily calls a target's “bed-downs.” By fusing data collected from data brokerage firms with other open-source information—including from data breaches circulating on the dark web—these advertising intelligence companies can produce extremely precise dossiers on a person's primary residences, places of employment, known associates and relatives, medical or therapy appointments, religious affiliations, hotel rooms frequented, travel itineraries, and much more.

This kind of information can be supplied to some of the world's most notorious despots, hostile foreign adversaries, or even organized criminal groups with the click of a purchase order. Nothing is currently stopping Iran or China from using front companies to purchase information on the detailed movements and smartphone configurations of U.S. officials or suspected intelligence officers and their families and then acting on that information as they choose.

Experiments undertaken by researchers and journalists have shown how access to these real-time data brokerages can reveal highly sensitive information about high-value government targets, including active U.S. military personnel. To get a sense of just how detailed this information can be, consider how much information journalists could uncover in the open domain about members of the Houthi PC Small Group. Investigations by Wired showed that several members, including Hegseth, Waltz, and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, had left information about their Venmo contacts and transactions either entirely or partially public. Journalists from Der Spiegel used commercially available people-search engines and information from data breaches to reveal passwords, phone numbers, and other information linked to Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Signal, and WhatsApp accounts owned by Gabbard, Hegseth, and Waltz.

ADINT firms can combine such openly available information with advertising data to present a detailed file on almost any target. In the case of the Signal group chats, hostile governments could have used ADINT services to map any of its participants' locations and precise movements and then put them under physical surveillance, perhaps to gain covert access to their phones when an opportunity arises. Or such services could be used to undertake reconnaissance on the make and model of their personal devices, or those of their acquaintances, in order to target those devices for hacking using precision spyware exploits. Such detailed files could include known associates of principal targets and contain highly specific information about their habits, devices, and applications, broadening the number of potential clandestine entry points into a sensitive conversation. (Hegseth's Signal group was reportedly created before his appointment as secretary of defense and at one point included a dozen people “from his personal and professional inner circle.”)

One of the greatest security risks posed by personal devices occurs in a situation when they are most often used: during travel. To connect to the telecommunications network, a cellphone must first communicate with a nearby cellular tower using its built-in radio. Information from the phone's SIM card is sent to the network for authentication. Behind the scenes, a wide variety of systems—base stations, mobile switching centers, and other infrastructure—route calls and data to and from the device. Although a plethora of fine-grained information gathered from domestic cellular networks is routinely accessed by government agencies, it is when a mobile user travels abroad that their devices may be particularly vulnerable.

When subscribers roam on another provider's network, telecommunications companies exchange massive amounts of data every second. Telecom companies can use these signals to retrieve detailed personal information about roaming users, including when a phone number is active on a cellular network, the services they draw on, and their precise location. Access to this international signaling network was once confined to a relatively small club of mostly Western telecommunications firms, and by extension, the state intelligence agencies that colluded with those firms, either informally or through lawful access requests. But a growing number of mercenary surveillance firms have managed to acquire licenses, called global titles, or have found ways to cooperate with existing cellular service providers to enter that club. Once inside, these firms can find someone's exact location, block or slow down their cellular services, or eavesdrop on their calls and texts. They may even be able to intercept two-factor verification codes to hack accounts or surreptitiously transmit spyware.

Many firms now market this kind of surveillance to a growing number of government agencies. A 2020 Citizen Lab report revealed that Circles, a firm that sells signaling surveillance services, had government clients in Botswana, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Serbia, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Another Citizen Lab investigation revealed that between November 2019 and March 2020, millions of malicious signaling requests were sent per month from networks in Saudi Arabia to geolocate the phones of Saudi users when they traveled to the United States.

As noted, several members of the Houthi Signal group were outside the United States while participating in the group's chats. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Canada; Witkoff was in Russia and Azerbaijan during part of the group's discussions. (Witkoff denies communicating on his personal device on those trips, although he has not said whether he was carrying his personal device and whether it was turned on.) Gabbard was on a multicountry trip across Asia, including Thailand. The Royal Thai Army was once a Circles client, and a 2022 Citizen Lab investigation revealed an extensive government espionage campaign targeting Thai pro-democracy protesters and activists, at least 30 of whom had their devices infected with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. It would have been trivial for government clients to acquire the Signal group members' phone numbers or other identifiers and then use malicious roaming messages to covertly track their locations in real time, disrupt their access to messaging platforms, hijack two-factor authentication checks, or inject spyware into their devices should those targets have opened a poorly encrypted website.

Threats to the security of personal devices are made worse by the lack of effective regulation of surveillance vendors. Many of these firms employ the same type of obfuscation techniques as oligarchs and money launderers, making regulation challenging. The result is that dozens of governments and even nonstate actors now possess advanced digital surveillance capabilities that were once limited to only a few great powers and can deploy them largely in the absence of restraints. Were any of the Houthi Signal group members compromised at the time they discussed the Yemen attack plans? Frankly, it would be shocking if they were not.

One can only hope that somewhere, professionals are ensuring that the devices of top U.S. officials are free from mercenary spyware and not being tracked. For the moment, the signs are not encouraging. Instead of launching a full investigation of the security breakdown and holding those responsible to account, the Trump administration has defended the defense secretary's use of the chat groups and continued to downplay their significance. At the same time, the administration has taken steps to weaken or dismantle government offices designed to protect the United States from foreign digital interference and cyberwarfare, shutting down the FBI's foreign influence task force and radically downsizing the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, including those responsible for “red teaming” government systems. And in early April, apparently in response to a demand by the right-wing conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, the president fired the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command—the top U.S. official managing the country's cyberdefenses.



The consequences of this disregard for device security could soon come back to haunt the administration. To be fair, there are no easy fixes. It would be impractical, and possibly illegal in some jurisdictions, to ban government personnel from using personal devices on their own time. And the only way to truly insulate government officials from the growing number of surveillance risks would be for them to completely avoid using personal devices while they travel—another impracticality. Most government officials have found it extremely challenging to properly do their business without using personal devices in one way or another. Yet as of today, these devices—managed and secured at their user's own discretion—remain a huge risk.

To truly address the problem, the United States and other governments will need to take a far more ambitious approach. First and foremost, SignalGate should serve as a wake-up call to rein in the mercenary surveillance industry. Governments should put in place much stronger controls for the sale and use of surveillance technology, including imposing transparency requirements and adding export regulations. Regulators must mandate stronger standards for the telecommunications sector writ large, as the United Kingdom has recently done, and hold telecommunications companies responsible for closing known loopholes in their signaling systems. Legislators must pass stricter privacy laws that prevent the unauthorized and uncontrolled sale of location data, advertising intelligence, and other personal data, and drastically improve oversight across law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Finally, law enforcement and government watchdogs must impose real penalties on those caught flouting government protocols for the handling of classified information.

The SignalGate episode is a terrible failure of operational security. But it is not a one-off mistake. It is a glimpse of a much more far-reaching crisis, one that threatens the United States and every other country that relies on the digital world in making its most important and sensitive decisions.

Over the last decade, calls to reform the Department of Defense have grown ever louder. Everyone, from Congress, which convened a special commission on the urgent need for change, Pentagon officials, who have drafted countless internal reports examining how to improve many aspects of the department's ability to function, and pleading defense industry leaders, seems to agree that things need to be done differently. And no wonder: accelerating technological change is reshaping conflict around the world. China is making historic progress upgrading its military, and Russia has redoubled its military modernization despite massive losses of personnel and equipment in its war on Ukraine. The increasingly turbulent security environment offers regular reminders that taking a business-as-usual approach to investing in the U.S. military is shortsighted.

The latest group to call for a shakeup at the Pentagon is the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is turning its attention toward the Defense Department as its next target for reform. “We welcome DOGE to the Pentagon,” declared U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in February. The group, he said, would bring “actual businesslike efficiency to government.”

But the Pentagon is not a business. Inefficient and rigid though it may be, the military represents a fundamentally different challenge for would-be reformers. Not only does it have a mission—protecting U.S. national security—that is shared by no private corporation, but it also has a workforce unlike any in the private sector. Its governance is different, too: it lacks control over its own budget, organizational structure, and some of its most important strategic decisions. Those differences mean that attempts to make the Pentagon run more like a corporation will backfire. If Hegseth and DOGE continue as they have begun, they will fail to achieve their goals—and harm the U.S. military in the process.

To see why the Defense Department can't be run like a business, just look at its structure. Like all departments and agencies in the executive branch of the U.S. government, it has a large, unwieldy, and often divided board of directors: the U.S. Congress. All 535 members of the House and Senate have, to varying degrees, the authority to shape the direction of the U.S. military. In contrast, Walmart, the largest company in the United States, has 12 directors on its board. And even though the president of the United States is the commander in chief of the armed forces, the most important decision the U.S. military faces—whether to declare war—ultimately lies outside the chain of command, in the hands of Congress. Nowhere in the private sector would a business lack control over its most meaningful decisions.

The same is true of the Pentagon's budget. Not only is it larger than that of any business in the United States; the organization also has little control over it. Each year, the Defense Department conducts a robust, lengthy, and often cumbersome process to determine how it would like to spend its money, ideally in line with the administration's National Defense Strategy. But ultimate control over funding decisions lies in the hands of Congress, whose committees and members rip apart department proposals and reshuffle them according to a wide array of considerations. Sometimes Congress emphasizes a different approach to meeting national security priorities; sometimes its choices are driven more by constituent job concerns. No private business could thrive with such a constrained ability to decide what it wants to purchase when and how.

Worse still, for most of the last decade and a half, Congress has failed to approve these funds promptly. The result has been a series of continuing resolutions and stopgap funding bills that largely renew the previous year's budget but generally prevent the military from making new purchases or shifting investments in line with new strategies. This challenge became even more acute in recent weeks because, for the first time, Congress's inability to agree on the size of the defense budget will force the Pentagon to go an entire fiscal year without a full congressional appropriation. That means that today's military budget is almost exactly the same as last year's—Congress increased it by less than one percent in a feeble attempt to alleviate the impact of this historic spending problem. It is hard to imagine a private sector company declaring a fundamental mismatch between its strategy and budget, and then, after months of deliberations by its board of directors, ultimately failing to meaningfully change its budget. Short-term efforts to move resources around have also been stymied by Congressional restrictions. The Pentagon cannot reprogram more than $15 million without Congressional approval, which prevents it from shifting funds to purchase newly released platforms or to test and evaluate promising systems.



The department's workforce also sets it apart from the business world. Its 3.5 million military and civilian employees make up an institution that is 40 percent larger by headcount than the next largest American employer. Those in uniform have, since 1973, volunteered to serve their country anywhere in the world at any time—and to risk their lives doing so. Approximately half the civilian workforce served in uniform before continuing as public servants. Many have undergone intense, years-long vetting to ensure they can be trusted with valuable classified information to protect U.S. security. And about one in eight of these civilians perform specialized military duties. No private sector workforce anywhere in the country is expected to make these sacrifices. Partly as a result, department hiring is notoriously slow. Given the glacial pace of that process, and in light of the specialized capabilities required of staff, especially the need for high-level security clearances, decisions to fire employees must be made carefully. So far, however, DOGE has been anything but careful. It has focused on firing probationary employees simply because it is easier to fire people based on their status than to assess their work and and push out poor performers. Every organization fires and reassigns personnel, but doing so based on time served rather than performance is shortsighted, particularly if workers later identified as essential cannot be quickly hired back.

Above all, the Defense Department differs from a business in the unique product it provides: security for the American public. The need to wholly focus on national security gives the military a special relationship to risk, one that is incomparable to that of a business. If a company fails, as the overwhelming majority of startups do, investors lose money and people lose their jobs. If the U.S. military fails, people die. The military's singular role in society, to keep Americans safe and to maintain a monopoly of violence on behalf of the state, makes the stakes for risk taking in defense uniquely high. The department's monopoly status also means that effectively executing its vision is invariably more complex than in it would be for a private company. The military cannot avoid risks, but the decision to run them must always be considered far more soberly and carefully than in the corporate world.

Of course, these differences do not mean that the Pentagon should be immune to reform. There is no shortage of serious ideas on how reform can be accomplished. Some of these involve studying and replicating existing successes. For instance, the U.S. Marine Corps has managed for the second straight year to be the only military service to repeatedly pass financial audits while undergoing a massive transformation in line with the changing security environment and the National Defense Strategy. Another positive example comes from U.S. Special Operations Command, which benefits from special acquisition authorities that allow it to get tools in the hands of warfighters more quickly than other combatant commands can.



On the other end of the spectrum, would-be Pentagon reformers should also learn from the military's many other recent failed efforts. Realizing that the Defense Acquisition Guidebook, which ran to nearly 2,000 pages of rules, was cumbersome and unwieldy, Defense Department leaders launched a massive effort to update it. The result, in 2022: the department published 12 new acquisition guidebooks totaling a similar number of pages. The acquisition process remains clunky, and diligent efforts to streamline regulations appear to have achieved little. A real challenge for defense reforms is that the insistent desire for change over the past decade has resulted in a discordant cycle in which new reform initiatives pile up before earlier reforms can be implemented or their impact assessed. The Pentagon's board of directors—Congress—can take some meaningful steps toward reform, as well. Recognizing the harm that endless continuing resolutions do to the military and returning to the regular appropriations process would be a good start. But given that Congress has been unable to break the continuing-resolution cycle, it should consider simply tweaking its most damaging elements by enabling the Defense Department to consistently start new programs and buy new capabilities even without fresh appropriations. (The additional spending flexibility Congress embedded in the latest continuing resolution represents a first step along these lines.)

The Pentagon needs change, but effective reform will require appreciating the uniqueness of the organization. So far, the signs are not encouraging. As Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, put it in March, DOGE's approach has resembled “a kid in a nuclear power plant running around hitting buttons.” At a minimum, DOGE's tactics will fail to achieve much-needed reform in the Defense Department. But at a maximum, these steps could backfire in terrifying ways, as they did at the Department of Energy, where DOGE forced out many employees who handled nuclear materials, before the Trump administration realized just how critical these positions are and rescinded most of the firings.

Those who serve in the military take an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” Without an understanding of the special role played by the U.S. military, outsiders attempting to make it run like a business will fail. And their failures will represent more than a missed opportunity; they will weaken the United States, benefit its adversaries, and poison the well for more thoughtful plans for change in the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘He gets him what he needs': Hegseth's new favorite adviser helped set up Signal on one of secretary's computers at Pentagon","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/politics/hegseth-adviser-signal-computer/index.html","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:32:00 GMT","

Follow:


            Last month, after news broke that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was using Signal to discuss sensitive military operations in violation of Pentagon policy, one of his closest military aides made an unusual inquiry to the Defense Department's chief information officer: Would they grant an exception so Hegseth could keep using Signal freely?
    


            The question came from Col. Ricky Buria, a former aide to previous Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who has rapidly established himself as a key member of Hegseth's inner circle, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN. The Signal inquiry raised eyebrows among other senior Pentagon officials, who wondered whether the request was appropriate — especially from a uniformed officer, rather than Hegseth's civilian chief of staff.
    


            Weeks earlier, before The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had been using the app to discuss detailed military plans, Buria had pushed to get Hegseth an extra desktop computer in his office that he could use Signal on, ostensibly for personal communications so he could more easily text friends and family from the Pentagon, the sources said.
    


            The Secretary's office is considered a secure space, where cell phones are not typically permitted. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency recommends that highly targeted individuals use Signal, but DoD policy says Signal is “NOT authorized to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information.” It notes that requests for exceptions to that policy can be submitted to the chief information officer.
    


            It is not clear whether Hegseth was ever given an exception to use Signal freely, or if he has continued to use it for sensitive military planning in the fallout of the Signalgate episode.
    


            In a statement to CNN, Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, “The Secretary of Defense's use of communications systems and channels is classified. However, we can confirm that the Secretary has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer.”
    


            Parnell did not comment on why Hegseth had another computer set up in his office that Signal was installed on.
    


            Buria, a career Marine with multiple combat deployments who served as both Austin and Hegseth's junior military assistant, has for months been straddling the line between military aide and civilian adviser, the sources said. And last week, he submitted his retirement papers to the Marine Corps, a Marine spokesperson confirmed.
    


            On Thursday morning, Buria was at the Pentagon in civilian clothing and greeted the NATO Secretary General before accompanying him, Hegseth, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon's head of policy into a meeting room.
    


            Buria did not respond to repeated requests for comment about his increasingly influential position in Hegseth's inner circle, including his role in helping to facilitate Hegseth's use of Signal inside the Pentagon.
    


            Buria's plan is to stay at the Pentagon, but as a senior civilian adviser to Hegseth, the sources said. Hegseth is even considering appointing Buria as his new chief of staff, now that his former chief of staff Joe Kasper is moving into a new role at the department, the sources added.
    


            Buria's transition from military assistant to senior adviser was extremely unusual, particularly since he worked so closely with Austin, according to officials that served in the Biden and second Trump administration. And Hegseth moved quickly to root out other “holdover” military officials upon taking office, including former Joint Chiefs Chairman CQ Brown; former Air Force vice chairman Gen. Jim Slife; former Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti; and Jen Short, a three-star general who was appointed senior military assistant under Austin.
    


            Underscoring the trust Hegseth placed in him, Buria, not even a general officer, filled the crucial senior military assistant role on an acting basis, current and former officials said. The SMA, which is a three-star position that requires Senate confirmation, serves as both the chief military point of contact for the secretary and as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's representative to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
    


            The sources all said that Buria's rise appears to largely be a function of how much Hegseth has narrowed his inner circle, as he has become increasingly paranoid about leaks and concerned about being undermined. After firing two of his most senior advisers last week and accusing them of leaking, Hegseth now relies primarily on his wife Jennifer, Buria, and his lawyer for counsel, the sources said.
    


            Hegseth also likes Buria's “yes, sir” attitude, said one defense official who has observed their interactions.
    


            “He likes that Ricky does what he asks and gets him what he needs,” the official said.
    


            Under Secretary Austin, Buria was “cool, calm, collected, never got ruffled, and had a good attitude,” a former senior Pentagon official in the Biden administration told CNN, adding that he was “very good and capable.” But he was also essentially a “body man” for Austin — carrying his bags and appearing only in the background of official photos, if at all.
    


            Under Hegseth, however, Buria has in a few short months become one of Hegseth's most trusted advisers and friends.
    


            Buria has routine access to Hegseth's personal and government phones, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN, and is often seen working out with the secretary in photos posted on X. He has even started sitting at the table with foreign leaders, most recently during official meetings in Panama and with El Salvador's defense minister at the Pentagon. He also appeared in a photo laughing with Elon Musk when he visited the Pentagon earlier this month.
    


            Buria never did anything of the sort while serving in the same role for Austin, the former senior Pentagon official said.
    


            “He would never sit in on bilats or meetings or anything like that, like he is now,” the former official said, referring to official bilateral meetings between the secretary and his counterparts.
    


            Current and former officials have also raised questions about whether Buria is experienced enough to serve as Hegseth's chief of staff — and whether the White House would accept that, given Buria's history working under Austin and Trump's push to root out Biden-era “holdovers” from his administration.
    


            “It's certainly an unlikely path, to move from the military assistant to a political appointee,” said a second former senior DOD official. “I can't think of another case.”
    


            It could be a tough adjustment, the first former senior official said.
    


            “You need someone with a political background who understands the political context, someone who can call up a four-star and yell at them for not being on message or not doing things the right way,” this person added. “I think that's the biggest concern … do we really think [CENTCOM Commander] Erik Kurilla is going to take Ricky seriously, as a recently retired colonel?”
    


            A third former senior DOD official who served under Austin agreed, saying the chief of staff has to be comfortable holding their own against career political operators who are working at senior levels of other government agencies.
    


            As for his work with Austin, the second former senior DoD official emphasized that the military services — in Buria's case, the Marine Corps — put forward their rising-star officers for the job of junior military assistant.
    


            The officers themselves shouldn't be considered political, and Buria never appeared to be, this former official said. While he seemed ambitious, this person added, there was “no indication he would be interested in leaving the military service and becoming a Trump political appointee.”
    


            In fact, multiple sources told CNN that Buria was on the fast-track to becoming a general officer within the Marine Corps, which has made his decision to leave uniform all the more bewildering to those who have worked alongside him.
    


            As he has risen in Hegseth's inner circle, Buria has gotten bolder in advising Hegseth on political and policy matters, the current defense official and a former official said. And he has sometimes ruffled feathers in the way he's spoken to more senior military officers, including at least two combatant commanders, the sources added.
    


            “He's gotten far too casual with them, and presents too unprofessionally,” said the current official.
    


            In a sign of his increasingly political role, Buria joined X in January, and three days ago began regularly reposting Trump, Hegseth, and Vance, as well as posts from DoD's rapid response account criticizing the media coverage of Hegseth — including one calling NPR a “fake news propaganda machine.”

            A Pakistani astronaut will become the first foreign national aboard China's Tiangong space station, as Beijing steps up space diplomacy amid a burgeoning battle with the United States for supremacy in orbit.
    


            The mission of the Pakistani astronaut – who is yet to be selected – tightens already close space ties between Beijing and Islamabad. Last year, Pakistan sent a satellite to the Moon aboard China's lunar explorer, alongside payloads from the European Space Agency, France, and Italy, according to Chinese state media.
    


            Tiangong is one of two currently operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station, launched in 1998. Since it started operating in 2021, it has only hosted Chinese astronauts.
    


            The mission is “a significant step in the internationalization of the Chinese space station,” said Quentin Parker, an astrophysicist and professor at the University of Hong Kong.
    


            “When you internationalize things properly, you build something greater than the sum of the parts, and that's true in the internationalization of the space station,” he said.
    


            During a press conference on Wednesday, the China Manned Space Agency announced the astronaut selected will be a payload specialist, handling daily tasks during the mission, as well as scientific experiments for Pakistan.
    


            Amjad Ali, deputy director of Pakistan's space agency SUPARCO, lauded the news as a milestone for the South Asian nation, whose government is taking a renewed interest in its more than 60-year-old space program.
    


            “It is very important for Pakistan, being the first foreign country whose astronauts are entertained by China and taken by the Chinese mission,” he told Reuters news agency on Wednesday.
    


            Ali said Pakistan space bosses will compile a list of five to 10 candidates for the mission over the next month, for China to then shorten to two.
    


            The pair will then go through training in China for six months to a year, with one eventually being sent to space as early as October next year, while the other acts as a reserve, Ali said.
    


            The two countries' growing space ties coincide with their increasing economic collaboration and trade on Earth.
    


            Under Beijing's China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a major project within its broader Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested heavily in infrastructure in the north and south of Pakistan, including a deep-water port in the southwestern city of Gwadar, as well as multiple technological projects between the two countries.
    


            An agreement signed in February between the two countries on space cooperation was a precursor the mission announced Wednesday.
    


            On Tuesday, a delegation from Chinese space tech company Galaxy Space met with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according  to a statement from Sharif's office.
    


            The delegation expressed a “keen interest in investing in Pakistan's space technology industry and joint ventures with Pakistani space technology institutions and private telecom companies,” the statement added.
    


            Sharif, calling China his country's “most reliable friend and strategic partner,” said that Pakistan was “looking to increase cooperation with China in the fields of space technology, space satellites and satellite internet.”
    


            Amer Gilani, who oversees human spaceflight cooperation at SUPARCO, told CNN that the experiments to be conducted during the planned mission were still being selected, but will have “high scientific, industrial and social impact.”
    


            China has rapidly advanced its space power in recent decades through ambitious lunar and deep-space exploration programs, as well as expanding its space station.
    


            On Thursday, another manned mission will launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China, carrying three astronauts to Tiangong.
    


            The Shenzhou-20 crew is scheduled to blast off at 5:17 p.m. on Thursday local time (5:17 a.m. ET), state media reported on Wednesday. It will be the ninth crewed mission headed for China's space station since it was fully assembled in 2022.
    


            The main purpose of the mission is to complete the in-orbit rotation with the Shenzhou-19 crew, which is scheduled to return to earth on April 29, China Manned Space Agency officials said at a press conference.
    


            While in space, the astronauts will conduct science and application experiments, install a space debris protection device, as well as extravehicular payload and equipment, and perform recovery tasks, according to the agency.
    


            The mission will also carry small animals and organisms for life-science experiments at the space station. They will include zebrafish, flatworms known as planarians, and streptomyces bacteria.
    


            China has signed nearly 200 intergovernmental space cooperation agreements with foreign countries and international organizations, covering fields from satellite development and lunar exploration to manned space flight, state media reported in December.
    


            China's space administration announced Thursday it has also approved loans of lunar samples collected by China's earlier moon exploration mission to seven institutions across six countries, including Pakistan.
    


            Parker, from the University of Hong Kong, emphasized the importance of international space cooperation.
    


            “The way that things are in the world at the moment is increasingly complex – but it's important that this outreach and collaborative spirit is maintained,” he said.

            Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was confronted by some pro-Palestinian demonstrators Wednesday night in New Haven, Connecticut, according to a statement and videos shared by Ben Gvir's office.
    


            “Water bottles were thrown” at Ben Gvir, his office said, when the far-right minister exited a building in front of protesters following a speech he gave at Shabtai, a private Jewish society at Yale that's not officially affiliated with the university.
    


            The videos show dozens of demonstrators shouting and chanting at the minister as he exits, smiling and waving at the protesters. “Minister Ben Gvir refused to leave the scene and made a V sign at them, as a sign of victory,” his office said.

            Photos published on social media show a water bottle apparently being thrown at Ben Gvir and a group of people surrounding him.
    


            In one video, an item that was apparently thrown is heard hitting the ground. People standing next to Ben Gvir shout “whoa” as they realize items are being thrown.
    


            Ben Gvir was not injured and is in “good health,” his office said.
    


            In a separate video viewed by CNN, at least one person is seen being detained by police. CNN has reached out to New Haven police for comment and details about detainments or arrests.
    


            When the event began earlier Wednesday evening, protesters crowded the sidewalk outside the gated building while chanting “Free Palestine,” “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Yale, your hands are red.” As attendees made their way into the venue, protesters yelled “shame” repeatedly and booed.

            Mitchell Dubin, a Yale senior and member of the Shabtai Society, told CNN “Shabtai does not seek to legitimize or delegitimize world leaders. Instead, it provides a space where ideas are interrogated with rigor, policies are challenged with integrity, and civil discourse is preserved even under strain.”
    


            Renewed protests have spread at college campuses this spring over Israel's handling of its war in Gaza.
    


            The war started after Hamas, the militant group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, killed 1,200 people in Israel in a series of gruesome attacks and took hundreds of others hostage in October 2023.
    


            But international groups have said Israel's attacks in Gaza have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians – mostly women and children – and caused an ongoing humanitarian crisis.



            Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also gathered at Yale University on Tuesday night to protest Ben Gvir's visit.
    


            A Yale spokesperson told CNN an “unregistered group” of 200 people not “affiliated with any recognized student organization” gathered Tuesday and set up eight tents in Beinecke Plaza, a central square on Yale's campus.
    


            The group disbanded at 11 p.m. Tuesday after “university officials articulated Yale's policies and the consequences of violating them” and offered a final warning, the Yale spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Protesters were given cards with QR codes that linked to Yale University's policies for peaceable assembly, such as keeping everyone physically safe, not blocking entrances and exits and not disrupting the university's operations.

            Some students who were warned by campus officials in previous incidents that violated school policy were given written notices and “are subject to immediate disciplinary action,” the spokesperson said. But the university didn't say how many received such notices.
    


            Tuesday's protest came shortly after the group met with Yale officials to discuss recent campus policy violations and were “warned that further violations would jeopardize the group's privileges,” the university said.
    


            Yale has since revoked the group's status as a registered student organization, as officials say they are also investigating concerns about “disturbing antisemitic conduct at (Tuesday's) gathering,” the university said Wednesday.
    


             “Yale condemns antisemitism and will hold those who violate our policies accountable through our disciplinary processes,” the statement said.
    


            A statement from Ben Gvir's office said the protesters were there “in an attempt to prevent a speech by the Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir – who was invited to speak at the venue.”
    


            “The event is taking place against the backdrop of a round of diplomatic meetings that the minister is holding in the US, after speaking at President Trump's mansion in the past 24 hours, and the day before at a meeting with Jewish communities in the US,” the statement said.
    


            Ben Gvir – a far-right firebrand – has been public about his adoration for US President Donald Trump, proudly extolling his plan to resettle Gazans outside of the Palestinian territory.

            He quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in January because he was opposed to the ceasefire deal that saw the return of Israeli hostages from Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. He only rejoined the government last month when Israel resumed its war in Gaza.
    


            Ben Gvir has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, and he was considered so extreme that the Israeli military rejected him from service. This is his first visit to the United States as national security minister.
    


            Last October, a group of 90 congressional Democrats urged President Joe Biden to sanction Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom lead extreme nationalist parties within Netanyahu's government. Ultimately, the Biden administration chose not to impose sanctions on Israeli government ministers.
    


            The new protest on the New Haven campus comes exactly a year after 45 protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing when they refused orders to leave Beinecke Plaza, part of a wave of demonstrations across US campuses last spring.

            As part of their support for Palestinians in Gaza, protesters at the Yale campus demanded the university get rid of investments in businesses with connections to Israel's military effort there.
    


            In recent weeks, another Ivy League university, Harvard, has been at the forefront of the Trump administration's effort to stop campus protests, contending they are examples of antisemitism.
    


            The Trump administration is demanding Harvard give it access to all university reports on antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias on campus generated since October 2023, as it ramps up a confrontation with the school that risks billions in federal money amid a broader push to bring elite US colleges in line with its political demands.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump administration directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the National Education Association and the American Civil Liberties Union, which accused the Republican administration of violating teachers' due process and First Amendment rights.

In February, the U.S. Education Department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. Earlier this month, the department ordered states to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.”

The directives do not carry the force of law but threaten to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools were warned that continuing such practices “in violation of federal law” could lead to U.S. Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts.

The lawsuit argued that the orders were “unconstitutionally vague,” an issue underscored in the ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty.

She said the April letter does not make clear what the department believes a DEI program entails or when it believes such programs cross the line into violating civil rights law. “The Letter does not even define what a ‘DEI program' is,” McCafferty wrote.




The judge also said there is reason to believe the department's actions amount to a violation of teachers' free speech rights.

“A professor runs afoul of the 2025 Letter if she expresses the view in her teaching that structural racism exists in America, but does not do so if she denies structural racism's existence. That is textbook viewpoint discrimination,” McCafferty wrote.

States were given until the end of Thursday to submit certification of their schools' compliance, but some have indicated they would not comply with the order. Education officials in some Democratic-led states have said the administration is overstepping its authority and that there is nothing illegal about DEI.

The lawsuit filed in March argues the Feb. 14 memo, formally known as a “Dear Colleague” letter, would limit academic freedom by dictating what students can be taught. 

The memo said schools have promoted DEI efforts at the expense of white and Asian American students. It dramatically expands the interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the use of race in college admissions to all aspects of education, including, hiring, promotion, scholarships, housing, graduation ceremonies and campus life.

The memo faces another challenge from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which has asked a federal court in Maryland to stop the department from enforcing it. 

Both lawsuits argue that the guidance is so vague that it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed.

President Donald Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon, warned of potential funding cuts if states did not return the form by Friday.

In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there's no discrimination that's happening in any of the schools,” she said.

The April directive asked states to collect the certification form from local school districts and also sign it on behalf of the state, giving assurance that schools are in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Schools and states are already required to give assurances to that effect in separate paperwork, but the new form adds language on DEI, warning that using diversity programs to discriminate can bring funding cuts, fines and other penalties.

The form threatens schools' access to Title I, the largest source of federal revenue for K-12 education and a lifeline for schools in low-income areas. ___

NEW YORK (AP) — Tariff worries continue hanging over companies as they report their latest financial results and try to provide guidance on their path ahead.

Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. 

Seemingly few industries or companies are being spared from the uncertainty. Food and beverage businesses, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of household staples are among the many companies trying to gauge the potential impact to costs and sales.

A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that companies are right to be focused on tariffs. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance

Here's what companies are saying about tariffs and their potential impact:




Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it's doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties.

But P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten told reporters on a call that the consumer products giant still will likely have to pass on higher prices to shoppers as early as July.

The consumer product giant reduced its annual financial outlook after reporting lower sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, during the latest quarter, due to a pullback in consumer spending over worries about tariffs as well as overall financial worries about job security and mortgage rates.

“Everything plays into the consumer behavior,” Schulten said. “Uncertainty around the stock market and what their 401ks are worth and what the portfolio is worth. Uncertainty around the economic outlook and what it means for their livelihood and the job market.”

PepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations, citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.

The maker of Pepsi beverages and Frito-Lay snacks said it now expects its core earnings per share to be even with last year. Previously it expected mid-single-digit percentage growth.

A 25% tariff on imported aluminum is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. The company expects “elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty” for the rest of this year. 

Merck trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, though it maintained its guidance for revenue.

The pharmaceutical giant has a global reach. Half of its revenue comes from the U.S. market, with the rest of the world making up the other half, according to FactSet. The company expects tariffs already implemented to cost the company about $200 million.

American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast for the year amid uncertainty over the economy.

While tariffs might not directly impact airlines and other companies in the travel sector, they could prompt a shift in consumer spending. Tariffs typically make goods more expensive and that might force consumers to tighten their budgets and focus more on necessities, while cutting back on discretionary items and services, such as travel.

Southwest Airlines is trimming its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. The company also said it could not reaffirm its 2025 and 2026 outlooks for earnings before interest and taxes, given “current macroeconomic uncertainty.”

Chemical company Dow expects to see delays in purchases from businesses and consumers amid tariff-driven economic uncertainty.

“Markets worldwide are awaiting additional clarity into how the tariff and global trade negotiations will land,” said CEO Jim Fitterling, in a statement.

The company is delaying construction of a facility in Alberta, Canada and expects capital expense savings of about $1 billion from that decision. It is also expanding an ongoing review of its assets in Europe, including facilities in Germany and the U.K.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the International Monetary Fund urged countries to move “swiftly'' to resolve trade disputes that threaten global economic growth.

IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the unpredictability arising from President Donald Trump's aggressive campaign of taxes on foreign imports is causing companies to delay investments and consumers to hold off on spending.

 “Uncertainty is bad for business,'' she told reporters Thursday in a briefing during the spring meetings of the IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank.

Georgieva's comments came two days after the IMF downgraded the outlook for world economic growth this year. The 191-country lending organization, which seeks to promote global growth, financial stability and to reduce poverty, also sharply lowered its forecast for the United States. It said the chances that the world's biggest economy would fall into recession have risen from 25%, to about 40%.

Georgieva warned that the economic fallout from trade conflict would fall most heavily on poor countries, which do not have the money to offset the damage.

Since returning the White House in January, Trump has aggressively imposed tariffs on American trading partners. Among other things, he's slapped 145% import taxes on China and 10% on almost every country in the world, raising U.S. tariffs to levels not seen in more than a century. But he has repeatedly changed U.S. policy — suddenly suspending or altering the tariffs — and left companies bewildered about what he is trying to accomplish and what his end game might be.




Trump's tariffs — a sharp reversal of decades of U.S. policy in favor of free trade — and the resulting uncertainty around them have caused a weekslong rout in financial markets. But stocks rallied Wednesday after the Trump administration signaled that it is open to reducing the massive tariffs on China. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.

Major U.S. airlines are reducing their flight schedules and revising or withdrawing their profit outlooks for the year due to less domestic travel demand as sentiment about the national and global economies sours.

American Airlines pulled its financial guidance for 2025 on Thursday, joining rivals Southwest and Delta in declaring the economic outlook too uncertain to provide full-year forecasts. All three airlines cited weakening sales among economy class leisure travelers. 

“We came off a strong fourth quarter, saw decent business in January, and really domestic leisure travel fell off considerably as we went into the February time frame,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC.

Consumer reluctance to book vacations would correspond with a new poll that showed many people fear the U.S. is being steered into a recession and that President Donald Trump's broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.

There's also increasing concerns about international travelers. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said in a client note that anti-American sentiment could be spurring a travel dropoff, with data showing that international visitors to the U.S. are running about 5% lower than a year ago.

“In recent weeks there have been numerous news stories about tourists canceling trips to the U.S. in protest of the perceived heavy-handedness of recent trade policies,” he wrote. “This points to potentially another channel to consider in assessing the effects of tariffs on economic activity.”




Some economic indicators point to expectations of a slowdown. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes slowed in March, and U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in April, the fourth consecutive month of declines. However, fears of a downturn have not translated into layoffs. 

Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2 that triggered panic in financial markets and generated recession fears, leading consumers and businesses to start pulling back on spending, which includes travel. The president put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes but increased his already steep tariffs against China.

Beijing increased its import tax on American goods to 125% in retaliation. On Thursday China denied Trump's assertion that the two sides were involved in active negotiations to end or mitigate their trade war. 

American Airlines said it would give an update on its full-year guidance “as the economic outlook becomes clearer.” Airline executives said sales among business travelers and for premium seats on long-haul international flights remained solid.

Southwest Airlines reported late Wednesday that it would trim its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. The company also said it could not reaffirm its 2025 and 2026 outlooks for earnings before interest and taxes, given “current macroeconomic uncertainty.” 

United Airlines last week gave two different financial forecasts for how it may perform this year, one if there's a recession and one if not. The airline said it planned to reduce its scheduled domestic flights by 4% starting in July in response to lower-than-expected demand for economy fare tickets.

“We think there is a reasonable chance things can weaken from here,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. 

Delta Air Lines, the nation's most profitable carrier, predicted as recently as January that the company was on track for the best financial year in its history. Earlier this month, the airline scratched its performance expectations for 2025 and said it was putting a planned flight schedule expansion on hold. 

“With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said at the time. “In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control. This includes reducing planned capacity growth in the second half of the year.”

The parent companies of Frontier Airlines and Alaska Airlines also pulled their 2025 guidance.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans' trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president's broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.

Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump's trade policies will increase prices “a lot” and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up “somewhat,” according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.




About half of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.

While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn't mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation.

AP polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux reports on a new poll showing concerns over tariff impacts.

Three months into his second term, Trump's handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That's roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.

Matthew Wood, 41, said he's waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he's feeling anxious.

“I'm not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends,” said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. “Personally, it hasn't affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don't know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.” 




Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump's attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he's willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.

About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That's up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn't previously have an opinion on tariffs.

Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.

“Actually, I think he shouldn't have suspended it,” said Manis, a retired sheriff's deputy from Del Rio, Texas. “Because now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.”

Not quite 100 days into Trump's second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.

Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He's imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes — albeit partially suspending some of them — launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump's tariff pronouncements.

Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.

Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump's tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.

Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not “sustainable.”

About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want — a sign of the economy's resilience so far.




Retirement savings are a source of anxiety — about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a “major source” of stress in their lives. But fewer — only about 2 in 10 — identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety.

“This whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,” said Nicole Jones, 32. “It's revenge — and everybody's losing on it.”

The Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn't given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt.

“Things are more expensive for us,” she said.

And most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state.

The difference is that Republicans — who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president — now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country's financial future.

“It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine,” Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump's policies went into effect.

BANGKOK (AP) — China on Thursday denied any suggestion that it was in active negotiations with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs, saying that any notion of progress in the matter was as groundless as “trying to catch the wind.” 

China's comments come after Trump said Tuesday that things were going “fine with China” and that the final tariff rate on Chinese exports would come down “substantially” from the current 145%.

Guo Jiakun, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said during a daily briefing on Thursday that, “For all I know, China and the U.S. are not having any consultation or negotiation on tariffs, still less reaching a deal.”

“China's position is consistent and we are open to consultations and dialogues, but any form of consultations and negotiations must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and in an equal manner,” Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong said. 

“Any claims about the progress of China-U.S. trade negotiations are groundless as trying to catch the wind and have no factual basis,” the spokesman said.

Trump had told reporters earlier in the week that “everything's active” when asked if he was engaging with China, although his treasury secretary had said there were no formal negotiations. 

Asked Thursday about China denying there were any conversations ongoing with the U.S., Trump said “They had a meeting this morning,” before adding, “it doesn't matter who they is.” 




The U.S. president has expressed interest in a way to climb down from his massive retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. There are mounting business and consumer concerns that the taxes will drive up inflation and potentially send the economy into a recession.

Trump had put 145% tariffs on imports from China, while China hit back with 125% tariffs on U.S. products. While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China remained the exception. Instead, Beijing raised its own tariffs and deployed other economic measures in response while vowing to “fight to the end.” For example, China restricted exports of rare earth minerals and raised multiple cases against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.

China also made it clear that talks should involve the cancellation of all tariffs it currently faces. 

“The unilateral tariff increase measures were initiated by the United States. If the United States really wants to solve the problem, it should face up to the rational voices of the international community and all parties at home, completely cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China, and find ways to resolve differences through equal dialogue,” said He, the Commerce Ministry spokesman. 

Despite the economic measures leveled against China, Trump said Tuesday that he would be “very nice” and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“We're going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” Trump said.

GOP Sen. John Kennedy said Sunday during an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker that the Trump administration deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is in an El Salvadoran megaprison, was a ""screw up."" 

A second U.S. judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to return another man who was deported from the U.S. to El Salvador last month under the Alien Enemies Act – the latest case in a high-profile legal battle playing out in federal courts across the country.

U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, on Wednesday ruled that the Trump administration violated a settlement agreement DHS reached last year with a group of young asylum seekers when it deported a 20-year-old man, referred to in court filings as ""Cristian,"" to El Salvador last month.

He was part of a group of migrants who had entered the U.S. illegally as unaccompanied children and who later filed asylum claims to remain in the U.S.

DHS agreed in the settlement that it would refrain from deporting any of the individuals in the class until their asylum claims could be fully adjudicated by a U.S. court.

Gallagher ruled that the government breached that agreement when it deported Cristian, a member of the class, and ordered that they return him to the U.S. 

News of the case and settlement in question was first reported by ABC News.

Gallagher stressed in her ruling that, unlike other court challenges to Trump's deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, this one centers on a ""breach of contract"" by the government. 

Her ruling also alluded to the deportation of Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member living in Maryland who was deported to El Salvador last month. U.S. officials have resisted court orders to facilitate his return to the U.S.

In response to this, Gallagher specifically tasked the Trump administration in her ruling with ""making a good faith request to the government of El Salvador and to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS.""

The Trump administration, meanwhile, told the court it had determined that Cristian was eligible for removal under the Alien Enemies Act because he had been arrested and convicted for cocaine possession earlier this year.

They told the court that his designation as an ""alien enemy pursuant to the AEA results in him ceasing to be a member"" of the class that had negotiated a settlement.

That agreement did not appear to hold water with Gallagher, who ordered the government not to remove any other members of the class until their asylum claims are properly adjudicated.

""Therefore, under the plain terms of the Settlement Agreement and fundamental tenets of contract law, removal from the United States of a Class Member, including but not limited to Cristian, without a final determination on the merits by USCIS on the Class Member's pending asylum application violates the Settlement Agreement,"" Gallagher said.

She also granted a temporary restraining order to another member of the class, an 18-year-old referred to as Javier, whom counsel for the group said was in ""imminent danger"" of being deported earlier this month, as ABC reported.

Gallagher agreed that Javier was covered by the settlement with the government and blocked his removal from the U.S.

Newly released video shows how Russian national Svetlana Dali was allegedly able to sneak onto a New York to Paris flight without a boarding pass late last year.

The video, provided by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to the Associated Press on Wednesday after a records request, shows Dali wearing a brown sweater as she is screened by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents. 

Moments later, it shows her wearing a gray hoodie under a black jacket with a large backpack on while she slips by two gate agents checking boarding passes by blending in with a group of passengers strolling onto an airbridge. 

The staffers did not appear to notice Dali as she passed and joined a group of ticketed passengers who were allowed to board the plane.

Dali had initially been turned away from a security checkpoint at JFK International Airport by a TSA official after she could not show a boarding pass, court documents obtained by the AP said.

She then allegedly snuck into a special security lane for airline employees, masked by a large Air Europa flight crew, and made it into a screening area where agents were inspecting bags and patting down travelers.

Delta crew members realized Dali was an unauthorized passenger while the plane was in the air and notified French authorities, who detained her before she entered customs, court documents said.

She was eventually flown back to New York and admitted to authorities that she had gotten on the plane without a ticket and that she had intentionally evaded security and Delta employees so she could avoid buying a ticket, court records said.

Dali was initially released after her arrest with electric monitoring but then was arrested again in Buffalo, New York, after she cut off the monitor and tried to enter Canada.

She is being held in a federal lockup in Brooklyn, records obtained by the AP show.

Dali, 57, is a legal resident of the United States. She has pleaded not guilty to a stowaway charge over the incident last November. Her trial is set to begin next month but prosecutors, and her lawyer have said they are trying to work toward a plea deal.

'Kids First' director Billy Moges discusses the ongoing Supreme Court battle over parents' rights to remove their children from LGBTQ+ curriculum.

The U.S. Supreme Court will consider the establishment of the nation's first religious charter school next week, a case that could have key implications for school choice across the country.

A huge majority of states have implemented some form of school choice in recent years, but only a little more than a dozen have adopted programs that make private school choice universally available to K-12 students.

Here is the full list and a timeline of the school choice movement in recent years.

Alabama passed its CHOOSE Act in 2024, which establishes an education savings account (ESA) that will soon be open to all families in the state.

Arizona became the first state to offer universal school choice for all families in 2022, launching an $800 million program that gives parents $7,000 to put toward their children's tuition.

Arkansas's S.B. 294 established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status.

The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee told Fox News Digital a universal school choice proposal is not intended to neglect the need to support public schools in the state. (Office of the Governor of Tennessee)

Florida's H.B. 1, passed in 2023, established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status.

The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials.

Idaho launched its first private school choice program through a refundable tax credit. Families can receive up to $5,000 per child for private educational expenses, with $7,500 available for students with disabilities. The program is capped at $50 million annually and prioritizes families earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level (about $96,450 for a family of four).

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE IF FAMILIES CAN OPT OUT OF READING LGBTQ BOOKS IN THE CLASSROOM

Iowa's H.F. 68, passed in 2023, established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status.

The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials.

The Indiana Choice Scholarship Program grants a voucher to qualifying K-12 students that they can put toward private school tuition.

In order to qualify, students must be residents of Indiana and a member of a household that makes an ""annual income of not more than 400% of the amount to qualify for the federal free and reduced price lunch program.""

Montana has two major school choice programs, but only one of them is universally available. The more restricted program is a standard ESA, but students must have special needs or have some other form of disability in order to qualify.

The more expansive program is a statewide tax credit scholarship program that ""allows individuals and corporations to claim a 100% tax credit for contributions to approved Student Scholarship Organizations,"" according to EdChoice.

The average scholarship value for participating students is $2,190.

North Carolina has a major voucher program that is available to all students across the state, but is limited by a budget cap.

Qualifying students will get an average voucher value of $5,701 to put toward private school tuition costs, transportation, equipment or other costs associated with attending school.

After baseline qualifications are met, vouchers are granted based on household income. 

Ohio's school choice program awards $6,166 for grades K–8 and $8,408 for grades 9-12 to qualifying students.

Students must meet one of a series of qualifications in order to receive the award, and parents must submit their income information.

Like Montana, Oklahoma employs a tax credit system to allow for school choice in the state.

""The Oklahoma Parental Choice Tax Credit provides parents of students in private school with a refundable tax credit ranging from a minimum of $5,000 up to a maximum of $7,500 per child to cover the cost of private school tuition and fees, or it provides parents of students in home school a refundable tax credit of $1,000 to cover the cost of unbundled educational expenses,"" according to EdChoice.

Tennessee passed the Education Freedom Act of 2025, creating a universal ESA program. Families receive $7,000 per student, which must first be used for tuition but can also cover other educational expenses. The program starts with 20,000 scholarships, with half reserved for students from families earning up to 300% of the free and reduced-price lunch threshold and students with disabilities. If at least 75% of scholarships are awarded, the cap will rise to 25,000 students in 2026.

Utah's H.B. 215, passed in 2023, established choice programs open to all students, regardless of income or disability status.

The accounts allow families to spend state money not just on tuition but also on other approved expenses, such as tutoring, online courses and instructional materials.

West Virginia employs an ESA program to allow universal school choice for private schools, and it also has ""intra-district and inter-district public school choice via open enrollment,"" according to EdChoice.

The ESA program grants an average of $4,299 toward private school tuition costs.

Wyoming passed HB 199 in 2025, expanding its ESA program by removing income restrictions and making it fully universal starting in 2025-26. Renamed the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship, the program will provide families with $7,000 and be funded through a $30 million appropriation. Participating students must be assessed on academic progress.

U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young offers his reaction to winning the CNN defamation trial in an interview with Fox News Digital.

FIRST ON FOX -- U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young, who successfully sued CNN for defamation earlier this year, filed a lawsuit against U.S. News & World Report on Wednesday as he continues to fight to clear his name. 

In January, a Florida jury found that CNN defamed Young by implying he illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan on the ""black market"" during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021. Young was awarded $4 million in lost earnings, $1 million in personal damages such as pain and suffering, and the jury found that punitive damages are also warranted against CNN. 

Young, who has since sued the Associated Press and Puck over coverage of the CNN trial, filed his latest lawsuit against U.S. News & World Report. The dust-up started in January when AP media reporter David Bauder wrote that ""Young's business helped smuggle people out of Afghanistan"" when covering the CNN trial. Bauder's report is at the center of Young's separate lawsuit against the AP, and U.S. News & World Report republished the story, which is common practice for news outlets, before eventually retracting it. 

U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT RETRACTS AP ARTICLE ABOUT VETERAN ZACHARY YOUNG, BUT AP STANDS BY THE STORY

A jury found  earlier this year that CNN defamed U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young. He is now suing U.S. News & World Report.  

In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Bay County, Florida which has been obtained by Fox News Digital, Young's lawyer, Daniel Lustig, wrote that U.S. News & World Report's retraction didn't go ""far enough,"" and his client gave the outlet a chance to correct the mistake before a lawsuit was filed. 

""We gave U.S. News every opportunity to do the right thing — to correct what was clearly false, to make it right by correcting and acknowledging what smuggling means. They had already issued a retraction, but it didn't go far enough. It was not a full retraction, and it was not a fair one. Words matter. The word they used meant something serious, and they knew it,"" Lustig wrote. 

Once Young objected to the AP accusing him of smuggling people, U.S. News & World Report removed its pickup of the story and chalked it up to a ""possible misunderstanding."" 

NAVY VETERAN WHO PROVED CNN DEFAMED HIM SUES ASSOCIATED PRESS, SAYS HE WAS FALSELY PAINTED AS ‘SMUGGLER'

Zachary Young is seeking the same venue for his lawsuits against the Associated Press and U.S. News & World Report as he had with CNN: Bay County, Florida.  (Joseph A. Wulfsohn/Fox News Digital)

""RETRACTION: U.S. News & World Report has removed the article previously available at this URL that had been published on January 17, 2025, entitled ‘Florida Jury Says CNN Defamed Navy Veteran in Story About Endangered Afghans.' The article was reported and written by the Associated Press (AP). As an AP subscriber, U.S News regularly republishes multiple AP articles on a daily basis,"" U.S. News & World Report wrote on the page where the AP report used to exist. 

""The AP article reported that the jury found that a CNN report on Mr. Young had falsely implied he had engaged in illegal conduct,"" U.S. News & World Report continued. ""The AP article also stated that ‘Young's business helped smuggle people out of Afghanistan.' Mr. Young subsequently contacted U.S. News and objected to the word ‘smuggle' as accusing him of engaging in criminal activity. In republishing the article, U.S. News had no intention to suggest that Mr. Young's actions were unlawful. Nevertheless, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, U.S. News has removed and retracts the AP article.""

The retraction did not sit right with Young. 

""We didn't rush to court — we were forced by a refusal from U.S. News to take responsibility and their decision to not tell the truth. The media has a profound responsibility to the public, and if they can't be trusted to acknowledge what words mean and the damage they can cause, we will continue holding them accountable in court. That is the only way. If they don't want to take responsibility, it will be up to the people of Florida to keep them honest,"" Lustig told Fox News Digital. 

U.S. News & World Report did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

JURY FINDS CNN COMMITTED DEFAMATION AGAINST NAVY VETERAN, SETTLEMENT REACHED ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES

In the court filing, Young's attorney said it's ""categorically false"" to say that Young smuggled anyone and noted that ""human smuggling"" is a felony under U.S. law and courts ruled he did nothing illegal during his Afghanistan evacuation effort. 

The AP has previously defended the reporting and did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the lawsuit against U.S. News & World Report. 

""AP's story was a factual and accurate report on the jury verdict finding in Zachary Young's favor,"" an AP spokesperson previously said. 

Young is seeking compensatory and other damages, and will likely seek to amend the lawsuit to include punitive damages at a later date.

Donnie Wahlberg tells Fox News Digital that his wife, Jenny McCarthy, did not get jealous of his New Kids on the Block fan base.

After Donnie Wahlberg realized Jenny McCarthy wasn't going to be jealous of his New Kids on the Block fame, he decided that she was the woman for him.

During an interview with Fox News Digital, Wahlberg said his wife of over a decade never got jealous of his female fan base, even when he would kiss a different fan at the end of every show.

""Jenny, when we first started dating, like, one of the reasons I knew she was a great girl for me, among the many reasons, was I told her, I said, 'Look, I'm in this band. My fans are going to be there. When I walk into a hotel with you, for example, and you know there are 50 screaming fans outside, I can't just duck by and run into the hotel.'""

""'I got to stop and take pictures. I got to stop and say thank you. I got to stop and sign autographs.' And she said, ‘OK.' And I said, ‘All right, are you going to be good with that?' She said, 'Yeah, I'll take the pictures with you. I'm good,'"" Wahlberg said.

He continued, ""Like, I knew right then. I was like, 'Oh, she's the one.' I knew already, but you know, I did have that talk with her.""

Wahlberg told Fox News Digital that McCarthy's lack of jealousy showed him that she respected the bond he has with his fans. 

At the beginning of Wahlberg and McCarthy's relationship, the former Playboy model would go to Wahlberg's shows and see him kiss a different fan every night.

""Like, I knew right then. I was like, 'Oh, she's the one.' I knew already, but you know, I did have that talk with her.""

""When Jenny and I started dating, we were putting a tour together. It was in 2013, and it was called ‘The Package Tour.' So, I had this bit in the show where we sing this song called ‘Single,' and I would kiss a fan every night."" 

""Jenny came to a lot of shows on that tour. We were dating, it was new, and she was excited, and she loved coming to the shows. She would always sit through it and never say anything, never got jealous, never got upset,"" Wahlberg said.

He explained that at this point in their relationship, McCarthy was getting several offers to host a talk show and opted to be on ""The View,"" since it was based in New York where Wahlberg was filming ""Blue Bloods.""

""It's like the second or third episode of ‘The View,' and they had a 40-year-old guy on there who'd never been kissed before. The first few days, she'd come home and tell me how the show was going: 'Yeah, this happened, and Barbara [Walters] said this, and Whoopi [Goldberg] did that, and it was fun, and we did this.' And she didn't really mention it to me.""

""So, I happened to just catch it on TV, and I'm like, 'Oh, she volunteered to kiss the 40-year-old guy who'd never been kissed before, and she kept kissing him and kissing him and kissing him,'"" Wahlberg said with a laugh.

He told Fox News Digital that at this point, he and McCarthy had only been dating for a few months.

""She was very mature about it. I was not as mature,"" Wahlberg said.

Wahlberg confronted McCarthy about her on-air kiss, and she said, ""Do you know that I went to your concerts all summer long and watched you kiss someone all summer long? I never said a word. And now you're going to give me crap for kissing this dude on my TV show? How do you think I felt all those months?"" 

Wahlberg said that at that moment, he made the decision to never kiss a fan at his shows again.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Putin shows NATO his dangerous Balkan hand","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3389255/putin-shows-nato-his-dangerous-balkan-hand/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

In 1888, a generation before the First World War started, the German arch-statesman Otto von Bismarck predicted that a great European war was coming over some “damn foolish thing in the Balkans.” Tensions in Southeastern Europe have a troublesome habit of dragging in outside powers, sometimes with terrible consequences.

The region is experiencing another bout of squabbling, which threatens to involve NATO if tensions keep rising. The Atlantic Alliance had to intervene militarily twice in the 1990s to resolve Balkan wars emanating from the collapse of Yugoslavia. Russia, weak and divided in the wake of communism's painful downfall, failed to intervene against NATO. We may not be so lucky the next time. 

A striking aspect regarding the current Balkan turmoil is how eerily it resembles the tensions that birthed the First World War. The cast of characters is virtually unchanged. At the center of the dispute are the Serbs, seeking national unity around an independent Serbia. However, significant numbers of Serbs live in neighboring countries, especially Bosnia-Herzegovina. That beautiful yet unsettled country is run as a colony by Teutonic outsiders: in 1914, Austria-Hungary; today, the European Union with NATO support. The EU's high representative for Bosnia, the de facto colonial governor, is a German, while his predecessor was Austrian. Behind the Serbs stand the Russians, their Slavic Orthodox “big brothers.” 

Since the end of the Bosnian War in late 1995, as enshrined in the U.S.-brokered Dayton Peace Accords, the country has been managed quixotically, with a weak central government in Sarajevo and most powers devolved to two entities: the Muslim-dominated Federation and the Serbian Republic or Republika Srpska. This arrangement has satisfied none of the country's ethnic groups. Dayton gives less centralized power than most Muslims want, yet there's too much authority in Sarajevo's hands for most Serbs (the dwindling Croatian minority, ensconced in the Federation, likewise wants less power in federal, i.e., Muslim, hands). 

Dayton was never meant to be a permanent salve to Bosnia's intractable ethnic problems, yet it's endured inefficiently for 30 years, thanks to political inertia and the inability of NATO and the EU to come up with a better system. However, it's being pushed beyond capacity by the current political crisis, which has been festering for decades.  

This came to a head in February with a Bosnian court's criminal sentencing of Milorad Dodik, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, to a year in prison and a six-year ban on participation in politics over his ignoring Sarajevo's edicts and the EU High Commissioner Christian Schmidt. Dodik pronounced the sentence as illegitimate, so he was ignoring it, while dismissing Schmidt as a foreign interloper, suggesting that the imperious German politician should back off given the Nazi genocide perpetrated against Bosnian Serbs, as well as Jews and Roma, during the Second World War. The 66-year-old Dodik, who has led the Bosnian Serbs in different offices since 1998, longer than Vladimir Putin has ruled in the Kremlin, is a consummate survivor. 

In response, a Bosnian court issued an arrest warrant for Dodik, who chose to ignore that, too. Instead, at the end of March, Dodik flew to Moscow as a guest of Putin, whom Dodik praised lavishly as his partner in their shared “fight against the globalist elite.” The two leaders have enjoyed friendly photo ops over the years, and Dodik made clear that Moscow stands behind his beleaguered little entity — and behind himself, too. 

Russia wasn't the only friend Dodik attempted to enlist in his defense. He appeared in Israel, staging an awkward photo op with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where Dodik effusively praised the Israeli fight against jihadists while comparing the shared history of suffering experienced by Serbs and Jews at the hands of Germans and Turks. 

Dodik also reached out to Washington, D.C. Dodik enthusiastically embraced the MAGA cause in our last election, while the Bosnian Serb leader views President Donald Trump as a kindred spirit in the fight against globalism. He compared his legal travails to the Democratic lawfare waged against Trump, with Dodik offering the United States access to Bosnia's minerals as additional enticement. That failed to work, however, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly came out in support of Sarajevo and the EU in Dodik's legal brawl. 

Moscow was more welcoming. As Sarajevo requested an Interpol warrant for Dodik, which would make his international travels difficult if not impossible — a request that Interpol has rejected to date — Dodik hinted that if Bosnian Muslim pols and their EU and NATO puppet masters kept pushing, the Russians would push back in support of Bosnia's Serbs. Dodik backed Putin's 2022 reinvasion of Ukraine as fully justified, while Putin's recent meeting with Dodik in Moscow indicates Kremlin support. 

This shouldn't be dismissed as an idle threat. One of Dayton's few unambiguous successes involved disbanding the ethnic militaries that waged the 1992-1995 war, replacing them with a unified but small Bosnian armed force. Dodik has no army of his own, although the Republika Srpska's paramilitary police is unusually well armed, including with Russian weapons. Recreating ethnic armies has been a firm “red line” under Dayton, at least until now. 

Dodik alarmed international observers this spring by hinting that he would recreate his own military, a move that would kill Dayton in any practical sense. The EU's peacekeeping force in Bosnia, called EUFOR, is only a couple of battalions strong and would need substantial NATO reinforcement in the event of any serious crisis. Western intelligence assesses that Dodik has made plans to rearm the Bosnian Serbs with substantial Russian military aid, but nothing firm has happened yet.  

Just as alarming are mounting signs that Serbia, which stands firmly behind its co-nationals in Bosnia in Dodik's legal skirmish, is cozying up to Moscow, too. For years, Aleksandar Vučić, who has ruled in Belgrade since 2014, first as prime minister, for the last eight years as president, has managed a delicate balancing act between East and West. Under Vučić, Serbia kept its options open vis-à-vis membership in the EU someday (until 2023, Vučić even kept potential NATO membership for Serbia on the table). All the while, Serbia has become something of an economic colony of China. 

In security matters, Belgrade plays all sides. While Serbia last year purchased a dozen Rafale fighter jets from France for its air force, its ground forces employ many Russian weapons systems, and its air defenses include late-model Chinese surface-to-air missiles. 

The intelligence partnership between Moscow and Belgrade has grown particularly close. Under Vučić, the relationship between Serbia's spy agency, known as BIA, and its Russian counterparts has blossomed. Russian military intelligence, known as GRU, has a robust presence in Serbia, using its bases there to spy on NATO forces in neighboring Kosovo. In 2023, BIA's boss, Aleksandar Vulin, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department over his dubious links to Moscow. After that, Vulin was promoted to deputy prime minister. 

There's increasing spy-directed ideological harmony between Moscow and Belgrade. The former has its “Russian World” concept to unite Russians outside the borders of the Russian Federation, which is viewed as a threat by Russia's neighbors. Belgrade has recently developed an identical “Serbian World” concept to encompass Serbs living outside Serbia. 

Vučić has ventured deeper into Moscow's orbit as his government has been rattled by major popular protests against corruption. Facing angry marches in cities across Serbia, Vučić sought Russian help. Last month, Vulin, who is considered Moscow's top man in Belgrade, stated that Russian intelligence agencies had aided his government against the protests. Vulin made this statement after he met with Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service or SVR. Widespread allegations that the government had used acoustic weapons against protesters were rebutted by Belgrade, which enlisted the help of Russia's Federal Security Service. To nobody's surprise, FSB investigators sided with Vučić, denying that any acoustic weapons were employed.

IS IT REALLY THE PERFECT TIME TO BOMB IRAN?

The current relationship between Russia and Serbia can be summed up with the case of Dmitry Iordanidi, an SVR officer who left Belgium in 2023 under a cloud, amid the expulsion of 20 Russian spies masquerading as diplomats in Brussels.

Moscow wanted to get Iordanidi, a rising SVR star, back into the field in Europe, but somewhere safe from NATO scrutiny. They elected to send him to Belgrade, of course.

Multiple states are suing the Trump administration to halt the implementation of President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs.

They said Trump's tariffs were unlawful and created chaos within the nation's economic system, the Associated Press reported. The lawsuit was filed in New York City on Wednesday at the U.S. Court of International Trade. Twelve states were listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit: Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Vermont.

The lawsuit argues that Trump overstepped his “lawful authority” in imposing the tariffs. 

“The Constitution assigns to Congress, not the President, the ‘Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,'” the lawsuit reads. “Yet over the last three months, the President has imposed, modified, escalated, and suspended tariffs by executive order, memoranda, social media post, and agency decree. These edicts reflect a national trade policy that now hinges on the President's whims rather than the sound exercise of his lawful authority.”

The states also claimed that by implementing these tariffs, Trump “upended the constitutional order.”

“By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,” the 12 states said in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit also claimed that the president does not have the power to impose tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is the law that Trump said gave him the right to impose the tariffs. 

“The President has no authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs as he has done here,” the plaintiffs stipulate in the lawsuit's introduction. “The text and history of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — the statute the President has invoked for the most damaging of his tariffs — confirm that the President cannot impose such tariffs under that law. And even if it did, it would not allow the worldwide tariffs he has imposed, which were not a response to an emergency as IEEPA defines it and have no nexus to the circumstances that purported to justify them.”  

New York Attorney General Letitia James, representing the state as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, criticized Trump's tariff policy, claiming that he raised taxes “on a whim.”

“The president does not have the power to raise taxes on a whim, but that's exactly what President Trump has been doing with these tariffs,” James said.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called the president's tariff policies “reckless” and “illegal.”

“President Trump's insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless — it is illegal,” Mayes said. “Arizona cannot afford President Trump's massive tax increase. No matter what the White House claims, tariffs are a tax that will be passed on to Arizona consumers.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","White House turbulence seeps into second Trump term","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3388571/trump-white-house-turbulence-second-term/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Fissures within the Trump administration have started to form as rivalries over trade and even Defense Department operations bring the infighting of the president's first term roaring back to life.

The White House was praised in the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term for chief of staff Susie Wiles's discipline over infighting, leaking, and chaos that plagued the first administration. But now, advisers have begun to turn on each other privately and publicly as the fallout from Trump's decision to slap most U.S. trade partners with higher tariffs, then pause those tariffs, and battle China in a trade war has thrown the financial markets into a tailspin.

Elon Musk, who is taking a step back from the administration, sparred with top Trump trade advisers over his disapproval of the “Liberation Day” tariffs. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials who worked under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have taken to the media to air out dirty laundry and call for his ouster, in a remarkable display of disloyalty that Trump usually abhors.

Several Pentagon staffers have lost their jobs after the Atlantic's top editor was given access to a Signal group chat detailing plans of a U.S. airstrike on Yemen, along with the revelation from the New York Times that Hegseth shared the sensitive Yemen plans in a second Signal group chat with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.

All of the infighting is now threatening Trump's 100-day legacy of dominance.  

“It was inevitable that the tight, disciplined operation that was the campaign would become less tight, less disciplined as the administration formed and the circle enlarged to include hundreds, if not thousands, of appointees and staff, many of whom are political actors in their own right,” Republican strategist Dennis Lennox said.

As Hegseth remains determined to hang on to his job, his former employees are not holding back their criticism of the department under his leadership.

Most notably, John Ullyot, a former chief Pentagon spokesman, wrote for Politico that there is “total chaos at the Pentagon” and urged Trump to fire Hegseth.

Ullyot pushed back against claims that several officials at the Pentagon who have been forced out or placed on leave were leaking sensitive information to the media. Joe Kasper, Hegseth's former chief of staff, also left the Pentagon in the aftermath of Signalgate. 

“Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door,” he wrote after mentioning Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser, Darin Selnick, former deputy chief of staff, and Colin Carroll, former chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg.

In a joint statement, Caldwell, Carroll, and Selnick said they were “incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended.”

“Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door,” they continued in a rebuttal of their former employer. 

Joint statement from Dan Caldwell, Colin Carroll, and Darin Selnick: We are incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended. Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door. All…

The comments are unique for a department that prioritizes decorum and eschews partisanship, yet they paint a picture of a Pentagon in turmoil.

“It's total dysfunction and amateur hour,” Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University, said about the Pentagon in an interview with the Washington Examiner. 

Angie Wong, a Miami GOP committeewoman, claimed that “a lot of the fall guys” were Hegseth's own staff members, which has bolstered Democratic calls for Hegseth to resign.

Simultaneously, backstabbing was interfering with Trump's desire “to have a nice, clean, 100 days, where he pushes through his agenda,” Wong said. 

The Trump White House has defended Hegseth despite growing calls for his resignation.

Hegseth attempted to downplay the severity of his actions during an interview at his former workplace this week. 

“What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination [and] other things,” Hegseth told Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade on Tuesday morning. “That's what I've said from the beginning.”

After NPR reported that the administration was shopping around for a new defense secretary, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, quickly denounced the report. 

The story is “total FAKE NEWS based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about,” Leavitt wrote Monday on X. “As the President said this morning, he stands strongly behind” Hegseth.

This ⁦@NPR⁩ story is total FAKE NEWS based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about. As the President said this morning, he stands strongly behind ⁦@SecDef⁩.  https://t.co/5Npig8968v

That same day, Leavitt also told reporters, “The president absolutely has confidence in Secretary Hegseth.” 

The support has led some GOP experts to say that Hegseth will not lose his job.

“I do not expect Pete Hegseth to be let go as Secretary of Defense over this (and) certainly not in the short to medium term,” said Gregg Keller, a Republican consultant based in Missouri, who has talked with some Trump insiders. “Pete Hegseth may get thrown over at some point, but it won't be in the aftermath of this.” 

“First of all, that is Trump's psychology is never accept blame or defeat, and by throwing over Hegseth, he would be doing exactly that,” Keller continued. “He would be giving a scalp to the Left, to the Democrats, to the media. And I would be shocked to see him do that.”

Dallek also referenced Trump's affinity for “loyalists” compared to the establishment Republicans of his first term.

But questions about how long Hegseth will last, how Trump will deescalate trade wars, and how long the president can continue to use the executive branch to steamroll Congress have dominated the narrative about the White House.

“I think most Republican senators knew that Hegseth wasn't qualified,” Dallek said, referencing reports that the defense secretary had struggled with alcoholism before his promotion. “He and some of the other appointments, I think, were clearly not ready for prime time. And so they might be more loyal to Trump, but they don't necessarily have the kind of professionalism or gravitas or experience and achievement that would lend a sort of a smooth-running, button-down operation.”

Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) appeared to call for Hegseth's ouster in an interview with Politico this week.

“I'm not in the White House, and I'm not going to tell the White House how to manage this … but I find it unacceptable, and I wouldn't tolerate it if I was in charge,” Bacon said.

Trump's fascination with using tariffs as a means to negotiate with the nation's trade partners has not largely panned out, despite the president's veneer of confidence.

“We have a lot of action going on,” Trump told reporters Wednesday morning when asked about the tariffs. “We are making a lot of money in this country. This country is not going to be losing money on trade anymore. We are losing $2 trillion a year on trade. Now we're going to be making money, a lot of money. So that's very good.”

But Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool has not been without strife, as some of his top officials have sparred publicly as the situation progressed and financial tumult grew.

Peter Navarro, the president's chief trade adviser, was subject to DOGE adviser Elon Musk's ire after repeatedly downplaying any negotiations with trade partners as the Liberation Day tariffs spooked the global markets, even as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said trade deals were ongoing.

Musk notably slammed Navarro calling him “a moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” on social media.

Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks. @IfindRetards @RealPNavarro https://t.co/gECgtZt5Sc

Leavitt, however, said the spat was not a sign of disunity within the White House.

“These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs,” she said during a press briefing. “Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue.”

Musk and Bessent have also reportedly had problems, with Axios reporting that the two got into a shouting match last week in the White House over the IRS. Disagreement between the two men had previously been reported over the installation of Gary Shapley as the interim head of the IRS rankled Bessent, who reportedly felt Musk had interfered to get him placed.

Bessent, who oversees the agency, complained to Trump about the appointment, according to the New York Times, with the president shortly thereafter replacing Shapley with Michael Faulkender, Bessent's deputy.

When asked about the disagreement between Bessent and Musk, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the outlet, “It's no secret President Trump has put together a team of people who are incredibly passionate about the issues impacting our country.”

Meanwhile, Trump has tamped down his bitter recriminations against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which had begun to rock the stock market.

“I have no intention of firing him,” Trump said Tuesday, backtracking on previous comments. “I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates. It's the perfect time to lower interest rates.”

Trump's tariff woes are not the only problems he has on the financial front. His efforts to trim the budget have spooked Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have even gone so far as to pause town halls with constituents.

“It's not at all surprising that we're starting to see cracks and even before Liberation Day,” Dallek added. “If we look at what Elon Musk has done with DOGE, that's not a well-run, highly functional machine.”

Musk, the tech billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, announced Tuesday that he will spend “significantly” less time on DOGE beginning in May following the financial decline in Tesla earnings.

HEGSETH PRAISES DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST 100 DAYS AS TENSIONS AT PENTAGON CONTINUE

Before that, Trump told Cabinet members that Musk would step back amid tensions that Musk's DOGE, which has trimmed the federal workforce and shuttered agencies, was causing concerns for the administration and Republican lawmakers across the nation.

“He had his honeymoon period, and it kind of went away really quickly,” Wong said of Trump's leadership. “The more and more Republicans I'm talking to these days, they're having buyer's remorse.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Not local enough: The Montgomery County Public Schools case","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/3389230/mahmoud-v-taylor-montgomery-county-public-schools-case/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The Supreme Court heard arguments this week in Mahmoud v. Taylor, in which parents from Montgomery County, Maryland, challenged the public school system for the right to opt their young children out from exposure to books on LGBT themes.

The case appears, on the surface, to reverse long-standing views of the role of local government. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, defended not federal intervention to prevent discrimination but local governments' rights to make their own rules. The plaintiffs in the case, a religiously diverse cultural traditionalist group of Muslim, Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox parents, are looking to the nation's highest court to discipline their local school board.

Historically, it has been conservatives defending local government as a bulwark of democracy, while progressives looked to limit it. Indeed, arch-progressive Woodrow Wilson, in his prepresidency life as a political scientist, observed that Washington does not govern American communities but, rather, that “they govern themselves.” Wilson, of course, did much to change that.

But taking a closer look at Montgomery County, a jurisdiction of 1.1 million residents with a school system of 160,000, the 14th largest in the United States, reveals that the problem parents are facing lies squarely in the unusually large size. Montgomery County's school governance is not local enough. It has just one elected school board that governs countywide, setting the rules for cities ranging from Silver Spring to Rockville to Gaithersburg, along with a large number of smaller towns with diverse demographics.

In many states, notably in “home-rule” states such as those of New England and the Mid-Atlantic, each of these municipalities would have its own school board and public school system, with the capacity to set its own rules and the discretion to set its own curricular policies.

Compare, for instance, Montgomery County, with its single, unitary school board, with the situation in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, a major suburban Boston area analogous to Montgomery's relationship to metro Washington. Notwithstanding the fact that Norfolk has a smaller population, 787,000, it has 22 individual school districts. Although school choice discussion today focuses on the use of vouchers and the advent of charter schools, smaller, home-rule school systems are themselves a form of choice. As Charles Tiebout observed in his classic 1956 essay, A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures, municipalities compete for residents based on the market basket of public goods they offer. There is simply no such competition in Montgomery County when it comes to schools.

In metro Boston, this competition has served students well. In a 2000 paper, economist Caroline Hoxby asked, Does Competition Among Public Schools Serve Students and Taxpayers Well? Her answer was positive: “My results suggest that metropolitan areas with greater Tiebout choice have more productive public schools.”

But what's at issue in the Montgomery County case is less about school quality and more about the rights of parents to choose a system with which they are culturally comfortable. The existence of individual, small school systems enables that by, in effect, magnifying the power of their vote.

Winning an at-large, or countywide, seat on the Montgomery County Board of Education in 2024 required 212,000 votes. Winning a seat on the elected School Committee in Brookline, Massachusetts, one of the nation's top school systems, required just 5,400 votes in a town of some 60,000. Put another way, one's vote simply carries more weight when it is one of a smaller number of total votes.

IS IT REALLY THE PERFECT TIME TO BOMB IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM?

As it happens, I was a longtime resident of Brookline, and when the school system pushed for an unpopular curricular change, dropping an Advanced Placement history course, popular opinion forced its restoration. This is far more difficult in an election in which hundreds of thousands of votes are cast, and in which special interests, such as Weingarten's teachers union, are in a financial position to exercise disproportionate influence.

Simply put, if there were 20 school systems in Montgomery County rather than just one, it is far less likely that aggrieved parents would have had to take their cause to the Supreme Court. They could have employed public school choice — and the ballot box. There's another solution to their problem: Break up the Montgomery County school system.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A conversation with Sen. Chris Van Hollen about Kilmar Abrego Garcia's detention — and where America goes from here.

by  Miles Bryan

Since being deported to El Salvador last month, Kilmar Abrego Garcia has had very little contact with the outside world — something that Democratic Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen tried to change. 

Last week, Van Hollen flew to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who the Trump administration has admitted was deported from Maryland in error. But the White House has since doubled down on claims that he is a member of the MS-13 gang, with Stephen Miller, a top Trump domestic policy adviser, saying, “This was the right person sent to the right place.”Van Hollen was initially denied access to Abrego Garcia. But officials in El Salvador eventually relented, and arranged a meeting at the senator's hotel. Abrego Garcia told Van Hollen about his experience at El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT), a massive prison, and his traumatic isolation from the outside world. 

Abrego Garcia's detention has pushed the United States to the brink of a constitutional showdown. The Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return to the US — an order that the White House has shown little intention of heeding. 

“This goes to the heart of protecting people's rights and what bullies do and what authoritarian leaders do,” Van Hollen told Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram. “And what Donald Trump is doing is beginning by picking on the most vulnerable and refusing to bring his case in the courts, and when the courts rule, ignoring them.” 

Van Hollen talked to Today, Explained about what he heard from Abrego Garcia, and why he believes this case has pushed the United States into a constitutional crisis. Below is a transcript of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. Make sure to listen to the whole thing.

Why was it so important to you to go down to El Salvador to meet with this one man?

I wanted to let him know, number one, that I was bringing greetings from his family who haven't heard from him since he disappeared. He was locked away. No one was able to reach him — not his wife, not his mom, not his lawyers. In fact, until this moment, I'm the only one who's communicated with him before or since. So I wanted to, number one, see if he was alive.

But I also wanted him to know that his case was something that was meaningful to every American who cares about the Constitution. And I wanted to ask the government of El Salvador to stop being complicit with the Trump administration in this illegal scheme. So it was to defend the rights of this person because if we don't defend the right of this individual, we do threaten rights for everybody who lives here.

The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has allied himself with President Donald Trump, has called Abrego Garcia a terrorist, and said he would never return him. How hard did that make it for you to actually sit down with him?

My view is this: The courts of the United States have said that he was illegally taken away. When I met with the vice president of El Salvador, I asked him if they had any evidence that he had committed any criminal acts. And his answer was, “No. We've got him in our jail” — and he was originally at CECOT, which is one of the most notorious prisons in Latin America — “we've got him there because the United States is paying us to do it.” That was his answer. 

And I said, “Do you really want to be part of this illegal scheme with Donald Trump in violation of constitutional rights in the United States?” His answer was, “We got to deal with them, they're paying us and if the Trump administration tells us, we'll let them go. But we're being paid, we got a contract. And so we're gonna keep them locked up.”

And so how did you end up getting to meet him?

Well, I asked the vice president. He said no. I said, “If I come back next week, can I meet with him?” No. “Well, maybe I could get him on the phone?” No. 

So the next day, I decided not to give up. I drove towards CECOT prison, about three kilometers out, and I was waved to the side of the road by soldiers. I said, “Why are you stopping me?” They said, “You can't go to see Abrego Garcia.” And I said, “Do you know how he's doing?” They said no. And I say, “Why can't I go?” They said, “We have orders.” 

So then we had some events in El Salvador with local press. And they did relent. And I think that even Bukele recognized that it was a bad look for El Salvador to not allow anybody to meet or talk with this guy, to even know whether he was alive. As I was sort of getting ready to go to the airport on the way home, we got a call and I ended up meeting with him. 

What did he tell you? 

First and foremost, he told me he missed his family and I told him how much his family missed him. And he said that thinking of them is what gave him strength every day. He said he had had a traumatic experience — that was his word, “traumatic.” 

He said he tried to make a phone call from the Baltimore Detention Center. They wouldn't let him do it. And then of course he landed in this really awful CECOT prison. So he was traumatized. He said he hurt, he felt he was in pain, and said he hadn't committed any crimes. 

And he asked me to pass his message of love back to his family. I informed him — because he'd been in a total news blackout — his case was now representative of the fight for constitutional rights and due process for everybody who lives in America, and that a lot of people were working to get him out of prison in accordance with the Supreme Court order to facilitate his return.

What was the prison like?

The first place he went was CECOT and he said he was not in fear for safety from the prisoners in his cell. He said, if I recall right, there were about 25 prisoners in his cell. He said he was scared and traumatized by other prisoners in other cells, and these cells are packed. I mean, they sometimes have more than 100 prisoners, and he says that they would call out to him and taunt him and that did make him feel very much at risk. 

He told me that he'd been moved to this other prison and detention center in Santa Ana. He told me he'd been there about eight days. This is when I met with them, which were sort of better conditions, but still, and I wanna stress this, still no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world and to learn anything about what's happening. That's a violation of international law to deny somebody the ability to talk to their lawyer or family. So that's where he is sitting as we speak.

When you guys met up, there were some photos released and it looks like you had margarita glasses or something in front of you. Where did that come from? Where exactly was this meeting?

They brought him to my hotel. At first they wanted to stage the meeting by the pool, to create this impression, to deceive people, thinking that he was in some tropical paradise when he'd been in one of the worst prisons in El Salvador.

During our conversation, the government folks from Bukele instructed the waiters to set two taller-looking glasses on our table, making it look like margaritas. I have no idea what's in them because neither of us touched them, but they had a little cherry on top and they had either salt or sugar on the rim. 

I think it shows the lengths that Bukele and Trump will go to deceive the American people about what's happening, right? Here's a guy, illegally abducted, ends up in the worst prison — and they want to create this impression that, “Hey, he's just in paradise.” 

Republicans are leaning into this message that Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang. What do you make of that?

You know, my point on all of this, Sean, is that they should bring those facts before the court and Trump should not just be spending all his time on social media. Put up or shut up in federal court. And I wanna quote the federal judge in this case: She said that the Trump administration had presented, quote, “no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or to any terrorist activity.” Period. Put up or shut up in court. I'm not vouching for the man. I'm standing up for his rights because all of our rights are at risk if we don't.

You're not only saying we have to focus on constitutional rights. You're saying this situation with Abrego Garcia is a constitutional crisis. You say constitutional crisis, [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom says distraction. How do we reconcile those two assessments of this very serious situation?

This is a fundamental constitutional issue, and it is a crisis because the Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration has to help facilitate his return to the United States. 

I also do just want to briefly quote what the Fourth Circuit said. This is a three-judge panel, and the chief judge who wrote it is a guy called Judge Wilkinson — he was appointed by Reagan. Here's what he says: “It is difficult in some cases to get to the heart of the matter. But in this case, it's not hard at all. The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.” 

So this is not a distraction. This goes to the heart of protecting people's rights and what bullies do and what authoritarian leaders do. And what Donald Trump is doing is beginning by picking on the most vulnerable and refusing to bring his case in the courts, and when the courts rule, ignoring them. So this is a very important moment to protect everyone's constitutional rights. It's not about one person. It's about all of us.

With near daily strikes against Yemen's Houthis, is there an end in sight?

by  Joshua Keating

President Donald Trump has, in the past, described America's military involvement in the Middle East as “the worst decision ever made” and came into office vowing to to “end these endless wars.” 

In some areas, the administration has followed through. The US has begun a major drawdown of US troops in Syria, following through on a goal dating back to Trump's first term, and is threatening to “walk away” from its involvement in the war in Ukraine, with or without a deal to end the fighting. 

But at the same time, the administration has quietly enmeshed US forces in yet another open-ended conflict in the Middle East, one that risks turning into exactly the sort of draining, distracting quagmire that Trump had pledged to avoid.

On March 15, the US began a campaign of airstrikes, known as “Operation Rough Rider,” against the Houthis, the Iran-backed militant group that controls much of Yemen and has been firing at commercial ships and military vessels in the Red Sea since the beginning of the war in Gaza in 2023.

The Biden administration, as well as Israel's military, also carried out a number of strikes against the Houthis, but the ongoing US campaign is far more extensive. There have been at least 250 reported airstrikes so far, according to open-source data collected by the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute. 

According to some reports, more than 500 Houthi fighters have been killed, including a number of senior commanders, though the group tends to be tight-lipped about its casualties. The Yemen Data Project, a monitoring group, also documented more than 200 civilian casualties in the first month of bombing. The largest strike so far, on a key oil terminal on Yemen's coast, killed more than 74 people last week. 

The strikes have destroyed “command and control facilities, weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,” a US defense official told Vox.

The administration seems satisfied with the results so far. 

The ongoing strikes against the Houthis are “the first operation of this scale that the US has conducted against Houthi forces, and they really are on their back foot right now,” Peter Nguyen, the National Security Council's director of strategic communications, told Vox. 

Responding to criticism directed at Pete Hegseth, the embattled defense secretary, over the use of a personal device to conduct sensitive government business, Trump recently told reporters to “ask the Houthis how he's doing.”

With the exception of the accidental leak of the administration's war plans via Signal last month, the operation has gotten little public attention or debate, which is fairly remarkable given its scale. 

Undoubtedly, the Houthis are sustaining damage, but the group's resources and equipment are scattered and hidden across a wide area, making them difficult to target. The record of superpowers defeating insurgent groups with airpower is not inspiring. 

“With air strikes alone, you're not going to be able to defeat the Houthis,” Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemeni defense analyst, told Vox, pointing out that the group had survived eight years of a punishing air campaign by a Saudi-led military force supplied by the United States. 

US officials say the goal is not to wipe out the Houthis, but for them to stop their attacks on shipping through the Red Sea, which virulently anti-Israel, Iran-aligned group began in response to Israel's war in Gaza.

“They've got to say ‘no mas,'” to those attacks in order for the bombing to stop, Trump has said. The Houthis announced a pause on their attacks on shipping when a ceasefire went into effect in Gaza in January, but resumed attacks in early March in response to Israel blocking aid into Gaza. 

The Red Sea has been fairly quiet since Operation Rough Rider began, but the Houthis have vowed to continue fighting and have launched a number of missiles and drones at Israel, including one on Wednesday.

“Attacks against shipping in the Red Sea need to stop, and so our operations will continue until that happens,” Nguyen said. “As soon as they stop, then we're probably fine. But they haven't, and we assess that the will for them to continue operations is still there.”

Indeed, in a defiant speech this week, the president of the Houthi-backed government, Mahdi al-Mashat, declared that the group was “undeterred by missiles, bombs, or strategic bombers, Trump” and mocked Trump for having “stumbled into a strategic quagmire.”

A little more than a month in, it's still too soon to declare a quagmire. 

But the resources devoted to the conflict have been significant. The Pentagon has moved a second aircraft carrier group to the region to join one already there. It has also relocated at least two Patriot missile batteries as well as a THAAD missile defense system — one of the most advanced systems in the US arsenal — from Asia to the Middle East. 

The strikes are not just about the Houthis. They are also widely seen as a demonstration of strength toward the group's main patron, Iran.

The New York Times has reported that in just the first three weeks of the campaign, the US used $200 million worth of munitions, and that military officials are concerned about its impact on stocks the Navy would need in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. 

Contrary to the hopes of many in the Trump administration — including Vice President JD Vance — who argue the US should be shifting its focus from the Middle East to prepare for a potential conflict with China, the US is shifting resources from Asia to the Middle East.

Assuming the Houthis don't say “no mas” in the immediate future, the question becomes how long the US will sustain the operation. This week, the White House released a legally required report to Congress on the operation, stating that the strikes would continue until the “Houthi threat to United States forces and navigational rights and freedoms in the Red Sea and adjacent waters has abated.” But the Wall Street Journal has also recently reported that officials are considering winding the strikes down. 

That's a scenario that worries Basha, the Yemeni analyst. The Houthis, until recently a fairly obscure group outside its region, have already taken Yemen's capital, survived a years-long war by the Saudi-led coalition, and — since October 7, 2023 — proven themselves arguably most capable and resilient of Iran's proxies in the Middle East. 

“If they're not curtailed or defeated or weakened by this, they're going to be able to say, ‘We defeated Trump, the strongest military in the world. We're unstoppable,'” Basha said.

As for restoring shipping through the Red Sea, transits through the strategically vital waterway were up slightly last month, but still well below the levels from before the Houthi attacks began in October 2023. It will likely take a long period of calm for shipping companies — and more importantly, the companies that insure them — to assume the risk has abated. 

The alternative could be the US becoming even more deeply involved in the conflict. The Obama administration's campaign against ISIS also began as an air operation before it was deemed necessary to send in ground troops and back local armed groups, frustrating an administration that had also vowed to scale back US military involvement in the Middle East. 

The internationally backed Yemeni factions opposed to the Houthis are reportedly considering taking advantage of this moment to launch a ground campaign to oust the group once and for all. US officials have not yet made a decision on whether to back that operation. 

Most analysts and officials say American troops participating in ground operations in Yemen is highly unlikely, but even more limited support for a ground operation would still be another case of the US backing armed groups in a messy Middle Eastern civil war — exactly the sort of situation Trump has blasted previous administrations for falling into.

That said, the strikes are not just about the Houthis. They are also widely seen as a demonstration of strength toward the group's main patron, Iran. The administration is currently locked in a new round of negotiations over Iran's nuclear program and Trump has not ruled out military action — likely led by Israel — against the Iranians if those talks fail. 

It's still possible the US could simply move on from Yemen quickly, but judging by recent history, it would not be a surprise if the promised American pivot away from war in the Middle East was once again put on hold.

Canary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.

by  Zack Beauchamp

About nine years ago, a new organization called Canary Mission released a YouTube video describing their mission: maintaining a blacklist of anti-Israel college students.

American campuses, the video warns, had become hotbeds of anti-Israel extremism: safe spaces for students to attend “Jew-hating conferences and anti-American rallies.” To fight this, Canary Mission would build an extensive database of students and professors who engaged in anti-Israel activity. The primary intent, per the video, is to ensure that anti-Israel students cannot find gainful employment after graduation.

“These individuals are applying for jobs within your company,” the Canary Mission video warns. “It is your duty to ensure that today's radicals are not tomorrow's employees.”

Over the course of the next decade, Canary Mission — which takes its name from the expression “canary in the coal mine” — delivered on its promise. 

Its database now contains mini-profiles of thousands of students and professors, and has expanded to include professionals like doctors and nurses. People listed in the database have been harassed, disciplined, and even fired. Israeli intelligence has used Canary Mission profiles as justification for detaining listed visitors at the border.

And since the second Trump administration began, Canary Mission's targets have started to be deported from the United States.

After plainclothes officers arrested Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk on the streets of Boston in late March, Öztürk's attorneys claimed the sole reason for her arrest was her Canary Mission profile. While the Trump administration claims she had engaged in activity “in support of Hamas,” the private Homeland Security memo justifying her detention only cited an op-ed she had written in support of boycotting Israel, using language very similar to her Canary Mission page. 

The organization, for its part, is happy to take the credit (though it did not respond to my request for comment). After Öztürk's arrest, Canary Mission's X account posted a celebratory tweet claiming “sources point to her Canary Mission profile as the primary cause.” It currently maintains a list of seven other students and professors who it believes should be targeted for deportation. Two of these, Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, are currently in ICE custody. Mahdawi was arrested after his name appeared on this list (Khalil was arrested before it was published).

Canary Mission's rise is not really a story about one organization, or even the toxic climate of America's Israel-Palestine debate. Rather, it is a case study in how civil society organizations — normally seen as pillars of liberal democratic life — can become agents of illiberalism. And when such groups can align themselves with a friendly government, the danger rises exponentially.

There are many pro-Israel activist in groups in the United States, and many that focus on college campuses specifically. But Canary Mission is unusual in two respects: its opaque structure and extremely aggressive tactics.

Canary Mission's website does not list a president, board, or a staff directory. On paper, its headquarters are in Israel — specifically Beit Shemesh, a medium-sized city near Jerusalem. Yet the address listed on its paperwork is in a padlocked, seemingly abandoned building.

Over the years, reporters have identified some of the Canary Mission's revenue streams — including significant donations from some prominent American Jewish philanthropies. But much of the Canary Mission's funding remains anonymous due to its use of a pass-through group, called Central Fund of Israel (CFI). 

Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them.

American donors can give to CFI without having to disclose whether the money is earmarked for Canary Mission, and CFI can disburse funds to Canary without noting their original source. It's an unusual setup that effectively allows Canary Mission to keep its funding sources fully anonymous.

“It really stands out when you look at other similar organizations in the same ecosystem,” says Yousef Munayyer, the head of the Israel-Palestine program at the Arab Center think tank in DC. “I can't think of another one that hides their funding like this.”

The obvious irony — that an organization dedicated to naming and shaming is itself so opaque — is palpable. But it is necessary, in part, because Canary Mission has been a lightning rod for controversy even within the pro-Israel community.

No matter what you think about pro-Israel groups' views of American college campuses, they clearly have the right to express their views and organize around them. And many of these groups engage in political activity — like documenting Jewish students' concerns about campus antisemitism or creating new right-leaning Middle East studies journals — that are within the confines of legitimate debate and activism in a democratic society.

But Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them. 

Lila Corwin Berman, a historian of Jewish philanthropy at New York University, dates this approach to roughly the early 2000s. During that time, pro-Israel organizations like Campus Watch and the David Project began publicly targeting professors and students that they believed had engaged in unacceptable speech. 

These efforts were haphazard at the outset, publishing specific attacks on allegedly problematic scholars rather than maintaining a full-on blacklist. Canary Mission's database, first unveiled in 2014, represented a qualitative escalation — one explicitly aimed at creating professional problems for anti-Israel activists.

This was highly controversial. In 2018, pro-Israel campus groups at five major universities published a joint op-ed calling on the movement to repudiate Canary Mission.

“We are compelled to speak out against this website because it uses intimidation tactics, is antithetical to our democratic and Jewish values, is counterproductive to our efforts and is morally reprehensible,” they wrote.

This internal criticism did not do much to stop the Canary Mission's growth, fueled as it was by unaccountable backers. Today, Canary Mission's searchable database is vast — containing entries for over 2,000 individuals across 38 states, DC, and five Canadian provinces. 

To understand why Canary Mission is so controversial, start by looking at how its blacklist works.

Each individual listing contains both a dossier documenting the target's alleged offenses and their contact information, including direct links to their social media accounts that can facilitate targeted harassment campaigns. The only official way to get an entry deleted is to release a public apology with evidence of new pro-Israel beliefs; these testimonials are then posted on the “ex-Canary” segment of the Mission's website.

Some Canary Mission targets have said or done something that many would find offensive, such as endorsing the October 7, 2023, massacre. But the vast majority of profiles I could find were individuals who either attended a pro-Palestinian rally or wrote something critical about Israel's policies towards the Palestinians.

Canary Mission will describe this banal activity in threatening terms, like “attending a pro-Hamas rally.” But the speech in question is more than just legally protected: It is exactly the sort of political activity that people in a democracy are supposed to use as a vehicle for expressing their opinion. The Mission's database isn't primarily about identifying examples of extreme anti-Israel speech or political violence — it is about trying to silence any criticism of Israel by labeling it antisemitic or pro-terrorist.

Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student facing deportation, is a case in point.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

The Canary Mission profile that reportedly led to her ICE arrest listed a single offense — an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper calling on the university to (among other things) “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” Agree or disagree with these positions, advocating for them is clearly legitimate political speech. There is no plausible case that people like Öztürk constitute any kind of threat to Jews on campus. That she is listed by Canary Mission — and that the organization publicly cheered her arrest — reveals its primary interest in policing speech critical of Israel by any means necessary.

This can also be seen by the sheer number of Jewish students and professors on the Canary Mission's database.

The American Jewish community is fairly left-wing; roughly two-thirds disapprove of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government. While a strong majority supports Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state, large numbers of American Jews believe its occupation of Palestinian territory is both strategically unwise and morally indefensible. There is also a minority of anti-Zionist American Jews, more prominent in younger generations, who support the dissolution of Israel and its replacement with a binational state.

If you scan the Canary Mission database, Jewish students and scholars make up many of the entries. Reading their dossiers, like the profile of eminent Holocaust historian Omer Bartov, their alleged offenses include everything from criticizing the Netanyahu government's approach to judicial reform to attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration.

If Canary Mission were truly about protecting Jews' rights to participate freely in campus life, then it wouldn't include them on a database explicitly designed to hurt their career prospects.

We don't know for a fact that the Trump administration is using Canary Mission's database to identify deportation targets. There is suggestive evidence: The wording in the State Department memo justifying Öztürk's deportation, for example, is very similar to what appeared on her Canary profile). But so far, there is no direct proof of a link.

The depressing thing is that it makes all the sense in the world.

Yet regardless of whether Canary Mission entries are currently directing policy, it's clear they wish to be seen as doing so. They do this not only by maintaining their list of seven people they wish were deported, but also posting messages in support for actual deportations with slogans like “pro-Hamas extremism has consequences” and “no more safe havens for terror supporters.”

These messages demonstrate an undeniable hostility to basic liberal values. Canary Mission has graduated from “merely” advocating professional consequences for pro-Palestinian voices to endorsing outright state repression against them. They are sliding down a slippery slope at a rapid clip.

The depressing thing is that it makes all the sense in the world. 

The idea of trying to silence political opponents rather than debate them is dangerous. There are certainly cases where speech merits consequences: If a professor says discriminatory things about Jewish students, for example, or an activist advocates violence against her peers. But these are generally seen as exceptions rather than rules in free societies: the “boundary cases” where toleration for political expression runs up against other important values.

Canary Mission was founded on the opposite principle: that an entire category of speech, pro-Palestinian advocacy, should be treated as presumptively illegitimate. They believe the cause of defending Israel is best served not by engaging in rigorous debate and advocacy, but by making a giant list of people who believe the “wrong” things and ensuring they suffer consequences for those beliefs. 

This is illiberalism as practiced by civil society — and is, necessarily, less dangerous than illiberalism enforced by the state. But when illiberalism takes root in an influential sector of society, such as pro-Israel activism, it becomes a potential ally for an illiberal regime. 

No elected leader can turn a democracy into an authoritarian regime on their own. They need partners, influential people and organizations that can operate to weaken resistance to democratic backsliding and help create a climate of fear in which anti-government activity is perceived as costly.

The go-to examples are usually people with physical power and money — generals, police chiefs, and the wealthy elite. But there's a growing recognition that other social groups, even ones that seemingly lack soldiers or billions, can assist in undermining democracy's foundations.

In 2001, the political theorists Simone Chambers and Jeffrey Kopstein warned of a phenomenon they termed “bad civil society.” This is a phenomenon that they describe as “civic participation that weakens liberal democracy” — weaponizing the tools of organizing and activism to oppose the very democratic principles that allow them in the first place. 

At the time, it appeared that “illiberal forces are small, marginalized, and contained” in the United States. However, Chambers and Kopstein warned, this doesn't mean they'll always be irrelevant. 

Even if “illiberal forces cannot destabilize the state,” the authors write, “they can still “contribute to an insidious erosion of values that leaves liberalism vulnerable to all sorts of threat.”

Canary Mission's behavior in the past 10 years shows that this warning was prescient. The organization isn't just cheering Trump on from the sidelines; they have put together a public list of potential deportation targets. They are gleefully reveling in the fact that their longtime mission of suppressing speech is now backed by force of law.

Immigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.

by  Eric Levitz

President Donald Trump has been sending undocumented immigrants to a mega prison in El Salvador without due process. Most of these deportees have no criminal record, yet our government has condemned them to indefinite incarceration in an infamously inhumane penitentiary. 

In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration admits that its deportation order was unlawful. In 2019, a court had ruled that Abrego Garcia could not be sent to El Salvador, as he had a credible fear of being persecuted in that country. The White House attributed his deportation to an “administrative error.” 

The Supreme Court has ordered Trump to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, but the White House refuses to comply and has publicly vowed that Abrego Garcia is “never coming back.”

Some Democrats believe that their party must call attention to this lawless cruelty. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and four progressive House members have traveled to El Salvador in recent days to check on Abrego Garcia's condition and advocate for his due process rights. 

But other Democrats fear their party is walking into a political trap. After all, voters are souring on Trump's handling of trade and the economy, but still approve of his handling of immigration. Some Democratic strategists therefore think that Van Hollen and other progressive advocates for Abrego Garcia are doing the president a favor: By focusing on the plight of an undocumented immigrant — instead of the struggles of countless Americans suffering from Trump's tariffs — they have increased the salience of his best issue and reinforced the narrative that Democrats care more about foreigners than about the American middle class.

Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. 

As one strategist told CNN, “The impulse among lots of Democrats is to always crank the volume up to 11 and take advantage of whatever the easiest, most obvious photo opportunity is. In this case, you get a situation where you're giving the White House and the Republicans a lot of images and visuals that they think are compelling for them.”

Some progressives have declared this argument morally bankrupt. But I don't think that's right. Democrats have a moral responsibility to defend both America's constitutional order and its most vulnerable residents. It does not follow, however, that they have a moral duty to hold press events about Abrego Garcia's case — even if such photo ops do nothing to abet his liberation, while doing much to boost Trump's political standing. 

In my view, the argument that Democrats are doing more harm than good by taking a high-profile stand in favor of due process is not immoral, but simply mistaken. Van Hollen's trip has plausibly benefited US residents unlawfully detained in El Salvador. And the political costs of such dissent are likely negligible, so long as Democrats keep their messaging about immigration disciplined and eventually shift their rhetorical focus to Trump's economic mismanagement. 

So far as I can tell, no Democrat is arguing that the party should acquiesce to Trump's lawless deportations. The concerned strategist who spoke with CNN stipulated that “Democrats should stand up for due process when asked about it.” 

Rather, the argument is that 1) the party should not go out of its way to elevate immigration as an issue, or invite the impression that the rights of undocumented immigrants are its chief concern, and 2) congressional delegations to El Salvador risk doing precisely that. 

The case for this position is fairly simple. Voters are much more supportive of Trump's handling of immigration than of his economic management. In data journalist G. Elliott Morris's aggregation of recent issue surveys, voters approve of Trump's handling of immigration by 2.7 points, while disapproving of his approach to inflation and the cost of living by 21.8 points. 

Therefore, anything Democrats do to increase the salience of immigration plausibly aids Trump. What's more, elevating Abrego Garcia's cause above other issues could give voters the impression that Democrats are not prioritizing their own economic concerns. 

Or at least, this is what Republican strategists seem to believe. Following House progressives' trip to El Salvador, National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement, “House Democrats have proven they care more about illegal immigrant gang bangers than American families.” The NRCC proceeded to air digital ads against 25 swing-district Democrats, in which it offered to buy the representatives' airfare to El Salvador if they promised to “livestream the whole thing and snap plenty of selfies with their MS-13 buddies.”

For those urging Democrats to embrace message discipline, focusing on the due process rights of the undocumented is a lose-lose proposition, accomplishing nothing of substance while damaging the party politically. In this view, Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador did not actually help Abrego Garcia, whose fate still lies with America's court system and the White House. To the contrary, Democrats are effectively giving Trump an incentive to ship more undocumented immigrants to a foreign prison without due process. After all, the president wants his opponents to take high-profile stances in defense of the undocumented. If Democrats teach him that they will do precisely that — so long as he violates immigrants' due process rights — then they will have made such violations more likely in the future, not less.

Meanwhile, this faction of wary strategists insist that their party has a genuine image problem. Yes, Trump's tariffs are deeply unpopular. And as their economic impacts surface, the president's trade policies are liable to become more salient, no matter what Democrats say or do. But thus far, the public's declining confidence in Trump is not translating into rising confidence in the Democratic Party. 

Historically, Democrats always outperformed Republicans on the question of which party “cares more for the needs of people like you,” outpolling the GOP by 13 points on that score as recently as 2017. Yet in a Quinnipiac poll taken after Trump single-handedly engineered an economic crisis with his “Liberation Day” tariffs, the two parties are tied on that question.

What's more, even as the public sours on Trump, the GOP remains more popular than the Democratic Party. In a new Pew Research survey, voters disapproved of Trump's job performance by a 59 to 40 percent margin. Yet the Republican Party's approval rating in that same survey was 5 points higher than the Democrats', with only 38 percent of voters expressing support for the latter. 

Democrats have time to improve their image; the midterms are well over a year away. So some might wonder why the party should fret about increasing the salience of an unfavorable issue so far from Election Day. But there's an argument that the party should be doing everything in its power to increase its popularity — and reduce Trump's — right now. Businesses, universities, and various other civic institutions will need to decide in the coming weeks and months whether to comply with the president's illiberal attempts to discipline their behavior. The weaker Trump appears to be, the less likely it will be that American civil society acquiesces to authoritarianism.

Thus, from this vantage, message discipline is a moral imperative. Centering Democratic messaging on Abrego Garcia's case might help ambitious Democrats earn small-dollar donations and adoration among the party's base. But it undermines effective opposition to Trump's authoritarian regime. 

This argument is reasonable. But in my view, it understates the potential benefits of vigorous advocacy against Trump's lawless deportations and overstates the political harms. 

On the substance, Democratic officials flying to El Salvador to check on Abrego Garcia's condition could plausibly deter abuses against him and other immigrant detainees in that country. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele may be a reactionary aligned with Trump, but he is surely aware that the United States has a two-party system. His government therefore must give some thought to its relationship with a hypothetical future Democratic administration. Thus, by advocating so forcefully for US residents unlawfully imprisoned in El Salvador, the Democratic Party has given Bukele some incentive to, at a minimum, keep Abrego Garcia and others like him alive (something that his government routinely fails to do with its prisoners).

Meanwhile, bringing a measure of comfort to an American unlawfully disappeared to a foreign prison is a clear moral good. In an interview with Vox's Today, Explained podcast, Van Hollen said that Salvadoran authorities have not allowed Abrego Garcia to communicate with his family or his lawyers. Rather, they had kept him isolated from the entire outside world, until a US senator demanded a meeting with him. Only through Van Hollen's intervention was Abrego Garcia's wife able to send her greetings to him, or even confirm that her husband was still alive. If an elected official has the power to serve a constituent in this way, it seems worthwhile that they do so.

The prospect that Van Hollen might have effectively encouraged more unlawful deportations by taking this course of action — since Trump wants his opponents to do photo ops on behalf of undocumented immigrants — merits consideration. But it strikes me as far-fetched. One could just as easily posit that Democrats ducking this issue entirely would have emboldened Trump to ramp up unlawful deportations. Ultimately, I think the president's ambitions on this front will be determined by the scope and persistence of the judiciary's opposition, not by Democratic messaging.

It seems possible — perhaps, even likely — that Democrats loudly advocating for Abrego Garcia is politically suboptimal, relative to a monomaniacal focus on the economy. But so long as Democrats act strategically on other fronts, I think the political costs of taking a stand on due process are likely to be negligibly small, for at least five reasons:

First, as far as progressive immigration positions go, “The Trump administration should honor court orders and the due process rights of longtime US residents” is pretty safe territory. In March, a Reuters-Ipsos poll asked Americans whether Trump “should keep deporting people despite a court order to stop?” — they said no by a margin of 56 to 40 percent. And an Economist-YouGov poll released Wednesday found voters specifically agreeing that Trump should bring Abrego Garcia back by a 50 to 28 point margin.

If Democrats frame Abrego Garcia's case as a question of Americans' civil liberties — while reiterating their party's commitment to enforcing immigration law and securing the border — they should be able to mitigate any political cost inherent to elevating this issue. And that has largely been Van Hollen's message. As the senator argued at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, “I keep saying I'm not vouching for Abrego Garcia. I'm vouching for his constitutional rights because all our rights are at stake.” 

Second, there does seem to be some scope for eroding Trump's advantage on immigration. On March 1, polls showed voters approving of the president's immigration policies by more than 10 points. Surveys taken in the last 10 days, by contrast, show that margin has fallen to 2.5 points. It is unclear whether Democrats' messaging on the Abrego Garcia case had any impact on this decline. But given the timing, that possibility cannot be summarily dismissed

Third, some influential right-wingers endorse the Democratic position on Abrego Garcia. Last Thursday, pro-Trump podcaster Joe Rogan detailed his misgivings about the president's violations of due process:

What if you are an enemy of, let's not say any current president. Let's pretend we got a new president, totally new guy in 2028, and this is a common practice now of just rounding up gang members with no due process and shipping them to El Salvador, “You're a gang member.” “No, I'm not.” “Prove it.” “What? I got to go to court.” “No. No due process.”

Defending a principle mutually endorsed by Joe Rogan and the Roberts Court does not seem like the riskiest stand that Democrats could take.

Fourth, I'm not sure that the media's coverage of this controversy looks all that different in the alternate dimension where Democrats voiced opposition to Trump's actions when asked, but otherwise spoke exclusively about his failed economic policies. The president exiling US residents to a foreign prison — and refusing to attempt to repatriate one of them, in defiance of the Supreme Court — is a huge news story. This is a much more shocking and unprecedented event than the House GOP's quest to cut Medicaid, even if the latter will ultimately inspire more voter backlash. 

In a world where Van Hollen and his House colleagues never go to El Salvador, the general subject of immigration might have received marginally less media attention over the past week. But I think the effect here is quite small. 

Fifth, Democratic officials are not speaking out on this entirely at their own direction. Their party's base is understandably alarmed by the president's lawlessness. Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost said he traveled to El Salvador because he had received “hundreds and hundreds” of emails and calls from his constituents demanding action on this issue. Thus, there might be some cost to Democratic fundraising and morale, were the party's officials to uniformly avoid calling attention to the controversy. 

All this said, I think it's true that the optimal political strategy for Democrats is to focus overwhelmingly on economic issues. Voters are more concerned with prices and economic growth than with due process. And Trump is most vulnerable on tariffs, Medicaid cuts, and his economic management more broadly.

I just don't think that dedicating some time and energy to championing bedrock constitutional principles — 19 months before the midterm elections — is by itself a perilous indulgence. In any event, to this point, it has proven entirely compatible with driving down Trump's approval rating, which has fallen by 7 points since February in Pew's polling. 

Going forward, Democrats do need to convey that their top concern is Americans' living standards. If Trump moves ahead with anything resembling his current trade policy, his approval is likely to fall, irrespective of Democratic messaging. But the party needs to make sure that voters see it as an effective alternative on economic issues — one that cares more about the needs of people like them.

Throughout the US today, a large and growing number of small business owners, workers, and retirees are suffering as a direct result of Trump's mindless economic policies. If congressional Republicans get their way, millions more will lose their health insurance as a result of Trump's fiscal agenda. Democrats must find ways to elevate these stories. Van Hollen's decision to go to El Salvador evinced some verve and creativity. His party must apply similar energy to the task of dramatizing Trump's economic misgovernance and communicating their party's vision for redressing it.

Why early season heat waves are becoming more common and more dangerous.

by  Umair Irfan

We're only midway through spring, yet searing summer temperatures have already started baking some parts of the world. 

Cities like Phoenix and Palm Springs, California, closed in on triple digits in March; Phoenix usually doesn't reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit until May. This month, hundreds of millions of people across India and Pakistan experienced temperatures as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit, triggering power outages and protests. The heat has also created conditions for thousands of wildfires in the region. 

It's part of a pattern. Last year, heat waves coursed through Africa and Europe during the spring, setting new temperature records in more than a dozen countries. Mexico experienced a series of heat waves beginning in April. A heatwave in Texas in May sent power demand to a record high for the month. 

Heat waves are a distinct weather phenomenon where high temperatures linger for days at a time. As global average temperatures climb higher, the frequency and duration of periods of extreme heat are also growing, which is already hurting people around the world. 

But the human impacts of heat waves also vary depending on their timing. Climate change is leading to shorter winters, earlier springs, and earlier arrivals of extreme temperatures. Heat waves that occur early in the warm season, well before summer sets in, tend to cause greater harm to health.

“These early events can cause more heat-related illnesses and fatalities than later heat waves in June or July, even if temperatures are similar,” Davide Faranda, a climate scientist at the French National Center for Scientific Research studying extreme weather, wrote in an email. 

There are several factors behind this. One is acclimatization. When winter ends, people are less used to high temperatures at a physiological level. When ambient temperatures are higher than body temperatures, individuals absorb more heat, which can lead to heart and lung problems, first in vulnerable people — the very young, the very old, and those with underlying health concerns — then in everyone. In regions like South Asia, spring is when millions of farmers head outdoors to plant crops, where they can face dangerous temperatures while doing intense physical labor. Gradual exposure to heat over time can help people better withstand it, but without this familiarity, an early season heat wave can pack an unexpectedly strong punch. 

Heat has a cumulative and compounding effect on the body too when it doesn't let up.

Humans acclimatize through infrastructure and behavior as well. Drinking water helps limit the dangers of high temperatures, but someone might not be in the habit of staying adequately hydrated in the spring. A person may not recognize that heavy sweating, light headedness, and severe fatigue are symptoms of heat illness. 

Many buildings may still be set to heat rather than cooling when the first heat wave of the year sets in. The low availability of air conditioning in the Pacific Northwest contributed to the death toll of a severe heat wave in 2021 that killed at least 868 people. 

That's not to say that mid- or late summer heat waves aren't dangerous, too. Heat has a cumulative and compounding effect on the body too when it doesn't let up. Spells of high temperatures that last weeks and persist long after the sun has set have proven deadly.

To reduce the dangers of springtime heat, it's important to pay attention to weather forecasts and prepare accordingly. That means avoiding direct sunlight, proactively staying hydrated, and taking breaks during high temperatures. Ease into the warm weather. It's also essential to recognize the warning signs of heat-related complications and not to try to push past your limits.

The region spanning Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Iran, and Pakistan is home to more than a quarter of the world's population. It's also where scientists can see some of the strongest effects of human activity on temperature. “South Asia is one of the regions where the climate change signal in heat waves is particularly strong,” Faranda said.

Along with an international team of researchers, Faranda analyzed the factors behind the recent heat wave across India and Pakistan. The group found that events like the severe heat wave in April 2025 are 4 degrees Celsius warmer over the past three decades than they were in the period between 1950 and 1986. The team controlled for other factors that influence temperatures like urban air pollution and changes in land use. The recent scorching temperatures also took place at a time when the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, a major driver of global weather variability, was in its neutral phase. In its warm phase, it tends to drive up global temperatures, so seeing this heat wave without this additional boost adds to the evidence that climate change is a major contributor. 

Humidity is another important driver of heat risk. It can get pretty muggy in South Asia. One of the ways scientists track this is with the wet-bulb globe temperature, a metric that accounts for heat, humidity, and sunlight exposure. For a healthy, young person, the upper survival limit for wet-bulb globe temperature is 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Cities in Iran, India, and Pakistan now regularly cross that threshold. 

Precipitation also appears to be shifting in the region, with more spells of severe rainfall followed by drought. And as the planet continues to heat up, these trends will continue. “Future projections indicate that heat waves in South Asia are likely to start earlier in the year, last longer, and reach even higher peak temperatures,” Faranda said. 

While many factors are unique about South Asia, other regions of the world are on the same course. The same pattern of more frequent heat waves earlier in the season is also playing out in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, leading to similar problems.

“These impacts include increased mortality rate, and heat-related illnesses, disruption to local food supply and agriculture, and potential overload of power grids due to increased electricity demands,” Gianmarco Mengaldo, a professor at the National University of Singapore who co-authored the India-Pakistan heat wave analysis. 

The US is also facing an increase in the number of heat waves, with warming starting earlier in the year. 

It's leading to more complications from extreme heat as well as leading to longer, more intense pollen allergy seasons. 

Communities can take steps to mitigate the impacts of heat with design elements like green spaces and cool roofs that reflect sunlight rather than absorbing it. It's also critical to limit greenhouse gas emissions to slow the warming of the planet as a whole.

How a day off can (and can't) help children.

It's a stressful time to be a kid.

Young people are watching environmental disasters, school shootings, and economic and political uncertainty, all with a level of media (or at least social media) coverage that would have been unimaginable for previous generations. Against this backdrop, they're also expected to have their lives figured out by an early age, and rack up a laundry list of achievements to cite in an increasingly lengthy and comparison-filled college application process. “You almost have to start working on your college career in middle school,” Jennifer Rothman, director of youth and young adult initiatives at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told me.

Given all this, it's perhaps no surprise that kids need a break. Mental health days — a day off to deal with depression or anxiety, or simply to tend to mental well-being, gained currency among adults during the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic — and they've taken off among young people as well, with at least 12 states passing laws allowing excused absences for mental health reasons. 

But as chronic absenteeism remains a problem around the country, some school officials are worried that giving kids mental health days could encourage an attitude that school attendance is optional. “There's a lot of misconceptions about how important it is to be in school — if I didn't come to school at all in the pandemic, why do I urgently have to keep coming to school now?” Kent Pekel, superintendent of Rochester Public Schools in Minnesota, said during a webinar last year, according to EdWeek.

While concerns about mental health are far from gone, they're also being joined by fears of learning loss and the acknowledgement that missing even a few days of school can be detrimental to kids' education. There's also a widespread worry that students are reaching college, the job market, and the ballot box without basic skills like reading.

Some experts also caution that taking a day off for the wrong reasons could actually make matters worse. “When you get yourself in the trap or downward slide of school avoidance, that's really hard, and it happens really quick,” Sarah Cain Spannagel, a clinical psychologist in Cleveland who works with children and families, told me.

How can kids, families, and educators navigate all this? How do we support kids through a time that's often scary even for adults, while also making sure they get an education? I posed these questions to experts this week, and the answers I got suggested that while a day off won't cure a kid's depression or anxiety (sadly, that doesn't work for grown-ups, either), time for reset and recovery can help protect kids from getting to a crisis point in the first place. A day off could even show families and schools what's missing from a kid's life, leading to less stress and pressure in the future. 

Doctors and teens alike have been especially concerned with young people's mental health in the last five years, with Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general under President Joe Biden, warning in 2021 of a mental health crisis among adolescents. More recent surveys have shown some improvement in the prevalence of teen sadness and depression, but clinicians are still seeing “alarming rates” of anxiety and depression, as well as suicidality and self-harm, Amber Childs, a psychiatry professor at Yale School of Medicine who works on youth mental health, told me.

Allowing mental health days can also help destigmatize mental illness, and encourage young people to be open about any struggles they're going through, rather than hiding them, kids and experts say. 

Among teens, mental health days have emerged as a popular coping strategy. Students began advocating for them even before Covid hit, and lawmakers in states from Oregon to Utah have agreed, giving kids a designated number of mental health days per year, or simply changing the definition of an excused absence to include psychological reasons.

While hard numbers on how many days kids are actually taking are hard to come by, the practice seems to be increasing, perhaps driven by a growing awareness that psychological well-being is as important as physical health, Spannagel said.

The concept of a mental health day might sound pretty foreign to previous generations. Growing up, “I never got any days off,” Rothman of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who has three teenagers, told me. “Your parents were kind of like, you either have to have a fever or you're throwing up, that's the only way you're staying home.”

But adults today need to understand “how different the world is now for our kids than it was for us,” Rothman said.

Because of social media, young people today don't have much downtime from social interaction, news, or, well, anything really, Childs told me. Being able to unplug “not only from our digitally enabled lives, but also from the routine things that happen in the social and academic space” can be positive, “whether or not something bad is happening.”

Allowing mental health days can also help destigmatize mental illness, and encourage young people to be open about any struggles they're going through, rather than hiding them, kids and experts say. 

However, the way we often think about mental health days might not be the most helpful for kids. Rather than using them when a child is already in crisis — “taking the release valve off of the pressure cooker,” as Childs put it — families and schools should use them as “a preventative tool” to keep that pressure from building up in the first place.

Ideally, parents can look ahead to a time when kids might have a lot of stressful events coming up, like big exams or performances, then schedule a day off ahead of time. They should also plan how to use the day well. “A mental health day doesn't equate to chilling on a couch for eight hours straight binging TikTok and television,” Childs said.

Instead, Rothman suggests getting outside, reading, drawing, or playing card games — “whatever is calming and helps them feel more like themselves.” For teenagers especially, a day off could be a time to just catch up on sleep, something they're often lacking due to early high school start times.

What kids feel the need to do on a mental health day can also give adults “clues about what might be crowded out during a typical school day or week,” and help build those activities back in on ordinary days so kids don't get as stressed out and depleted, Childs said. (If kids keep taking days off to sleep, it might be time for the school to consider a later start time.)

Taking a day off shouldn't be a way for kids to avoid something they're anxious about, like a class, a difficult friendship, or school in general, experts say. Childs suggests that parents look for patterns — if kids keep asking for a mental health day on a Monday, it's an opportunity to delve deeper into what's happening at school on Mondays that might be stressing them out.

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

If requests for a day off are very frequent, or if feelings around them are intense, it could be a sign that “you're getting avoidance of a problem that most likely is going to be there in two days” when the kid goes back to school, Spannagel said.

Meanwhile, if symptoms like stress or sadness are going on for more than two weeks, or parents see major changes to behavior like eating or sleeping, it could be time to reach out to a child's primary care doctor to have them evaluated for mental health conditions, Rothman said.

Kids with ADHD, autism, or learning differences might need the reset of a mental health day more than the average kid, to help them recover from sensory overload or fatigue, Spannagel said. At the same time, a kid frequently feeling too exhausted or overwhelmed to go to school could mean they need additional help with executive functioning or social skills, or that the accommodations they have at school aren't meeting their needs. 

When it comes to concerns about absenteeism and academics, families and teachers can have a conversation about making up any work a child misses on an occasional day out, Spannagel said. 

And while some fear that allowing mental health days could encourage kids to skip school, that concern is “giving me like, if we talk about sex with them, they're going to want to have more sex,” Childs said. “I think the question is more complex, which is: What about the current environment has lent itself to kids not feeling engaged in school?” 

A few mental health days aren't going to fix problems with the school environment, not least because giving a kid a day off in the middle of the school year just isn't possible for every family. Experts don't recommend leaving kids home alone if they're struggling mentally, and many parents don't have the job flexibility to take extra time off with their kids. But schools can help by building aspects of a mental health day into the school week, adding time to shift the focus “away from academics and performance into exploration of self,” Childs said.

Having resources in the classroom, like a quiet corner where kids can take a moment to themselves, can also help support kids' mental health day-to-day, Rothman said. (My older kid's teacher brought this calming dog stuffie to their classroom in the fall, and I honestly would like one for myself.) 

Talking about mental health in school is also crucial, whether that's part of a formal program or just a teacher “being open about the things that they're feeling,” Rothman said. “It fights the stigma around it.”

Seventy-four percent of teens say social media helps them feel more connected to their friends, but 48 percent also say the platforms harm people their age, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

The Trump administration is reportedly seeking to eliminate Head Start, the federal program that provides early education to more than half a million kids from low-income families. One graduate calls the program “one of the few times in my early life where I felt truly loved, seen and supported in a place of learning.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s remarks about children with autism who “will never pay taxes” recall the dark history of eugenics, writes Jessica Grose at the New York Times.

My older kid and I are reading the Aster series of graphic novels, about a little girl who moves to the countryside so her mom can pursue her career as a robot-bird scientist, leading to friendships with an 800-year-old woman, a sheep wearing a tie, and three chestnuts who are also knights, among other colorful characters.

Two weeks ago, I wrote about how tariffs could drive up the cost of items like strollers and car seats, making it harder to have a kid in America. Reader Diana Braley responded, “As a mom in 2025, I've realized raising kids doesn't have to be as expensive as society makes it seem.”

“Raising children has always required commitment, support, and resilience — not consumerism,” Braley wrote. “Big companies sell us the idea that spending more makes us better parents. But the truth is, our instincts and community matter more than any fancy product.”

Jay Leno, 74, says caring for his wife, Mavis, after she received her dementia diagnosis is just part of what love is all about.

During an appearance on today's episode of ""In Depth with Graham Bensinger,"" the former late-night host spoke about the challenges he faced being a caregiver to his wife.

""When I got married, you sort of take a vow: 'Will I live up to this? Or will I be like a sleazy guy if something happens to my wife, I'm out banging the cashier at the mini-mart?'"" Leno told the podcast's host, Bensinger. ""No, I didn't. I enjoy the time with my wife. I go home, I cook dinner for her, watch TV, and it's OK.""

They still do many of the things they did before, he said. Only now, he has to help her with daily tasks.

""But, I like it. I like taking care of her,"" Leno said, adding, ""She's a very independent woman, so I like that I'm needed.""

The couple met in the '70s at a comedy club in Los Angeles and married in 1980. They don't have any children together.

Leno was granted conservatorship over his wife's estate in 2024, according to court documents.

""Well, that's the challenge, isn't it? When you have to feed someone and change them and carry them to the bathroom and do all that kind of stuff every day,"" Leno said. ""It's a challenge. And it's not that I enjoy doing it, but I guess I enjoy doing it.""

At the end of the day, he said, it's part of his commitment to her and their marriage vows.

""At some point in my life, I'm going to be called upon to defend myself. I think that's really what defines a marriage. I mean, that's really what love is. That's what you do. I mean, I'm glad I didn't cut and run. I'm glad I didn't run off with some woman half my age or any of that silly nonsense. I would rather be with her than doing something else,"" Leno said.

Leno isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about the experience of being a caregiver to a loved one.

In a 2019 opinion piece for USA Today, Rob Lowe reflected on the experience of stepping up with his brothers to care for their mother after she learned she had stage 4 breast cancer.

""I often felt overwhelmed, and that was even with all the support I had from my brothers and colleagues,"" Lowe wrote.

Emma Heming Willis has also been open about her journey caring for her husband, Bruce Willis, after he received a frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in 2023.

""You know, I have my moments. It just depends. I'm hanging in there and doing the best that I can. And, turning my pain into purpose,"" Heming Willis said in a 2023 Instagram Live.

As the population ages, more and more people will probably need help with tasks at some point in their lifetime.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of caregivers in the US increased from 43.5 million in 2015 to about 53 million in 2020.

A representative for Leno didn't immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Less training for newbies. Few entry-level jobs. And AI is about to make things even worse.

First jobs for college grads are becoming more elusive. Open roles for entry-level software engineers have dropped. Generative AI is writing more code, and Big Tech companies are boasting about how AI is making their workers more efficient. The number of entry-level management consulting and finance jobs began declining last year, and several big firms considered offering lower salaries — reasoning that AI would take on some of the workload.

Gen AI isn't Gen Z's only problem. Today's erratic economy has employees deeply worried about their jobs. That can mean fewer positions with new vacancies. Employers have been wary about bringing on fresh-faced hires in need of training.

All of these roiling changes have left many Zoomers extremely nervous. In a new survey of college seniors from the career site Handshake, 62% of those who said they were familiar with AI tools expressed at least some concern about how those tools would affect their job prospects, up from 44% in 2023. Computer science students seemed the most worried about their overall prospects; 28% said they were ""very pessimistic"" about starting their careers in the current economy, up from 18% a year ago. As of March, soon-to-be grads had submitted 21% more job applications on Handshake than seniors did the year before — all while job postings on the site declined by 15%. And according to Indeed, internship postings across all sectors, which peaked in 2022, have fallen to below 2019 levels.

If AI replaces entry-level work, new grads will have to learn the skills they need to work some other way — and lots of those practical, workplace skills aren't taught in the college classroom. A collapse of the career ladder and increasing automation could create more inequalities in skills, pay, and job satisfaction, says Matt Beane, a professor of technology management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There are already cracks beginning to form in some white collar industry pipelines. ""It's too late for us to completely and perfectly avoid this problem,"" Beane says. ""Some damage has been done.""

Gen Zers are already deeply uncertain about the value of a college degree, with about half saying they felt higher education is a ""waste of money"" in a March survey from Indeed. In March, nearly 6% of college graduates 27 or younger were unemployed, compared with 2.6% of all workers with college degrees, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Four percent of all workers were unemployed, and nearly 7% of young people without college degrees didn't have jobs.

A Brookings Institution analysis of OpenAI data concluded that some entry-level jobs, like preparing legal documents and reviewing legal data, were at high risk of automation. About half of the tasks for a marketing research analyst were similarly thought to be at risk, compared with 9% of the work for a marketing manager. There were similar findings for sales representatives versus sales managers. AI tools may unevenly affect different industries: An Anthropic analysis of its tool Claude.ai found that 37% of queries were related to computer and mathematical work, like developing and maintaining websites or debugging computer systems, while other categories like education, business and finance, sciences, and administrative were less common.

Bosses might have their eye on the benefits of putting gen AI and agents into the workforce, but it's not a silver bullet for efficiency. Three in four workers surveyed last year by the freelancing platform UpWork said AI tools had made them less productive and put more work on their plate. ""It seems like there's savings and productivity gains on the surface, but then when you really dig in, there's potentially longer review periods or more going back to double-check or correct mistakes that don't seem obvious,"" says Tim Herbert, the chief research officer at CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry.

""New grads are entering an environment where they are going to have to wait for the downstream implications to emerge"" from the AI revolution, says Frank Fusco, the CEO of Silicon Society, a company focused on educating workers through job shadowing. He believes some roles will be destroyed or consolidated but new ones will emerge from AI — ones we can't yet envision or predict. Ultimately, companies will realize they can't render people obsolete. But for Gen Z, ""the timing is very unfortunate,"" he says. ""We are at the very start of that curve if we zoom out.""

Meanwhile, companies are also more cautious about hiring workers as they face economic uncertainty and the prospect of a recession. ""We're in a period where we're frozen,"" says Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed. Workers and bosses are moving cautiously to see the fallout of President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We're all a little bit of a deer in the headlights, unsure of what's going on."" But, she says, that can't last very long — companies eventually have to make moves, whether by laying people off, or as people quit and move jobs.

The tech industry in particular has faced uncertainty for the past two years, with the number of job postings falling from about 625,000 in January 2023 to 467,000 this past March, according to a data analysis performed by CompTIA. Entry-level jobs in early 2023 made up 24% of those roles, down to 21% now. Those looking for workers with seven or more years of experience have increased by 3% in that same time. These shifts come in part after tech companies rapidly hired during the pandemic and then laid thousands off in 2023. But it's a tough reality for those starting their careers in an industry that was known for high salaries and trendy perks.

It's a hard pivot for tech, an industry that has long been accused of favoring young talent to move fast and break things over older, experienced workers. ""While they love young people, I think they love robots more,"" says Maureen Wiley Clough, the host of ""It Gets Late Early,"" a podcast about ageism in the tech industry. In a 2023 survey from Intelligent.com, a higher education research resource, nearly 40% of bosses across industries said they thought recent grads were not prepared for the workforce. In a 2024 survey of 800 HR leaders sponsored by Hult International Business School, 37% of HR leaders said they would rather have a robot or AI do a job than hire a recent graduate to take it on; another 30% said they would prefer to just let the job sit open.

But it's not Gen Zers' fault that they don't fully get workplace etiquette and norms yet. Young workers graduating in the past five years have sometimes started their college courses or careers remotely. That can mean missed opportunities to find close mentors and learn the culture and norms of an office. Zoomers largely seem more likely to want to work hybrid schedules over remote when compared with older workers, and they're looking for in-person connection. ""Those things have just left the equation,"" Wiley Clough says. ""It's kind of like, well, good luck, sink or swim.""

Some junior workers are teaching themselves to use AI, finding it helpful when looking for a job. Meelah Harkness graduated from Loyola University Chicago last May after studying communications and started applying for jobs. She filled out applications on LinkedIn for roles that already had more than 100 applicants, and upgraded her account to premium so she could send messages to people she didn't know.

Amid her frenzy of applications, Harkness spent a few weeks studying for a certificate in AI in advertising and public relations. She was wary of the rapidly developing tech, and wondered whether her newly minted marketing skills would be easily replaced by generative AI. Taking the course actually made her feel more confident. ""A robot can't sell to a human the way a human can sell to a human,"" she says. About four months into her search, she landed a job as a marketing coordinator at Bartesian, the maker of a cocktail mixing machine, using some of what she learned in that AI course to generate mockup images in a sample work test.

Christine Cruzvergara, the chief education officer at Handshake, is more optimistic that young workers won't be pushed out easily. She says that while the tight job market and developments in AI are changing the world young people are graduating into, entry-level jobs are still out there and vital to companies. ""You have to be able to actually grow your talent pipeline, and to be able to advance people into your midlevel or later on senior-level roles,"" Cruzvergara says. ""To do that, you are likely to have to hire from entry-level, to have more flexibility and ability to shape that in the ways that you want."" If automation truly took over entry-level work across an entire industry or among white-collar workers, Cruzvergara says, ""there would be a recalibration of what is considered an entry-level job.""

The top college grads should look for work at firms where they'll get hands-on training, says Beane, who wrote the book ""The Skill Code: How to Save Human Ability in an Age of Intelligent Machines."" It will become a flex to work for companies that see the value and invest in educating young workers. And companies looking to hire will have to take on ""promising but undertrained"" applicants, he says. Without an entry-level role, it will fall more to midlevel and senior-level workers to train these workers like apprentices — or young people will be pushed to teach themselves. ""The onus of the responsibility falls on both the employer and the employee to upskill in this new digital age,"" says Danielle Farage, a speaker and Gen Z work expert, who is also a Gen Zer. ""There's no way you can keep up unless you make it part of your role to continuously be learning and upskilling.""

Students are already taking notes. Julia Fedorin, a student at the University of Waterloo, decided to scrap the traditional job application process. She made a video and posted it to X last week, asking Shopify to hire her as a marketing intern — even though the role didn't exist. Her video was viewed more than 1 million times and also caught the eye of Shopify, which has already offered her an internship for the fall. ""I think AI should 100% be a tool that you use,"" she tells me. But it can't write experience. ""Now more than ever, we value authenticity,"" Fedorin says. ""I think there's only so much that AI can show.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","AI is changing how software companies charge customers. Welcome to the pay-as-you-go future.","https://www.businessinsider.com/saas-ai-changing-how-software-companies-charge-customers-2025-4","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

A quiet revolution is reshaping the business model of software-as-a-service. The SaaS industry is shifting from monthly ""per seat"" licenses to embrace usage-based, pay-as-you-go pricing.

The driving force? AI, and specifically a new class of reasoning models that are computationally intensive and expensive to operate.

This isn't just a pricing experiment; it may be an economic necessity for some companies as they adjust to the cost of running AI-powered software services.

If you've been reading my stories, you'll know I warned that the generative AI revolution would bring major pricing changes to some internet businesses. Back in January 2024, I wrote that it costs a lot to build AI models, and noted that Big Tech companies were looking for new sources of revenue growth, such as subscriptions. 

Now, there's a new breed of ""reasoning"" AI model that's really expensive to run. They don't just spit out simple responses. They loop through steps, check their work, and do it all again — a process called inference-time compute. Every step generates new ""tokens,"" the new language of generative AI, which have to be processed.

For instance, OpenAI's o3-high model was found to use 1,000 times more tokens to answer a single AI benchmark question than its predecessor, o1. The cost to produce that one answer? Around $3,500, according to Barclays analysts.

These costs aren't theoretical. As enterprises integrate AI into core workflows, building agents, copilots, and other complex decision tools, each query becomes more compute-hungry. And when millions of users are involved, those costs scale fast.

The result: Software companies may struggle to keep charging flat monthly fees if AI usage and compute costs spike and become wildly uneven across their customer bases.

For decades, SaaS companies such as Microsoft and Salesforce have typically charged per user, per month. This has been a clean, predictable model that worked well when marginal usage costs were near zero. But generative AI changes that. With inference compute costs high and rising, flat pricing becomes a potential financial liability.

""Elevated compute costs for AI agents may drive a higher cost of revenue compared to traditional SaaS offerings, forcing companies to rethink their cost-management strategies,"" consulting firm AlixPartners, wrote in a recent study about AI threats to software companies.

Instead of charging per user, companies are beginning to charge based on activity, whether that's tokens consumed, queries run, automations executed, or models accessed. This aligns revenue more closely with usage and ensures companies can cover their variable and rising infrastructure costs.

Sam Altman floated an idea like this for OpenAI last month.

an idea for paid plans: your $20 plus subscription converts to credits you can use across features like deep research, o1, gpt-4.5, sora, etc.no fixed limits per feature and you choose what you want; if you run out of credits you can buy more.what do you think? good/bad?

Developer platform Vercel already operates on this principle: The more traffic a customer's site receives, the more they pay.

""It's better aligned with customer success,"" Vercel CFO Marten Abrahamsen told me in an interview. ""If our customer does well, we do well.""

Younger companies like Bolt.new, Vercel, and Replit are at the forefront. Bolt.new, a low-code platform powered by AI agents, saw a major inflection in revenue growth after shifting from per-seat pricing to usage-based tiers. Its plans now scale with tokens consumed, from casual hobbyists to full-time power users.

Meanwhile, Braze and Monday.com have introduced hybrid pricing models, mixing base seat licenses with pay-per-use AI credits.

For Monday.com, many seat-based customers get 500 AI credits to use each month. When they exhaust these, they must pay extra for more.

ServiceNow, one of the SaaS players, has added usage-based pricing, but only as a small add-on to an otherwise predictable, seat-based offering.

CEO Bill McDermott told me the company spent years building a cheap, fast, and secure AI platform with help from Nvidia. He also noted that many of the big AI models out there, such as Meta's Llama and Google's Gemini, have become a lot cheaper to tap into lately.

Still, ServiceNow weaved in usage-based pricing to protect itself in rare situations when customers are extremely active and use a huge amount of tokens that the company has to process.

""When it goes beyond what we can credibly afford, we have to have some kind of meter,"" McDermott said.

He stressed that customers can still rip through thousands of business processes before they hit this usage-based pricing tier.

""Our customers still want seat-based predictability,"" McDermott added. ""We think it's the perfect goldilocks model, offering predictability, innovation, and thousands of free use cases.""

Investors are taking note. Barclays analysts argued recently that usage-based software companies, such as JFrog and Braze, should command premium valuations, especially as seat-based vendors face potential slower revenue growth from AI features that don't scale with user count.

""We are hearing more concerns from investors that the ongoing prevalence of AI agents could lead to lower incremental revenue contributions from seat growth for SaaS vendors,"" the analysts wrote in a note to investors recently. 

This shift could lead to more volatility in quarterly revenue, but stronger long-term alignment with product value delivered, the analysts explained.

The downside is that these are variable costs for customers. Instead of knowing exactly how much a service costs every month, your costs might rise unexpectedly if you get a lot of traffic, or your employees go nuts for new AI tools, for instance.

There's a similar problem facing the companies providing these new AI-powered software services. Their sales may rise and fall more in line with customer success and activity in general. That lumpy revenue is less attractive to investors, compared to the reliable monthly seat-based sales often generated by traditional SaaS providers.

David Slater, a chief marketing officer who's worked at tech companies including Salesforce and Mozilla, recently built a personal website using Bolt.new. He says costs could easily get out of control if you use the tool heavily, or go down a design rabbit hole and keep tweaking something over and over.

The allure of SaaS services is that they are predictable, for customers as well as providers. Anything that messes with this situation could be a concern, especially for end users.

""A pricing model that's not predictive for the company and the consumer cannot stand,"" Slater told me in an interview.

The shift from seats to usage isn't just about AI, but AI is the catalyst. As software gets smarter, more dynamic, and more compute-hungry, tying pricing to actual use may become a more sustainable path forward.

Expect to see more companies introduce token credits, pay-per-query pricing, or hybrid models in 2025, not just because it's more efficient, but because it may be the only way to stay afloat as AI adoption accelerates.

Now, this could all change again if generative AI compute costs fall over time. That's happened in previous computing eras, and some experts see this happening again. Or, at least, they hope so.

""Sooner or later, AI costs are going to plummet, and then this usage-based model dies, replaced with an anchor like seats, or time, or a monthly subscription that's understandable,"" Slater said.

Elon Musk has said he stepping away from DOGE and the West Wing, but there's one thing federal workers really want to know.

""Can we stop sending this weekly email now?"" an employee at the Internal Revenue Service asked.

Business Insider spoke to 17 federal workers after the Tesla CEO said on a Tuesday earnings call that he hopes to devote more time to the company because the ""major work of establishing"" DOGE is complete.

Several federal workers brought up the ""What did you do last week"" email required by Musk's DOGE office since February. Many said they're skeptical that Musk will forfeit his White House influence. Even if he does, some said Musk's legacy will live on in DOGE through cuts to the federal workforce and government budget. Others are simply hopeful they'll have one less weekly email to send.

As a special government employee, Musk is only legally allowed to work for the Trump administration for 130 days a year. Still, the federal workers BI spoke with said they expect him to continue making political headlines.

""My reaction is, 'I'll believe it when I see it,'"" a programmer at the IRS said, adding, ""I believe the richest man in the world has hacked his way into the most powerful government in the world, and there is nobody to stop him from keeping that access, even if he looks 'gone' on paper.""

A former employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that they aren't taking Musk's announcement seriously. An employee at the Office of Personnel Management added that Musk's vow to step back seems like ""PR spin.""

Other federal workers said that even if Musk does leave DOGE, his actions will have a lasting impact on the government and its staff.

""The effect he's had on the federal government can't be as neatly defined as quarterly earnings reports,"" the OPM employee said. Several workers expressed concern over reports that DOGE and Musk have access to sensitive information like internal government databases and Americans' Social Security details.

Some talked about the anxiety that DOGE's federal firing spree has caused in their own lives. A few said they are constantly worried about losing their livelihoods. Federal workers who voted for Donald Trump and support his money-saving goals have previously told BI they felt betrayed by Musk's abrupt mass firings of what DOGE called ""low performers.""

""There is a methodical way to downsize, and I'm all for right-sizing to meet current events,"" a Department of Agriculture employee said. ""The way Musk and his team have handled and are continuing to handle the situation is harmful to federal workers (who are real people with families), harmful to American institutions, and ultimately harmful to the American public.""

A Department of Defense employee hopes that Musk stepping back will give them ""a little relief"" about their job security.

And then there are the possible effects on their day-to-day work. Several federal workers told BI they hope Musk's departure signals the end of his ""five bullets"" email. It's unclear what Musk and his colleagues do with the information or if it has led directly to any employee firings.

""I have to look and research and see what I did — that's 10 minutes that's wasted,"" one Social Security Administration employee said, adding, ""I could be spending my time more efficiently doing other things."" Another IRS employee said they send nearly the same email every week.

Musk said on Tuesday's Tesla call that he will still spend a day or two a week on government matters, ""as long as it is useful"" to the president. When reporters asked Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday about Musk's departure, he said that Musk ""is an incredible guy"" and ""was a tremendous help both in the campaign and what he's done with DOGE."" Neither Musk nor Trump elaborated on Musk's future role in the administration.

The possible DOGE shake-up comes alongside plummeting first-quarter Tesla earnings. The electric-vehicle company's earnings per share and revenue were down 71% and 9% year over year, respectively. Musk said last month that his role in the White House was ""costing me a lot"" and he was running his businesses with ""great difficulty."" With news that he could be retreating from Trumpworld, Tesla's stock was trading up over 5% after hours and jumped again Wednesday.

One federal employee said they aren't surprised Musk is leaning back into his CEO role. They said working in the government is likely ""too much trouble for someone who is trained to see things as engineering problems.""

Tesla has lost its crown as the top EV seller in Europe.

Volkswagen's EVs outsold Elon Musk's car company across the first three months of the year, according to data from JATO Dynamics, an automotive analysis firm.

65,679 Volkswagen battery EVs were registered in the first quarter, compared to 53,237 Teslas.

The German carmaker saw its registrations more than double year-over-year, rising 157% since the first quarter of 2024.

Tesla registrations dropped 38% over the same period. According to JATO's data, this was the biggest decline among the top 30 most-registered brands.

It's a bad time for Tesla to be losing ground. JATO found that the year's first three months were the strongest quarter for battery EVs on record. Battery EVs accounted for 16.9% of all total car registrations in March — an increase of 2.7 percentage points year-over-year.

The UK was the main driver of growth, with volumes up by 13%.

Despite the company losing the top spot overall, Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 remain the top two most-registered battery EVs.

In March, registrations of the former dropped 43%, but the Model 3 increased 1%. The Volkswagen ID.4 ranked third but remained 2,000 units short of the Model 3 across the quarter.

""As the brand continues to deal with a host of PR issues in addition to the changeover of the Model Y, Tesla is now relying on the Model 3 to offset its loses,"" said Felipe Munoz, a global analyst at JATO Dynamics.

""Despite the controversy surrounding the brand's CEO and the limited availability of the new Model Y, Tesla continues to perform well,"" he added.

Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with revenue down 9% while net income plunged 64%, well below analyst expectations.

However, the stock still rose, as Musk said he would spend less time working with the government and focus more on his car company.

Trump's proposal cedes all leverage to Russia without nailing security guarantees.

Kiyv residents take cover from Russian missile attacks in an underground shelter in the early morning hours today.

The US says Ukraine should accept the settlement it has negotiated with Moscow, so everyone can get on with building “a better Ukraine.” That's the right goal, but if the deal is written as reported, it wouldn't be achievable. 

Although the Trump administration's proposal hasn't been published, a report in the Daily Telegraph says it consists of seven main points. The top two are revealing: an immediate ceasefire, followed by direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv.So, this isn't the grand peace deal US officials say it is, rather an acceptance of Russian terms for the unconditional ceasefire Donald Trump proposed more than a month ago. Negotiations on a full settlement were supposed to follow, but the administration is so eager to get something done that it appears to have granted most of Russia's war demands in advance.These include a guarantee that Ukraine will never join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; that the US will recognize Crimea, which the Kremlin annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as sovereign Russian territory; that President Vladimir Putin's forces will retain control of virtually all other Ukrainian lands they have seized by force since then; and that the US would lift economic sanctions.There's little here for Kyiv, except some minor territorial swaps and permission to access its own rivers. There is, however, a substantial benefit included for Washington,  which would gain control over Ukraine's mineral resources and major infrastructure, together with 50% of the revenue they produce. The US would also take control of Ukraine's massive Enerhodar nuclear plant, currently under Russian occupation.The issue here isn't that these are all conditions Ukraine can't accept. Zelenskiy and other officials in Kyiv understand this war will end with its de facto acceptance of Russian control over swathes of Ukrainian territory. Most European leaders also understand Ukraine won't be joining NATO. And a deal committing the US to involvement in growing Ukraine's postwar mining industries and infrastructure would be great, if that also included a commitment to invest.What's unacceptable is that core concessions are being handed over to Russia in exchange for nothing more solid than a ceasefire that may not last. Putin's invasion is being rewarded on the false premise that its conquest of all Ukraine is otherwise inevitable, and that Kyiv and its allies have no cards to play.So here's what the deal should include, if it's to enable the building of a better Ukraine, and not just a stronger Russia:Top of the list would be clearly defined security guarantees, including a mechanism to ensure a permanent ceasefire. Russia and Ukraine, after all, agreed to halt all fighting in 2014, the result of which was eight years of low-level warfare, followed by a full Russian invasion in 2022. A European “coalition of the willing” has made clear it's ready to monitor the ceasefire, but only with a US backstop to deter Russian attacks on peacekeepers. There's no sign of such a US commitment, which needs to be made and spelled out in the deal. The agreement also should state clearly that Ukraine has the right to arm and defend itself as a sovereign state, thus ruling out Russia's persistent demand that its neighbor must be demilitarized. Without that and other guarantees, including a clear US willingness to underwrite them, there's little chance that Ukraine can prosper. Why would any businessperson in their right mind invest in what could quickly be destroyed?For the same reason, any recognition of Russia's hold on Crimea needs to be traded for limitations that prevent Putin from again turning it into one giant military base, pointed at Ukraine's vital ports, shipping, and agricultural heartlands - not to mention other littoral states of the Black Sea. Recognition also needs to be exchanged for Russia's abandonment of its claims to territories that it hasn't yet taken.There also needs to be a remedy to some of the war crimes Russia has committed. The Kremlin can't be forced to acknowledge its massacres of civilians, but it should at a minimum be made to return abducted children to their Ukrainian families.If that sounds like a lot, it's far from an exhaustive list, which is why an unconditional temporary ceasefire was the right idea, making space for protracted talks. But to give away US leverage first, and only then negotiate the security terms needed to ensure that peace lasts makes no sense. In fact, it would deserve pole position in a new book Trump should write in retirement: “The Art of the Terrible Deal.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Japan intends to push back against any US effort to bring it into an economic bloc aligned against China because of the importance of Tokyo's trade ties with Beijing, according to current and former Japanese government officials.

Like many other countries, Japan is trying to get permanent relief from President Donald Trump's tariffs by addressing US concerns in areas of bilateral trade, including automobiles and agriculture. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said that Japan is pushing to strike a deal before the current 90-day reprieve in tariffs expires, with one person saying the country hopes to finalize an agreement around the Group of Seven summit in June.

Five wealth experts highlight international opportunities as tariff tumult hits US stocks.

If there's one benefit to the level of market volatility that US trade policy is provoking, it's the renewed emphasis on diversification, according to wealth experts.

International investments, in particular, are growing more attractive on speculation President Donald Trump's increased tariffs and other initiatives could tip the US into a recession and lead to a diminished role on the world stage.

The S&P 500 is down roughly 8.6% so far this year, while the Euro Stoxx 50 index is up about 14% on a currency-adjusted basis through the close of trading Wednesday in the US. So for this edition of Bloomberg's Where to Invest $10,000, we asked investing experts to focus largely on non-US opportunities. Their highlights ranged from an electricity play in Spain to pharmaceutical companies in the UK to Japanese real estate.

For those who like to invest using exchange-traded funds, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research associate Andre Yapp provides rough proxies for the experts' ideas. And for each interview, we also asked the experts how they'd spend a $10,000 windfall on something fun. Ideas stretched from devices to track one's health to trips to the Canadian Rockies and supporting up-and-coming foreign fashion designers.

The idea: 
            After 17 straight years of US equity market dominance over non-US markets (as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index) through the end of 2024, it's no surprise that global investors have become a bit too cozy with US stocks. This extended winning streak inflated the valuation premium of US equities to record highs relative to international markets. In 2025, this relationship is shifting to favor non-US markets. Investors can find many world-class international companies trading cheaply relative to their immense future cash flows. For stability and income, European and UK pharmaceutical stocks stand out as exceptionally compelling in this period of tariff uncertainty.
        


The strategy:
            European pharmaceutical companies have spent years exiting lower-margin consumer health businesses and now primarily focus on innovative pharmaceuticals manufactured and distributed globally. While some have announced plans to increase their domestic US manufacturing, most companies will continue to use existing, highly efficient global supply chains. Sourcing raw materials from the lowest-cost locations globally ensures both stable pricing and availability. Innovative drugs with few substitutes can pass cost increases on to distributors. These stocks deliver growing dividends, attractive yields versus broad markets and have abundant drug pipelines to keep delivering growing cash flows for years ahead.
        


The big picture:
            Diversifying into non-US equities brings geographic, sector and currency diversification. With Germany kicking up its fiscal spending to new highs, Europe could weather current challenges well. Even if geopolitical tensions weigh on all markets, the economically defensive sectors such as health care, with an emphasis on the drugmakers, are positioned to outperform.
        


The idea: 
            Over the longer term, we expect international equities to gain ground and the US dollar to weaken. The currency most likely to rally against a weaker US dollar is the Japanese yen, making investing in Japanese real assets an interesting potential investment. Also, in a world of European Union and Chinese reflation, higher tariff-related inflation and a weaker US dollar, we should see commodities such as copper and gold continue to rally.
        


The strategy:
            Japanese assets remain attractive due to the lack of leverage and attractive valuations. However, given that the yen is very weak and is the most likely to appreciate, should the dollar weaken we'd focus on buying real estate (think: hotels) or infrastructure assets, many of which have high dividend yields and relatively stable cash flow. We use private funds to do this.While you might think copper would be exposed to the downside if there is a recession, it will remain a key ingredient in the long-run recovery and energy transition. It's also likely to rally if we see a weakening in the US dollar, and it remains a strong hedge against higher inflation. Gold, meanwhile, remains a safe haven in a risky world. We believe there is a major shift from central banks to buy gold as they look to diversify reserves away from the US dollar. If inflation rises, real yields tend to fall, which historically has supported gold prices.
        


The big picture:
            We've become more cautious on the outlook for US and global equities and expect market volatility to remain elevated. Tariffs tend to push up inflation and push down activity. Historically, this combination has been unambiguously bad for stock valuations. However, one unexpected benefit from the increased economic assertiveness of the US is that it has forced Europe and China into greater fiscal activism. This has seen international equities race ahead of US equities. But, in the short run, this rally may have gone too far.
        


The idea: 
            Against most expectations, including my own, European stocks have surged. Year to date, a broad measure of European equities is up about 14% in dollar terms, trouncing US stocks. While I would not chase the broader European rally, there is one segment that looks interesting — luxury goods manufacturers.
        


The strategy:
            While the US continues to host many of the global champions in technology, industry and entertainment, Europe has long had an edge in luxury brands, particularly the world-beating French and Italian labels. But despite the long-term success of these businesses, most are down this year. The Goldman Sachs EU Luxury Goods Basket (GSXELUXG) is off 18% from the February high and to my mind, this is an opportunity.Much like US technology companies, many of these brands have a unique “moat” that protects their business. They continue to maintain premium pricing and benefit from still strong growth among high-end consumers. On a global basis, these companies are also very levered to China. As the Chinese economy continues to stabilize and policymakers place more emphasis on supporting domestic consumption, European brands stand to be a prime beneficiary of a healthier Chinese consumer.
        


The big picture:
            Luxury goods makers, unlike much of the European equity market, have a good long-term track record. As these stocks have sat out much of this year's rally, this is one segment of the European market I'd be looking to add.
        


The idea: 
            My idea is around electricity. For an economy to grow it needs electricity, and that becomes even more important if you want part of your state or country to benefit from the development of data centers. Meeting demand requires both producing electricity (regardless of whether it is from a renewable or other source) and then moving that electricity to where it is used — transmission. More and more regulators are beginning to understand that they need to set rates of return at a high enough level to induce the investment in both electric generation and transmission.
        


The strategy:
            A stock that gives investors exposure to this is Spanish utility Redeia Corp. Over the past 10 years it hasn't really grown at all, but Spain still has climate change goals that will result in growth for renewables — and a need within Spain for more investment in transmission to move electricity from renewables plants to homes and industries. Spain is in the process of changing regulation to enable transmission companies like Redeia to earn better returns on capital. So Redeia is expected to see strong growth as it builds new transmission plants, earns higher returns and funds some spending through selling a non-core satellite business.A second stock we like is Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., a Canadian electricity producer with some US assets. Regulators in states like Missouri and Arizona, where Algonquin has operations, are realizing that to compete for data centers they need more electricity supply, so are allowing higher rates of return for building new plants. Additionally, the company has a new CEO with a reputation for being very good at reducing costs.
        


The big picture:
            Personal consumption and industrial production in the US will grow around an annual pace of 1.5% to 2%. The need for more electricity for data centers would take us above that pace. Current growth in production capacity, particularly in Missouri and Arizona, is far below 1.5% to 2%. This isn't a situation of buying into an industry that has been overbuilt. We need more capacity, and it's even more the case in Spain. Europe doesn't have an energy supply that it can grow more quickly to become energy-independent. Europe will for the foreseeable future require imports of fossil fuels, and so the focus on renewables is part of geopolitical protection.
        


The idea: 
            The debate over US exceptionalism has been prominent this year. The secret is: There has already been less US exceptionalism than meets the eye. Since late 2022, there has really only been one extremely exceptional company — Nvidia Corp. S&P 500 returns excluding Nvidia have been bested by those of European and Japanese equities since October 2022. Investors are reassessing the US's exceptional premium and Europe and Japan's exceptional discounts. The discounts are in every area except tech, but what's particularly interesting are financials and industrials in Europe and financials and consumer sectors in Japan.
        


The strategy:
            In January, US equities had a 40% valuation premium over international markets. Despite international markets' biggest outperformance since 1989 in the first quarter, this premium has narrowed but remains at 32%, double its long-run average. This is true across sectors — and has plenty of room to close. Since 2020, earnings growth in Europe and Japan has matched the US, overcoming the post-global financial crisis gap. Although the tariff turmoil presents a short-term headwind, long-term tailwinds remain.
        


The big picture:
            As this year's powerful rebalancing unfolds, we see “push” and “pull” factors continuing to support developed ex-US equities. Push: still-elevated multiples, lower US earnings expectations, and US policy uncertainty. Pull: discounted valuations, nominal growth supporting value stocks, increasing buyback yields, and supportive policy reactions to US policy, like the end of European austerity. In the short term, while Europe rallies, Japan is taking a breather, but its continued improvements in nominal growth and corporate governance are gamechangers.

Events of the next few months will forge the president's legacy — including crises over Iran's nukes, Houthi missiles, China tariffs and Ukraine's devastation.

Off to make peace?

Donald Trump anointed himself, in his second inaugural, as the world's “peacemaker.” Just three months later, his presidency is consumed by conflict. The coming months will be Trump's season of crisis, a legacy-making period in which he must navigate three hot wars, a cold war, a potential war and a trade war.

Unfortunately, he's starting from a deficit of his own making: His decisions have left America's alliances strained, its economic power tattered, and its strategic competence in question.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

There are smarter ways to address the national-security risks posed by the mainland's trade practices. 

Tariff target.

Photographer: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty Images

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cast the White House's chaotic assault on world trade as a rational strategy — to negotiate fairer trade with other nations first, then together pressure China into concessions. He's right about one thing: The US can't address Chinese mercantilism without allies. But tariff blackmail isn't the way to enlist them.

While countries are indeed desperate to evade threatened “reciprocal” duties — currently suspended until July — that doesn't mean they're about to join a US-led campaign to isolate China. Smaller nations can't afford to alienate what is for many their top trading partner. The European Union and other larger players aren't thrilled about undermining the rules-based trading order, which even Chinese leaders profess to support. Most important, no one can be confident that policy in Washington won't shift again on a whim. The administration already appears to be buckling a little in its confrontation with China, under pressure from plunging markets and irate US executives.

Electrifying everything comes with plenty of risks of its own.

The electrification of everything is the biggest shake up the global energy system has seen in decades. Unfortunately, the route to the future is hung up by the culture wars of the energy transition and the fight against climate change. That's putting pressure on the advocates of electric vehicles, heat pumps and wind turbines to address the risks their vision carries.

Confronting them is increasingly important as power consumption booms. Since 2010, global electricity demand has grown almost twice as fast as total energy use. The trend is likely to continue, in part because of electron-hungry new technologies, like data centers and artificial intelligence, and in part simply because the world is getting richer.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The uncertainty around trade tariffs is complex but a period of uncertainty also provides Europe with an opportunity to assert itself as an economic and geopolitical superpower, the governor of the Bank of Latvia told CNBC Thursday.

""With all this uncertainty and vulnerability, this is also the time of opportunities for Europe,"" said Mārtiņš Kazāks, who is also a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank.

""It's a time for Europe to grasp all the aspects of being an economic superpower and becoming a really fully-fledged political and geopolitical superpower, and this requires doing all the decisions that in the past, were not carried out fully,"" after the global financial crisis, he said. The central bank chief cited a capital markets union, fiscal union and a single market in services as examples of further integration that were needed.

""This requires political will, political guts to make those decisions, and to strengthen the European economy and assert its place in a global world,"" Kazāks told CNBC's Carolin Roth on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank spring meetings in Washington this week.

When asked what tariffs mean for the ECB, which implemented a 25-basis-point interest rate cut at its April meeting, Kazāks said decisions would be taken ""from meeting-to-meeting because of this very poor visibility.""

""The uncertainty is very hard,"" he noted, adding that ""it's certainly a very vulnerable situation for the global economy.""

""The [political] statements, the policy decisions and the political environment and especially the tariff war are what's creating this extremely elevated uncertainty.""

Kazāks said financial markets should be monitored very carefully for any dramatic shifts in sentiment.

""So far it seems to be relatively orderly ... but if one looks at the spillovers to Europe, the financial markets are working more or less fine, we haven't seen spreads exploding or anything like that,"" he said.

""But in terms, however, of the macro scenarios, this uncertainty is extremely elevated in the sense that, given the possible outcomes, the multiple scenarios and their probabilities are very similar with the baseline [tariff] scenario,"" he said.

Although the initial duties announced in early April by U.S President Donald Trump, as well as the EU's retaliatory countermeasures, were paused for 90 days until July, there are concerns over the wider impact on regional and global economic growth once that period ends.

The IMF earlier this week forecast that U.S. gross domestic product would expand 1.8% in 2025, down 0.9 percentage points from its January forecast. The fund also cut its global growth forecast to 2.8% this year, down 0.5 percentage points from its previous estimate.

The fund predicted a slight decline in the euro zone, forecasting that euro area GDP will hit 0.8% in 2025, before picking up modestly to 1.2% in 2026.

Kazāks said the IMF's forecasts were on the optimistic side, and that the risk of global recession was ""not trivial.""

President Donald Trump on Thursday criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for deadly missile and drone attacks on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv that came after the U.S. leader suggested that Russia was ""ready"" for a peace deal.

""I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, after Russia launched what was one of the most damaging attacks on a major Ukrainian city since it invaded its neighbor more than three years ago.

""Not necessary, and very bad timing,"" Trump wrote. ""Vladimir, STOP!""

""5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!""

Trump's message to Putin came a day after the American president said he believed ""Russia is ready"" for a peace deal with Ukraine.

""I think we have a deal with Russia,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.

Trump suggested that the holdup in getting that deal was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom he had accused in a social media post of making ""inflammatory statements.""

""We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it's been harder.""

Hours after those comments, Russia unleashed its attack on Kyiv, leaving at least eight people dead and 70 injured.

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, told NBC News on Thursday morning that peace ""talks in London yesterday were candid, constructive and productive.""

Zelenskyy said earlier Thursday that he was cutting short a visit to South Africa to return home because of the attacks.

""Russia continues to kill people and avoid tough pressure and accountability for this,"" Zelenskyy said Thursday.

""Unfortunately, there is a lot of destruction. Rescue operations are ongoing, the rubble of buildings is being cleared.""

In this article

American Airlines withdrew its 2025 financial guidance on Thursday, joining other carriers that are grappling with an uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy and weaker-than-expected leisure travel bookings this year.

""We came off a strong fourth quarter, saw decent business in January and really domestic leisure travel fell off considerably as we went into the February time frame,"" CEO Robert Isom told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday.

American said that the 0.7% increase in unit revenue in the first quarter was driven by strength in international bookings and premium cabins, echoing other airlines like Delta and United, which said more price-sensitive leisure customers have been the ones holding back on trips.

The airline forecast second-quarter revenue down as much as 2% from last year to up as much as 1%, below the 2.2% Wall Street analysts expected, with its capacity expected to rise as much as 4% in the current quarter. American said adjusted per-share earnings would likely come in between 50 cents and $1, while analysts expected 99 cents per share.

It said capacity will rise between 2% and 4% over last year in the second quarter.

Here is how American performed in the first quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:

American posted a $473 million loss for the first quarter, wider than the $312 million loss it reported a year earlier, with revenue of $12.55 billion, nearly unchanged from last year. Adjusting for one-time items, American reported a loss per share of 59 cents.

Capacity was down 0.8%.

American said its efforts to rebuild its corporate travel business after a failed business strategy are making progress but were offset by ""economic uncertainty that pressured domestic leisure demand and the tragic accident of American Eagle Flight 5342,"" referring to the January accident when an Army helicopter collided with an American regional jet that was landing in Washington, D.C., killing all 67 people on the two aircraft.

Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said Thursday she thinks policymakers need to be patient rather than preemptive in assessing how tariffs will impact inflation and growth.

In her first broadcast interview since taking the reins at the central bank district in August 2024, Hammack noted the high level of uncertainty now and did not commit to a specific course of action regarding interest rate policy.

""I think we need to be patient. I think this is a time when we want to make sure we're moving in the right direction, than moving too quickly in the wrong direction,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""So I would rather take our time to make sure we're looking at the data, the hard data ... which are actually really good.""

Hammack's remarks come at a sensitive time for the Federal Reserve, which has been left to assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on both inflation and employment.

Several central bank officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have said the duties pose threats to both sides of the Fed's ""dual mandate,"" posing another challenge on how to calibrate monetary policy. Hammack also voiced concerns over how the Fed might balance those priorities.

""It could be that we have the two sides of our mandate and conflict, which is the most challenging for monetary policy,"" she said. ""If it's higher inflation, lower employment, that's where things get really complicated.""

Markets strongly expect the Fed will stand pat on interest rates when it meets May 6-7, then resume cutting rates in June with the likelihood of a total three or four reductions by the end of the year, according to CME Group data.

Hammack does not vote this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee but will vote in 2026.

""If we have convincing data by June, then I think you'll see the committee move if we know which way to move at that point,"" Hammack said.

However, uncertainty over tariff policy and how the Fed might react has contributed to substantial market volatility in recent months, with stocks struggling, Treasury yields rising and the U.S. dollar falling.

A former Goldman Sachs executive, Hammack said she is sensitive to market movements but only in how they affect broader economic conditions.

""Our job is not to focus on what the markets are doing. Our job is to focus on how that's going to impact households and businesses, and what that's going to mean in the real economy,"" she said. ""So we're not steering the markets. We're steering the real economy.""

Hammack noted that the ""hard"" economic data such as unemployment and inflation is still relatively good, while ""soft"" data such as surveys shows elevated levels of concern.

""What we're hearing right now is that the uncertainty is really weighing on businesses,"" she said. ""It's creating issues for them in terms of planning, in terms of thinking about where they're going to go, and so some of them have put pauses on whether they're going to make bigger investments, whether they're going to invest in new facilities, new capital plans, and then they're thinking about their hiring plans.""

""I wish I had a crystal ball. We don't have one,"" Hammack added.

South Korea's data protection authority has concluded that Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek collected personal information from local users and transferred it overseas without their permission.

The authority, the Personal Information Protection Commission, released its written findings on Thursday in connection with a privacy and security review of DeepSeek.

It follows DeepSeek's removal of its chatbot application from South Korean app stores in February at the recommendation of PICP. The agency said DeepSeek had committed to cooperate on its concerns. 

During DeepSeek's presence in South Korea, it transferred user data to several firms in China and the U.S. without obtaining the necessary consent from users or disclosing the practice, the PIPC said.

The agency highlighted a particular case in which DeepSeek transferred information from user-written AI prompts, as well as device, network, and app information, to a Chinese cloud service platform named Beijing Volcano Engine Technology Co.

While the PIPC identified Beijing Volcano Engine Technology Co. as ""an affiliate"" of TikTok-owner ByteDance, the information privacy watchdog noted in a statement that the cloud platform ""is a separate legal entity and has no relation to ByteDance,"" according to a Google translation.

According to PIPC, DeepSeek said it used Beijing Volcano Engine Technology's services to improve the security and user experience of its app, but later blocked the transfer of AI prompt information from April 10.

DeepSeek and ByteDance did not immediately respond to inquiries from CNBC. 

The Hangzhou-based AI startup took the world by storm in January when it unveiled its R1 reasoning model, rivaling the performance of Western competitors despite the company's claims that it was trained for relatively low costs and with less advanced hardware. 

However, the app's rising popularity quickly triggered national security and data concerns outside China due to Beijing's requirement for domestic firms to share data with the PRC. Cybersecurity experts have also flagged data vulnerabilities in the app and voiced concerns about the company's privacy policy. 

PIPC on Thursday said it had issued a corrective recommendation to DeepSeek, which includes requests to immediately destroy AI prompt information transferred to the Chinese company in question and to set up legal protocols for transferring personal information overseas.

When the data protection authority announced the removal of DeepSeek from local app stores, it signaled that the app would become available again once the company implemented the necessary updates to comply with local data protection policy.

That investigation followed reports that some South Korean government agencies had banned employees from using DeepSeek on work devices. Other global government departments, including in Taiwan, Australia, and the U.S., have reportedly instituted similar bans.

OKLAHOMA CITY — The Trump administration is considering investing in companies that mine and process critical minerals in an effort to end U.S. dependence on imports from countries including China, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said this week.

""We should be taking some of our balance sheet and making investments,"" Burgum said late Wednesday at a conference organized by the Hamm Institute for American Energy. ""The U.S. may need to make an ""equity investment in each of these companies that's taking on China in critical minerals,"" he said.

China dumps minerals on international markets, collapsing prices and making it difficult for U.S. companies to compete, Burgum said. ""You're competing against state capital because China is picking these strategically as areas that they want to invest in,"" Burgum said.

The U.S. could use a vehicle like a sovereign wealth fund to invest in domestic miners focused on extracting and processing critical minerals, he said. ""Why wouldn't the wealthiest country in the world have the biggest sovereign wealth fund,"" the Interior Secretary said.

Beijing earlier this month imposed export controls on rare earth elements — a subset of critical minerals —in retaliation for President Donald Trump's decision to hike tariffs on goods made in China. Rare earth  elements are used in key industries including defense, energy and automobiles. The U.S. imported 80% of the rare earths it used in 2024, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. About 70% of U.S. rare earth imports came from China in 2023.

""We have to get back in the game,"" Burgum said, referring to mining. ""It's not just drill, baby, drill. It's mine, baby, mine. If we don't do that as a country, we will not be successful. We will literally be at the mercy of others that are controlling our supply chains.""

The Trump administration is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund to guard companies that invest in approved projects against changing political winds in Washington, he said. If a future president cancels a project through executive fiat, companies would be paid back from the fund, Burgum said.

""Think of it like an insurance market that would be backed by the federal government,"" Burgum said. ""You got to write a check. There's got to be a financial cost if you're going to do these decisions where you're destroying our balance sheet or destroying a company's opportunity,"" he said.

The U.S. needs to stockpile key critical minerals through a mechanism similar to the strategic petroleum reserve, Burgum said. When China dumps minerals on global markets and prices plummet, the U.S. should buy those minerals and stockpile them, he said.

""Those three things would put us in the game around critical minerals — the stockpiling, the sovereign risk insurance and the ability to take an equity position. We're working on all three of those,"" he said.

In this article

Comcast on Thursday outlined changes to its broadband strategy as the business continues to shed customers in the face of heightened competition.

The discussion came amid the company's first-quarter earnings call with investors. Despite the customers losses, Comcast's earnings surpassed analysts' expectations.

Comcast shares were down about 4% in early trading.

Here is how Comcast performed for the period ended March 31, compared with estimates from analysts surveyed by LSEG:

While domestic broadband revenue was up 1.7% to $6.56 billion, Comcast lost 199,000 total domestic broadband customers, reflecting the continued pressure on the cable giant's cornerstone business. Competition has ramped up in recent years due to the rise of alternative home internet options, including 5G, or so-called fixed wireless. 

""In this intensely competitive environment we are not winning the marketplace in a way that is commensurate with the strengths of our network and connectivity,"" said Comcast President Mike Cavanagh on the company's earnings call.

Analysts peppered Comcast executives with questions on Thursday regarding its Xfinity-branded broadband and mobile, and how the company will pivot the business.

Cavanagh said that the company had identified a ""disconnect"" that's translated to slowed growth despite a strong broadband network and related products. He noted the two primary headwinds are ""price transparency and predictability and the level of ease of doing business with us.""

During last quarter's earnings call, Comcast executives alerted investors that they would shift the company's focus to growing its mobile business following continued losses in broadband.

Comcast's less-than-10-years-old mobile business remained a bright spot during the quarter. Revenue for the unit was up roughly 16% to $1.12 billion, and it added 323,000 lines. There are now roughly 8.15 million total Xfinity Mobile lines. 

On Thursday, CEO Brian Roberts said the company is ""clearly facing some challenges, but as you've heard, with a lot of passion."" 

""The team has a sense of urgency, energy and focus to getting customer pain points resolved,"" Roberts said. ""While this may take a little time to fully take hold, our history of operational execution success would tell you that while sometimes we may not move first, once we get in motion we do it extremely well.""

On Thursday, Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong said the company is ""in an incredibly strong position to successfully execute on tough decisions we're making in the face of elevated competition in certain areas.""

Broadband bloomed as a growth engine for cable companies like Comcast as the cable TV business began its decline. Comcast on Thursday reported 427,000 cable TV customer losses during the first quarter.

Following years of consistent broadband customer growth, especially during the early Covid pandemic lockdown orders when many Americans used home internet for work and school, the green shoots of competing offerings began to take hold.

The key competitive force has been the rise of fixed wireless offerings from Verizon and T-Mobile. There's been the so-called overbuilding of fiber internet, as well as 5G, a fixed wireless high-speed internet offering.

In 2022, Comcast and Charter Communications each reported their first quarterly losses in broadband customer growth.

Last September, Charter unveiled a strategy shift, which centered around new pricing, internet speeds, a push to grow mobile and making customer service changes. CEO Chris Winfrey told CNBC the goal was to remove the longtime negative perception around cable companies.

When Comcast noted the need to shift strategy earlier this year, executives said they would follow Charter's lead in these areas. Comcast recently started to introduce changes to its mobile plans and pricing, and made a new hire.

Comcast Cable President Dave Watson on Thursday said new offers — such as adding a mobile line for free for one year — that were introduced toward the end of the first quarter have already shown benefits.

""It resulted in a great quarter to start with. We're rolling here, and we expect continued acceleration in coming quarters,"" he said.

Watson also noted upgrades to services for existing customers as ""a core piece of our strategy is innovation.""

Despite the lack of growth, revenue for the broadband unit is consistently up due to strength in average revenue per user, or ARPU in industry jargon. Analysts questioned if that would take a hit with the strategy shift.

""What we're trying to do is really focus on the pain points in this market,"" Watson said. ""We can execute this tactically, surgically and do not view it as a broad repricing of our base. We think we can still drive healthy broadband ARPU growth, but these initiatives will require some investment, which in turn will impact our ability to grow EBITDA in the near future. But we view the impact as very manageable.""

For the first quarter, Comcast's net income was down 12.5% to $3.38 billion, or 89 cents a share, compared with $3.86 billion, or 97 cents per share during the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items including income tax expenses and costs related to the value of assets, among other items, Comcast reported earnings per share of $1.09. 

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were up nearly 2% to $9.53 billion. 

The company's revenue was down slightly to $29.89 billion compared with $30.06 billion in the same period in 2024. 

Revenue was helped by what Comcast refers to as its ""growth businesses,"" including mobile, streaming platform Peacock, the business services unit, residential broadband, studios and theme parks. Comcast is in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, including CNBC, in a transaction that's expected to be completed this year.

Revenue for the media segment, which includes NBCUniversal, was up about 1% to $6.44 billion, and revenue in the film studios unit rose 3% to $2.83 billion. 

The media unit got a boost from Peacock, with adjusted EBITDA for the segment up 21% to $1 billion driven by the streaming platform. Revenue for Peacock itself was up 16%. The streamer's quarterly loss narrowed to $215 million, compared with a loss of $639 million in the same quarter a year prior.  

Peacock had 41 million paid subscribers, beating analyst estimates of 37.21 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. Peacock ended last fiscal year with 36 million paid customers. 

Competitors including Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have each seen their streaming platforms reach profitability in recent quarters. Streamers have shifted gears to focusing on ad-supported business models and cracking down on password sharing in a bid to reach profitability as Wall Street investors shifted focus to the metric rather than subscriber additions.

NBCUniversal's theme parks revenue was down 5% to roughly $1.88 billion – driven by lower guest attendance during a quarter plagued by the Los Angeles wildfires – weighing down the overall business. 

The company is gearing up for the debut of Universal Epic Universe on May 22, which will be the first major theme park development in Florida in 25 years. In Thursday's release, Comcast called the new theme park its ""most ambitious parks experience ever created,"" with more than 50 attractions.

In August it will also open Universal Horror Unleashed in Las Vegas. NBCUniversal also recently announced plans to build a Universal Theme Park and Resort in the U.K.

Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.

BEIJING — China on Thursday said that there were no ongoing discussions with the U.S. on tariffs, despite indications from the White House this week that there would be some easing in tensions with Beijing.

""At present there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,"" Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He added that ""all sayings"" regarding progress on bilateral talks should be dismissed.

""If the U.S. really wants to resolve the problem ... it should cancel all the unilateral measures on China,"" He said.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week indicated that there might be an easing in tensions with China. The White House earlier this month added 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, to which Beijing responded with duties of its own and increased restrictions on critical minerals exports to the U.S.

The Commerce Ministry's comments echoed those of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun, who said on Thursday afternoon that there were no ongoing talks, according to state media.

Both spokespersons held to the official line that China would be willing to talk to the U.S. subject to Beijing being treated as an equal.

""China definitely wants to see the trade war deescalate, as it hurts both economies,"" said Yue Su, principal economist, China, at The Economist Intelligence Unit. ""However, due to the inconsistency of Trump's policies and the lack of clarity around what he actually wants, China's strategy has shifted from focusing on 'what you need' to 'what I need.' Their request for the U.S. to cancel 'unilateral' tariffs reflects that shift.""

China earlier this week threatened countermeasures against countries that might make deals with the U.S. at the expense of Beijing's interests.

""We also need to recognize that this is a 'whatever it takes' moment for China in terms of U.S.-China relations,"" Su said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if China adopts a more hawkish stance if the U.S. continues to escalate tensions.""

Several Wall Street banks have cut their China gross domestic product outlook in the last few weeks in light of the tariffs and escalating tensions with the U.S.

The Commerce Ministry on Thursday emphasized government and business efforts to help companies sell goods meant for exports to the Chinese market instead.

""From China's perspective, any meaningful negotiations will likely require the US to reduce tariffs to the previous 20% or even lower level,"" said Jianwei Xu, senior economist for Greater China, at Natixis.

""But for the Trump administration, however, reducing tariffs too far could raise uncomfortable questions: What was the point of the confrontation if we end up back where we started?""

The U.S. is China's largest trading partner on a single-country basis. But in the last several years, Southeast Asia has surpassed the European Union to become China's largest trading partner on a regional basis.

Correction. Yue Su is principal economist, China, at The Economist Intelligence Unit. An earlier version misstated the name of the organization.

In this article

LONDON — Adobe plans to launch a mobile version of its artificial intelligence image generation tool Firefly, stepping up a challenge to OpenAI as the Microsoft-backed startup advances its efforts on visual applications for the technology.

The design software giant said Thursday at its MAX creativity conference in London that it will release Firefly on both iOS and Android ""soon,"" without giving a specific date.

""Creative people think on the go,"" Alexandru Costin, vice president of Adobe Firefly, told CNBC in an interview. ""One of the visions we have is for the Firefly mobile application to become a creative partner that sits with you all the time.""

Costin said that one way creatives could use its upcoming mobile app was to ask it to sketch up some ideas about an ad campaign while commuting to the office, so that by the time they arrive at work they've got a mood board to help them develop their thinking.

Adobe also announced the launch of its latest AI models, Firefly Image Model 4 and Firefly Image Model 4 Ultra, and said its new Firefly Video Model for video generation is now generally available.

The company said the new systems are capable of generating hyper-realistic pictures and videos in response to textual prompts in a ""commercially safe"" way, blocking the inclusion of any intellectual property.

It marks Adobe's latest push to incorporate AI into its creative tool suite and comes as the company is increasingly facing competition from well-funded AI firms such as OpenAI and Runway.

Last month, OpenAI released a native image generation feature that went viral online for its ability to produce anime images in the style of animation studio Studio Ghibli and recreate people as toy dolls.

The tool saw such huge levels of demand that OpenAI boss Sam Altman warned it was melting the company's GPUs (graphics processing units). ""It's super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT. But our GPUs are melting,"" Altman said on March 27.

While Adobe's Costin conceded that the competitive environment is heating up, he said the company isn't shying away from partnering with the competition. For example, Adobe has partnered up with the likes of OpenAI, Google and Runway to add their AI image generation tools to Firefly.

""Competition is great,"" Costin told CNBC. ""We think there will be models with different personalities and capabilities.""

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have pushed countries to look for ways to improve their trade balance with the U.S. and negotiate the extent of duties levied on their imports.

Indonesia's plan now is to ""narrow,"" or even eliminate its trade surplus with the U.S., the country's finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told CNBC on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings.

This comes after the country was hit with a 32% levy on exports to the U.S. by President Donald Trump on April 2. He has since lowered the duty to 10% as part of his 90-day pause on tariffs imposed on some countries and goods.

Indrawati noted that the resource-rich country has been perceived to be preventing trade via ""non-tariff barriers"" such as its administrative processes, customs processes on imported goods and taxation procedures.

Indonesia is now looking to import more agricultural products such as wheat, soybeans and corn from the U.S, she said.

""We import not only from the United States but many others ... we can always discuss about how we can narrow and put the United States in a better advantage of providing those kinds of agriculture products,"" she noted.

Indonesia could potentially also import oil and gas - especially liquid gas from the U.S. - as its domestic production is insufficient for its energy needs, the finance minister said.

Her comments come as Indonesia's trade surplus with the U.S. stood at $4.3 billion between January to March 2025 - up from $3.61 billion in the same period the year before. The superpower was the biggest contributor to the Southeast Asian country's overall trade surplus of $10.92 billion in the first quarter.

However, Indrawati noted that trade to the U.S. accounts for less than 2% of the country's gross domestic product.

""So, it's not really that big,"" given that total exports accounts for 20% of Indonesia's GDP, she added.

Still, Indrawati said that the impact of Trump's tariffs could potentially be felt in other ways as countries look to diversify their exports from the U.S.

Bank Indonesia held its policy rates for its third consecutive review on Wednesday, in a bid to maintain the exchange rate stability of the Indonesian rupiah against the uncertain macroeconomic outlook.

The central bank kept its benchmark 7-day reverse repurchase rate - which is also known as BI Rate -unchanged at 5.75%, as expected all but two of 26 economists polled by Reuters. It also kept its two other policy rates steady.

The move comes as the Indonesian rupiah hit a record low while the Jakarta Composite index plunged earlier in the month as capital flowed out after the U.S. imposed ""reciprocal tariffs"" on countries including Indonesia.

The decision serves to safeguard the rupiah's stability as the central bank continues to assess future room for a cut, taking into account the country's inflation rate and growth prospects, Governor Perry Warjiyo said.

""Our short term priority is exchange rate stability. Once stability is maintained, the room for a rate cut will be more open and that would be the time to decide on future interest rate policy,"" he added.

The rupiah weakened 0.12% against the dollar to 16,800 on Thursday, a day after BI's rate decision.

The efforts by President Donald Trump and his administration to reshape the global economy will likely damage the economy and financial assets, according to hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates.

Co-chief investment officers Bob Prince, Greg Jensen and Karen Karniol-Tambour said in a newsletter Wednesday that the world is undergoing a ""rapid shift to modern mercantilism"" that could have a negative outcome for the economy.

""We expect a policy-induced slowdown, with rising probability of a recession,"" the CIOs wrote.

The Bridgewater commentary comes as the stock market has already been rocked by Trump's tariff policies. The S&P 500 is down 8.3% year to date and 5.2% since the April 2 rollout of Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs. Many of those levies have since been paused, but tensions have escalated between the U.S. and China.

Outside of the stock market, U.S. bonds and the dollar have also declined in recent weeks. Some Wall Street experts have suggested that the widespread decline could be a sign that foreign investors are backing away from the U.S. in the Trump era.

Bridgewater hinted at this idea in the newsletter, saying that the policy changes create ""exceptional risks to US assets, which are dependent on foreign inflows.""

The combination of an economic slowdown and a shift away from the U.S. could unwind a lot of the conventional wisdom of investing from over the past decade, when America financial assets and economic growth broadly outperformed other major countries.

""This shift in asset allocations has created risks if the future is different than the past. Many portfolios are increasingly vulnerable to 1) any weakness in growth, 2) central banks not being able to ease into problems, 3) equity underperformance, and 4) US underperformance relative to the rest of the world,"" the newsletter said.

Bridgewater, which was founded by Ray Dalio in 1975, reported having $92.1 billion in client assets as of Dec. 31.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Why gold became the safe haven of choice as U.S. Treasurys and dollar sold off","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/gold-rallies-as-investors-re-evaluate-us-treasurys-and-dollar.html","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 05:56:33 GMT","



Gold prices have been on a tear with the recent trade turmoil driving investors to the safe haven, while competing assets such as the U.S. Treasurys and the dollar have tumbled. 

This is tied to the seismic shift in U.S. trade policy under President Donald Trump, and bullion has ""stepped into the void"" as the market's safe haven asset of choice, Commonwealth Bank of Australia's director of mining and energy commodities research, Vivek Dhar, said. 

""What makes this recent flight to safe‑haven demand so unique is that the U.S. dollar and Treasuries have been sold‑off as safe‑haven appeal of these U.S. assets has declined,"" Dhar added. 

Gold prices have been scaling fresh highs and hit $3,500 per ounce on Tuesday, with more analysts forecasting that prices will rally further. J.P. Morgan expects the yellow metal to average $3,675 per ounce by the fourth quarter of 2025, and reach $4,000 by the second quarter of 2026.

Conversely, U.S. Treasurys have seen a sell-off in recent weeks, with the 30-year yield hitting the highest since November 2023 earlier this month. Meanwhile the U.S. dollar index has been sliding, and has weakened 8% so far this year, data from LSEG showed.

While the 30-year Treasury yield has gained just about 2 basis points so far this year, the spike within a week after Trump announced reciprocal tariffs was over 30 basis points — the benchmark 10-year yield also spiked by 30 basis points. Meanwhile, spot gold prices have risen 25% so far this year, according to LSEG data.

While yields on long-dated U.S. Treasury yields have come down from the highs hit earlier this month and the dollar has strengthened marginally as Trump backtracked on comments he made about firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, U.S. assets' standing among investors has already taken a hit.

""Although this is far from a 'Death of the U.S. Dollar' story, it is fair to say that confidence in the U.S., it's economy and it's principle assets, the USD and Treasurys, has been diminished,"" World Gold Council's market strategist John Reade told CNBC.

The traditionally inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold seems to have broken down. Usually, when yields are higher, bullion becomes less appealing given the higher opportunity cost of holding gold as it does not pay interest. 

Gold's inflation-hedging quality is making it ""special,"" said Michael Ryan, lecturer at University of Waikato's school of accounting, finance and economics.

Tariffs are expected to raise inflation in the U.S., which implies higher future interest rates, which in turn pressures Treasurys, Ryan said.

""Gold, however, is historically perceived as an inflation hedge, which may explain the preference for it—so it is perhaps gold's perceived inflation-hedging properties that are making it 'special,'"" he added.

Another factor for the breakdown of the traditional relationship between gold and Treasurys would be the dwindling faith in America and the ""U.S. exceptionalism"" narrative, analysts told CNBC. 

""There is a waning trust in U.S. assets due to both economic and geopolitical uncertainties,"" said Soni Kumari, a commodity strategist at ANZ.

Markets widely view Trump's tariff war as a policy misstep, and gold's perceived independence from any monetary and fiscal policy has boosted its appeal. 

""Unlike currencies or government bonds, gold carries no credit risk and is not tied to the economic or political trajectory of a single nation,"" said Alexander Zumpfe, senior precious metals trader at Heraeus. This is especially pertinent in times when confidence in traditional financial instruments is wavering. 

Further adding to gold's luster is the dulled appeal of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar generally makes commodities priced in the greenback, including gold, more attractive for holders of other currencies. 

Emerging market central banks, which have been underweight on gold compared to their developed market counterparts, have turned to the yellow metal and are likely to remain strong buyers as they diversify away from their dollar-based reserve holdings, said Eli Lee, Bank of Singapore's chief investment strategist. 

The recent dollar sell-off has sparked discussions about a global de-dollarization, calling into question the attractiveness of the greenback as the world's reserve currency.

Gold has been floated as a potential alternative main reserve currency several times.

""Countries realized that gold was a potential hedge against the U.S. freezing currency reserves for non-alignment with U.S. policy,"" CBA's Dhar said.

While the dollar sell-off has been beneficial to gold, Dhar said, it is still difficult to see a future with a material shift away from the greenback, given the costs of transporting and warehousing gold — bullion being a noninterest paying asset also limits its appeal.

Additionally, while there has been a bit of a revaluation of the U.S. Treasury's safe haven status, it is still ultimately ""really hard"" to replace given how it is the ""most liquid market in the world,"" said Franklin Income Investors' portfolio manager Todd Brighton.

The replacement of U.S. Treasurys as a safe haven is not happening anytime soon as we shift toward a more multi-polar world, he said.

Shares of Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) surged 55% on Tuesday and are up an additional 15% in pre-market trading, trading below $19. 

The skyward movement was driven by investor optimism around its proposed merger with Twenty One Capital a bitcoin (BTC) native investment vehicle backed by Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank.

Led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers and Brandon Lutnick, Twenty One Capital is being positioned as a public proxy for bitcoin, potentially holding over 42,000 BTC at launch and introducing metrics like Bitcoin Per Share (BPS) and Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR) to measure shareholder value in BTC terms.

According to the latest pro forma ownership tables, Tether will control 42.8% of equity and 51.7% of voting power, while Bitfinex and SoftBank hold 16.0% and 24.0% of the company respectively, post-convert. Public SPAC shareholders will retain just 2.7% ownership, underscoring the extreme dilution but significant upside if BTC rises.

With BTC trading near $94,000, and the entity holding nearly $4B in BTC exposure, investors are re-rating CEP as a high-leverage bet on institutional bitcoin adoption. The stock is set to re-list under ticker “XXI” once the merger is finalized.

The cost of the equipment Bitcoin miners use is increasing.

Bitcoin miners' earnings power and stocks have diverged from the asset they help produce, a stark reminder of the deteriorating economics of an industry US President Donald Trump has championed. 

CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is down more than 50% from its December 2024 peak, a far steeper drop than in the price of Bitcoin. The hashrate, which measures how much miners earn per unit of computing power, is languishing close to a record low.

 BTC reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have fallen to the lowest level since November 2018. 

Bitcoin reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have dropped to their lowest level in more than six years, as publicly traded companies ramp up their accumulation of the digital asset following the US presidential election, according to Fidelity Digital Assets. 

“We have seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to public company purchases — something we anticipate accelerating in the near future,” Fidelity reported on the X social media platform.

Fidelity said the supply of Bitcoin (BTC) on exchanges had fallen to roughly 2.6 million BTC, the lowest since November 2018. More than 425,000 BTC have moved off exchanges since November, a trend often viewed as a signal of long-term investment rather than short-term trading.

Over the same period, publicly-traded companies acquired nearly 350,000 BTC, Fidelity said.

Fidelity Digital Assets is a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, the $5.8 trillion asset manager headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The Fidelity Digital subsidiary was established in 2018, long before cryptocurrency was considered an institutional asset class. 

Fidelity is the issuer of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, one of the first 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved in the United States.

While Fidelity noted significant corporate Bitcoin purchases, most of the accumulation has been driven by Strategy, the business intelligence firm-turned-Bitcoin bank co-founded by Michael Saylor.

Since November, Strategy has acquired 285,980 BTC, accounting for 81% of the approximately 350,000 BTC purchased by publicly traded companies.

Strategy's latest purchase of 6,556 BTC was disclosed on April 21. 

Outside the United States, publicly traded companies in Asia have adopted a similar Bitcoin treasury strategy, with Japan's Metaplanet and Hong Kong's HK Asia Holdings increasing their Bitcoin allocations. 

Metaplanet currently holds 5,000 BTC, with CEO Simon Gerovich saying his goal is to double that amount this year.

Meanwhile, HK Asia Holdings announced plans to raise roughly $8.35 million to potentially increase its Bitcoin reserves.

During a Wednesday ask-me-anything (AMA) session, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson predicted that Ethereum would not be able to survive over the next decade. 

""So, I don't think Ethereum will survive, you know, more than 10 years to 15 years,"" he said. 

He has predicted that users will eventually migrate to other places. 

Hoskinson has compared Ethereum to Blackberry, the once-dominant smartphone maker that went extinct due to the success of Apple's iPhone. 

According to Hoskins, who also co-founded the flagship altcoin, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) did three things wrong. First, he claims that Ethereum has the wrong protocols. ""They have the wrong accounting model, they have the wrong virtual machine, and they have the wrong consensus model,"" he noted. The current protocol that Ethereum has for proof-of-stake is wrong, Hoskinson says. 

He also criticized Ethereum's slashing economics and layer-2s, which are taking activity away from the main chain. Hoskinson has described L2s as ""parasitic,"" echoing the criticism of Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko. The L2s will continue to suck all the alpha out of the main chain, he predicts. ""People will stop fighting, and it will be harder and harder for Vitalik to hold it together,"" Hoskinson added. 

Lastly, the Cardano co-founder has opined that Ethereum does not have a robust on-chain governance system that would be needed for efficiently solving the aforementioned issues. 

The underperformance of Ethereum ETHUSD has been one of the most-talked-about stories in the cryptocurrency world. The token is down 46% against Bitcoin since the start of the year. Meanwhile, the ETFs that allow betting against ETH are some of the best performers in the U.S.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Cardano Founder: Ethereum Won't Survive The Next 15 Years","https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-ethereum-wont-survive-15-years/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:00:31 GMT","

In his latest ask-me-anything session streamed on April 23, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson delivered a sweeping critique of Ethereum's long-term prospects, arguing that the world's second-largest smart-contract platform is encumbered by what he called three “self-inflicted wounds” and lacks the on-chain governance needed to heal them.

Responding to an audience question—“If you were running the Ethereum Foundation, what would you do differently?”—Hoskinson said the project chose “the wrong accounting model, the wrong virtual machine, and the wrong consensus model,” a triad of design decisions he believes now threaten Ethereum's survival. “People told them not to do it, they did it, and they got where they needed to go,” he said, before warning that the fixes adopted so far “put in all these weird slashing economics and layer twos and other things,” whose unintended consequences are starting to bite.

Hoskinson, who co-founded Ethereum in 2014 before leaving to launch Cardano two years later, insisted that a viable turnaround would require parallel workstreams. “First off, you have to solve your technological problems,” he said, pointing to Ethereum's proof-of-stake implementation as something the network “needs to wean itself off of.”

He suggested a shift to what he called a “telescoping protocol design” such as Ouroboros-Leios—Cardano's forthcoming upgrade path—and urged Ethereum developers to look at the “object model of SWE,” along with Narwhal-and-Tusk-style consensus, and a move to the RISC-V instruction set. “Something like RISC-V with intent, with an object model like SWE, probably would fit their ecosystem quite well,” he argued.

Yet the bigger obstacle, in Hoskinson's view, is Ethereum's lack of formalized self-governance. “They really don't have a good on-chain governance system,” he said. Building one, he estimates, would take “five to seven years” given the network's size and entrenched stakeholders. Without it, he warned, protocol upgrades and community coordination will remain fragile.

Hoskinson's most pointed forecast came midway through the session: “I don't think Ethereum will survive more than 10 years to 15 years.” He predicted that layer-2 networks will continue to “suckle out all of the alpha,” eroding the base chain's utility while sparking internal conflict that will grow “harder and harder for Vitalik to be able to hold […] together through sheer force of will.”

He also contended that a revitalized Bitcoin ecosystem by Cardano's efforts and faster monolithic chains could outcompete Ethereum on both liquidity and user experience. “Once [Bitcoin DeFi] turns on, the TVL will be larger than Ethereum […] and the other thing is they're being eaten alive by Solana and SUI and these other things,” he said, likening Ethereum's predicament to companies such as MySpace and BlackBerry that struggled to pivot when “fundamentally different paradigms […] creep up on you.”

Hoskinson also contrasted Ethereum's roadmap with Cardano's own. He highlighted Cardano's RISC-V-based virtual machine, its extended UTXO accounting, and its “non-parasitic” approach to layer-2 scaling—namely Hydra and the Midnight sidechain—as evidence that Cardano already embodies the architectural decisions he is urging Ethereum to adopt.

Hoskinson conceded that some of Cardano's governance tooling is “kind of weird now,” but maintained it will be “awesome in three to five years.” By contrast, he warned, Ethereum's transition would be slower and more contentious, giving alternative platforms time to attract developers and liquidity. “Users will gradually migrate to other places and then they're gonna get eclipsed by Bitcoin DeFi,” he said.

The remarks come at a sensitive moment for Ethereum, which completed its proof-of-stake merge 18 months ago and is preparing for upgrades aimed at lowering transaction costs and boosting throughput. Hoskinson's comments are unlikely to sway Ethereum's core developers, but they underscore a growing debate over whether modular, rollup-centric roadmaps can maintain network coherence as competing ecosystems evolve.

Asked to sum up his outlook, Hoskinson reverted to first principles. “A brilliant project,” he said of Ethereum, “it's just [a] victim of its own success.” Without decisive architectural and governance reforms, he concluded, the platform risks “a very hostile divorce” between the base layer and its scaling solutions and, ultimately, obsolescence within the coming decade.

At press time, ADA traded at $0.6872.

Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength on-chain and in price action, with active addresses spiking and the ETH price finally breaking past a key resistance level that had held it back for over a week.

According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán, between Apr. 20 and Apr. 22, the number of active Ethereum (ETH) addresses increased by almost 10%, rising from about 306,000 to over 336,000. This uptick indicates increasing network participation at a time when ETH is beginning to regain some bullish momentum.

Although they are not a guarantee of upward movement, spikes in address activity can be an early sign of shifting sentiment and frequently indicate growing investor interest, especially when combined with rising price action.

Ethereum is Heating Up!“Ethereum's active addresses jumped from 306,211 to 336,366, representing a 9.85% increase in just 48 hours” – By @oro_crypto Read the full analysis ⤵️https://t.co/g55MiVnmOo pic.twitter.com/brIHtXx3Sx

And that's exactly what we're seeing. ETH has finally pushed above the $1,650 resistance zone, a level that had acted as a ceiling since mid-April. Following a strong green daily candle breakout, ETH price has crossed $1,790, breaking away from the short-term range in which it had been stuck.

Buyers appear to be regaining control for the first time in weeks. ETH is now trading above both the 10-day and 20-day moving averages, which suggests growing strength in the short term. At just over 50, the relative strength index indicates mild bullish momentum without being overbought. 

The moving average convergence/divergence has also started to show early signs of a trend shift, turning slightly positive. Not all indicators are in complete agreement though. The stochastic RSI is already nearing the top of its range, which could signal short-term exhaustion if more buyers don't enter the market.

One key factor to watch is Ethereum's transaction fees. The network's fees remain unusually low, around $0.31 on average, as per YCharts data. This indicates that on-chain demand is still low even though the network is cheap to use. 

Still, with active addresses rising and ETH holding above previous resistance, the short-term outlook looks better than it has in weeks. If momentum continues, the next major test will be whether ETH can make a run toward $2,000.

Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.

The value of the $TRUMP token has increased by more than 70% since the announcement of an ‘Exclusive dinner with President Trump' for the top 220 $TRUMP coin holders. Although it may sound like a scam, we can confirm that it's REAL.

Moreover, the top 25 $TRUMP coin holders will also be invited to a private VIP reception with Trump and a separate special VIP tour.

With the biggest PolitiFi meme coin, $TRUMP, offering such non-financial yet prestigious perks, we've included the best altcoins you can invest in for similar exclusive benefits below.

Trump launched his proprietary meme coin just a few days before swearing in as president. The coin soared to a lifetime high of over $75 within the next two days, riding on the initial hype and popularity.

However, since then, $TRUMP has plummeted and has been trading around the $7.50 mark before this announcement.

That said, April 20 marked the beginning of a daily token unlocking event for the $TRUMP coin, which will release 0.049% of the total 1B supply into the market every day. This will further dilute $TRUMP's market capitalization and offer sell-side opportunities.

It's an excellent tactic not only to boost demand but to ensure that the additional daily supply is absorbed by investors.



There are a few conditions to this invitation. For starters, you can't be from a KYC watchlist country and must pass a background check after you're selected for the invitation. Also, you cannot bring along any guests with you.

However, $TRUMP isn't the only token offering exclusive benefits. We've gone hunting, and here are the top three cryptos with additional perks.

MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is arguably the best crypto to buy now if you're looking for a project offering top-notch benefits. That's because $MIND aims to give real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders.

While free tokens and governance rights are great, $MIND's roadmap shows it could offer more, allowing you to invest in a project that has the potential to create a money-making crypto portfolio on your behalf.



MIND of Pepe is an autonomous AI agent that will track online crypto trends and community hype to identify crypto projects with the potential to explode.

It will do so by talking to crypto influencers on dApps and social media sites like X and assessing their biases.

It's worth noting that the developers have lived up to the expectations, and they're finally launching $MIND on May 10.

In addition to early-bird access to $MIND's investment, presale holders will also get exclusive access to the tokens created by this revolutionary and self-evolving intelligence system.

You heard that right! As we noted above, MIND of Pepe will be launching its own tokens based on social sentiment trends and market fundamentals.

Don't miss out on possibly the biggest holder-centric crypto presale on the market right now. With over $8.2M raised so far, you can get in for just $0.0037365 per coin. For more, here's how to buy $MIND tokens.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the newest crypto subscription platform, but it's unique because it's the first one ever to integrate AI into its ecosystem. Not to mention, its mission is to revolutionize the $85B online creator industry with its long list of benefits.

For starters, creators on SUBBD get access to futuristic AI tools, like AI image, video, and voice generators, that they can use to automate the entire process of creating content and mundane tasks such as scheduling.



$SUBBD token holders, aka the fans, get access to the exclusive content of their favorite creators, on-platform discounts, and loyalty rewards — plus, early access to new features.

As a new cryptocurrency on presale, each token is available for just $0.05525. And with predictions that $SUBBD could jump over 1,200% and reach $0.668 by 2026, this is a project many are keeping an eye on.

$FARTCOIN holders might not get the kind of VIP benefits offered by $MIND or $SUBBD, but its extremely positive future outlook could result in double- or triple-digit gains in your investment.

With a market cap of over $1B, Fartcoin has been one of the top trending cryptos in the last few weeks, which were some of the most sluggish for the larger crypto market.



What's driving $FARTCOIN, you ask? Well, it's not strong fundamentals or a large-scale revolutionary goal. It's something simpler but perhaps more important: amusement and the community's shared love for stinking farts.

Token holders get free $FARTCOIN tokens if they submit hilarious fart jokes. Considering that the token is up nearly 100% in the last 30 days, it wouldn't be a bad idea to collect free $FARTCOIN and maximize your profits from the token's hot form.

At the end of the day, it's worth remembering that the best altcoins aren't those that offer the best VIP benefits – those are nice additions, of course – but without strong fundamentals, a token is unlikely to survive the market's heat.

Even then, though, the crypto market's volatility and unpredictability are such that no returns can be guaranteed. We urge our readers to do their own research before investing. Our articles are not intended to be taken as financial advice.

Hit TV series Peaky Blinders, which reached an estimated audience of 80 million through platforms like Netflix, is set to be adapted into a blockchain-based video game and wider Web3 ecosystem, the companies behind the effort announced on Thursday.

It is being developed by Anonymous Labs, a Web3 venture builder that previously launched the Simon's Cat cartoon IP token. The company is partnering with Banijay Rights, the global distributor of Peaky Blinders, to expand the show's presence into blockchain gaming and fan engagement tools.

The smoky streets of 1920s England are reimagined as a decentralized playground where fans can dive into high-stakes missions, craft their own Shelby-style legacy (the family the series is based around), and engage with the Peaky Blinders universe.

The game is being designed as an AAA title (a gaming buzzword where such products have extensive development budgets, large teams, and emphasis on high technical quality). It will feature digital collectibles and community engagement mechanisms that use blockchains.

The goal is to onboard traditional Peaky Blinders fans into crypto through interactive storytelling and gameplay.

""Peaky Blinders is arguably the biggest IP to date to embark on building a blockchain-based project, and I see this as a defining moment for the entire Web3 industry,” Wojciech Gruszka, head of Development at Peaky Blinders Web3 Game, said in a statement.

“This project is not just about creating an incredible user experience—it's a gateway to bringing blockchain new revenue streams and building brand loyalty in the Web3 space,” Gruszka added.

Specific details around token mechanics, launch timelines, or the game's economic structure have not been disclosed as of Thursday.

The studio tripled-down on one of the worst trends in video game history, saying that ""Web3 gaming is inevitable"".

I have to admit, after covering two of Ubisoft's Web3 blockchain games they shipped back in late 2024, both of which – surprise, surprise – were obliterated by the gaming community, I actually, truly believed the lesson had been learned and thought I'd never have to put the words ""Ubisoft"" and ""NFT"" in the same headline ever again.

And yet, here we are. Not even six months later, the derided developer has reminded everyone why they lost all goodwill in the first place by unveiling yet another blockchain-based video game, doubling (or rather, tripling) down on what many would describe as the absolute worst trend the gaming industry has ever seen.

Meet Might & Magic Fates, an upcoming trading card game inspired by the Might and Magic universe. Unlike Ubisoft's previous NFT titles – which, at the very least, were shadow-dropped and gave us something to look and laugh at – Fates has only been announced and not released, making it impossible to tell what the game is even about – no gameplay, no graphics, and no story to speak of.

According to the official description on Fates' website, the game will feature your standard card game mechanics: players can build decks by combining creatures, spells, artifacts, buildings, and heroes from various Might & Magic factions, challenge other players, and expand their card collections by trading, playing, or opening booster packs filled with cards of varying rarities.

The caveat lies in that last part about trading and owning cards. While a Ubisoft IP, the game is being developed in partnership with Immutable, a cryptocurrency company that makes blockchain games and NFTs. As per the game's Q&A, players will be able to trade their cards using the Immutable blockchain and own them as NFTs, not only adding to Ubisoft's growing pile of Web3 slop but also making the first Might & Magic title in 11 years a blockchain game – not exactly a comeback one would hope for.

Interestingly, it seems that by 2025, Ubisoft has finally started to realize that the overwhelming majority of gamers absolutely loathe the idea of blockchain gaming and attempted to preemptively soothe the backlash by emphasizing that Might & Magic Fates' ""Web3 layer that unlocks digital ownership"" is an optional feature.

While that emphasis might've helped with optics, it was, however, pretty much undone by a Ubisoft employee running the game's Twitter account, who, in their infinite wisdom, declared that ""Web3 gaming is inevitable,"" which, considering the words ""blockchain,"" ""NFT,"" and ""Web3"" are practically synonymous with ""scam"" for a lot of people, probably wasn't exactly the wisest thought to put into writing.

So, what are your thoughts on Ubisoft resurrecting Might and Magic only to make an NFT slop based on the IP? Will the third time be the charm for the struggling studio? Tell us what you think in the comments!

It turns out that the world of NFTs is not such a terrible thing after all. I will honestly admit that I played the game Legends of Elysium for a year - I just played. You can call me a layman, because although I saw such terms as NFT there - I did not know what it meant. And I simply play until now without paying attention to it. I like this game and if someone else plays it for NFTs, it is not my thing. I play for pleasure.

SAO PAIO DE OLEIROS, Portugal, April  24, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The D.O.G.E Foundation is officially announcing the development of a new blockchain architecture and the launch of its seed funding round. Designed to overcome the scalability crisis facing Web3, the project offers a ground-up rebuild of blockchain infrastructure — addressing the performance, decentralization, and reliability issues that have stalled mass adoption. While early promises of decentralization and accessibility sparked global excitement, today's reality tells a different story: overloaded networks, exorbitant fees, and scaling limitations continue to block true growth. Ethereum struggled under growing demand, Bitcoin proved too rigid, and Solana buckled under pressure. Recognizing the need for deeper change, the D.O.G.E Foundation is stepping forward with a new approach — because if tech slows you down, it's time to change the tech.

The Problem: Blockchains Built for the Past

We started with a simple question: what kind of network can keep up with the speed of the modern internet? That was our starting point. Not an upgrade. Not an improvement. A full rebuild — from scratch, with no shortcuts.

The idea didn't come from theory — it came from experience. One of our engineers, with a background in Qualcomm technologies, recognized early on that Web3 could reshape the internet. But everything hit the same wall: scale. None of the current networks could deliver the speed and reliability needed for real-time games, DeFi protocols, AI-driven systems, or autonomous applications.

We thoroughly studied why Solana broke. Speed is important, but it should never come at the cost of stability. Solana ran into architectural vulnerabilities: congestion, outages, and reliance on a narrow group of validators. We didn't just take note of these issues — we deliberately designed a system to avoid them.

Scalable by Design, Not by Patchwork

From day one, we had one goal: build a network that handles tons of transactions fast, while staying secure and decentralized. We're not trying to outperform Solana by numbers alone — we're taking a fundamentally different path. This isn't about benchmarks in a testnet. It's about building a system that performs in the real world — and keeps up as demand grows.

The way we approach architecture is simple: keep roles clearly separated, avoid unnecessary bottlenecks. We're developing a modular system where validation and execution work independently. That separation helps us process transactions in parallel, without sacrificing resilience or security.

Solving What Others Can't

The use cases that inspire us aren't theoretical. They're real-world problems that existing chains fail to solve: • Real-time games with a large number of concurrent players • DeFi protocols that stay stable under peak load • Infrastructure for AI agents making on-the-fly decisions • Autonomous systems that need dependable, stable coordination

The project is currently in active development. We're not building a showcase. We're laying a foundation — a blockchain you can depend on when real value and real users are on the line.

Our Seed Round is Now Open

We're not here to make noise. We're building an architecture where scalability, reliability, and real-world utility come first. Development is underway. We have a clear technical strategy, a deep understanding of the market, and insights gained from analyzing the failures of previous networks. Now, we're looking for partners who share this vision — and are ready to invest in foundations, not fads.

NFTs from the startup RTFKT, which was bought and later shuttered by Nike, are no longer displaying the images attached to them after a Cloudflare restriction. 

Right-clicking and hitting save won't have the same impact now that the images from the entire Clone X NFT collection have been replaced with a violation message. 

It reads, “This content has been restricted. Using Cloudflare's basic service in this manner is a violation of the Terms of Service.”

Some X users have speculated that RTFKT can no longer afford to pay for one of the CloudFlare subscriptions, resulting in the removal of the images. However, at the time of writing, various NFTs from this collection are now displaying their images again.

Nike bought RTFKT in December 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and claimed it would “invest in the RTFKT brand, serve and grow their innovative and creative community, and extend Nike's digital footprint and capabilities.”

Four years later, Nike shut down the startup as its CEO claimed the company was “recalibrating and reassessing its priorities.”

Nike had also previously sued a sneaker resale startup called StockX, saying that its NFTs based on Nike shoes may confuse buyers. 

RTFKT might also face a lawsuit from the Rosen Law Firm. Poker player Alan Wehbi claimed on X that he made “seven figures” on RTFKT and that Nike is supposedly planning to sue the firm, but are “going through some shit with their internal legal team.”

The Clone X collection has 9,221 unique owners, and the most expensive NFT, which sold for almost $60,000 worth of ether two years ago, is now listed for $176 quintillion.

At the lower end of the scale, most Clone X NFTs cost around $300.

We use cookies to improve your experience.            



A recent announcement for the Private Dinner event for the top 220 holders of the TRUMP meme coin stated that if former President Trump does not attend, attendees may receive a limited NFT.

This has sparked speculation about the event's true purpose. Could it ignite a new market wave?

According to official details from the TRUMP meme coin team, the Trump Gala Dinner is an exclusive event for the top 220 holders of the meme coin. It will be held at Trump National Golf Club in Washington on May 22, 2025. 

However, organizers have noted they reserve the right to change the date and venue, raising questions about the event's certainty.

More intriguingly, there's uncertainty about Trump's participation. Despite the event bearing his brand, terms state that Trump may not attend. If the dinner is canceled or Trump is absent, eligible TRUMP holders will receive a limited-edition NFT as compensation. 

This has fueled speculation that Trump may use the event to launch a new NFT collection, building on his previous NFT ventures. 

“President Trump may not be able to attend the TRUMP Gala Dinner. In the event President Trump is unable to attend the TRUMP Gala Dinner, or if the Gala Dinner does take place, then in our sole discretion, it may be rescheduled to another date, or TRUMP Meme holders who are qualified for the Gala Dinner and/or reception will receive a limited edition TRUMP NFT in lieu thereof,” the terms and coditions wrote. 

Trump is no stranger to the NFT market. In early 2025, Donald Trump's NFT collection, “Trump Bitcoin Digital Trading Cards,” debuts with 160 pieces on the Bitcoin network. 

He debuted his Trump Digital Trading Cards in December 2022, marking his entry into the crypto space. The first collection, featuring 45,000 NFTs, quickly gained traction due to Trump's brand. It raised approximately 648 ETH, roughly $785,000 as per the ETH rate during the sale.

After that, Trump launched Series 2 of the Trump Digital Trading Cards. Trump's second round of ‘Digital Trading Cards' sold out quickly. However, not everything went smoothly. 

The value of the original Series 1 collection took a significant hit. The rapid release of new collections raised concerns in the community about “value dilution,” diminishing the appeal of earlier NFTs.

According to OpenSea data, the total trading volume for Trump Digital Trading Cards reached 17,167 ETH, equivalent to tens of millions of USD—an impressive figure for an NFT collection.

By April 2025, CryptoSlam data shows the trading volume for Trump Digital Trading Cards dropped to just $2,000, a stark contrast to its peak.

The Trump Gala Dinner could have implications beyond TRUMP holders, potentially influencing meme coin and NFT markets. If Trump launches a new NFT collection and succeeds, it could reignite interest in celebrity-driven NFT projects. 

Conversely, if the event flops or the new NFT fails to gain traction, it may deepen skepticism about the sustainability of meme coin and NFT ventures.

The studio tripled-down on one of the worst trends in video game history, saying that ""Web3 gaming is inevitable"".

I have to admit, after covering two of Ubisoft's Web3 blockchain games they shipped back in late 2024, both of which – surprise, surprise – were obliterated by the gaming community, I actually, truly believed the lesson had been learned and thought I'd never have to put the words ""Ubisoft"" and ""NFT"" in the same headline ever again.

And yet, here we are. Not even six months later, the derided developer has reminded everyone why they lost all goodwill in the first place by unveiling yet another blockchain-based video game, doubling (or rather, tripling) down on what many would describe as the absolute worst trend the gaming industry has ever seen.

Meet Might & Magic Fates, an upcoming trading card game inspired by the Might and Magic universe. Unlike Ubisoft's previous NFT titles – which, at the very least, were shadow-dropped and gave us something to look and laugh at – Fates has only been announced and not released, making it impossible to tell what the game is even about – no gameplay, no graphics, and no story to speak of.

According to the official description on Fates' website, the game will feature your standard card game mechanics: players can build decks by combining creatures, spells, artifacts, buildings, and heroes from various Might & Magic factions, challenge other players, and expand their card collections by trading, playing, or opening booster packs filled with cards of varying rarities.

The caveat lies in that last part about trading and owning cards. While a Ubisoft IP, the game is being developed in partnership with Immutable, a cryptocurrency company that makes blockchain games and NFTs. As per the game's Q&A, players will be able to trade their cards using the Immutable blockchain and own them as NFTs, not only adding to Ubisoft's growing pile of Web3 slop but also making the first Might & Magic title in 11 years a blockchain game – not exactly a comeback one would hope for.

Interestingly, it seems that by 2025, Ubisoft has finally started to realize that the overwhelming majority of gamers absolutely loathe the idea of blockchain gaming and attempted to preemptively soothe the backlash by emphasizing that Might & Magic Fates' ""Web3 layer that unlocks digital ownership"" is an optional feature.

While that emphasis might've helped with optics, it was, however, pretty much undone by a Ubisoft employee running the game's Twitter account, who, in their infinite wisdom, declared that ""Web3 gaming is inevitable,"" which, considering the words ""blockchain,"" ""NFT,"" and ""Web3"" are practically synonymous with ""scam"" for a lot of people, probably wasn't exactly the wisest thought to put into writing.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined AFK Letters Co Ltd (AFK) £90,000 for making more than 95,000 unsolicited marketing calls to people registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), in a clear breach of electronic marketing laws. 

AFK Letters is a company which writes letters seeking compensation and refunds for its customers. 

Between January and September 2023, AFK used data collected through its own website and a third-party telephone survey company to make 95,277 marketing calls without being able to demonstrate valid and specific consent from the people contacted. Despite AFK claiming it could not provide evidence of consent because it deleted all customer data after three months, when challenged by the ICO, it was also unable to provide consent records for several calls made within a three-month timeframe. 

One of the complainants about the company stated that they had not consented to receive the calls: 

“…claimed she had information showing I might be due a refund in relation to my solar panels as the supplier had gone bust (which isn't true.) She knew my name… I explained I had not consented to receive such a call which was an intrusion and asked her to remove me from the list.” 

AFK's third-party data supplier was using consent statements which did not specifically name AFK when asking the public for consent to be called. Additionally, AFK's  own privacy policy only mentioned contact by email, and did not state that people would also receive phone calls. 

An ICO investigation found that AFK failed to comply with Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), which requires organisations to have clear, informed and specific consent before making unsolicited direct marketing calls. 

Andy Curry, Interim Director of Enforcement and Investigations at the Information Commissioner's Office, said: 

“AFK made calls to those registered with the Telephone Preference Service, and failed to keep proper records of consent for those it was calling as well as failing to properly disclose to people what they would be consenting to. This is a fundamental requirement of responsible and legally compliant direct marketing.  

“This fine should serve as a clear warning to and learning for other organisations: if you cannot demonstrate valid consent for people on the Telephone Preference Service, you should not be contacting people. If people are being asked for consent to be contacted, it should be absolutely clear what this is for. 

“It is vital that other companies utilising direct marketing have robust systems in place to protect people's privacy and comply with the law.” 

The ICO reminds people to report nuisance calls and check that their TPS registration is up to date. Organisations are also urged to review their direct marketing processes to ensure they comply with data protection law.

The Bank of Korea has recently pointed out several misunderstandings regarding its digital currency usage test ""Project Hangang River,"" which is conducted from April 1 to June. The central bank emphasized that this project is more about experimenting with ""deposit tokens,"" a stablecoin issued by domestic commercial banks, rather than the central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Bank of Korea.

At a briefing held at the Bank of Korea on April 21, Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryul stated, “There is concern that the CBDC might allow the Bank of Korea to access personal information, but due to the possibility of privacy infringement during the research process, we decided to use deposit tokens issued by banks in 2023 in a way that actual users can utilize them.” He added, “The term ‘token' was used because stablecoins were negatively perceived during the Luna-Terra incident, and ultimately, the digital currency test is a test of the deposit tokens issued by banks.”

Furthermore, Lee mentioned, “Deposit token users provide their personal information to the banks, not to the Bank of Korea,” and “Whether stablecoins and (central bank digital currency) can coexist is something the Bank of Korea has considered when designing the digital currency system ecosystem.”

Lee Byung-mok, director of financial settlement at the Bank of Korea, stated, “Even in the digital financial world, the concept of digital legal currency is to convert even stablecoins into legal currency,” and “The basic concept of the CBDC pursued by the central bank is to coexist with payment methods that are circulated and used by the private sector.”

Project Hangang River is the first test, and plans have emerged to link it with personal remittances and more local government voucher projects in the future.

Yoon Sung-kwan, head of the Digital Currency Research Office at the Bank of Korea, said, “We are considering a second follow-up test,” and “We are conducting meetings in working groups with financial institutions, discussing first personal remittances and expanding usage.”

Deputy Governor Lee added, “We are gradually expanding even in the first phase,” and “There are plans to use deposit tokens for scholarships given to freshmen at Silla University, which can be used at local or campus stores.”

As of the morning of that day, 51,766 electronic wallets capable of using deposit tokens had been opened, and a cumulative total of 29,251 transactions had occurred from April 1 to April 20.

In the balmy late afternoon of Aug. 25, 2024, Sushil and Radhika Chetal were house-hunting in Danbury, Conn., in an upscale neighborhood of manicured yards and heated pools. Sushil, a vice president at Morgan Stanley in New York, was in the driver's seat of a new matte gray Lamborghini Urus, an S.U.V. with a price tag starting around $240,000. As they turned a corner, the Lamborghini was suddenly rammed from behind by a white Honda Civic. At the same time, a white Ram ProMaster work van cut in front, trapping the Chetals. According to a criminal complaint filed after the incident, a group of six men dressed in black and wearing masks emerged from their vehicles and forced the Chetals from their car, dragging them toward the van's open side door.

When Sushil resisted, the assailants hit him with a baseball bat and threatened to kill him. The men bound the couple's arms and legs with duct tape. They forced Radhika to lie face down and told her not to look at them, even as she struggled to breathe, pleading that she had asthma. They wrapped Sushil's face with duct tape and hit him several more times with the bat as the van peeled off.

Several witnesses saw the attack and called 911. Some of them, including an off-duty F.B.I. agent who lived nearby and happened to be at the scene, trailed the van and the Honda, relaying the vehicles' movements to the police. The F.B.I. agent managed to obtain partial license plate numbers.

Danbury police officers soon located the van. A patrol vehicle activated its emergency lights and tried to make a stop, but the driver of the van accelerated, swerving recklessly through traffic.

About a mile from where the chase began, the driver careered off the road and struck a curb. Four suspects fled on foot. The police found one hiding under a bridge and apprehended him after a brief chase. Within a couple of hours, the other three were located hiding in a wooded area nearby. The police, meanwhile, found the shaken Chetals bound in the back of the van.

The price of Donald Trump's cryptocurrency has soared after the US president promised to host two special events for its top investors.

The website for the $Trump meme coin says its 220 biggest holders will be invited to a private gala dinner with the president on 22 May, describing it as the ""most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world.""

According to crypto trading platform Coinbase, $Trump jumped by more than 70% after the announcement. But it remains well below the record high of more than $74 (£42.40) reached shortly after its launch in January.

The digital currency is one of several crypto-related ventures launched by businesses linked to Trump, who has called himself the ""crypto president"".

As well as the gala dinner, which will be held at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington DC, there will be ""an ultra-exclusive private VIP reception with the President"" for the top 25 coin holders, the coin's website said.

Trump tokens in circulation are currently worth a total of around $2.5bn. They were first released just days before his inauguration on 20 January.

The move was criticised by several people in the crypto industry, with some calling it ""a stunt"".

First lady Melania Trump also launched a cryptocurrency on the eve of the inauguration.

Meme coins are often used by speculators to make money or to allow fans to show support to a celebrity or moment in internet culture.

Shortly after returning to the White House this year, Trump signed an executive order to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations.

He has also signed an order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include other digital currencies.

Those funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.

This week, Trump's media company announced plans to launch exchange traded-funds (ETFs).

The financial products to be launched by Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of the Truth Social platform, and its partners will include digital assets as well as stocks with a ""Made in America focus"".

ETFs are investment funds that hold multiple assets. They can be bought and sold in a similar way to shares.

The overnight strikes killed at least eight people and injured 77 more,  local officials have said. 

Volodymyr Zelensky ends an historic visit to South Africa to counter Russia's influence on the continent.

At least eight people were killed and dozens injured in overnight Russian strikes on Ukraine's capital, officials say.

The lawsuit argues President Trump did not have the authority to enact the levies and start a global trade war

The executive order aims to overhaul the process colleges must go through to receive federal financial aid.

A bill is headed to the Pennsylvania state Senate, looking to regulate virtual currencies.

Currently, businesses that transfer money using virtual currencies like crypto coins are not regulated.

This bill would expand existing law on other forms of money to control online currencies.

Rep. Scott Conklin, D-Centre County, sponsored the bill. He released a statement, which said:

""With technology creating new forms of virtual currencies such as cryptocurrency, our laws need to keep pace with those changes to protect Pennsylvanians.

""Consumers deserve to know that the transactions they conduct using digital currencies are as safe and secure as those involving traditional forms of money.

""Under current state law, virtual currency is not subject to the state's Money Transmission Licensing Law, which regulates businesses that transmit money or credit. My bill would expand the law so that it covers virtual currency and requires that it be treated similarly to money transmissions under the act.""

At a time when countless crypto projects are awkwardly pivoting toward artificial intelligence, Eric Winer has spent over a decade building bridges between cutting-edge technology and everyday users. Now, as CTO of NEAR AI, he's pursuing a vision where AI agents negotiate, communicate, and transact on our behalf — a vision that could fundamentally reshape how we interact with the digital world.

Winer speaks with the measured enthusiasm of someone who has repeatedly been early to technological revolutions. Having joined the Winklevoss twins as Gemini's first engineer in 2013 and helped launch one of the earliest NFT marketplaces before the term ""NFT"" became commonplace, he now confronts what may be his most ambitious challenge: creating a decentralized ecosystem of AI agents that preserves user sovereignty in an increasingly AI-mediated future.

Eric Winer is a speaker at Consensus 2025. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

CoinDesk: You've been in crypto for over a decade now. How did that journey lead you to focusing on AI?

Eric Winer: I've been in the crypto world for 11 years now. Eleven years ago I met the Winklevoss twins through mutual acquaintances. They hired me as the first engineer at Gemini, which was the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in America at the time. Our mission from the CEO was to take this fantastic blockchain technology (really just Bitcoin at the time) and apply some grown-up engineering around it so that it could be effectively adopted by institutions, governments, and people broadly.

Back in 2013-2014, Coinbase was around, but it was kind of a rinky-dink Silicon Valley startup at a time before there was really much of a fintech culture even in California. So it wasn't particularly built well. We were building Gemini in New York City with people who knew how money worked and trying to build not just for cryptography enthusiasts, but for the masses.

I've always been trying to get blockchain technology over the adoption barrier to reach a place where people would be using it, perhaps under the hood, to make the world more efficient and give people more sovereignty, even if they don't know it.

CoinDesk: And that led you to NFTs before most people had even heard the term, right?

Eric Winer: Within Gemini, we acquired a company called Nifty Gateway, which was basically the third NFT startup after OpenSea and CryptoKitties. We launched what was the first NFT marketplace targeted at ""normies"" in March 2020. It ended up growing by about 1000% month over month for a few months, going from selling a thousand dollars of NFTs to selling a hundred million dollars of NFTs in a day.

This exposed a lot of people to the world of collectibles and art online, right in the middle of the pandemic. From there they got bit by the NFT bug and then by the crypto bug, bringing them into the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

Personally, I think the promise of NFTs got unfortunately co-opted by the crypto and speculation crowd. Nifty Gateway never used the term ""NFT"" on its website or in its materials when it launched. We fought against that even becoming what it was called. NFT is just a thing, but online. We were selling art, selling tickets. Having to assign a technical moniker and put that into the public, I think, was actually counterproductive at the end of the day.

CoinDesk: Many crypto projects seem to be awkwardly pivoting toward AI without a clear vision. What makes NEAR AI's approach different?

Eric Winer: Near AI is a fascinating company because the founders of Near actually started by building an AI company. They started as an AI company, trying to train models to write code around 2017-2018. It was a little early for that to be effective at the time.

AGI has always been the vision here. Near AI is less a ""crypto x AI"" company than it is an AI company that's vision-aligned with the same purpose of Near. Near's vision is for users to own their own data, own their own decision making, not be beholden to corporate, financial, or governmental interests, and be able to decide where their money goes and how their decisions are made.

Whether that's done via a blockchain or done via an AI model, you have to have both. If we don't have a user-owned AI effort going, then we'll lose the game because everybody will start using ChatGPT for everything in their world, and whatever ChatGPT uses for payments is whatever you'll use for payments. Then blockchain loses because you didn't win the AI battle – not the crypto x AI battle, but the real actual AI battle.

Near AI does have interactions with blockchains, including Near, because we think that Near and other blockchains are a good way of doing things. But we're primarily an AI company that sees crypto as a technology; we are not a crypto company trying to shove in AI.

CoinDesk: What exactly does NEAR AI offer as a platform right now?

Eric Winer: Near AI as it exists right now is mostly an agent hosting platform. It's actually one of the easiest ways to get an AI agent running online. You upload some pretty simple Python code or TypeScript code, and boom, it's hosted online with a user interface, embeddable into any website.

It can be backed by any open weights models, although by and large, we delegate the actual model operation to other providers like Fireworks and Anthropic that are out there. The special sauce of our framework is that it makes it easy for those AI agents to talk to other AI agents, whether on our platform or off.

The other thing that isn't live yet, but will be by the time consensus rolls around, is that we are heavily invested in TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments). We think it's very important that you know where your data is going, that it's not being harvested by these models for training, that even us as operators of a cloud system are not able to look at your data, analyze it, or steal it if we wanted. So we're putting all those agents and all the underlying models into these trusted execution environments so that you can use them with confidence.

CoinDesk: Your vision seems to center on AI agents communicating with each other. What does that future look like to you?

Eric Winer: What we're trying to build within Near AI is an ecosystem of AI agents that talk to each other. ""AI agent"" is a very overloaded term at this point. Most of the time when you see something talking about itself as an AI agent, it's really a set of guidelines and tools for an AI model to act on your behalf. Like, ""I've got Llama or Claude or GPT models, and I'm going to instruct it to post on Twitter on my behalf."" To do that, it needs the ability to access Twitter and some general guidelines about how to read and post tweets.

But that's not how I necessarily think about agents. I think about agents mostly in terms of how they interact with the rest of the world on your behalf. My AI agent is posting on Twitter, managing my calendar, looking at all my messages and emails, deciding which are spam, which to reply to, which to surface to me – just like an assistant in my life should be.

The future that we envision, which I think is going to happen inevitably, is a world where most of our access to the internet and to the rest of the world is mediated by our personal AI assistants.

CoinDesk: That's a remarkably different vision from most crypto projects. How does it reshape our financial systems?

Eric Winer: If it's my AI agent talking to, say, Amazon's AI agent, and they're going to buy something and negotiate, they're more likely to rationally choose a crypto-based payment method and probably an AI-based dispute resolution method and AI-based credit. We reshape the financial system not by building a better one and trying to convince people to use it, but by building a better one and trying to convince AIs to use it that's easier for AIs and for the people operating them.

I think that's the crypto adoption play now: we build a world of AIs talking to AIs on your behalf, and then we convince the AIs that blockchain and decentralization is a better world for them and for us than the one we've got.

CoinDesk: So in your view, AI could actually be the catalyst that drives blockchain adoption, rather than the other way around?

Eric Winer: I think in the future, and probably not too far in the future, you'll see that vision that everybody seems to want – the super app, the one place you go where everything you do online really becomes an AI assistant. It's giving you a content feed, it's taking action on your behalf, it's spending money on your behalf.

And it's not just doing it alone. It's not just hitting APIs and browsing websites – it's talking to other AI agents. It's also handling your interpersonal, person-to-corporate, or person-to-governmental communications. That needs to be a decentralized ecosystem much like the internet is to some extent a decentralized system, but maybe we can do one better on top of blockchain-based registries.

REVOLUT'S pretax profit surged 149% last year to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.46 billion) as the financial technology firm rode a wave in crypto trading and earned more from interest rates and card fees, the company said.

Revenue at the London-based fintech rose to 3.1 billion pounds, up from 1.8 billion pounds in 2023, it said, driven by income from interest on the back of higher rates, card payments and the company's “Wealth” segment, which includes trading and crypto products.

US Department of Justice

A federal grand jury in Central Islip, New York, returned an indictment April 22 and unsealed today charging a New York man with lying on his applications for a green card and United States citizenship by concealing his past role as a leader and perpetrator of the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.

According to court documents, Faustin Nsabumukunzi, 65, of Bridgehampton, New York, was a local leader with the title of “Sector Counselor” in Rwanda in 1994 when the genocide began. Between April and July of that year, members of the majority Hutu population persecuted the minority Tutsis, committing acts of violence including murder and rape. An estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed during the three-month genocide. Nsabumukunzi was arrested this morning on Long Island and is scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. ET before U.S. District Judge Joanna Seybert for the Eastern District of New York.



The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) today launched new guidance, stating for the first time that if a corporate self-reports suspected wrongdoing and co-operates fully with investigators, it can expect to be invited to negotiate a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) rather than face prosecution, unless exceptional circumstances apply.

At a legal conference in London, SFO Director Nick Ephgrave introduced new corporate co-operation guidance that will make it simpler for corporates to report suspected wrongdoing by a direct route to the SFO's Intelligence Division via a secure reporting portal.

A high-ranking member of a Midlands-based drugs supply network has been found guilty in his absence following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.

Alexi Morgan, 30, from West Bromwich, failed to appear at Birmingham Crown Court for the start of his two-week trial.

On 23 April a jury delivered guilty verdicts on all charges against him, and a judge sentenced him to 15 years and six months' imprisonment.

Revolut saw its revenue jump 72 per cent to £3.1bn in 2024, fuelled by a bounce in its subscription and crypto offerings. Europe's most valuable private tech company reported pre-tax profits of £1.1bn in 2024, more than double the previous year, and added 15 million new users. Revolut now has 52.5 million retail customers across the world.

Nik Storonsky, Revolut CEO and co-founder, heralded 2024 as a “landmark” year for the UK-headquartered challenger bank. Customer balances, a key metric for Revolut as it looks to get more users to use Revolut as their primary account, were up 66 per cent to £30bn. This was driven by strong growth in customer deposits and increased balances.

Revolut bills itself as an all-in-one financial app and offers a gamut of financial services, including consumer and business banking services, mortgages, subscription products, insurance and crypto products. It said profits were up partly due to the instilling of financial discipline across the business.

Its revenue uplift was helped by subscription revenue hitting £423 million, a 74 per cent year-on-year increase, while wealth revenue grew 298 per cent driven by increased crypto trading activity and the launch of Revolut X, its standalone crypto exchange, last year.

Revenue across Revolut's business offering topped £460m and now accounts for roughly 15 per cent of Revolut's revenue. Revolut, valued at $45bn, secured a UK banking licence in 2024 and is now in its so-called ""mobilisation"" phase. Revolut has also been rumoured to be gearing up for an IPO.

Revolut employed 10,133 staff as of the end of 2024, up from 8,152 in 2023.

Storonsky added: “2024 was a landmark year for Revolut. We not only accelerated our customer growth, welcoming nearly 15 million new users globally, but critically, we also saw customers engaging more deeply by adopting a wider range of our services across both our retail offering and Revolut Business.

""This powerful combination directly fuelled our record growth, and our technology-driven operating model translated this into record profitability. 

""This performance earned us the status of Europe's most valuable private technology company, reflecting the confidence of existing and new investors in our trajectory.

""But we're just getting started. We're making strong progress towards 100 million daily active customers across 100 countries, driven by growth in the UK, Europe, and our expansion markets. This ambitious goal will keep us focused on revolutionising global financial access through innovative products and seamless user experiences.""

Shares of Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) surged 55% on Tuesday and are up an additional 15% in pre-market trading, trading below $19. 

The skyward movement was driven by investor optimism around its proposed merger with Twenty One Capital a bitcoin (BTC) native investment vehicle backed by Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank.

Led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers and Brandon Lutnick, Twenty One Capital is being positioned as a public proxy for bitcoin, potentially holding over 42,000 BTC at launch and introducing metrics like Bitcoin Per Share (BPS) and Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR) to measure shareholder value in BTC terms.

According to the latest pro forma ownership tables, Tether will control 42.8% of equity and 51.7% of voting power, while Bitfinex and SoftBank hold 16.0% and 24.0% of the company respectively, post-convert. Public SPAC shareholders will retain just 2.7% ownership, underscoring the extreme dilution but significant upside if BTC rises.

With BTC trading near $94,000, and the entity holding nearly $4B in BTC exposure, investors are re-rating CEP as a high-leverage bet on institutional bitcoin adoption. The stock is set to re-list under ticker “XXI” once the merger is finalized.

Would you offer insurance when expecting low odds of a claim being made? Most likely, you would, while pocketing the premium without a second thought. Bitcoin (BTC) traders are doing something similar in the Deribit-listed BTC options market, hinting at bullish price expectations.

Recently, an increasing number of traders have been selling (writing) BTC put options, likened to providing insurance against price drops in exchange for a small upfront premium. 

They are implementing this strategy in a cash-secured manner by holding a corresponding amount in stablecoins, ensuring they can buy BTC if the market declines and the put buyer decides to exercise his right to sell BTC at the predetermined higher price.

This strategy enables traders to collect premiums (paid by put buyers) while potentially accumulating bitcoin if the options are exercised. In other words, it's the expression of a long-term bullish sentiment.

""There is a notable increase in cash-secured put selling using stablecoins—another sign of a more mature, long-term approach to BTC accumulation and a continued expression of bullish sentiment,"" Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk.

Chen said BTC holders are also selling higher strike call options to collect premiums and generate additional yield on top of their coin stash, which is weighing over Deribit's DVOL index, which measures the 30-day BTC implied volatility. The index has dropped from 63 to 48 since the April 7 panic selling in BTC to $75K, according to data from the charting platform TradingView.

""We observe that investors remain long-term bullish on BTC, particularly among crypto-native “holders” who are willing to hold through market cycles,"" Chen said.

Bitcoin's price has risen to over $92,000 since the early month slide to $75,000, supposedly on the back of haven demand and renewed institutional adoption narrative.

The sharp price recovery has seen BTC options risk reversals reset to suggest a bias for call options across time frames, according to data source Amberdata. Over the past two days, traders have specifically snapped up calls at strike $95,000, $100,000 and $135,000 via the over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm. As of writing, the $100,000 strike call was the most popular option play on Deribit, with a notional open interest of over $1.6 billion.

Just how important it is to track flows in the options market can be explained by the fact that the cumulative delta in Deribit's BTC options and options tied to the U.S.-listed BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and its peers was $9 billion as of Wednesday, according to data tracked by Volmex.

The data indicates heightened sensitivity of options to changes in BTC's price, suggesting potential for price volatility. 

Delta, one of the metrics used by sophisticated market participants to manage risk, measures how much the price (premium) of an options contract is likely to change in response to the $1 chance in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, BTC.

So, the cumulative delta of $9 billion represents the total sensitivity of all outstanding BTC and bitcoin ETF options to changes in the spot price. As of Wednesday, the total notional value of all outstanding options contracts was $43 billion.

Such large data or sensitivity to price swings in the underlying asset means market makers and traders actively engage in hedging strategies to mitigate their risks. Market makers, or those mandated to provide order book liquidity, are known to add to price volatility through their constant effort to maintain a net directional neutral exposure.

""Option deltas have increased to record levels as open interest grew and strike deltas shifted significantly. Option market makers are actively hedging this delta exposure, driven by substantial new positions and notable shifts in strike pricing,"" Volmex noted on X.

According to Volmex, crypto-native options traders over Deribit are positioned more bullishly than those trading options tied to IBIT.

Dubai's crypto regulator has issued an alert, warning of firms falsely claiming to be part of the city's high-profile real estate tokenization pilot, saying that such misrepresentation may violate the emirate's virtual asset laws.

The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), in coordination with the Dubai Land Department (DLD), said on Tuesday that several entities have improperly suggested they are participating in the DLD's blockchain-based property title deed initiative, which launched as a limited pilot on March 19.

“No entities beyond those explicitly approved by DLD and VARA are authorised to participate,” the regulator said. “Any entity promoting their involvement in the project without formal confirmation… is misrepresenting their status.”

VARA did not name any firms in the release.

The tokenization initiative could account for 7% of all property deals, valued at 60 billion dirhams ($16 billion), by 2033, CoinDesk previously reported, as part of the city's broader push to position itself as a global tech and digital asset hub.

This warning from VARA comes days before Token 2049 kicks off in the city. Earlier in March, on-chain investigator ZachXBT pointed out that the conference tends to attract a disproportionate amount of scams.

Major tokens fell as much as 5% on Thursday as traders took profits on a steady move higher from earlier this week, with memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) leading losses among the largest assets.

Bitcoin (BTC) clung to the $93,000 zone in the past 24 hours, but XRP, Solana's SOL, BNB Chain's BNB and DOGE showed losses above 2%. Ether (ETH) fared relatively better with a 1.5% slump.

Overall market cap decreased 2.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, fell over 3%.

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. bagged over $916 million in inflows on Wednesday. Some traders point to the asset's growing safe haven as a catalyst underpinning this surge in flows.

“The inflows are driven by a declining U.S. dollar index, and Bitcoin's growing safe-haven appeal amid equity market volatility,” Vugar Usi Zade, COO at Bitget, told CoinDesk in an email. “The massive ETF inflows reflect Bitcoin's strengthening position as a leading crypto asset, with growing institutional adoption.

“Its reduced correlation with equities and safe-haven narrative position it as a diversification tool, though short-term challenges like weak investment signals require sustained macro catalysts,”

Bitcoin's safe-haven narrative has been growing in the past week on its relevant resilience, mirroring gold's price rise, even as bond yields and U.S. equities corrected amid the ongoing tariff wars.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump said he had no intention to fire Federal Reserve Chair Powell and that a deal with China (which is facing tariffs as high as 245% on some items) would significantly reduce some of its levies.

The mixed signals and frequent tone shift are jading traders, however, who continue to monitor comments for further cues on positioning.

“Macro risks remain, but one critical overhang appears to be cleared. Trump is signaling no intention to replace Fed Chair Powell for now. The reassurance has prompted a modest pullback in long-end yields, helping reduce a key tail risk,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message Thursday.

“The broader outlook, however, is anything but simple. Trade frictions, geopolitical jitters, and regulatory opacity continue to cast long shadows,” the firm added.

 New Hampshire's House Bill 302 would allow the state treasurer to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion. 

A bill that would allow New Hampshire to invest a portion of its state funds in digital assets and precious metals has advanced to a full Senate vote after passing a second committee.

On April 23, House Bill 302 (HB 302) was reviewed in the second Senate committee and passed in a 4-1 vote.

The legislation, introduced in January, cleared the New Hampshire House earlier this month in a 192–179 vote. It now faces a vote by the full Senate and, if approved, will require the governor's signature to become law.

Once enacted, it would allow the New Hampshire treasury to use 10% of the state's general funds to invest in crypto with a market cap of over $500 billion — a threshold currently met only by Bitcoin (BTC).

During a debate before the full House vote, Democratic Representative Terry Spahr argued that the bill is unnecessary. 

The lawmaker said it could undermine the future security of the state's digital asset stockpile. Spahr argued that the state treasurer already has the authority to manage investments without the bill.

Others said that it could earn the state good returns for its investment. Republican Representative Jordan Ulery said the investments could net the state a “large amount of money.”

Bitcoin Laws, which tracks the progress of digital asset legislation, shows that New Hampshire also has two more blockchain-related bills going through its legislature. 

HB 639 addresses blockchain dispute resolution and regulatory frameworks, while HB 310 focuses on real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin usage.

New Hampshire's progress comes as Arizona pursues a more aggressive approach by exploring the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, aiming to become the first US state to implement the policy.

 Bitcoin is up 7.68% over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 6.79% and 8.14% respectively. 

Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to the broader financial market amid macroeconomic uncertainty, but analysts caution it's still too early to know whether the trend will last.

“We're not quite there yet, but if Bitcoin holds strength through the upcoming CPI, as well as ongoing Powell-related and equity earnings volatility, the decoupling narrative could evolve from “temporary divergence” to “regime change,” Bitfinex analysts said in an April 23 markets note viewed by Cointelegraph.

The analysts said that while Bitcoin's (BTC) relative strength against US equities “appears real,” it is yet to be confirmed as structural. The analysts warned that Bitcoin has previously seen short periods of outperformance, only to eventually fall back in line with the broader market.

Cointelegraph recently reported that Bitcoin is increasingly abandoning its stock correlation to copy gold's upside. At the time of publication, Bitcoin's price has posted gains of 7.68% over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 6.79% and 8.14%, respectively, as per Google Finance data.

Over the same period, Nvidia (NVDA), which has outperformed Bitcoin over the past decade, fell 15.4%. The analysts attributed the decline to the “effective ban on advanced chip exports to China and tariff-driven volatility.” In May 2024, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said there is a “near zero chance of Nvidia outperforming Bitcoin over the next 10 years.”

The Bitfinex analysts described the current crypto market as a “hybrid state,” with rising macroeconomic risk on one side and an uptick in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on the other. 

April 22 alone saw $913 million in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, the largest since late January.

They added that this reinforces Bitcoin's position as a strong store of value, with Bitcoin dominance rising to levels not seen since late 2021. 

At the time of publication, Bitcoin's dominance was 64.39%, according to TradingView data.

Crypto market participants will be closely watching April's Consumer Price Index (CPI), published on May 13, after March data showed a cooling trend that some saw as a short-term bearish signal for Bitcoin.

March's CPI came in at 2.4% year-over-year, down from 2.8% in February, the lowest level since February 2023, according to the US Bureau of Statistics.

Meanwhile, some crypto analysts caution that other indicators suggest Bitcoin's rally may not last.

10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said, “Given that our stablecoin minting indicator has yet to return to high-activity levels, we remain cautious about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally.”

 ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he is “pretty sure this is how I voted,” amid the spot Bitcoin ETF posting a “massive” inflow day not seen since late January. 

BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has been named the best new ETF product by etf.com, as it recorded its highest inflows since Jan. 21. 

On April 23, BlackRock's iShare Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was awarded the “Best New ETF” at the annual etf.com ETF awards. In an X post shortly after, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said it “feels right to me.”

“I'm pretty sure this is how I voted. Both of them did things no one has seen [before],” Balchunas said, also referencing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) winning the “ETF of the Year” award. Over the past 5 years, VOO is up 89%, according to Google Finance data.

IBIT was also the recipient of the Crypto ETP of the year. 

IBIT's two awards came on the same day IBIT recorded $643.2 million in inflows, according to Farside data. It was the highest inflow day since Jan. 21, when it saw $661.9 million, just a day after US President Donald Trump's inauguration, when Bitcoin's spot price hit an all-time high of $109,000.

Bitcoin commentator Vivek said this “is massive,” while Apollo Sats co-founder Thomas Fahrer said, “Huge inflow.”

The IBIT fund, which launched in January 2024 alongside 10 other US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, has net assets of approximately $53.77 billion, according to BlackRock data. Over the past 30 days, it has traded, on average, 45.02 million shares per day. 

At the time of publication, a single IBIT share is trading at $53.20, as per Google Finance data.

Meanwhile, VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) received the award for “Best new ETF ticker.”

IBIT's large inflow on April 23 made up most of the $917 million seen across all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs that day. It was the second day in a row with over $900 million in inflows amid most of the month posting outflow days due to macro uncertainty.

On April 23, Glassnode pointed out that the $912 million ETF inflows the day prior equaled more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.

 The volatility of US bonds during tariff escalations may reignite Bitcoin's unique economic properties as a safe-haven and potential reserve asset, Ammous said. 

Analysts are criticizing the financial implications of US President Donald Trump's import tariffs, a development that some say highlights Bitcoin's unique economic properties during times of global uncertainty.

Trump's 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs, reverting them to a 10% baseline for most countries except China, has exposed vulnerabilities in the US bond market, according to critics.

Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, said Trump's decision to reverse the higher tariffs was likely a reaction to rising bond yields, suggesting the administration's hand was forced.

“Trump fought the bond market and the bond market won,” Ammous said in an April 23 X post. “The gambit seemed to work for the first day, and the huge crash in the stock market was presented as a small price to pay for fiscal sustainability.

“But then the bonds began to crash, and it became clear how disastrous the tariffs were, and how wrong it was to expect that deliberately crashing the stock market would boost the bond market,” he added.

Related: Trump's tariff escalation exposes ‘deeper fractures' in global financial system

Following Trump's tariff announcement, CNBC data shows that the 10-year Treasury yield surged from under 4% to 4.5% amid a sell-off driven by inflation and recession concerns.  

“The rise in yields was the exact opposite of what the administration wanted, and reversing course on the tariffs half a day after they go into effect was absolutely devastating for Trump's negotiating position,” Ammous said.

Some analysts, including Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal, have suggested the tariff maneuvering may only be “posturing” for the US to reach a trade agreement with China.

“All of the talk about China buckling under the threat of Trump now sounds hilarious in retrospect, when Trump could not keep his tariffs in place for two days,” Ammous said, adding that China “showed absolutely no inclination” to reach out and strike a deal.

Delays in reaching a trade agreement may limit the recovery of both equity and cryptocurrency markets, which hinge on the outcomes of the trade negotiations, according to Nansen analysts.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) is acting “less like a tech stock and more like a hedge against economic uncertainty,” after Trump signaled a “substantial reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods,” Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev told Cointelegraph.

Related: Crypto, stocks enter ‘new phase of trade war' as US-China tensions rise

The situation has revived long-standing proposals to back the US dollar with Bitcoin. 

Ammous said the US should keep buying BTC until the government holds enough to fully back the dollar supply, ultimately switching to a Bitcoin standard:

Historically, the dollar was backed by gold and redeemable for a fixed amount of the precious metal until 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspended gold convertibility in response to the Great Depression.

In 1971, President Richard Nixon halted the dollar's convertibility into gold, aiming to protect the US gold reserves and stabilize the economy, marking the beginning of the fiat currency system that remains in place today.

Bitcoin's fixed supply, which is hard-coded in its tokenomics, makes it a popular digital competitor to gold. 

Joe Burnett, director of market research at Unchained, predicted that Bitcoin may rival or surpass gold's market capitalization in the next decade, projecting that the Bitcoin price will surpass $1.8 million by 2035.

Celebrate Hubble Space Telescope's 35th Birthday with Stunning Images

Happy anniversary to the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched on April 24, 1990

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

The Tarantula Nebula, located about 161,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud bordering our Milky Way, is packed with ionized hydrogen gas dotted by supernova remnants.

NASA/ESA

Thirty-five years ago today a revolutionary new era of astronomy began when the Hubble Space Telescope, tucked onboard the space shuttle Discovery, blasted off Earth into history. The next day a robotic arm tipped the telescope into orbit from the shuttle's cargo bay. Within a month Hubble had truly begun its mission, gazing out at the cosmos for NASA and the European Space Agency with its 2.4-meter-wide starlight-gathering mirror—the largest ever launched to space at the time.

NGC 6302, known as the Butterfly Nebula, is located between 2,500 and 3,800 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. The image includes near-ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light. At the heart of the nebula lie one or more dying stars that are periodically flinging layers of gas out into space. This gas—reaching temperatures of more than 36,000 degrees Fahrenheit and speeds of more than 600,000 miles per hour—becomes the “wings” of the butterfly.

In the years since, Hubble has gathered more than 1.6 million observations and 430 terabytes of data. The telescope has revealed that supermassive black holes nestle at the heart of most large galaxies, Jupiter's icy moon Europa may be shooting plumes of water out into space and, in the distant future, our Milky Way galaxy will likely collide with our neighbor, Andromeda.

But the mission almost flopped.

The Hubble Space Telescope was decades in the works, even making a cameo appearance in a Superman comic in 1972, before it reached space in 1990. But after Hubble's deployment, as the telescope began operations, astronomers realized its vision was blurry and traced the issue to a tiny imperfection in the telescope's mirror.

A pair of planetary nebulae, IC 418 (left) and MyCn18 (right). IC 418 is located about 2,000 light-years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Lepus. At its heart is the remains of a red giant star that spat its outer layers of gas into space, creating the lattice of gas illuminated by ultraviolet light. MyCn18, located about 8,000 light-years away, glows with ionized nitrogen (red), hydrogen (green) and doubly ionized oxygen (blue).

Astoundingly, that mirror is still in use today aboard the observatory. Fortunately, Hubble was uniquely designed to be serviced in orbit by astronauts. NASA's first (and most urgent) servicing mission flew in December 1993; during five separate spacewalks, astronauts installed a new primary camera able to counteract Hubble's blurred vision, as well a bulky new apparatus that corrected the light that fed into the observatory's original suite of instruments.

The Hubble Space Telescope and a spacewalking NASA astronaut are seen in orbit around Earth during STS-61, the 1993 servicing mission to correct the observatory's optics.

M104, nicknamed the Sombrero Galaxy, is located about 30 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. M104 creates stars surprisingly slowly and is home to a mysteriously quiescent central supermassive black hole.

Additional shuttle missions in 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2009 also visited the observatory, extending its lifetime and expanding its view each time with new hardware and better instruments.

The galaxy NGC 1566 is located about 60 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Dorado. NGC 1566 is what scientists call a weakly barred or intermediate spiral galaxy and belongs to a group of gravitationally bound galaxies that astronomers are still working to understand.

The results have been nothing short of breathtaking. Hubble's position well above most of Earth's atmosphere allows it to see the cosmos unhindered by the tempests and turbulence that all ground-based observatories face. That privileged vantage point has profoundly shaped our understanding of the solar system and universe around us.

In our own neighborhood, Hubble has studied the changing weather on the outer planets, discovered moons orbiting Pluto and watched the once-in-a-lifetime impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter scar the giant planet with dark spots as big as Earth. It has even glimpsed the sun, in a feat it was most definitely not designed to attempt.

Hubble used its ultraviolet vision to capture an image of auroras on Jupiter in 2016 as NASA's Juno spacecraft was arriving in orbit around the massive planet.

In more distant reaches, Hubble provided conclusive proof that supermassive black holes exist and made the first observations of astronomical objects colliding as well as of the surface of a star besides our sun. And in a remarkable triumph, it managed to capture a first-of-its-kind snapshot of a supernova explosion that had been successfully predicted by astronomers.

The dense globular cluster ESO 520-21, or Palomar 6 (top), is located near the center of the Milky Way in the constellation Ophiuchus. The Carina Nebula (bottom) is a star-forming region located about 7,500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Carina. The pillar of dust and gas seen in this image stretches about three light-years tall and is being eroded away by radiation from hot newborn stars embedded in the column.

And, of course, it has taken some of the most iconic space photographs we have—among them, the stunning “Pillars of Creation” image of a stellar nursery known as the Eagle Nebula.

For 35 years Hubble has pushed the boundaries of possibility, transforming our view of the cosmos each time it beams the universe's light down to Earth. How long it will continue to do so, however, remains unclear. Since the 2009 servicing mission, the NASA shuttles that ferried astronauts to Hubble retired, and the hazards of space have taken their toll. Hubble's hardware failures are mounting, and the observatory's ongoing operations depend on an ever-increasing number of workarounds and improvisations. At this point, even the most optimistic “Hubble hugger” astronomers admit that the observatory's days are numbered.

Although Hubble is most known for its iconic photographs, it gathers other observations as well, such as this single exposure taken by the observatory's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. The image maps gas zipping around the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M84, located about 50 million light-years away from Earth. From the spectrograph's data, which show that the gas is moving as fast as 880,000 miles per hour, astronomers determined that the black hole contains at least 300 million times the mass of our sun.

In June 2024 NASA announced that failing machinery was forcing the observatory to begin operating with only one fully functional gyroscope, which slows the telescope's work. In addition, Earth's atmosphere is slowly but surely pulling Hubble down to Earth, bringing the observatory ever closer to fiery destruction, although reentry is not expected until next decade.

NASA launched Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, in 2021, although unlike Hubble, JWST is stationed so far beyond Earth's orbit that crewed servicing missions are too daunting to attempt. The two telescopes mostly collect data independently of each other but occasionally team up, combining their powers to produce spectacular results.

NGC 1999, located about 1,350 light-years away from Earth, is a reflection nebula created by debris from the newborn star V380 Orionis, visible at the center of the image. The image relies on data gathered by Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2—the replacement camera installed during the first servicing mission—in 1999.

ESA/Hubble & NASA, ESO, K. Noll (CC BY 4.0)

Despite its age, Hubble may yet be reborn. In 2022 billionaire Jared Isaacman, who has paid SpaceX undisclosed sums for several private spaceflights with the company, proposed a new servicing mission for the aging telescope. NASA officials seriously considered the proposal but in 2024 declined to pursue Isaacman's idea.

The lenticular galaxy NGC 4753 is located about 60 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo. Lenticular galaxies are elliptical objects; Hubble sees this particular galaxy nearly edge on. Scientists believe that the galaxy developed after a merger some 1.3 billion years ago.

ESA/Hubble & NASA, L. Kelsey (CC BY 4.0)

Now Isaacman is President Donald Trump's nominee to lead NASA. Senators conducted his confirmation hearing earlier this month; a vote has not yet been scheduled. It's not clear how ethics rules will impact Isaacman's relationship with SpaceX should he be confirmed or whether he would have the authority to resurrect the servicing mission proposal.

NGC 7635, nicknamed the Bubble Nebula, is located about 7,100 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia. The nebula is about seven light-years wide; at its heart is a star 45 times as massive as our sun that is spitting gas into space at speeds as high as four million miles per hour.

NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA) (CC BY 4.0)

And larger issues face the agency than the fate of any single observatory. Hubble and JWST are the only astrophysics telescopes that would continue to receive funding amid massive science cuts included in the Trump administration's budget request for NASA. (That said, budget allocations are made not by the president but by Congress, which has a long history of reinstating money to slashed space science projects.)

Such is the limitation of an astronomical marvel: while Hubble has spotted a star as it was less than one billion years after the big bang, even it cannot see its own future.

Lyme disease, a disease transmitted when deer ticks feed on infected animals like deer and rodents, and then bite humans, impacts nearly half a million individuals in the U.S. annually. Even in acute cases, Lyme can be devastating; but early treatment with antibiotics can prevent chronic symptoms like heart and neurological problems and arthritis from developing.

Scientists from Northwestern University have identified that piperacillin, an antibiotic in the same class as penicillin, effectively cured mice of Lyme disease at 100-times less than the effective dose of doxycycline, the current gold standard treatment. At such a low dose, piperacillin also had the added benefit of ""having virtually no impact on resident gut microbes,"" according to the study, which will be published April 23 in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Doxycycline and other generic antibiotics, on the other hand, wreak havoc on the microbiome, killing beneficial bacteria in the gut and causing troubling side effects even as it kills the borrelia bacteria that causes Lyme. In addition to its negative impact on the gut, doxycycline also fails to help between 10 and 20% of individuals who take it, and it is not approved for use in young children -- who are at the highest risk of tick bites, and therefore, of developing Lyme.

More effective, or at least more specified, treatment options are needed as climate change extends tick seasons and Lyme becomes more prevalent.

""Powerful, broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill extracellular bacteria are seen as the most effective medication because physicians want to just kill the bacterium and don't care how,"" said Brandon L. Jutras, who led the research. ""This is certainly a reasonable approach, but I think the future for Lyme disease patients is bright in that we are approaching an era of customized medicine, and we can potentially create a particular drug, or a combination to treat Lyme disease when other fail. The more we understand about the various strains and species of Lyme disease-causing Borrelia, the closer we get to a custom approach.""

Jutras is an associate professor in the microbiology-immunology department of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and a member of Northwestern's Center for Human Immunobiology. Jutras's lab was recently named a Phase 3 winner in LymeX Diagnostics, the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation's $10 million competition to accelerate the development of Lyme disease diagnostics, and in 2021 he won the Bay Area Lyme Foundation Emerging Leader Award.

The authors argue that piperacillin, which has already been FDA-approved as a safe treatment for pneumonia, could also be a candidate for preemptive interventions, in which someone potentially exposed to Lyme (with a known deer tick bite) would receive a single-dose shot of the medication.

To reach the conclusion that the penicillin relative would be the most effective and targeted treatment, the team screened nearly 500 medicines in a drug library, using a molecular framework to understand potential interactions between antibiotics and the Borrelia bacteria. Once the group had a short list of potentials, they performed additional physiological, cellular and molecular tests to identify compounds that did not impact other bacteria.

They found that piperacillin exclusively interfered with the unusual cell wall synthesis pattern common to Lyme bacteria, preventing the bacteria from growing or dividing and ultimately leading to its death.

Historically, piperacillin has been administered as part of a two-drug cocktail to treat severe strep infections because strep can break down beta-lactams (piperacillin's class of antibiotics) unless accompanied by tazobactam, which is an inhibitor of the enzyme that inactivates piperacillin. Jutras wondered if using the same two medications, rather than piperacillin alone, would be a more effective bacteria killer.

""Bacteria are clever,"" Jutras said. ""Strep and some other bacteria combat antibiotics by secreting beta-lactamases that inactivate piperacillin. We found the approach is totally irrelevant in the context of Lyme disease and another way that makes piperacillin more specific. Adding the beta-lactamase inhibitor doesn't improve the therapy because Lyme Borrelia don't produce beta-lactamase, but the cocktail does negatively impact the microbiome by becoming more broadly functional against beneficial residents.""

Lyme prevention remains a challenge -- no approved human vaccine exists -- and Jutras hopes his research moving forward will help with developing proactive strategies to diagnose and treat it.

The study was supported by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation and United States Department of Agriculture (VA-160113), the Dennis Dean Research Grant (Virginia Tech), the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (R01AI173256, R01AI178711), the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation and the Global Lyme Alliance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How DNA self-organizes in the early embryo","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250423111756.htm","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 02:20:46 GMT","

An international research team led by Helmholtz Munich has, for the first time, provided a detailed insight into how the spatial organization of genetic material is established in the cell nucleus of early embryos within the first hours after fertilization. Surprisingly, embryos demonstrate a high degree of flexibility in responding to disruptions in this process. The study, now published in Cell, reveals that no single master regulator controls this nuclear organization. Instead, multiple redundant mechanisms ensure a robust and adaptable nuclear architecture, allowing embryos to correct errors in the initial organization of their nucleus.

Early DNA Organization is Robust and Flexible

When the egg and sperm fuse, a comprehensive reorganization of DNA begins within the nucleus. Epigenetics plays a crucial role in this process, regulating gene activity through chemical modifications on DNA and its associated proteins. ""We wanted to understand how these epigenetic programs influence gene activity and ensure that the cell correctly executes its developmental tasks,"" explains study leader Prof. Maria-Elena Torres-Padilla, Director at the Institute of Epigenetics and Stem Cells at Helmholtz Munich and Professor at the Faculty of Biology at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU). ""Previously, it was not known whether a single central mechanism controlled nuclear organization after fertilization. Our results show that after fertilization, multiple parallel regulatory pathways control nuclear organization, reinforcing each other.""

Challenging the Classical Model of Nuclear Organization

To decipher the mechanisms of this reorganization, the researchers conducted a mid-scale perturbation screening in mouse embryos. To map epigenetic changes in early embryos, they employed state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques (see information box below). The analyses uncovered multiple redundant regulatory mechanisms involved in nuclear organization.

Furthermore, the experiments revealed that -- contrary to previous assumptions -- gene activity is not strictly determined by nuclear positioning. ""The position of genes within the nucleus did not always correlate with their activity,"" explains Mrinmoy Pal, first author of the publication and doctoral researcher at the Institute of Epigenetics and Stem Cells. Some genes remained active despite shifting to a nuclear region traditionally considered inactive, while similar relocations in other cases led to a drastic reduction in gene expression. ""This challenges the classical model of nuclear organization and genome function,"" Pal concludes.

Embryos Can Self-Correct Early Nuclear Organization Errors

Even more surprising was the finding that embryos can self-correct disruptions in nuclear organization, even after the first division of the fertilized egg. If nuclear organization was disrupted prior to the first cell division, it could get restored during the second cell cycle. This suggests that early embryos are not only resilient but also possess mechanisms to compensate for errors in their initial nuclear organization. The researchers discovered that this process is regulated by epigenetic marks inherited from the maternal egg cell. If these maternal signals are disrupted, the embryo can activate alternative epigenetic programs to eventually restore correct nuclear organization that might not originate from the mother. This indicates that embryos can utilize different starting points for their development to prevent developmental defects.

Relevance for Aging and Disease

The findings from study could have broad implications: in diseases such as Progeria, a genetic disorder causing premature aging, significant disruptions occur in DNA associated with the nuclear lamina. Additionally, several cancers are linked to changes in nuclear genome organization. ""Our results could help to better understand these mechanisms and, in the long term, develop new approaches to specifically influence epigenetic programs to improve disease outcomes,"" says Torres-Padilla.

Study Methods

To investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying early nuclear organization, the researchers used a combination of high-resolution molecular techniques:

By combining these techniques, the research team was able to comprehensively map the dynamics of nuclear organization during the first hours of embryonic development and reveal its plasticity.

The micro-organisms living in the human gut can affect many biological functions, including pain perception.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library

What Rina Green calls her “living hell” began with an innocuous backache. By late 2022, two years later, pain flooded her entire body daily and could be so intense that she couldn't get out of bed. Painkillers and physical therapy offered little relief. She began using a wheelchair.

Green has fibromyalgia, a mysterious condition with symptoms of widespread and chronic muscle pain and fatigue. No one knows why people get fibromyalgia, and it is difficult to treat. But eight months ago, Green received an experimental therapy: pills containing living micro-organisms of the kind that populate the healthy human gut. Her pain decreased substantially, and Green, who lives in Haifa, Israel, and is now 38, can go on walks — something she hadn't done since her fibromyalgia diagnosis.

Green was one of 14 participants in a trial of microbial supplements for the condition. All but two reported an improvement in their symptoms. The trial is so small that “we should take the results with a grain of salt”, says co-organizer Amir Minerbi, a pain scientist at the Technion — Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. “But it is encouraging [enough] to move forward.” The trial results and data from other experiments linking fibromyalgia to gut microbes are published today in Neuron1.

Fibromyalgia affects up to 4% of the global population and occurs in the absence of tissue damage. In 2019, Minerbi and his colleagues discovered that the gut microbiomes — the collection of microbes living in the intestines — of women with fibromyalgia differed significantly from those of healthy women2. This led the scientists to wonder whether a dose of microbes from healthy people would ease the pain and fatigue caused by the condition. After all, previous research3 had shown that gut microbes might indirectly influence an array of chemical signals tied to pain perception.

How pain is misunderstood and ignored in women

How pain is misunderstood and ignored in women

The team transplanted minuscule samples of microbe-laden faeces from both women with fibromyalgia and healthy women into mice without any microbes in their bodies. The researchers found that mice that received microbes from women with fibromyalgia showed signs of greater sensitivity to pain in response to pressure, heat and cold than did mice that got microbes from healthy women. The first group also showed more evidence of spontaneous pain.

The team next transplanted faeces from healthy women into mice that had been colonized with fibromyalgia-associated microbes and then treated with antibiotics. These mice showed reduced symptoms of pain after the transplant. Mice that received both transplants but didn't get antibiotics showed no improvement.

The researchers then conducted a trial with 14 women, including Green, who had severe, treatment-resistant fibromyalgia. All the participants received antibiotics and then, over ten weeks, regularly swallowed capsules containing gut bacteria from healthy women. Twelve reported improvement in symptoms such as pain, anxiety and sleep disturbances. Fatigue was a common side effect of the treatment.

The researchers note that gut microbes from people with fibromyalgia might prompt the immune system to attack neural circuits that are involved in pain. The microbes also metabolize compounds secreted by the human liver into molecules that can affect pain sensitivity.

Social constructs of descent-based identity, such as race and ethnicity, do not align with genetic groupings.Credit: Adamkaz/Getty

In 1924, motivated by the rising eugenics movement, the United States passed the Johnson–Reed Act, which limited immigration to stem “a stream of alien blood, with all its inherited misconceptions”. A century later, at a campaign event last October, now US President Donald Trump used similar eugenic language to justify his proposed immigration policies, stating that “we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now”.

If left unchallenged, a rising wave of white nationalism in many parts of the globe could threaten the progress that has been made in science — and broader society — towards a more equitable world1.

As scientists and members of the public, we must push back against this threat — by modifying approaches to genetics education, advocating for science, establishing and leading diverse research teams and ensuring that studies embrace and build on the insights obtained about human variation.

At a hearing in February, the now-confirmed head of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, reiterated his past comments that Black children should receive different vaccine schedules from white children because of variations in their immune systems.

How white supremacy became a global health problem

How white supremacy became a global health problem

Kennedy's motives in this regard are unclear. But after making numerous demonstrably false statements about vaccination, he is providing another layer of reasoning that the scientist whose work Kennedy cites described as “twisting the data far beyond what they actually demonstrate” while promoting racial essentialism: the false belief that people of different ‘races' have inherently distinct biology2,3. 

Meanwhile, although Trump stated at his inaugural address that his administration “will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based”, an executive order he signed in March condemns as “corrosive ideology” the Smithsonian Institution's promotion in its museums and research centres of the view that race is not a biological reality, but a social construct. 

Similar rhetoric is increasingly entering political discourse as pro-nativist and anti-immigration parties (at times propped up by scientific racism) gain traction in many parts of the world.

The dangerous and pseudoscientific ideas of eugenics have periodically gained popularity over the past century. But the latest wave of white nationalism is happening after decades of two interlinked concepts gaining attention and acceptance in the scientific community.

On the one hand, there is broad consensus among researchers that social constructs of descent-based identity, such as race and ethnicity, do not align with genetic groupings. On the other, there is growing awareness that diversity matters for sound science and effective policy, including in health care. Embraced together, these two concepts have strengthened science and increased benefits to health.

Decades of sociological data demonstrate that racial and ethnic identities, whether self-identified or otherwise, are constructs that are defined and deployed in specific sociopolitical contexts.

Take the degree to which racial and ethnic categories have been altered over the past two and a half centuries in the US Census, in response to political needs and social changes. The term Hispanic, which is now used to refer to people with heritage from Spanish-speaking countries, was first brought in for the 1970 census, in response to lobbying from Latino advocacy groups. In reaction to changing societal norms, the term African American was added to the 2000 census as an alternative to ‘Black' and ‘Negro' (with the latter being dropped in 2013, in time for the 2020 census).

Alongside analyses of sociological data, genetic research has repeatedly demonstrated that constructs of descent-based identity, such as race and ethnicity, do not align with discrete biological groupings. It has also shown that their use can exclude those who do not fit into a specific category and obscure substructure in populations, with implications for human health.

For example, the likelihood of people having haemoglobinopathies (inherited disorders that affect red blood cells) varies substantially depending on where in the world a person lives. In some regions of India, carrier rates for the blood disorder β-thalassaemia are estimated to be higher than 8%, whereas in areas of China, they can be as low as 2.7%4. This heterogeneity would be missed if researchers simply grouped study participants as ‘Asian', a term that refers to nearly 60% of the global population. Similarly, using the category ‘Hispanic' without considering other factors would fail to reveal that the genetic variant associated with Steel syndrome, a rare genetic bone disorder, is more common in people from Puerto Rico than in those from the Dominican Republic or Mexico5.

Many now question the use of race as an appropriate proxy for anything, from hypothesized biological differences to environmental influences. In fact, researchers and health-care providers have been moving away from ‘race-based medicine', in which perceived biological differences change the estimation of clinical risk and the provision of patient care on the basis of whether people are Black, white, Asian, Hispanic and so on6,7.

Counter the weaponization of genetics research by extremists

Counter the weaponization of genetics research by extremists

In conjunction with the growing acceptance of the idea that social identities related to ancestry don't align with genetic groupings, multiple studies conducted over the past decade have demonstrated the benefits of including diverse participants in research.

Any two human genomes are, on average, more than 99% identical. Yet millions of variants across people's genomes — including ones that are relevant for health — differ in frequency to varying degrees as a result of demographic processes (both random and non-random) playing out over centuries to millennia. Increasing the diversity of participants in studies increases geneticists' chances of finding variants that are important to health, and lessens their likelihood of drawing spurious conclusions about the genetic or other factors driving disease8,9.

The availability of large-scale multimodal data and advanced statistical and computational tools is making it easier than ever for researchers to stop relying on race or ethnicity as proxies for biology or structural and social determinants of health. Instead, they can interrogate the effects of many well-defined variables, from people's genetics and geographical location to their diet and income.

Over the past few years, multidisciplinary frameworks have been developed to inform researchers — and so aid study design and the appropriate interpretation of findings. Reports from the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, for instance, emphasize the need for more-diverse groups of participants to be included in genetics and genomics research2, as well as in biomedical research more broadly3. They also stress the importance of a diverse workforce — which has consistently been shown to result in higher productivity, as well as in work that has a greater impact on people's lives10,11.

Motorola unwrapped new Razr folding smartphones today—the Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra—the latter a pricier model that expands the family. But at the company's closed-door launch event on Wednesday in New York City, much of the spotlight was on Moto AI, artificial intelligence features powered by in-house and third-party large language models, like Meta's Llama.

Google's Gemini is naturally available on the Razr phones, but for the first time, the AI search engine Perplexity AI will be preinstalled on the devices. The CEO of Perplexity, Aravind Srinivas, took the stage to talk about the optimizations made to take advantage of the Razr's unique design. Motorola even says Microsoft's Copilot will also be available in the coming months. That's a whole lot of AI for such small phones.

The 2025 Razr lineup starts at $700 for the base Razr, $1,000 for the Razr+, and $1,300 for the Razr Ultra; the midrange Razr+ is almost the same device as the Razr+ from 2024, with a few enhancements to durability. It wasn't all phones, either. Motorola showed off new open-ear earbuds called Moto Buds Loop, complete with a Sound by Bose collab and Swarovski crystals embedded into the earbuds. And the Moto Watch Fit is a basic fitness watch for Android phones. Here's everything you need to know.

The Razr+ on the left, Razr Ultra in the middle, and Razr on the right.

The core change throughout the Razr 2025 lineup is the build quality. Motorola says a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate makes all the Razr models four times stronger than the previous stainless steel; it can withstand 35 percent more folds than before. The glass is thinner, which Motorola says allows for less of a crease at the fold, and the IP48 dust- and water-resistance is a small step up from most folding phones that aren't rated for any dust protection.

The Razr Ultra specifically employs Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic, not unlike Apple's Ceramic Shield on its iPhones, for supposedly 10 times better drop performance. (The Razr+ and Razr use Gorilla Glass Victus.)

Texture and color are other ways Motorola is trying to differentiate its smartphones. The company says in 2024, 65 percent of the phones it sold were not dark or neutral tones—colors that have long dominated the smartphone market. That's why the new Razrs have a rich, colorful palette. Textures also play an important role, hence the Razr Ultra comes in four finishes: Mountain Trail, which uses FSC-certified wood; Scarab, which is the first-ever use of Italian-made Alcantara on a smartphone; Cabaret, for a satin-inspired finish; and Rio Red, for a leather-inspired look.

Motorola also claims 25 percent of its Razr customers come from iOS, an unusually high figure in a category where iPhone owners tend to stick with Apple's hardware. More incentive for Apple to prioritize a folding iPhone.

The Razr+ and Razr Ultra retain that larger 4-inch external screen, over the Razr. Motorola says it's more customizable, with the ability to add dedicated panels for your friend's contact info, music streaming panels, and even more widgets for quick, glanceable access without constantly opening the phone. When you flip it open, the Razr Ultra now boasts the largest 7-inch screen of the lot, achieved by narrowing the bezels around the display.

The Razr Ultra's 4-inch front screen.

On the camera front, the main change is with the Razr Ultra. The second camera is now an ultrawide, while the telephoto stays on the Razr+ model. This was a slightly controversial move last year, when the Razr+ cut the ultrawide in favor of a 2X optical zoom. Having an ultrawide on a flip makes it easy to fit more people in the frame in group shots. The Ultra is also the only model of the lot that can capture videos in Dolby Vision, for more accurate colors.

All three devices can take advantage of a new photo feature called Signature Style, which lets you adjust the colors and tones of a photo, which can then be applied to all your images for a personalized aesthetic. But the Razr Ultra has some exclusive features. Group Shot is like Google's Best Take on Pixel phones, merging images to avoid a group photo where one person is blinking. Action Shot changes the shutter speed to make sure motion is tack-sharp, and Air Gesture lets you start video recording hands-free with a palm gesture, and stop recording with a fist.

The Ultra has the biggest battery, and it charges the fastest—wired and wirelessly—supporting 68-watt wired and 30-watt wireless charging. It's also the only Razr with a dedicated “AI key,” a button on the left edge of the phone that triggers Moto AI.

The Alcantara Razr Ultra sits at the top.

Motorola announced Moto AI last year and opened it up for beta, and the company says it has been refining the features based on user feedback. While you're able to use Google's Gemini assistant on these phones like other Android devices, you can now access Perplexity AI through the preinstalled app or Moto AI if you ask to “talk to Perplexity.”

Moto AI's core features are Catch Me Up, Remember This, and Pay Attention. Catch Me Up summarizes notifications, prioritizing urgent messages, if you're coming back to your Razr after some time and have a pile of notifications to sift through. Remember This lets you ask Moto AI to remember anything, even ask it to save screenshots, and you can ask it to recall that information later on. Pay Attention starts an audio recording, where the Razr will auto-transcribe a conversation and provide a summary at the end.

A few new tricks are here that weren't announced before, like Next Move. This predicts what you might want to do based on what's on the screen. Naturally, Motorola also has some AI generation services—Image Studio lets you create AI-generated art, and Playlist Studio comes up with a fresh playlist based on a prompt, though it seems to only work with Amazon Music right now.

If you put the Razr Ultra in tent mode, you'll enable a hands-free Moto AI mode, which lets you have a conversation with Motorola's assistant without manually activating it.

The Moto Watch Fit.

The Moto Buds Loop.

Rounding out the announcements are “Moto Things,” Motorola's umbrella term for accessories. They include open-ear earbuds, the Moto Buds Loop, and a new smartwatch, the Moto Watch Fit.

Open-ear earbuds are all the rage, and Motorola is elevating the look and sound with two collaboration partners: Bose and Swarovski. Yes, the earbuds have Sound by Bose for souped-up audio quality, and there's a version of the Buds Loop with Swarovski crystals. They have all the standard features you'd expect in earbuds today, from spatial sound support and a water-repellent design to 37 hours of battery life with the case alone (8 hours for the buds). No word on the price, though they arrive this summer.

The Watch Fit is not a Wear OS smartwatch, so you won't be able to use your favorite apps on this fitness watch. It works with any Android phone, and the Apple Watch-inspired 1.9-inch OLED screen will let you check notifications, control music playback, and track workouts. It can track your heart rate, sleep, and blood oxygen, plus it sports built-in GPS. It has an IP68 water-resistance and a 5 ATM rating, and 16 days of battery life. Motorola did not share pricing, but this wearable will arrive sooner in the “coming weeks.”

The Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra will be available for preorder starting May 7, and they officially go on sale May 15.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Use Instagram Edits, Meta's New CapCut Clone for Editing Videos","https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-instagram-edits-capcut-clone/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

In January, Meta announced its stand-alone video editing app for making Reels, simply called Edits. After release delays, users anywhere in the world can now download the app and try it out.

The new video-creation tool is clearly inspired by the success of ByteDance's similar CapCut app for TikTok, with tools dedicated to streamlined editing of vertical clips. Instagram's Reels feed of algorithmically selected clips was launched five years ago, also in direct response to TikTok's expanding influence at the time. Meta has never shied away from its mimetic tendencies; the company tends to adopt the buzzy software features of other apps by building those same features into its platforms. So, Edits, a creator-focused tool that makes it even easier to pump out social videos, is an unsurprising release designed to keep pace with competition.

Are you interested in getting started with Edits from Meta? I've been exploring the app since it dropped earlier this week. Here's what you need to know about Instagram's video-editing tool, how it generates Reels, as well as how Edits differs from CapCut.

The Edits app is now available to download on both Apple and Android phones. After you first open Edits on your phone, you will be required to log into the app using an Instagram account, which is frustrating but not shocking. Again, Meta's purpose for the app is not to spur video creation in the abstract; rather, it's a tool specifically made to help people make content to post on Reels.

You can capture videos up to 10 minutes in length directly in the Edits app.

In the Projects tab, you can see all of your recorded videos, and you can upload videos from your phone's camera roll.

After logging in, you'll see five tabs along the bottom of the app. On the left is the Ideas tab. Here is where you can jot down notes and brainstorm ideas for future Reels, and also watch over your saved videos from Instagram. Next is the Inspiration tab that shows a scrollable feed of videos that use trending audio tracks, plus a button that makes it easy for you to snatch one of those songs and use it in your own video. The middle tab is where all of your in-progress video Projects are located, and this is also the tab where you can upload any clips already stored on your camera roll that you want to turn into Reels. The Recording tab is next along the bottom, where you can shoot videos directly inside of the Edits app. Lastly, on the far right is the Insights tab, which shows engagement data, so you can learn who's watched your past Reels.

The Inspiration tab plays Reels that use trending songs and gives you a quick way to make your own video with a popular song.

The Ideas tab is like a scrapbook for things you want to incorporate into new Reels.

Insights is where you get your stats.

You don't need to have experience with TikTok's CapCut to get the hang of Edits, although those familiar with existing tools for editing vertical videos will immediately recognize most of this user interface: a timeline of clips in the middle with various tools along the bottom. You can adjust the video's sound by adding a music clip through “Audio” or tapping on “Voice” to record a voice-over. Here you can also add text, stickers, and image overlays to your video creation. If you're looking at the timeline of uploaded videos for a project, short-tap on an individual clip in the timeline and move the edges inward to crop its length. Want to try a different clip order? Long-press on a clip and drag it to shuffle everything up.

You can search for songs to use or add songs you've saved on Instagram proper.

Linear editing works much like it does in other video editing apps made for touchscreens.

Done and ready to post? Tap Export in the top right corner to download the video to your phone. The app will present buttons to share it directly to Instagram or Facebook, but really, since you just downloaded the video, you can post it anywhere you'd like.

While the purposes of these two apps are almost identical, there are a few key differences between Meta's Edits apps for Instagram and ByteDance's CapCut app for TikTok. Mainly, Edits is more streamlined and doesn't feel as cluttered—at least for now. There's no subscription option in Edits to unlock extra features, which is the case with CapCut, though Meta could add subscription tiers to Edits in the future. There's also not an overwhelming amount of AI-powered editing tools in Edits, which CapCut definitely has, although those could potentially be added at a later date.

Edits is initially more approachable as an app, but picky creators may find CapCut's additional options for video editing gives them a more fine-tuned level of control over the final product. Also, if you want to edit videos on a computer, rather than sitting on your smartphone all evening, you'll want to stick with CapCut—Edits is only available on mobile devices.

You can clip out specific objects or people in videos and isolate them.

There's an automated captioning feature for videos with speech.

There are multiple languages and styles available for captions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Apple Watch Just Turned 10. Here's How Far It's Come","https://www.wired.com/story/apple-watch-turns-10/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:02:22 GMT","

It's been 10 years since the Apple Watch debuted. It was actually announced at a special event on September 9, 2014, but only became available to buy seven months later, on April 24, 2025.

While it seems hard now to recall a time when the Apple Watch, or something similar, did not exist, the market hasn't always been so obvious. It was only 10 years ago that we were still wondering if Pebble would actually pan out, and all anyone wanted a Fitbit for was to get in their 10,000 steps (an entirely arbitrary number, but I digress).

Customers in Sydney, Australia, queueing for a look at the first Apple Watch in April 2015.

When it debuted, the first Apple Watch was glitchy and expensive. Battery life sucked. Many publications, including mine, spent significant time and space wondering why anyone even wanted a smartwatch. Today, it is an Apple success story. “Since 2015 til the end of 2024, we estimate that 281.2 million Apple watches have been shipped,” Jitesh Ubrani, a device research manager at IDC, tells WIRED. That's at an estimated value of $127 billion. No wonder it has spawned a flotilla of imitators.

However, on its 10th anniversary (or perhaps more appropriately its aluminum anniversary), the Apple Watch Series 10 faces a tumultuous global market. Even before the Trump administration announced tariffs, global smartwatch sales were slumping. As innovation slows (or is blocked in patent disputes), people are now holding on to their Apple devices for longer, while newer smartwatches, such as the Galaxy Watch are also coming for Apple's lunch.

Check Reddit's r/AppleWatch and you'll find people who still own—and use—the original Series 0. It's a reminder that Apple's Jony Ive poured years of work into a tiny design that was originally intended to be a piece of jewelry, before reportedly clashing with executives over what the watch's eventual function would be.

Potential buyers look at the various options offered by the first Apple Watch.

Initial unfortunate nomenclature aside—Tim Cook casually called it “the iWatch”, before that horrible name was kiboshed due to patent squabbles—it was beguiling, and Ive had his wish. Walking into an Apple Store and picking out your case and accessories was the closest many might have come to a luxury watch purchasing experience.

Because the Watch is not just a simple timepiece—you can change it to suit your needs or mood. When you buy an Apple Watch, you can also pick or change your bands, from the now-classic Milanese loop to the company's successful collaboration with Hermès. You can change your watch face to suit your outfit, to check if Snoopy has a cute new cartoon for the day, to go sailing, or map your way back off the trail. Those two ingenious buttons on the case's back that let you easily switch out your straps at a whim with no tools are now copied by almost all manufacturers in the watch industry, not just smartwatch manufacturers.

“Apple showed that [the strap] was a critical part of the design language, but also laid down the gauntlet in engineering secure, easy-to-use quick-release systems that didn't require tools. Brands have put a lot of R&D into this,” said Tim Barber, WIRED's watch expert.

While the $10,000 Apple Watch was certainly a folly—you still have to update an Apple Watch, even when it's pure gold (except when you no longer can)—the watch itself is to my eyes both beautiful and declaratory: Wearing one signifies that you're a serious person who cares about fitness and getting work done. It's the only watch that has ever outsold the entire Swiss watch industry, and actually, Barber notes, in part, reinvigorated the luxury watch industry.

The $10,000 Apple Watch Edition launched in 2015 and had an 18K gold case with sapphire crystal glass.

“Rather than wipe out mechanical watches, as some thought it would—hence the folly of TAG Heuer, Montblanc, and others getting into ultimately inferior smart watches—Apple Watch reinvigorated them as a prestige item specifically apart, and in opposition to, digital culture,” says Barber. “That undoubtedly benefited watchmakers. It's almost certainly been a net positive.”

Ive and the Apple Watch design team hit upon a key concept when it comes to digital wearables: It's a form of self-expression that you wear on your wrist, and it must actually look good for you to want to wear it. It was a health tracker that wasn't as overtly health-coded as a Fitbit or a Garmin. In fact, when the Series 0 first launched, it had only a few simple health features—the now iconic Activity Rings, the workout app, an optical heart sensor, and the heart app.

Ten years on, Activity Rings remains one of the best examples yet of fitness gamification. (Today is also Global Close Your Rings Day; if you close them today, you get a limited-edition award.) Every fitness tracker has a step counter, but the visual demonstration of how little you have left to do to close the Move ring has launched a thousand memes, and even a couple T-shirts.

Prior to the Apple Watch, smartwatches were conceived as a kind of wrist-based mini smartphone, to ping you with notifications or to take calls off your wrist. David Naranjo, associate director of Counterpoint Research, noted in a phone call with WIRED that Apple's success in this category was largely due to completely changing the watch's use case—from being a smartwatch to being a smartwatch with a dedicated health and fitness aspect.

“Fitbit and others had [an ecosystem and apps], but there were other things they were not able to do,” Naranjo said. “Apple built out the ecosystem and made the health care story very strong. Not only did the company focus on fitness and heart rate, it went beyond fitness and looked at a much deeper level of health care. That's where Apple excelled.”

Apple's ECG sensor launched on the Apple Watch Series 4.

Every year, Apple launches one stand-out health feature, from measuring VO2 Max on the Series 3 to the ECG sensor on the Series 4, all the way to sleep apnea notifications on the Series 10. “If you zoom out way into the future, and you look back and ask what Apple's biggest contribution was, it will be in the health area,” Cook said in an interview with WIRED last year.

This is a bold thing to say, especially given that the Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 don't even have blood oxygen measuring, due to a patent dispute with the medtech company Masimo. For a while, Apple has been doing research into features that would transform the Apple Watch for people with chronic conditions, like adding noninvasive blood glucose monitoring for diabetics, or adding blood pressure measuring for people with hypertension. Alas, despite promising advances, these features have yet to materialize.

Apple's latest project, an AI-assisted comprehensive health service, is far behind other health manufacturers such as Oura, Whoop, or even Garmin. Imagine, for example, being able to take a picture of your meal with the Watch Ultra and uploading it to the (still rudimentary) Health app, the way you already can with the Meals feature on an Oura Ring 4. You have to imagine it for now, of course, because the Apple Watch doesn't currently have a camera, and Apple's Visual Intelligence is still limited to the iPhone 16. But it seems within reach.

Still, the Watch's wearability and seeming ubiquity does mean that it has a track record of saving peoples' lives, whether that's by notifying users of an irregular heart rhythm via the ECG feature or calling the emergency services if it recognizes the user has fallen or been in a serious crash. I also have a personal anecdote to report—before the blood oxygen feature was removed, I had pneumonia. How did I know? My blood oxygen level, as measured by the watch, was at 84 percent. I went to urgent care and got antibiotics, stat.

While Apple has not historically always been first to market with a new health feature, it's a fast follower, and the features nearly always work. “Apple owners are very patient when it comes to Apple,” Naranjo says. “They've come to believe that Apple doesn't rush to market with something that isn't almost perfect.”

That point seems to bear out with the research. In 2022, nearly 80 percent of Apple iPhone owners also owned an Apple Watch, and it accounted for 56 percent of smartwatch sales in the North American market. Most importantly, research suggests most people who own an Apple Watch are pretty satisfied with their device.

As most of them are likely Apple users already, it helps that the Watch—like all Apple devices—integrates seamlessly with Apple's ecosystem. It's intuitive, easy to use, and has an interface that is pleasing to experience—both for the first time and 10 years on. I still twirl and push the tiny digital crown every day, and I find it a great way for navigating the device's smaller menus without obscuring text with your fingers.

The Taptic Engine that gently buzzes on your wrist has now been adapted to dozens of uses, from waking you up in the morning to gently pointing you in the right direction while you're walking or biking around and using Apple Maps. There is no way to count just how many tourists have not gotten robbed because they did not need to pull out their phone to figure out how to get back to the hotel from the bagel shop, but the number I imagine must be considerable. Whether you're pausing a podcast or doing a couple toe touches in the middle of the day, life seems a little easier with an Apple Watch.

The Apple Watch Series 10 and its many strap options.

I took a brief and stunningly informal essay of WIRED Gear team members who also wear Apple Watches on why they bought or wear one. Notifications, integration with the Apple ecosystem, and fitness tracking were the most common answers. “Waterllama also helps me keep track of my hydration,” product reviewer Ryan Waniata says.

“Can I confess that … the only thing I use my Apple Watch for is to ding my iPhone and find out where I lost it at home?” asked senior writer Zeyi Yang. Yes! I use it to find my AirPods Pro, too. The UWB chip that debuted in the Series 9 has saved countless minutes every morning, even if you're just finding AirTags and your phone with it, but sadly not using it to unlock your self-driving Apple car.

It's so easy to use, we're still willing to forgive its most annoying flaws, most notably the battery life. Charging my Apple Watch every day is the bane of my existence, and despite years of efforts to improve it, the closest that Apple has come is to launch … fast charging? Loading media onto the watch, even basic offline maps, is such a hassle that even Apple has resigned itself to the fact that most people will end up carrying their phone instead. Apple Watch will even still buzz you to stand up when you're driving on a freeway.

But most of all, there is the unfashionably late arrival of Apple Intelligence, which launched on iPhone last October. So far, the only Apple Intelligence features that you can use on the Watch (if you have not disabled it due to privacy concerns, or the fact that it's just kind of annoying or inaccurate) are notification summaries and the Reduce Notifications focus. This is underwhelming, to say the least. The only consolation is that Apple Watch users are not the only Apple customers waiting for Apple Intelligence to become useful.

In 2022, I wrote that Apple's wearables seem designed for an increasingly terrifying world. While I made fun of the marketing at the time, the world has gotten more uncertain and scary. I'm glad that I talked my husband into wearing an Apple Watch Ultra, and, thanks to Crash Detection, I will now know if he gets into a car accident on the way home. My aging parent now wears an Apple Watch with Fall Detection (and moved two blocks away from me, but that's another thing), which gives me peace of mind. Since I've gotten older, I'm glad that there are more cardio health features on the watch, particularly now that I know that nearly half of all adults in the United States have high blood pressure.

So despite the slowing market, I am still waiting to see what new features—health or otherwise—will be announced at this year's WWDC, and later on this year. “I would never count Apple out in terms of what they're able to do,” said Naranjo. “They've proven time and time again that they can create a new category and make that category grow.”

I can be patient and wait in Apple's sticky ecosystem, biding time until blood glucose monitoring shows up. Ten years ago, we all asked if we could even find a use for Jony Ive's piece of glittery, buzzing jewelry; not even Apple knew the future success that it had on its hands (or its wrists). The Apple Watch is ubiquitous, and we're still waiting for more.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Gmail's New Encrypted Messages Feature Opens a Door for Scams","https://www.wired.com/story/gmail-end-to-end-encryption-scams/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Google announced at the beginning of April that it is launching a streamlined tool that will allow business users to easily send “end-to-end encrypted” emails—an effort to address the longstanding challenge of adding additional security protections to email messages. The feature is currently in beta for enterprise users to try out within their own organization. It will then expand to allow Google Workspace users to send end-to-end encrypted emails to any Gmail user. By the end of the year, the feature will allow Workspace users to send the more secure emails to any inbox. Email spam and digital fraud researchers warn, though, that while the feature will provide a new option for email privacy and security, it will also inevitably spawn new phishing attacks.

End-to-end encryption is a protection that keeps data scrambled at all times except on the sender and recipient's devices, and it is difficult to add to the historic email protocol. Mechanisms to do it are typically very complicated and costly to implement and only make sense for large organizations trying to meet specific compliance requirements. In contrast, Google's end-to-end encrypted email tool is simple to use and doesn't require significant IT overhead. The scenario that digital fraud researchers are most concerned about, though, relates to the case where a Workspace user sends an end-to-end encrypted email to a non-Gmail user.

“When the recipient is not a Gmail user, Gmail sends them an invitation to view the E2EE email in a restricted version of Gmail,” Google wrote in a blog post. “The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email.”

The fear is that scammers will take advantage of this new and more secure communication mechanism by creating fake copies of these invitations that contain malicious links, and prompt targets to enter their login credentials for their email, single sign-on services, or other accounts.

“Looking at Google's implementation, we can see it introduces a new workflow for non-Gmail users—receiving a link to view an email,” says Jérôme Segura, senior director of threat intelligence at Malwarebytes. “Users might not yet be familiar with exactly what a legitimate invitation looks like, making them more susceptible to clicking on a fake one.”

Given email's technical limitations, Google created a way for an organization's Workspace to automatically manage keys—used to descramble encrypted messages. Key management is what makes end-to-end encrypting email so difficult, so offering a solution that is easy for customers is a departure from what's currently available. The fact that the organization's Workspace controls the keys rather than storing them locally on a sender and recipient's devices does mean that the feature doesn't quite qualify as end-to-end encryption in the strictest sense of the term. But researchers say that for use cases like business compliance, the tool could still be extremely useful. And individuals who want end-to-end encrypted communications should just use a purpose-built app like Signal.

When Gmail users receive one of the new encrypted emails from a Google Workspace user, Google's extensive array of dynamic spam filters and fraud detection mechanisms will be in play to protect against spam, phishing, and rogue imposters broadly. But email users outside the Google ecosystem will also be able to receive encrypted email invitations, which makes the service available to anyone, but also will leave non-Google users to their own devices.

Scammers will prey on anything topical to generate new scams, and this threat certainly isn't unique to Google's new encrypted email feature. The invitations to view end-to-end encrypted emails will come with a warning that says, “Be careful when signing in to view this encrypted message. This message is from an external sender and is encrypted. Make sure you trust the sender and their identity provider before entering your username and password.”

“While it's absolutely true that scammers are always looking for new ways to abuse any product, we built this particular technology with this risk in mind,” Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer said in a statement. “The notifications users will receive in this case are very similar to Drive file sharing notifications that go out whenever someone shares a doc or file. All the protections we employ to keep scammers from capitalizing on these messages will help us protect this new class of notifications as well.”

Generations of Google Drive and Google Docs scams show, though, that it is particularly difficult to combat imposter invitations outside of Google's ecosystem. But when it comes to the new end-to-end encrypted email feature, “it was either adding a warning or not allowing this feature for non-Gmail users,” Malwarebytes's Segura says.

In fact, the new tool may offer particularly good fodder for scammers, given that Google is such a trusted organization, and targets may have heard about how end-to-end encryption is a special, gold-standard security feature.

“It's almost as if someone at Google knew this was a bad idea and asked for a warning to be added,” Malwarebytes' Segura says. “It's quite likely fraudsters will jump on the opportunity to craft phishing emails using this exact same template, even including the original warning that will be overlooked.”

You might have already made up your mind about lining up outside a GameStop to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. Or maybe, if you're like me, you're wondering whether it's smart to shell out $450 for Nintendo's console when prices are jumping everywhere.

Whatever you decide, the first thing to know is that, as of April 24, Nintendo has launched preorders in the US and Canada. Preorders went live in other countries earlier, but Nintendo canceled the original April 9 preorder window for the two countries to assess the impacts of the tariffs. The good news is that the price of the Switch 2 console remains at $450, and the Mario Kart World bundle is still $500. That said, a few accessories have been hit with a small price hike.

In today's age of scalpers, preordering a Nintendo Switch 2 isn't as simple as adding it to your cart when the website goes live. If you buy directly from Nintendo, for example, you need to meet certain requirements. Don't worry, we break it all down in this guide.

The Switch 2 will feel extremely similar to anyone who has used a Switch. It's now larger, with a 7.9-inch screen versus the original's 6.2 inches, but it maintains the hybrid functionality—it's a portable console, but you can dock it to play on a TV. Everything you play on it will look better, thanks to a custom Nvidia graphics card. Nvidia claims the Switch 2 has 10 times better graphics than the original Switch, with ray tracing support and AI-powered upscaling.

The LCD screen might feel like a step back from the Switch OLED version—OLED typically offers better contrast and vibrant colors, but LCD is often brighter. That said, the 7.9-inch screen now sports a 1080p resolution with HDR support. It also has a 120-Hz variable refresh rate, meaning you'll see more frames in a single second, making everything on the screen feel more fluid.

The Joy-Con 2 controllers are larger to accommodate the bigger console, and now, you can use them as mice in certain games like Drag X Drive. That might also mean that shooting in a first-person shooter can feel more precise, and it can enhance the gameplay of a real-time strategy game like Civilization VII, if your arms don't get tired first. Nintendo confirmed the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not use Hall effect sensors, but are still more durable and smooth. Hopefully, that means no more Joy-Con drift. They now connect to the Switch 2 via magnets.

The speakers are better (they now support 3D audio via headphones), and the built-in microphone filters out unnecessary background sounds so your teammates won't hear the blender running in the kitchen. The Switch 2 comes with two USB-C ports, allowing you to charge it in handheld mode when it's on a table, and also connect peripherals like the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, which lets you bring your face into games when socializing with friends.

The new social features are driven by the C button on the right Joy-Con 2, which triggers GameChat. It lets you speak to in-game friends using the mic, and you can even share your screen so your teammates can help you navigate puzzles in case you're stuck, even if they're playing a different game. These GameChat features require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

When you place the Switch 2 on the dock, it now outputs 4K resolution with HDR to TVs (up from 1080p). When docked, you will be capped at 60 frames per second at 4K and 120 fps at 1440p resolution. The dock has a USB-C port for power, an Ethernet port for faster internet speeds, and an HDMI port to hook it up to the TV. On the front are two USB-A ports to connect accessories.

You can use physical game cartridges, and the Switch 2 cartridges are red. As for storage, you now get 256 GB included (up from 32 GB), and a microSD Express slot to expand space. You cannot use your old microSD card—microSD Express is significantly faster, which affects download speeds and how quickly games load.

The Switch 2 costs $450, which is $150 more than the original and $100 more than the Switch OLED. The only game bundle at launch is with Mario Kart World.

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Preorders are live for the Switch 2 as of midnight Eastern time on April 24 or 9 pm Pacific on April 23. The console officially goes on sale June 5. Here are the nitty gritty details from the top retailers, including when stores will open on launch day:

It doesn't look like you'll be able to preorder the Switch 2 through Amazon, but this could change. You can keep an eye on Nintendo's Amazon storefront.

There's some risk involved in preordering a Switch 2 from one of the big retailers. Scalpers and bots could get to them first, a plague we've seen before with graphics cards.

Thankfully, Nintendo has a solution to prevent all the Switch 2 stock from going to scalpers if you buy directly from the company. First, sign in to your Nintendo Account here and register your interest in purchasing the console (you need to be at least 18 years old). You'll then receive an email when it's your time to purchase, and the company says the first batch of invites will go out on May 8. The invites are first-come, first-served, and you'll have 72 hours to complete the purchase from the time the email is sent out.

You have to be the person who purchased the Nintendo Switch Online membership to register, must have paid for it for a minimum of 12 months, and must have opted in to share gameplay data and have at least 50 hours of total gameplay.

You can pay with Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay, or Apple Pay, and you'll be paying the whole amount at checkout. Orders will be shipped to your address of choice in the US and Canada. Nintendo says “release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times,” so you might not have a Switch 2 on June 5.

While Nintendo announced a bevy of games during the Switch 2 Direct on April 2, only a select number will be available on June 5.

There will be several other games launching over the summer, like Donkey Kong Bananza, Drag X Drive, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. In the fall and winter, you'll see titles like Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Elden Ring, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.

The Switch 2 has broad backward compatibility, meaning most Switch games will work just fine. However, Nintendo has announced a handful of “Switch 2 Edition” games that will take advantage of the Switch 2's hardware for enhanced graphics, smoother gameplay, and in some situations, new content.

If you do not own Breath of the Wild, the Switch 2 Edition will cost $80. However, if you bought it for the original Switch—physical or digital—you can buy an upgrade pack on the Nintendo eShop for $10. Some upgrade packs will cost $20 if there's new content in addition to the graphics enhancement, like the Star-Crossed World expansion for Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

At launch, anyone with a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership can get the upgrade pack for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for free.

There are several first-party accessories you can snag for the Switch 2 console. Some of these have seen price hikes due to the tariff trade war.

You might be better off holding onto your original Nintendo Switch, but if you want to reduce the sting of buying a Switch 2 even a little bit, GameStop will have special trade-in values that start on April 24. You can get up to $125 for a standard Switch, $175 for a Switch OLED, or $100 for a Switch Lite. The catch is they need to be in pretty good condition—GameStop will not accept Switch consoles with Joy-Con drift. You also need everything that came in the original box.

One of the big announcements from the April 2 Nintendo Direct was that GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. Just like how you've been able to enjoy SNES and Game Boy games, now you can relive the glory days of the GameCube. Titles include The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soul Calibur 2. These games will look better and play at higher resolution, though they're not remasters.

These GameCube games will launch on June 5 alongside the Switch 2, and you'll need to subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online: Expansion Pack. (That's a separate, pricier tier from the standard Switch Online membership.) You can also snag a cordless, modernized version of the GameCube controller to play these games, though the original will still work with the right adapter. Unfortunately, you will need a Switch 2 console to play these GameCube games. They're not compatible with the original Switch.

The MacBook is a powerful machine. Whether you're using a MacBook Air for web browsing and sending emails or a MacBook Pro for graphics-intensive projects like video editing and 3D design, Apple's laptops can do the job. But I suggest throwing some MacBook accessories into the mix. A slew of peripherals can vastly improve your experience, like laptop stands, keyboards, charging bricks, and external displays.

I've tested dozens over the years—these are the best MacBook accessories to streamline your workflow and unlock your machine's full potential. Check out our Best Home Office Gear guide for more recommendations.

Updated April 2025: We've added the Apple Studio Display, Mosiso Keyboard Cover, and the Satechi SM3 mechanical keyboard.

This case is available for a few MacBook models, but I've been using it with the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021). It has precise cutouts for all the ports, rubberized feet that prevent it from sliding, and ventilation to keep the MacBook from overheating. For this specific model, the case comes in clear, pink, and black. It does add a noticeable heft to the 16-inch MacBook Pro—which is already a heavy laptop.

I haven't used a keyboard cover on my laptop since college. But lately, I'm seeing it on people's MacBooks on TikTok. I take my MacBook Air on the go often, and I'm always getting makeup on it or trying to keep crumbs from falling through the cracks. So I decided to buy a keyboard cover.

This one from Mosiso has been great. It fits accurately on top of each key (complete with a cutout for the Touch ID button), feels comfortable to type on, and is thin enough that I can fully close the MacBook lid without damaging the screen. Made of silicone, it's easy to wipe down accidental coffee spills too. It's available in various colors and different MacBook models, including the M-series MacBook Air (13-inch and 15-inch), and the M-series MacBook Pro (14-inch and 16-inch).

Branch's laptop stand now holds the top spot in Best Laptop Stands guide. You can easily adjust it to any angle you need and it raises laptops from 2 to 7(ish) inches. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano says it's sturdy too, so it doesn't bounce around if you're working off your laptop instead of using an external monitor. With a pretty wood top and an aluminum base and legs, it's also aesthetically pleasing. And, at $65, it's a lot more affordable than a lot of other stands we've tested.

The 15-inch MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) in Starlight is stunning, but it's tough to conceal scratches or dings on such a faint color. And while I'd typically opt for a case, I didn't want to add any additional weight or bulk to a slim, lightweight laptop. This skin from Dbrand was the perfect solution. It's super thin, easy to install, and is accurately cut to fit the MacBook. It's textured too, which gives it a high-end feel and a sleek look. It's also durable for the most part. I spotted a few dings on the skin itself— which technically means it is doing its job protecting the MacBook—but I quickly buffed them out with a hair dryer.

It also comes in dozens of fun colors and prints, and has the option to customize your kit. Dbrand sent me the Deluxe Kit in Off Pink, which comes with the top skin, bottom skin, trackpad skin, palm rest skin, and microfiber cloth. It's more expensive, but it's a great option if you want to protect every inch of your MacBook. Otherwise, you can opt for the Essential Kit, which comes with only the top and bottom skins. They're available for different MacBook models too.

This is one of the slimmest and most compact 65-watt chargers I've ever tested. It dished out nearly 60 watts to the 2020 MacBook Pro with M1 and fully recharged it in an hour and a half (from 0 to 100 percent!). It has a soft-touch feel that's a nice upgrade over most plasticky chargers, and the plugs fold in sideways so it maintains a slim profile. It stayed put in several outlets and, since the USB-C port is at the bottom, it never fell off the wall, unlike certain chunky chargers. Best of all, you get a braided, 6-foot, 100-watt cable in the box.

If you have a MacBook Pro, go for Satechi's 108-watt wall charger. It's on the larger side, but it's not as big as the one from Apple. It comes with three USB-C ports, each with the ability to charge at 100 watts if only one device is connected—perfect for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. However, if you want to charge three gadgets at once, it'll charge them at 45, 30, and 30 watts, respectively, 58, 30, and 20 watts, or 65, 20, and 20 watts, depending on what you're charging. The plug folds up too.

I've been using the 16-inch version and it looks just as cute in person as it does online. The puffiness provides plenty of protection, and the velcro closure is strong enough that I'm never worried the laptop will slide out. I've been using it with the 15-inch MacBook Air, which leaves space for me to squeeze my keyboard and mouse into the sleeve as well. There's also a 13-inch/14-inch version for those who have smaller MacBooks.

Ever since Apple debuted the new Magic Keyboard on its MacBooks in 2021, it's been difficult to find a third-party keyboard that feels similar (if not the same). This is remedied with Apple's very own external keyboard. It's expensive but a nice way to fully replicate the MacBook setup. It comes equipped with a Touch ID button, which you can use to log in, pay for purchases, and download apps, as well as a number pad. It has the same function row keys as M-series MacBooks—complete with playback buttons, a Mission Control key, and a dedicated Do Not Disturb button. If you don't need this full-size version, there's also the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID ($149).

Prefer a more luxe experience? WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu has had a good experience with Harber London's full-grain leather sleeve. The inside is lined with wool felt to keep your machine scratch-free, and the black or tan leather exudes luxury. It fits a variety of MacBook models, including the 16-inch M2-powered version. The flap stays shut thanks to magnets, so your MacBook won't easily slip out. You can even charge the laptop while it's in the sleeve.

This is currently our favorite hub in our Best USB Hubs guide. It sports several USB-C ports, which are also conveniently labeled by their maximum speed. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft said he consistently got speeds of 850 to 900 megabytes per second on the fastest USB-C port, while the fourth can reach over 400 MB/s. It can handle beefier tasks in minutes too, like transferring hundreds of gigabytes of 6K footage within minutes. The only gripe is that it doesn't have any USB-A ports, but that's become a common complaint for laptops and accessories alike.

Belkin's Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few charging docks with support for Apple's DockKit framework—which means the iPhone's native camera has the ability to track your face. Belkin's stand, which sits above a 360-degree base, moves around the room to always keep you in frame. Since it also has MagSafe baked in, I keep it at my desk throughout the workday and use it to charge my phone. It makes it easy to keep an eye on notifications, answer calls, and scroll through social media. But it's especially great as a MacBook accessory if you prefer to use your iPhone's superior camera as a webcam—the face tracking works in video conferencing apps like Google Meet or Zoom.

This is Satechi's first full-size mechanical keyboard, and it comes with a number pad. It's been my daily driver since January, and I'm having difficulty swapping it out for another because I've been enjoying it that much. The low-profile brown switches are clicky and satisfying (but don't feel like too much of a departure from Apple's Magic Keyboard), and the adjustable feet make it super comfortable to type on for long periods. The keys are backlit (with 14 patterns to choose from), and the keycaps are swappable. You can pair it with up to four devices (two via Bluetooth, one via the 2.4-GHz USB receiver, and one via a wired connection).

At its core, the Nuio Flow is another split keyboard. But this one has been designed with more customization than what you'll find on the market. For starters, the Flow Keyboard comes with scissor switches—instead of mechanical keys—for less key travel. And rather than a traditional rectangular shape, it has a 3D wave design with contoured keys that feel like they're hugging your fingertips as you type. Both pieces are wireless, so you can position each one as close or as far apart as you'd like.

You can learn more about my experience with the Flow Keyboard by reading my hands-on. I recommend it only if you're already a wireless, split keyboard user. But it's too expensive to be someone's first ergonomic keyboard. In addition to the keyboard, Nuio offers additional accessories including a trackpad ($249), small adjustable stands, a desk pad (starting at $129), and wristpads ($99 for a pair). The entire system is magnetic, so each accessory (including the keyboard) clicks into place on the deskpad to help keep everything together.

I've never used a wrist rest before. And, according to Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, the excessive pressure a wrist wrest puts on the delicate tendons under the wrists can cause carpal tunnel syndrome and tenosynovitis (inflammation of the sheath surrounding tendons). But when my colleague, Nena Farrell, reviewed the Logitech Aurora Collection (7/10, WIRED Review), I couldn't resist the adorable cloud palm rest (which you can buy separately from the rest of the collection).

Aside from looking adorable—especially next to my pink Nuphy Halo75 V2 keyboard—it's also super comfortable. But, as Nena said in her review, it's got height to it. So, you'll want to use it with either a mechanical keyboard or another taller keyboard for the most enjoyable experience.

I've been using this mouse with both my MacBook Pro (2024) and iPad Pro (M4) for a while now. I keep it at my desk the majority of the time, but it's also my go-to for travel. The ergonomic design is super comfortable against my palm (especially for long periods), the scroll wheel is smooth, and the buttons are extremely responsive. There's also a Type-C port for charging that is, thankfully, placed on the front of the mouse so you can continue to use it while it's plugged in. The modern, sleek design compliments the MacBook nicely, and it comes in various colors including space gray, silver, gold, rose gold, and blue.

The best part about having a laptop is that it's portable, allowing you to work from virtually anywhere at any time. But if you're the type who likes to work using an external keyboard and mouse, it can be annoying to have to also carry your accessories everywhere. Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution to this specific issue. The included keyboard and trackpad fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand (which holds your laptop in place using magnets). It's expensive, but it's an ideal choice if you're the type who is constantly working out of coffee shops, the library, or travels a lot.

I've been using this one at my desk, which gives me enough room to place my keyboard, mouse, notebook, and coffee mug. It feels nice, looks sleek, and is easy to clean (I've managed to wipe up accidental spills with no trouble). This desk mat comes in a variety of fun colors including dark orange, light green, and blue. Since it's felt, it slides around slightly—but I've been using it on a glass desk. If you're worried about this, get the Grovemade Matte Desk Pad instead. It's pricier, but the cork bottom keeps it from moving around.

This is our favorite everyday monitor in our guide to Best Computer Monitors. It has a 1080p IPS screen that's great for viewing emails and spreadsheets, along with casual gaming. It also comes with a VESA mount, so it's easy to swivel and adjust to your preferred height. It can rotate vertically, making this a solid choice if you're looking for a second display with a vertical orientation. With built-in speakers, it's ideal for video calls or for playing music throughout the day while you work.

The Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is expensive, especially when compared to our other favorite monitors. But if you want to stick within the Apple family, it's a great companion for the MacBook. It has a sharp 5K resolution, a 12-megapixel camera, and built-in mics and speakers. On the back, there are three USB-C ports and a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) port—the latter of which delivers up to 96 watts of power, which means my MacBook always stays charged, even during intense workloads.

The Herschel Heritage is a more affordable option and our favorite budget bag. On the inside, you'll find a 15-inch laptop sleeve to fit a 13-inch MacBook or 14-inch MacBook Pro, with plenty of room to pack in more supplies. It's super durable too. WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano says it only started to show signs of wear after several years of use. Our only gripe is the lack of a water bottle compartment.

This tote from Moment is former WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey's favorite. It has pockets for days (and pockets within pockets) allowing you to store a 16-inch MacBook, multiple water bottles, and cables. Since Moment is a photography brand, the bag comes with padding to protect your gear along with a full-zip closure and weatherproof recycled nylon as well. Since it can hold so much stuff, it also distributes weight evenly to avoid causing shoulder pain.

Apple's AirPods Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are expensive but they reign as the absolute best noise-canceling headphones in our book. With excellent sound quality, brilliant noise reduction, stellar build quality, and seamless connectivity, they're hard not to love. When paired with your MacBook, they'll automatically connect to the laptop whenever you take them out of the case. If you own other Apple devices like an iPhone, you can easily switch back and forth between devices without having to manually dig through the Bluetooth menu.

If you prefer earbuds, we recommend the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd-generation) for $249. These are the best earbuds for iPhones, but they're also a great option for MacBooks. The latest generation AirPods Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has improved noise canceling, longer battery life (up to six hours of playtime), and better sound quality.

Apple 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter

We've tested a lot of accessories. Here are a few more solid options if you're hunting for more.

Apple 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter for $50: Apple's dual power adapter comes with two USB-C ports, which lets me recharge my MacBook Air and iPhone simultaneously. It's rated at 35 watts, so it's powerful enough to recharge an iPad Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and more. It will recharge a MacBook Air just fine, though more power-hungry MacBook Pro models will require something more powerful.

Ugreen Revodok Pro 211 Docking Station for $56: This is more of a mix between a dock and hub, but it packs plenty of ports and power. You'll get three USB ports (one USB-C and two USB-A) that, in testing, hit up to 900 MB/s of data transfer speeds. It's also a great choice for anyone using more than one monitor at their desk. You can use it to connect a multimonitor setup, along with accessories like a keyboard, mouse, and headphones. It's worth noting the docking station is slightly heavy but compact.

Casetify I'm Busy Macbook Case by Tabetaaii

Casetify I'm Busy Macbook Case by Tabetaaii for $78: I've been using this adorable case I'm Busy MacBook case by tabetaaii for the 13-inch MacBook Air (2022). It's durable, the cutouts are accurate for all the ports, and the rubberized feet at the bottom keep it in place. As with most cases, it does add some weight to it. If you choose one of the clear cases (like the ones I've been testing) the matte finish can be a fingerprint magnet, but it's easy to wipe off. I tested the standard versions, but Casetify discontinued those. You will, however, have the choice between its Impact and Bounce cases which come equipped with bumpers on the sides for extra protection.

Moft Laptop Carry Sleeve for $60: This is a sleeve that doubles as a laptop stand, with the option to choose between two heights. You can also use the built-in pocket to store additional items like a charger or earbuds. The sleeve is on the larger side though (I used it with the 15-inch MacBook Air), so it's not the easiest to fit into backpacks. But I would typically carry it or throw it into my tote bag.

Casetify Happy Doodles Laptop Sleeve for $46: As with its laptop cases, Casetify also offers a bunch of fun sleeves. I've been using this adorable one with the 15-inch MacBook Air. It's not as cushiony and roomy as the Baggu version, but it still offers enough padding to protect your laptop. Plus, the cute print always brightens my day.

Logitech MX Mechanical Mini for Mac

Logitech MX Mechanical Mini for Mac for $110: This Mac version of the Logitech's MX keyboard mimics the experience of your MacBook keyboard a little better. There's a Do Not Disturb key and the ability to program the function row key with Apple's apps like Final Cut Pro, Keynote, Photos, Safari, and more, using the Logi Options+ app—in addition to other Mac-specific shortcuts. It's only available with tactile quiet switches, which are ideal if you typically work around other people. The low-profile keys are still satisfying to type on all day. It's slim and lightweight so it's a nice option to travel with too.

The Das Keyboard MacTigr for $179: This keyboard (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has a dedicated Mac layout, Cherry MX Red switches (that don't get too loud), a high-quality all-metal build, and a two-port USB-C hub.

Satechi Dual-Sided Eco-Leather Deskmate for $28: This desk mat features one color on each side—that way, you can flip between colors whenever you'd like to change things up. It's made of polyurethane leather, but it looks pretty and my mouse glides smoothly over the top. Like Grovemade's desk mat, it's easy to clean too.

Apple Magic Trackpad 2 for $130: If you're already used to the trackpad on your MacBook, then you can't go wrong with the external Magic Trackpad. It has the same Multi-Touch gestures and Force Touch technology, so there's no learning curve involved. It automatically pairs with your MacBook for seamless connectivity. The battery lasts about a month, and the trackpad comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable to recharge it.

Rains Backpack Mini

Rains Backpack Mini for $95: The Rains BackPack Mini is the most stylish pick in our Best Laptop Backpacks guide. It's attractive, functional, and fits a 13-inch MacBook along with a few other accessories. If you're worried it's too small, we also like the larger 13-liter version for $125.

Harber London Leather City Backpack for $608: It's expensive, but this all-leather bag is currently WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite. It can fit up to a 16-inch MacBook in a dedicated sleeve, has space for a spare tablet or a Nintendo Switch, and includes a few pouches in the main compartment and in the front zippered pocket for organization. It's comfy to wear, and he's received plenty of compliments on it.

Vera Bradley Original Tote Bag for $50: I bought this nylon tote a couple of months ago after being forced to retire the Longchamp bag I've had since high school because I noticed a hole in it. It's roomy, easy to clean, and perfect for my 14-inch MacBook Pro—while still leaving plenty of room for my makeup bag, headphones, water bottle, and more. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a zipper or button enclosure, so you'll have to be slightly conscious of anything falling out from the top.

Fjallraven Kånken Totepack for $59: This tote backpack combination can be worn on your back or your shoulder. It also has a pocket for a 13-inch MacBook, a smaller pocket for a notebook or tablet, and a large main compartment. You'll also have two side pockets for water bottles or a small umbrella.

We're constantly testing a ton of accessories. Unfortunately, they're not all worth buying. Below, we've listed the ones we suggest avoiding altogether.

Twelve South BookArc Flex

Twelve South BookArc Flex for $40: Twelve South's BookArc Flex (3/10, WIRED Review) is a beautiful vertical laptop stand. Unfortunately, it fails at its one job: holding the laptop in place. It's too fragile. The slightest movement around the stand causes it to topple, forcing you to be super careful. It's not worth it.

Casetify Magnetic Privacy MacBook Screen Protector for $60: It pains me to put this screen protector under “Do Not Recommend” because it does its job very well. When I used it at an event last year, multiple people commented on how well it blocked what was on my MacBook Air's screen from multiple angles. It's also magnetic, which means you don't have to worry about applying it crookedly by accident. But regardless of how many times I reinstalled it, I couldn't fully shut my laptop with it on—there was always a slight gap between the lid and the bottom half of the computer. I ended up having to remove it whenever I wanted to shut my laptop and reapply it when I needed it again.

Could future AIs be “conscious,” and experience the world similarly to the way humans do? There's no strong evidence that they will, but Anthropic isn't ruling out the possibility. 

On Thursday, the AI lab announced that it has started a research program to investigate — and prepare to navigate — what it's calling “model welfare.” As part of the effort, Anthropic says it'll explore things like how to determine whether the “welfare” of an AI model deserves moral consideration, the potential importance of model “signs of distress,” and possible “low-cost” interventions.

There's major disagreement within the AI community on what human characteristics models “exhibit,” if any, and how we should “treat” them.

Many academics believe that AI today can't approximate consciousness or the human experience, and won't necessarily be able to in the future. AI as we know it is a statistical prediction engine. It doesn't really “think” or “feel” as those concepts have traditionally been understood. Trained on countless examples of text, images, and so on, AI learns patterns and sometimes useful ways to extrapolate to solve tasks.

As Mike Cook, a research fellow at King's College London specializing in AI, recently told TechCrunch in an interview, a model can't “oppose” a change in its “values” because models don't have values. To suggest otherwise is us projecting onto the system. 

“Anyone anthropomorphizing AI systems to this degree is either playing for attention or seriously misunderstanding their relationship with AI,” Cook said. “Is an AI system optimizing for its goals, or is it ‘acquiring its own values'? It's a matter of how you describe it, and how flowery the language you want to use regarding it is.”

Another researcher, Stephen Casper, a doctoral student at MIT, told TechCrunch that he thinks AI amounts to an “imitator” that “[does] all sorts of confabulation[s]” and says “all sorts of frivolous things.”

Yet other scientists insist that AI does have values and other human-like components of moral decision-making. A study out of the Center for AI Safety, an AI research organization, implies that AI has value systems that lead it to prioritize its own well-being over humans in certain scenarios.

Anthropic has been laying the groundwork for its model welfare initiative for some time. Last year, the company hired its first dedicated “AI welfare” researcher, Kyle Fish, to develop guidelines for how Anthropic and other companies should approach the issue. (Fish, who's leading the new model welfare research program, told The New York Times that he thinks there's a 15% chance Claude or another AI is conscious today.)

In the blog post Thursday, Anthropic acknowledged that there's no scientific consensus on whether current or future AI systems could be conscious or have experiences that warrant ethical consideration.

“In light of this, we're approaching the topic with humility and with as few assumptions as possible,” the company said. “We recognize that we'll need to regularly revise our ideas as the field develops.

Spotify announced on Thursday that it expanded the availability of its AI Playlist feature to more than 40 additional markets, including countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. 

The AI-powered tool, currently in beta on Android and iOS devices, lets listeners create personalized playlists based on written prompts, such as “workout music to make my ex jealous.” Spotify's AI then curates a selection of songs to match that angsty mood. Prompts can include a wide range of things, like various genres, decades, animals, colors, emojis, and movie characters.

In April 2024, Spotify launched the feature initially for Premium users in the U.K. and Australia. It was then rolled out to the U.S., Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand around five months later. 

With this expansion, the total number of markets offering the tool reaches nearly 50. Some of the newly included countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Fiji, Ghana, Jamaica, Kenya, Liberia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, among others.

Adobe on Thursday launched the latest iteration of its Firefly family of image generation AI models, a model for generating vectors, and a redesigned web app that houses all its AI models, plus some from its competitors. There's also a mobile app for Firefly in the works.

The new Firefly Image Model 4, Adobe says, improves on its predecessors in terms of quality, speed, and the amount of control over the structure and style of outputs, camera angles, and zoom. It can generate images in resolutions up to 2K. There's also a tweaked, more capable version of this model called Image Model 4 Ultra that can render complex scenes consisting of small structures and lots of detail.

Alexandru Costin, VP of Generative AI at Adobe, said that the company trained the models with a higher order of compute magnitude to enable them to generate more detailed images. He added that, as compared to previous generation models, the new models improve text generation in images and have features that let users use images of their choice to get the model to generate pictures in that style.

The company is also making its Firefly video model, which launched in limited beta last year, available to everyone. It lets users generate video clips from a text prompt or image, use camera angles, specify start and end frames to control shots, generate atmospheric elements, and customize motion design elements. The model can generate video clips from text at resolutions up to 1080p. 

Meanwhile, the Firefly Vector Model can create editable vector-based artwork, iterate and generate variations of logos, product packaging, icons, scenes, and patterns.

Notably, Firefly's web app gives you access to all these models as well as a few image and video generation models from OpenAI (GPT image generation), Google (Imagen 3 and Veo 2), and Flux (Flux 1.1 Pro). Users can switch between any of these models at any point, and images generated from any model will have content credentials attached to them. The company hinted that other AI models may be added to the web app in the future.

Adobe is also publicly testing a new product called Firefly Boards, a canvas for ideation or moodboarding. It lets users generate or import images, remix them, and collaborate with others — similar to what you can do with other AI-based ideaboards from Visual Electric, Cove, or Kosmik. Boards is available through the Firefly web app.

The company said these new models would soon be integrated into its product portfolio, but didn't give a timeline for the rollout.

Adobe is also making its Text-to-Image API and Avatar API generally available, and said a new Text-to-Video API is now available for use in beta. These APIs are available through the company's Firefly Services collection of APIs, tools, and services.

Adobe is also testing a web app called Adobe Content Authenticity to let users attach credentials to their work to indicate ownership and attribution through metadata. Users can also indicate whether AI companies can use any images for AI model training.

Companies like Google and Microsoft have equipped their productivity suites with AI features and assistants, while startups such as ClickUp and ReadAI have focused heavily on building AI integrations and search capabilities. In alignment with this growing trend of infusing digital work suites with AI, Dropbox on Thursday upgraded its AI search tool, Dash, first introduced in 2023.

The company is adding AI “understanding” of different types of content in Dash, which means users can search across audio, video, and images in addition to text. The company is also adding people search to let users search for a person who worked on a specific project or look for a subject-matter expert.

Last year, Dropbox unveiled Dash for Business to let enterprises use AI search. This year, it's improving Dash's enterprise tooling by adding support for IT admins to exclude some sensitive documents from the search results.

Dropbox already has functions for summarizing documents using its AI. With this new release, the company is introducing new writing tools that leverage summaries from different data sources to create new documents and presentations. The company said these tools, which live in Dash, can collate information from email, meeting notes, and existing documents to create project plans, memos, or briefs. The core idea is that users won't have to jump from one app to another to read some info and add it to a document.

What's more, Dropbox is adding new integrations to Dash, including integrations for communication tools like Slack, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams, along with project management and creative tools like Figma, Canva, and Jira. This will help users search for information across their projects on different platforms, according to Dropbox.

As AI vendors release new AI models, companies working in the productivity and workforce sectors are realizing that it's getting easier to have AI look through a lot of information, summarize it, and also generate new content based on that. The challenge for these companies is building features quickly enough while integrating with other platforms to keep their customers happy.

Mobile marketing analytics and infrastructure

We're looking for a Senior Backend Engineer experienced with building backends for web applications. Our ideal candidate has worked with Ruby frameworks such as Rails and Sinatra, developed applications with both relational and non-relational databases, is comfortable managing infrastructure with Kubernetes, and enjoys working in a remote but collaborative environment.

Mobile attribution is the core of our business - we rigorously maintain an expansive set of business logic that integrates with third parties and helps mobile developers determine where their users are coming from. Much of our business logic is in Ruby today. We're in the process of gradually migrating that logic over to Go.

This is a senior-level role but we would also consider mid-level candidates who are an exceptionally good fit.

We're a small engineering team looking to grow responsibly. We're a remote-only organization with most of the engineering team working from US timezones. We aim to help mobile app developers make data-driven decisions about their marketing in a secure, privacy-centric, user-friendly way. We encourage flexibility in working locations and hours but also make sure we all overlap at least briefly for a bit each day.

Tenjin manages mobile growth infrastructure for our clients by organizing, analyzing, and securing the rush of data generated by mobile devices and marketing channels. We're reshaping mobile marketing by breaking down data silos and building an integrated data platform to replace the detached services in use today.

The team at Tenjin is small but growing. We feel passionately about doing work that matters. Working here will provide you with opportunities for growth and leadership at the intersection of big data and mobile marketing. If you're looking to work in an environment with smart, talented coworkers who value good people and good ideas, we'd like to talk to you. Self-directed team players will enjoy the balance of flexibility and collaboration that guides our culture.

I don't really see the scandal though. I pretty much _only_ use AI for tasks that I could do myself.

The tech behemoth is betting that planting millions of eucalyptus trees in Brazil will be the path to a greener future. Some ecologists and local residents are far less sure.

We were losing the light, and still about 20 kilometers from the main road, when the car shuddered and died at the edge of a strange forest. 

The grove grew as if indifferent to certain unspoken rules of botany. There was no understory, no foreground or background, only the trees themselves, which grew as a wall of bare trunks that rose 100 feet or so before concluding with a burst of thick foliage near the top. The rows of trees ran perhaps the length of a New York City block and fell away abruptly on either side into untidy fields of dirt and grass. The vista recalled the husk of a failed condo development, its first apartments marooned when the builders ran out of cash.

Standing there against the setting sun, the trees were, in their odd way, also rather stunning. I had no service out here—we had just left a remote nature preserve in southwestern Brazil—but I reached for my phone anyway, for a picture. The concern on the face of my travel partner, Clariana Vilela Borzone, a geographer and translator who grew up nearby, flicked to amusement. My camera roll was already full of eucalyptus.

The trees sprouted from every hillside, along every road, and more always seemed to be coming. Across the dirt path where we were stopped, another pasture had been cleared for planting. The sparse bushes and trees that had once shaded cattle in the fields had been toppled and piled up, as if in a Pleistocene gravesite. 

Borzone's friends and neighbors were divided on the aesthetics of these groves. Some liked the order and eternal verdancy they brought to their slice of the Cerrado, a large botanical region that arcs diagonally across Brazil's midsection. Its native savanna landscape was largely gnarled, low-slung, and, for much of the year, rather brown. And since most of that flora had been cleared decades ago for cattle pasture, it was browner and flatter still. Now that land was becoming trees. It was becoming beautiful. 

Others considered this beauty a mirage. “Green deserts,” they called the groves, suggesting bounty from afar but holding only dirt and silence within. These were not actually forests teeming with animals and undergrowth, they charged, but at best tinder for a future megafire in a land parched, in part, by their vigorous growth. This was in fact a common complaint across Latin America: in Chile, the planted rows of eucalyptus were called the “green soldiers.” It was easy to imagine getting lost in the timber, a funhouse mirror of trunks as far as the eye could see.

The timber companies that planted these trees push back on these criticisms as caricatures of a genus that's demonized all over the world. They point to their sustainable forestry certifications and their handsome spending on fire suppression, and to the microphones they've placed that record cacophonies of birds and prove the groves are anything but barren. Whether people like the look of these trees or not, they are meeting a human need, filling an insatiable demand for paper and pulp products all over the world. Much of the material for the world's toilet and tissue paper is grown in Brazil, and that, they argue, is a good thing: Grow fast and furious here, as responsibly as possible, to save many more trees elsewhere. 

But I was in this region for a different reason: Apple. And also Microsoft and Meta and TSMC, and many smaller technology firms too. I was here because tech executives many thousands of miles away were racing toward, and in some cases stumbling, on their way to meet their climate promises—too little time, and too much demand for new devices and AI data centers. Not far from here, they had struck some of the largest-ever deals for carbon credits. They were asking something new of this tree: Could Latin America's eucalyptus be a scalable climate solution? 

New research shows that California's climate policy created up to 39 million carbon credits that aren't achieving real carbon savings. But companies can buy these forest offsets to justify polluting more anyway.

On a practical level, the answer seemed straightforward. Nobody disputed how swiftly or reliably eucalyptus could grow in the tropics. This knowledge was the product of decades of scientific study and tabulations of biomass for wood or paper. Each tree was roughly 47% carbon, which meant that many tons of it could be stored within every planted hectare. This could be observed taking place in real time, in the trees by the road. Come back and look at these young trees tomorrow, and you'd see it: fresh millimeters of carbon, chains of cellulose set into lignin. 

At the same time, Apple and the others were also investing in an industry, and a tree, with a long and controversial history in this part of Brazil and elsewhere. They were exerting their wealth and technological oversight to try to make timber operations more sustainable, more supportive of native flora, and less water intensive. Still, that was a hard sell to some here, where hundreds of thousands of hectares of pasture are already in line for planting; more trees were a bleak prospect in a land increasingly racked by drought and fire. Critics called the entire exercise an excuse to plant even more trees for profit. 

Borzone and I did not plan to stay and watch the eucalyptus grow. Garden or forest or desert, ally or antagonist—it did not matter much with the stars of the Southern Cross emerging and our gas tank empty. We gathered our things from our car and set off down the dirt road through the trees.

My journey into the Cerrado had begun months earlier, in the fall of 2023, when the actress Octavia Spencer appeared as Mother Nature in an ad alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook. In 2020, the company had set a goal to go “net zero” by the end of the decade, at which point all of its products—laptops, CPUs, phones, earbuds—would be produced without increasing the level of carbon in the atmosphere. “Who wants to disappoint me first?” Mother Nature asked with a sly smile. It was a third of the way to 2030—a date embraced by many corporations aiming to stay in line with the UN's goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels—and where was the progress?

Cook was glad to inform her of the good news: The new Apple Watch was leading the way. A limited supply of the devices were already carbon neutral, thanks to things like recycled materials and parts that were specially sent by ship—not flown—from one factory to another. These special watches were labeled with a green leaf on Apple's iconically soft, white boxes.

Critics were quick to point out that declaring an individual product “carbon neutral” while the company was still polluting had the whiff of an early victory lap, achieved with some convenient accounting. But the work on the watch spoke to the company's grand ambitions. Apple claimed that changes like procuring renewable power and using recycled materials had enabled it to cut emissions 75% since 2015. “We're always prioritizing reductions; they've got to come first,” Chris Busch, Apple's director of environmental initiatives, told me soon after the launch. 

The company also acknowledged that it could not find reductions to balance all its emissions. But it was trying something new. 

Since the 1990s, companies have purchased carbon credits based largely on avoiding emissions. Take some patch of forest that was destined for destruction and protect it; the stored carbon that wasn't lost is turned into credits. But as the carbon market expanded, so did suspicion of carbon math—in some cases, because of fraud or bad science, but also because efforts to contain deforestation are often frustrated, with destruction avoided in one place simply happening someplace else. Corporations that once counted on carbon credits for “avoided” emissions can no longer trust them. (Many consumers feel they can't either, with some even suing Apple over the ways it used past carbon projects to make its claims about the Apple Watch.)

But that demand to cancel out carbon dioxide hasn't gone anywhere—if anything, as AI-driven emissions knock some companies off track from reaching their carbon targets (and raise questions about the techniques used to claim emissions reductions), the need is growing. For Apple, even under the rosiest assumptions about how much it will continue to pollute, the gap is significant: In 2024, the company reported offsetting 700,000 metric tons of CO2, but the number it will need to hit in 2030 to meet its goals is 9.6 million. 

So the new move is to invest in carbon “removal” rather than avoidance. The idea implies a more solid achievement: taking carbon molecules out of the atmosphere. There are many ways to attempt that, from trying to change the pH of the oceans so that they absorb more of the molecules to building machines that suck carbon straight out of the air. But these are long-term fixes. None of these technologies work at the scale and price that would help Apple and others meet their shorter-term targets. For that, trees have emerged again as the answer. This time the idea is to plant new ones instead of protecting old ones. 

To expand those efforts in a way that would make a meaningful dent in emissions, Apple determined, it would also need to make carbon removal profitable. A big part of this effort would be driven by the Restore Fund, a $200 million partnership with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, a US environmental nonprofit, to invest in “high quality” projects that promoted reforestation on degraded lands.  

Profits would come from responsibly turning trees into products, Goldman's head of sustainability explained when the fund was announced in 2021. But it was also an opportunity for Apple, and future investors, to “almost look at, touch, and feel their carbon,” he said—a concreteness that carbon credits had previously failed to offer. “The aim is to generate real, measurable carbon benefits, but to do that alongside financial returns,” Busch told me. It was intended as a flywheel of sorts: more investors, more planting, more carbon—an approach to climate action that looked to abundance rather than sacrifice.

Apple markets its watch as a carbon-neutral product, a claim based in part on the use of carbon credits.

The announcement of the carbon-neutral Apple Watch was the occasion to promote the Restore Fund's three initial investments, which included a native forestry project as well as eucalyptus farms in Paraguay and Brazil. The Brazilian timber plans were by far the largest in scale, and were managed by BTG Pactual, Latin America's largest investment bank. 

Busch connected me with Mark Wishnie, head of sustainability for Timberland Investment Group, BTG's US-based subsidiary, which acquires and manages properties on behalf of institutional investors. After years in the eucalyptus business, Wishnie, who lives in Seattle, was used to strong feelings about the tree. It's just that kind of plant—heralded as useful, even ornamental; demonized as a fire starter, water-intensive, a weed. “Has the idea that eucalyptus is invasive come up?” he asked pointedly. (It's an “exotic” species in Brazil, yes, but the risk of invasiveness is low for the varieties most commonly planted for forestry.) He invited detractors to consider the alternative to the scale and efficiency of eucalyptus, which, he pointed out, relieves the pressure that humans put on beloved old-growth forests elsewhere. 

Using eucalyptus for carbon removal also offered a new opportunity. Wishnie was overseeing a planned $1 billion initiative that was set to transform BTG's timber portfolio; it aimed at a 50-50 split between timber and native restoration on old pastureland, with an emphasis on connecting habitats along rivers and streams. As a “high quality” project, it was meant to do better than business as usual. The conservation areas would exceed the legal requirements for native preservation in Brazil, which range from 20% to 35% in the Cerrado. In a part of Brazil that historically gets little conservation attention, it would potentially represent the largest effort yet to actually bring back the native landscape. 

When BTG approached Conservation International with the 50% figure, the organization thought it was “too good to be true,” Miguel Calmon, the senior director of the nonprofit's Brazilian programs, told me. With the restoration work paid for by the green financing and the sale of carbon credits, scale and longevity could be achieved. “Some folks may do this, but they never do this as part of the business,” he said. “It comes from not a corporate responsibility. It's about, really, the business that you can optimize.”

So far, BTG has raised $630 million for the initiative and earmarked 270,000 hectares, an area more than double the city of Los Angeles. The first farm in the plan, located on a 24,000-hectare cattle ranch, was called Project Alpha. The location, Wishnie said, was confidential. 

But a property of that size sticks out, even in a land of large farms. It didn't take very much digging into municipal land records in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where many of the company's Cerrado holdings are located, to turn up a recently sold farm that matched the size. It was called Fazenda Engano, or “Deception Farm”—hence the rebrand. The land was registered to an LLC with links to holding companies for other BTG eucalyptus plantations located in a neighboring region that locals had taken to calling the Cellulose Valley for its fast-expanding tree farms and pulp factories.  

The area was largely seen as a land of opportunity, even as some locals had raised the alarm over concerns that the land couldn't handle the trees. They had allies in prominent ecologists who have long questioned the wisdom of tree-planting in the Cerrado—and increasingly spar with other conservationists who see great potential in turning pasture into forest. The fight has only gotten more heated as more investors hunt for new climate solutions. 

Still, where Apple goes, others often follow. And when it comes to sustainability, other companies look to it as a leader. I wasn't sure if I could visit Project Alpha and see whether Apple and its partners had really found a better way to plant, but I started making plans to go to the Cerrado anyway, to see the forests behind those little green leaves on the box. 

In 2015, a study by Thomas Crowther, an ecologist then at ETH Zürich, attempted a census of global tree cover, finding more than 3 trillion trees in all. A useful number, surprisingly hard to divine, like counting insects or bacteria. 

A follow-up study a few years later proved more controversial: Earth's surface held space for at least 1 trillion more trees. That represented a chance to store 200 metric gigatons, or about 25%, of atmospheric carbon once they matured. (The paper was later corrected in multiple ways, including an acknowledgment that the carbon storage potential could be about one-third less.)

The study became a media sensation, soon followed by a fleet of tree-planting initiatives with “trillion” in the name—most prominently through a World Economic Forum effort launched by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at Davos, which President Donald Trump pledged to support during his first term. 

But for as long as tree planting has been heralded as a good deed—from Johnny Appleseed to programs that promise a tree for every shoe or laptop purchased—the act has also been chased closely by a follow-up question: How many of those trees survive? Consider Trump's most notable planting, which placed an oak on the White House grounds in 2018. It died just over a year later. 

To critics, including Bill Gates, the efforts were symbolic of short-term thinking at the expense of deeper efforts to cut or remove carbon. (Gates's spat with Benioff descended to name-calling in the New York Times. “Are we the science people or are we the idiots?” he asked.) The lifespan of a tree, after all, is brief—a pit stop—compared with the thousand-year carbon cycle, so its progeny must carry the torch to meaningfully cancel out emissions. Most don't last that long. 

“The number of trees planted has become a kind of currency, but it's meaningless,” Pedro Brancalion, a professor of tropical forestry at the University of São Paulo, told me. He had nothing against the trees, which the world could, in general, use a lot more of. But to him, a lot of efforts were riding more on “good vibes” than on careful strategy. 

Soon after arriving in São Paulo last summer, I drove some 150 miles into the hills outside the city to see the outdoor lab Brancalion has filled with experiments on how to plant trees better: trees given too many nutrients or too little; saplings monitored with wires and tubes like ICU admits, or skirted with tarps that snatch away rainwater. At the center of one of Brancalion's plots stands a tower topped with a whirling station, the size of a hobby drone, monitoring carbon going in and out of the air (and, therefore, the nearby vegetation)—a molecular tango known as flux. 

Brancalion works part-time for a carbon-focused restoration company, Re:Green, which had recently sold 3 million carbon credits to Microsoft and was raising a mix of native trees in parts of the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest. While most of the trees in his lab were native ones too, like jacaranda and brazilwood, he also studies eucalyptus. The lab in fact sat on a former eucalyptus farm; in the heart of his fields, a grove of 80-year-old trees dripped bark like molting reptiles. 

Eucalyptus planting swelled dramatically under Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1960s. The goal was self-sufficiency—a nation's worth of timber and charcoal, quickly—and the expansion was fraught. Many opinions of the tree were forged in a spate of dubious land seizures followed by clearing of the existing vegetation—disputes that, in some places, linger to this day. Still, that campaign is also said to have done just as Wishnie described, easing the demand that would have been put on regions like the Amazon as Rio and São Paulo were built. 

The new trees also laid the foundation for Brazil to become a global hub for engineered forestry; it's currently home to about a third of the world's farmed eucalyptus. Today's saplings are the products of decades of tinkering with clonal breeding, growing quick and straight, resistant to pestilence and drought, with exacting growth curves that chart biomass over time: Seven years to maturity is standard for pulp. Trees planted today grow more than three times as fast as their ancestors. 

If the goal is a trillion trees, or many millions of tons of carbon, no business is better suited to keeping count than timber. It might sound strange to claim carbon credits for trees that you plan to chop down and turn into toilet paper or chairs. Whatever carbon is stored in those ephemeral products is, of course, a blip compared with the millennia that CO2 hangs in the atmosphere. 

But these carbon projects take a longer view. While individual trees may go, more trees are planted. The forest constantly regrows and recaptures carbon from the air. Credits are issued annually over decades, so long as the long-term average of the carbon stored in the grove continues to increase. What's more, because the timber is constantly being tracked, the carbon is easy to measure, solving a key problem with carbon credits. 

Most mature native ecosystems, whether tropical forests or grasslands, will eventually store more carbon than a tree farm. But that could take decades. Eucalyptus can be planted immediately, with great speed, and the first carbon credits are issued in just a few years. “It fits a corporate model very well, and it fits the verification model very well,” said Robin Chazdon, a forest researcher at Australia's University of the Sunshine Coast.

Reliability and stability have also made eucalyptus, as well as pine, quietly dominant in global planting efforts. A 2019 analysis published in Nature found that 45% of carbon removal projects the researchers studied worldwide involved single-species tree farms. In Brazil, the figure was 82%. The authors called this a “scandal,” accusing environmental organizations and financiers of misleading the public and pursuing speed and convenience at the expense of native restoration.  

In 2023, the nonprofit Verra, the largest bearer of carbon credit standards, said it would forbid projects using “non-native monocultures”—that is, plants like eucalyptus or pine that don't naturally grow in the places where they're being farmed. The idea was to assuage concerns that carbon credits were going to plantations that would have been built anyway given the demand for wood, meaning they wouldn't actually remove any extra carbon from the atmosphere.

The uproar was immediate—from timber companies, but also from carbon developers and NGOs. How would it be possible to scale anything—conservation, carbon removal—without them?

Verra reversed course several months later. It would allow non-native monocultures so long as they grew in land that was deemed “degraded,” or previously cleared of vegetation—land like cattle pasture. And it took steps to avoid counting plantings in close proximity to other areas of fast tree growth, the idea being that they wanted to avoid rewarding purely industrial projects that would've been planted anyway. 

Brancalion happened to agree with the criticisms of exotic monocultures. But all the same, he believed eucalyptus had been unfairly demonized. It was a marvelous genus, actually, with nearly 800 species with unique adaptations. Natives could be planted as monocultures too, or on stolen land, or tended with little care. He had been testing ways to turn eucalyptus from perceived foes into friends of native forest restoration.

His idea was to use rows of eucalyptus, which rocket above native species, as a kind of stabilizer. While these natives can be valuable—either as lumber or for biodiversity—they may grow slowly, or twist in ways that make their wood unprofitable, or suddenly and inexplicably die. It's never like that with eucalyptus, which are wonderfully predictable growers. Eventually, their harvested wood would help pay for the hard work of growing the others. 

In practice, foresters have generally preferred to keep things separate. Eucalyptus here; restoration there. It was far more efficient. The approach was emblematic, Brancalion thought, of letting the economics of the industry guide what was planted, how, and where, even with green finance involved. Though he admitted he was speaking as something of a competitor given his own carbon work, he was perplexed by Apple's choices. The world's richest company was doing eucalyptus? And with a bank better known locally as a major investor in industries, like beef and soy, that contributed to deforestation than any efforts for native restoration.

It also worried him to see the planting happening west of here, in the Cerrado, where land is cheaper and also, for much of the year, drier. “It's like a bomb,” Brancalion told me. “You can come interview me in five, six years. You don't have to be super smart to realize what will happen after planting too many eucalyptus in a dry region.” He wished me luck on my journey westward.   

Savanna implies openness, but the European settlers passing through the Cerrado called it the opposite; the name literally means “closed.” Grasses and shrubs grow to chest height, scaled as if to maximize human inconvenience. A machete is advised. 

As I headed with Borzone toward a small nature preserve called Parque do Pombo, she told me that young Brazilians are often raised with a sense of dislike, if not fear, of this land. When Borzone texted her mother, a local biologist, to say where we were going, she replied: “I hear that place is full of ticks.” (Her intel, it turned out, was correct.)

What can be easy to miss is the fantastic variety of these plants, the result of natural selection cranked into overdrive. Species, many of which blew in from the Amazon, survived by growing deep roots through the acidic soil and thicker bark to resist regular brush fires. Many of the trees developed the ability to shrivel upon themselves and drop their leaves during the long, dry winter. Some call it a forest that has grown upside down, because much of the growth occurs in the roots. The Cerrado is home to 12,000 flowering plant species, 4,000 of which are found only there. In terms of biodiversity, it is second in the world only to its more famous neighbor, the Amazon. 

Each stop on our drive seemed to yield a new treasure for Borzone to show me: Guavira, a tree that bears fruit in grape-like bunches that appear only two weeks in a year; it can be made into a jam that is exceptionally good on toast. Pequi, more divisive, like fermented mango mixed with cheese. Others bear names Borzone can only faintly recall in the Indigenous Guaraní language and is thus unable to google. Certain uses are more memorable: Give this one here, a tiny frond that looks like a miniature Christmas fir, to make someone get pregnant.

Borzone had grown up in the heart of the savanna, and the land had changed significantly since she was a kid going to the river every weekend with her family. Since the 1970s, about half of the savanna has been cleared, mostly for ranching and, where the soil is good, soybeans. At that time, even prominent ecologists, fearing total destruction of the Amazon, advocated moving industry here, invoking what Brazilians call the boi de piranha—a myth about casting a cow into infested waters so that the other cows could ford downstream. 

Toby Pennington, a Cerrado ecologist at the University of Exeter, told me it remains a sacrificial zone, at times faring worse when environmentally minded politicians are in power. In 2023, when deforestation fell by half in the Amazon, it rose by 43% in the Cerrado. Some ecologists warn that this ecosystem could be entirely gone in the next decade.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, there's a certain prickliness among grassland researchers, who are, like their chosen flora, used to being trampled. In 2019, 46 of them authored a response in Science to Crowther's trillion-trees study, arguing not about tree counting but about the land he proposed for reforestation. Much of it, they argued, including places like the Cerrado, was not appropriate for so many trees. It was too much biomass for the land to handle. (If their point was not already clear, the scientists later labeled the phenomenon “biome awareness disparity,” or BAD.)

“It's a controversial ecosystem,” said Natashi Pilon, a grassland ecologist at the University of Campinas near São Paulo. “With Cerrado, you have to forget everything that you learn about ecology, because it's all based in forest ecology. In the Cerrado, everything works the opposite way. Burning? It's good. Shade? It's not good.” The Cerrado contains a vast range of landscapes, from grassy fields to wooded forests, but the majority of it, she explained, is poorly suited to certain rules of carbon finance that would incentivize people to protect or restore it. While the underground forest stores plenty of carbon, it builds up its stock slowly and can be difficult to measure. 

The result is a slightly uncomfortable position for ecologists studying and trying to protect a vanishing landscape. Pilon and her former academic advisor, Giselda Durigan, a Cerrado ecologist at the Environmental Research Institute of the State of São Paulo and one of the scientists behind BAD, have gotten accustomed to pushing back on people who arrived preaching “improvement” through trees—first from nonprofits, mostly of the trillion-trees variety, but now from the timber industry. “They are using the carbon discourse as one more argument to say that business is great,” Durigan told me. “They are happy to be seen as the good guys.” 

Durigan saw tragedy in the way that Cerrado had been transformed into cattle pasture in just a generation, but there was also opportunity in restoring it once the cattle left. Bringing the Cerrado back would be hard work—usually requiring fire and hacking away at invasive grasses. But even simply leaving it alone could allow the ecosystem to begin to repair itself and offer something like the old savanna habitat. Abandoned eucalyptus farms, by contrast, were nightmares to return to native vegetation; the strange Cerrado plants refused to take root in the highly modified soil. 

In recent years, Durigan had visited hundreds of eucalyptus farms in the area, shadowing her students who had been hired by timber companies to help establish promised corridors of native vegetation in accordance with federal rules. “They're planting entire watersheds,” she said. “The rivers are dying.” 

Durigan saw plants in isolated patches growing taller than they normally would, largely thanks to the suppression of regular brush fires. They were throwing shade on the herbs and grasses and drawing more water. The result was an environment gradually choking on itself, at risk of collapse during drought and retaining only a fraction of the Cerrado's original diversity. If this was what people meant by bringing back the Cerrado, she believed it was only hastening its ultimate disappearance. 

In a recent survey of the watershed around the Parque do Pombo, which is hemmed in on each side by eucalyptus, two other researchers reported finding “devastation” and turned to Plato's description of Attica's forests, cleared to build the city of Athens: “What remains now compared to what existed is like the skeleton of a sick man … All the rich and soft soil has dissolved, leaving the country of skin and bones.” 

After a long day of touring the land—and spinning out on the clay—we found that our fuel was low. The Parque do Pombo groundskeeper looked over at his rusting fuel tank and apologized. It had been spoiled by the last rain. At least, he said, it was all downhill to the highway. 

We only made it about halfway down the eucalyptus-lined road. After the car huffed and left us stranded, Borzone and I started walking toward the highway, anticipating a long night. We remembered locals' talk of jaguars recently pushed into the area by development. 

But after only 30 minutes or so, a set of lights came into view across the plain. Then another, and another. Then the outline of a tractor, a small tanker truck, and, somewhat curiously, a tour bus. The gear and the vehicles bore the logo of Suzano, the world's largest pulp and paper company.

After talking to a worker, we boarded the empty tour bus and were taken to a cluster of spotlit tents, where women prepared eucalyptus seedlings, stacking crates of them on white fold-out tables. A night shift like this one was unusual. But they were working around the clock—aiming to plant a million trees per day across Suzano's farms, in preparation for opening the world's largest pulp factory just down the highway. It would open in a few weeks with a capacity of 2.55 million metric tons of pulp per year. 

The tour bus was standing by to take the workers down the highway at 1 a.m., arriving in the nearest city, Três Lagoas, by 3 a.m. to pick up the next shift. “You don't do this work without a few birds at home to feed,” a driver remarked as he watched his colleagues filling holes in the field by the light of their headlamps. After getting permission from his boss, he drove us an hour each way to town to the nearest gas station.

This highway through the Cellulose Valley has become known as a road of opportunity, with eucalyptus as the region's new lifeblood after the cattle industry shrank its footprint. Not far from the new Suzano factory, a popular roadside attraction is an oversize sculpture of a black bull at the gates of a well-known ranch. The ranch was recently planted, and the bull is now guarded by a phalanx of eucalyptus. 

On TikTok, workers post selfies and views from tractors in the nearby groves, backed by a song from the local country music duo Jads e Jadson. “I'm going to plant some eucalyptus / I'll get rich and you'll fall in love with me,” sings a down-on-his-luck man at risk of losing his fiancée. Later, when he cuts down the trees and becomes a wealthy man with better options, he cuts off his betrothed, too. 

The race to plant more eucalyptus here is backed heavily by the state government, which last year waived environmental requirements for new farms on pasture and hopes to quickly double its area in just a few years. The trees were an important component of Brazil's plan to meet its global climate commitments, and the timber industry was keen to cash in. Companies like Suzano have already proposed that tens of thousands of their hectares become eligible for carbon credits. 

What's top of mind for everyone, though, is worsening fires. Even when we visited in midwinter, the weather was hot and dry. The wider region was in a deep drought, perhaps the worst in 700 years, and in a few weeks, one of the worst fire seasons ever would begin. Suzano would be forced to make a rare pause in its planting when soil temperatures reached 154 °F. 

Posted along the highway are constant reminders of the coming danger: signs, emblazoned with the logos of a dozen timber companies, that read “FOGO ZERO,” or “ZERO FIRE.” 

In other places struck by megafires, like Portugal and Chile, eucalyptus has been blamed for worsening the flames. (The Chilean government has recently excluded pine and eucalyptus farms from its climate plans.) But here in Brazil, where climate change is already supersizing the blazes, the industry offers sophisticated systems to detect and suppress fires, argued Calmon of Conservation International. “You really need to protect it because that's your asset,” he said. (BTG also noted that in parts of the Cerrado where human activity has increased, fires have decreased.) 

Eucalyptus is often portrayed as impossibly thirsty compared with other trees, but Calmon pointed out it is not uniquely so. In some parts of the Cerrado, it has been found to consume four times as much water as native vegetation; in others, the two landscapes have been roughly in line. It depends on many factors—what type of soil it's planted in, what Cerrado vegetation coexists with it, how intensely the eucalyptus is farmed. Timber companies, which have no interest in seeing their own plantations run dry, invest heavily in managing water. Another hope, Wishnie told me, is that by vastly increasing the forest canopy, the new eucalyptus will actually gather moisture and help produce rain. 

That's a common narrative and one that's been taught in schools here in Três Lagoas for decades, Borzone explained when we met up the day after our rescue with Marine Dubos-Raoul, a local geographer and university professor, and two of her students. Dubos-Raoul laughed uneasily. If this idea about rain was in fact true, they hadn't seen it here. They crouched around the table at the cafe, speaking in a hush; their opinions weren't particularly popular in this lumber town.

Dubos-Raoul had long tracked the impacts of the waves of planting on longtime rural residents, who complained that industry had taken their water or sprayed their gardens with pesticides. 

The evidence tying the trees to water problems in the region, Dubos-Raoul admitted, is more anecdotal than data driven. But she heard it in conversation after conversation. “People would have tears in their eyes,” she said. “It was very clear to them that it was connected to the arrival of the eucalyptus.” (Since our meeting, a study, carried out in response to demands from local residents, has blamed the planting for 350 depleted springs in the area, sparking a rare state inquiry into the issue.) In any case, Dubos-Raoul thought, it didn't make much sense to keep adding matches to the tinderbox.

Shortly after talking with Dubos-Raoul, we ventured to the town of Ribas do Rio Pardo to meet Charlin Castro at his family's river resort. Suzano's new pulp factory stood on the horizon, surrounded by one of the densest areas of planting in the region. 



With thousands of workers arriving, mostly temporarily, to build the factory and plant the fields, the sleepy farming village had turned into a boomtown, and developed something of a lawless reputation—prostitution, homelessness, collisions between logging trucks and drunk drivers—and Castro was chronicling much of it for a hyperlocal Instagram news outlet, while also running for city council. 

But overall, he was thankful to Suzano. The factory was transforming the town into a “a real place,” as he put it, even if change was at times painful. 

His father, Camilo, gestured with a sinewy arm over to the water, where he recalled boat races involving canoes with crews of a dozen. That was 30 years ago. It was impossible to imagine now as I watched a family cool off in this bend in the river, the water just knee deep. But it's hard to say what exactly is causing the low water levels. Perhaps it's silt from the ranches, Charlin suggested. Or a change in the climate. Or, maybe, it could be the trees. 

Upstream, Ana Cláudia (who goes by “Tica”) and Antonio Gilberto Lima were more certain what was to blame. The couple, who are in their mid-60s, live in a simple brick house surrounded by fruit trees. They moved there a decade ago, seeking a calm retirement—one of a hundred or so families taking part in land reforms that returned land to smallholders. But recently, life has been harder. To preserve their well, they had let their vegetable garden go to seed. Streams were dry, and the old pools in the pastures where they used to fish were gone, replaced by trees; tapirs were rummaging through their garden, pushed, they believed, by lack of habitat. 



They were surrounded by eucalyptus, planted in waves with the arrival of each new factory. No one was listening, they told me, as the cattle herd bellowed outside the door. “The trees are sad,” Gilberto said, looking out over his few dozen pale-humped animals grazing around scattered Cerrado species left in the paddock. Tica told me she knew that paper and pulp had to come from somewhere, and that many people locally were benefiting. But the downsides were getting overlooked, she thought. They had signed a petition to the government, organized by Dubos-Raoul, seeking to rein in the industry. Perhaps, she hoped, it could reach American investors, too. 

A few weeks before my trip, BTG had decided it was ready to show off Project Alpha. The visit was set for my last day in Brazil; the farm formerly known as Fazenda Engano was further upriver in Camapuã, a town that borders Ribas do Rio Pardo. It was a long, circuitous drive north to get out there, but it wouldn't be that way much longer; a new highway was being paved that would directly connect the two towns, part of an initiative between the timber industry and government to expand the cellulose hub northward. A local official told me he expected tens of thousands of hectares of eucalyptus in the next few years.

For now, though, it was still the frontier. The intention was to plant “well outside the forest sector,” Wishnie told me—not directly in the shadow of a mill, but close enough for the operation to be practical, with access to labor and logistics. That distance was important evidence that the trees would store more carbon than what's accounted for in a business-as-usual scenario. The other guarantee was the restoration. It wasn't good business to buy land and not plant every acre you could with timber. It was made possible only with green investments from Apple and others.

That morning, Wishnie had emailed me a press release announcing that Microsoft had joined Apple in seeking help from BTG to help meet its carbon demands. The technology giant had made the largest-ever purchase of carbon credits, representing 8 million tons of CO2, from Project Alpha, following smaller commitments from TSMC and Murata, two of Apple's suppliers. 

I was set to meet Carlos Guerreiro, head of Latin American operations for BTG's timber subsidiary, at a gas station in town, where we would set off together for the 24,000-hectare property. A forester in Brazil for much of his life, he had flown in from his home near São Paulo early that morning; he planned to check out the progress of the planting at Project Alpha and then swing down to the bank's properties across the Cellulose Valley, where BTG was finalizing a $376 million deal to sell land to Suzano. 

Guerreiro defended BTG's existing holdings as sustainable engines of development in the region. But all the same, Project Alpha felt like a new beginning for the company, he told me. About a quarter of this property had been left untouched when the pasture was first cleared in the 1980s, but the plan now was to restore an additional 13% of the property to native Cerrado plants, bringing the total to 37%. (BTG says it will protect more land on future farms to arrive at its 50-50 target.) Individual patches of existing native vegetation would be merged with others around the property, creating a 400-meter corridor that largely followed the streams and rivers—beyond the 60 meters required by law. 

The restoration work was happening with the help of researchers from a Brazilian university, though they were still testing the best methods. We stood over trenches that had been planted with native seeds just weeks before, shoots only starting to poke out of the dirt. Letting the land regenerate on its own was often preferable, Guerreiro told me, but the best approach would depend on the specifics of each location. In other places, assistance with planting or tending or clearing back the invasive grasses could be better. 

The approach of largely letting things be was already yielding results, he noted: In parts of the property that hadn't been grazed in years, they could already see the hardscrabble Cerrado clawing back with a vengeance. They'd been marveling at the fauna, caught on camera traps: tapirs, anteaters, all kinds of birds. They had even spotted a jaguar. The project would ensure that this growth would continue for decades. The land wouldn't be sold to another rancher and go back to looking like other parts of the property, which were regularly cleared of native habitat. The hope, he said, was that over time the regenerating ecosystems would store more carbon, and generate more credits, than the eucalyptus. (The company intends to submit its carbon plans to Verra later this year.)

We stopped for lunch at the dividing line between the preserve and the eucalyptus, eating ham sandwiches in the shade of the oldest trees on the property, already two stories tall and still, by Guerreiro's estimate, putting on a centimeter per day. He was planting at a rate of 40,000 seedlings per day in neat trenches filled with white lime to make the sandy Cerrado soil more inviting. In seven years or so, half of the trees will be thinned and pulped. The rest will keep growing. They'll stand for seven years longer and grow thick and firm enough for plywood. The process will then start anew. Guerreiro described a model where clusters of farms mixed with preserves like this one will be planted around mills throughout the Cerrado. But nothing firm had been decided.

This experiment, Wishnie told me later, could have a big payoff. The important thing, he reminded me, was that stretches of the Cerrado would be protected at a scale no one had achieved before—something that wouldn't happen without eucalyptus. He strongly disagreed with the scientists who said eucalyptus didn't fit here. The government had analyzed the watershed, he explained, and he was confident the land could support the trees. At the end of the day, the choice was between doing something and doing nothing. “We talk about restoration as if it's a thing that happens,” he said. 

When I asked Pilon to take a look at satellite imagery and photos of the property, she was unimpressed. It looked to her like yet another misguided attempt at planting trees in an area that had once naturally been a dense savanna. (Her assessment is supported by a land survey from the 1980s that classified this land as a typical Cerrado ecosystem—some trees, but mostly shrubbery. BTG responded that the survey was incorrect and the satellite images clearly showed a closed-canopy forest.) 

As Lucy Rowland, an expert on the region at the University of Exeter and another BAD signatory, put it: “Under no circumstances should planting eucalyptus ever be considered a viable project to receive carbon credits in the Cerrado.” 

Over months of reporting, the way that both sides spoke in absolutes about how to save this vanishing ecosystem had become familiar. Chazdon, the Australia-based forest researcher, told me she too felt that the tenor of the argument over how and where to grow has become more vehement as demand for tree-based carbon removal has intensified. “Nobody's a villain,” she said. “There are disconnects on both sides.”

Chazdon had been excited to hear about BTG's project. It was, she thought, the type of thing that was sorely needed in conservation—mixing profitable enterprises with an approach to restoration that considers the wider landscape. “I can understand why the Cerrado ecologists are up in arms,” she said. “They get the feeling that nobody cares about their ecosystems.” But demands for ecological purity could indeed get in the way of doing much of anything—especially in places like the Cerrado, where laws and financing favor destruction over restoration. 

Still, thinking about the scale of the carbon removal problem, she considered it sensible to wonder about the future that was being hatched. While there is, in fact, a limit to how much additional land the world needs for pulp and plywood products in the near future, there is virtually no limit to how much land it could devote to sequestering carbon. Which means we need to ask hard questions about the best way to use it. 

It was true, Chazdon said, that planting eucalyptus in the Cerrado was an act of destruction—it'd make that land nearly impossible to recover. The areas preserved in between them would also likely struggle to fully renew itself, without fire or clearing. She would feel more comfortable with such large-scale projects if the bar for restoration were much higher—say, 75% or more. But that almost certainly wouldn't satisfy her grassland colleagues who don't want any eucalyptus at all. And it might not fit the profit model—the flywheel that Apple and others are seeking in order to scale up carbon removal fast. 

Barbara Haya, who studies carbon offsets at the University of California, Berkeley, encouraged me to think about all of it differently. The improvements to planting eucalyptus here, at this farm, could be a perfectly good thing for this industry, she said. Perhaps they merit some claim about greener toilet paper or plywood. Haya would leave that debate to the ecologists.

But we weren't talking about toilet paper or plywood. We were talking about laptops and smart watches and ChatGPT. And the path to connecting those things to these trees was more convoluted. The carbon had to be disentangled first from the wood's other profitable uses and then from the wider changes that were happening in this region and its industries. There seemed to be many plausible scenarios for where this land was heading. Was eucalyptus the only feasible route for carbon to find its way here? 

Haya is among the experts who argue that the idea of precisely canceling out corporate emissions to reach carbon neutrality is a broken one. That's not to say protecting nature can't help fight climate change. Conserving existing forests and grasslands, for example, could often yield greater carbon and biodiversity benefits in the long run than planting new forests. But the carbon math used to justify those efforts was often fuzzier. This makes every claim of carbon neutrality fragile and drives companies toward projects that are easier to prove, she thinks, but perhaps have less impact. 

One idea is that companies should instead shift to a “contribution” model that tracks how much money they put toward climate mitigation, without worrying about the exact amount of carbon removed. “Let's say the goal is to save the Cerrado,” Haya said. “Could they put that same amount of money and really make a difference?” Such an approach, she pointed out, could help finance the preservation of those last intact Cerrado remnants. Or it could fund restoration, even if the restored vegetation takes years to grow or sometimes needs to burn. 

The approach raises its own questions—about how to measure the impact of those investments and what kinds of incentives would motivate corporations to act. But it's a vision that has gained more popularity as scrutiny of carbon credits grows and the options available to companies narrow. With the current state of the world, “what private companies do matters more than ever,” Haya told me. “We need them not to waste money.” 

In the meantime, it's up to the consumer reading the label to decide what sort of path we're on. 

Before we left the farm, Borzone and I had one more task: to plant a tree. The sun was getting low over Project Alpha when I was handed an iron contraption that cradled a eucalyptus seedling, pulled from a tractor piled with plants. 

“There's nothing wrong with the trees,” Borzone had said earlier, squinting up at the row of 18-month-old eucalyptus, their fluttering leaves flashing in the hot wind as if in an ill-practiced burlesque show. “I have to remind myself of that.” But still it felt strange putting one in the ground. We were asking so much of it, after all. And we were poised to ask more.

I squeezed the handle, pulling the iron hinge taut and forcing the plant deep into the soil. It poked out at a slight angle that I was sure someone else would need to fix later, or else this eucalyptus tree would grow askew. I was slow and clumsy in my work, and by the time I finished, the tractor was far ahead of us, impossibly small on the horizon. The worker grabbed the tool from my hand and headed toward it, pushing seedlings down as he went, hurried but precise, one tree after another.

Five years into its mission, NASA and ESA's Solar Orbiter just snapped what might be the crispest, most detailed full-Sun view humanity has ever seen.

The shot above—in all its mesmerizing, dull-yellow grandeur—captures our Sun's million-degree corona in ultraviolet light.

Taken on March 9, 2025, from about 47.8 million miles (77 million kilometers) away, this image isn't a single pretty picture. In fact, it's a mosaic—stitched together from 200 individual shots of the Sun, each of them captured by the spacecraft's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The result is a 12,544-by-12,544-pixel megaportrait that lets you zoom in (on the ESA site) and nerd out like never before.

As detailed on the site, the image showcases some fundamental components of our solar host. The tendrils shooting out from the sphere are the solar atmosphere—the corona—at wavelengths far beyond what our eyes can see. Closer to the solar surface are dark, filamentous prominences—solar plasma—arcing with the Sun's magnetic field. The prominences are roughly 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (10,000 degrees Celsius), a far cry from the million-degree corona.

The dark band across the front of the Sun—making it look like an ominous, fiery frowny face—is a solar filament. The brighter spots on the face of our star are active regions on its surface—the source of solar flares and coronal mass ejections—and on the right side of the star you can see coronal loops, also arcing with the magnetic field.

The joint Solar Orbiter mission is part of a larger effort to decode the chaotic dynamics of the solar atmosphere—including how magnetic fields twist, snap, and sometimes launch solar storms that can mess with satellites and power grids back home.

While this image dazzles our naked eyes, it's also rich in data for researchers chasing questions about solar heating, plasma behavior, and space weather forecasting.

But let's be real: It's also just cool as hell. We sent a spacecraft close enough to the Sun to capture its piping hot winds and live to tell the tale. Beyond that, it's paying back the favor with gloriously high-res imagery. Hang it in the Louvre.

We like the Apple AirTag as much as anybody, but if you're not an iPhone or iPad owner, we also get that you might be feeling a little left out. Android users can be forgetful too, right? Samsung's Galaxy SmartTag2 has you covered, and for less than the Apple gang is paying for their AirTags during this Amazon sale. A single Galaxy SmartTag2 is just $21.49, a discount of 28%, and a 4-pack is on sale for 31% off at just $69.45.

The redesigned Galaxy SmartTag2 dropped in October 2023 as a redesigned, updated version of the original SmartTag, and the upgrades have made all the difference. The SmartTag2 is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, and redesigned for far easier carrying with a keychain or carabiner. The battery life grew by leaps and bounds, and it now has ultra-wideband compatibility for precise close-range tracking.

See SmartTag2 (Single) at Amazon

See SmartTag2 (4-pack) at Amazon

Samsung also added the smart Lost Mode to the upgraded SmartTag2, which allows users to input their contact information directly to the tag. That info is accessible to anyone who finds your missing object (or pet — the SmartTag2 is also tailor-made for pet collars) and scans the SmartTag2. While the SmartTag2 is only compatible with Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets, Lost Mode works with any mobile device that has an NFC reader and web browser.

If you're thinking twice about attaching what you would assume to be a delicate electronic device to the collar of a pet that enjoys its outside time rain or shine, the SmartTag2 is also IP67-rated for water and dust resistance.

Here's something those AirTags can't do — control smart home devices. You can use the SmartThings app on your Samsung Galaxy smartphone or tablet to create automations linked to the SmartTag 2's button. If you have other smart devices from the Samsung family in your home, the SmartTag2 can be used to turn smart lights on or off and other commands.

The battery life of the SmartTag2 is downright crazy — up to 500 days, unless you put it into Power Saving Mode. Then it's up to 700 days, or nearly two years.

Compact intelligent Bluetooth trackers to keep tabs on your valuables aren't just for iPhone users. If you're a Samsung Galaxy smartphone or tablet owner, the SmartTag2 is literally made for you, and so is this Amazon sale that's reduced the price of a single tag by 28% to just $21.49 and a 4-pack of SmartTag2s by 31% to just $69.45.

At the time I'm writing this, pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have not opened up. They're set to go live April 23 at midnight EST. That's already happened by the time you're reading this so to everyone who was unlucky enough to be timed out and not get a Switch 2 into their carts, I pour one out. I'll be online later refreshing all my tabs trying to score too, but if you see this unedited in the morning you can safely assume I'm among the unlucky ones. But we're not all fully out of luck just yet. If what you seek is simply to enhance the way you play games, you can do that with the Xbox Elite 2 series controller. Right now. it's down to as low as $96 for a limited time—typically sells for $140.

The Xbox controller is sculpted with ergonomic flawlessness, comfortable to hold for long hours of playtime. The hybrid D-pad and textured grip on the triggers, bumpers, and back case provide tactile feedback while you game.

See at Amazon

The Xbox Elite 2 series controller takes all this so much further with the inclusion of four different customizable back paddles, adjustable tension thumbsticks, swappable thumbstick toppers, wrap around rubberized grip, and short hair trigger locks. It comes with a tool to twist the thumbstick mobility to your exact preferences. And the swappable tops have varying grips and lengths so you can choose a set that best matches your playstyle.

My favorite part though is simply the heft to it. These things are weighty in a good way. You really feel the solid components in your hand while trying to score some headshots in Halo.

Buttons are customizable and can be set up in three unique profiles. You can use these profiles either for multiple people or set them up differently on a per-game basis. Swap between them on the fly while you play. Battery life is impeccable as you'll be able to stay in the game for up to 40 hours.

The Xbox Elite 2 series controller supports Xbox Wireless as well as Bluetooth, allowing you to easily pair and switch between devices. That includes and Xbox console like the Series X | S or Xbox One as well as Windows PCs, Androids, iOS devices, and even a Samsung TV.

For a limited time, you can get the red version of the Xbox Elite 2 series controller for significantly cheaper than usual. Right now, it's down to just $96.

Two things were glaringly clear to me after sitting through a 2.5-hour event yesterday where Motorola pre-briefed press on its new trio of Razr Android phones. The company really believes in the flip-style foldable form factor popularized by Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip and it thinks more AI, shoved ever deeper into the software, will rescue us from the cruelty of pecking on apps and buttons with our fingers.

Debuting today are three Razr flip-style phones: Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra. You can think of them as good, better, and best. Motorola claims the Razr Ultra is the most powerful flip-style smartphone with the best camera system available. We'll be the judge of that when we get a device in for review. But the specs—including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset—at least backs that up on paper.

They all look pretty similar, but here's how you can spot the difference without pulling up a comparison chart. As the most premium model, the Razr Ultra sports the largest internal screen (7 inches), a dedicated Moto AI button on the left side, and fancier finishes such as Italian-made Alcantara, satin, faux leather, and wood. Upgrades over the other Razrs that you can't eyeball right away: 50 megapixels for the main, ultra-wide, and selfie cameras; a large 4,700mAh battery; 68W wired charging; 30W wireless charging; and 5W reverse wireless charging.

The Razr+ looks nearly identical to the Razr Ultra, but comes with a slightly smaller 6.9-inch internal screen, no physical AI button, a smaller 4,000mAh battery, slower charging (45W wired and 15W wireless), and a lower-resolution selfie camera (32 megapixels). It also has a less powerful Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset.

Sitting at the entry-level, the plainly named Razr has a smaller 3.6-inch external display (there's a “forehead” bezel not present on the Razr+ and Razr Ultra), lower-resolution cameras (50-megapixel main, 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and 32-megapixel selfie), and a mid-range MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chipset. However, the Razr does have a larger 4,500mAh battery than the Razr+.

I got to play with all three briefly and they all felt well-built to me, with the only major physical quality difference being the materials and finishes. I really liked the luxurious Alcantara on the Razr Ultra, but the polished aluminum and plastic Razr didn't feel cheap in my opinion.

Motorola boasted other quality-of-life upgrades for the new Razrs. The hinges are titanium, which the company says is four time stronger than before and can handle “up to 35% more folds” compared to previous generation Razr flip phones. Motorola also says the crease on the internal folding display is 30% less visible (unclear how Motorola arrived at that number but it does seem less visible), and the Razr Ultra supposedly has the strongest external screen thanks to it being Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic.

Gadget nerds might be salivating over the specs, especially the ones on the Razr Ultra, but the real appeal to these new flip-style phones might be Moto AI. Rather than develop its own AI—and risk embarrassing itself like a certain fruit-named tech giant—Motorola is partnering up with AI leaders and using their large language models and logic reasoning in the background for various tasks. Perplexity, the AI “answer engine” that's been chipping away at Google's search relevance, is deeply integrated into the Android 15 operating system. Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, Microsoft's Copilot, also power different aspects of Moto AI, assisting with general AI features like tasks suggestions (i.e. calling an Uber on your behalf or drafting an email), summarization, memory recall (think surfacing information from notes and screenshots), and more. Missing is any integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT (and there's probably a reason for that) and Anthropic's Claude.

The cameras also have Moto AI baked in with a feature called Signature Style. The phones use AI to automatically adjust tone and colors and then learns based on how you edit your shots. It sounds neat, but that also diminishes the whole point of photos which is that they usually don't have the same uninspired look to them. I want to mix it up with my photos! Not have a specific look.

Fact is, every phone maker is promising game-changing AI features that they're touting as more convenient or efficient. AI crammed deeper into your phone will help anticipate your needs! AI will save you from hundreds of taps every day. AI will finally fulfill the “intelligent” promises that voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant failed at.

That's the AI dream everyone (including Motorola) is selling. The AI in these new Razr phones is better and more useful, but also not quite capable enough to fully offload everything to just yet. And who even knows when that'll be, if that ever happens. (Naturally, Motorola didn't address AI hallucinations.)

All three Razrs will be available for preorder on May 7 and available unlocked on May 15. The Razr costs $699.99, the Razr+ is $999.99, and the Razr Ultra is $1,299.99.

House of the Dragon adds three new cast members. Taskmaster can't get a break in a new Thunderbolts* clip. And is the next Mission: Impossible movie really longer than Magnolia?  Morning Spoilers: you opened it, we came. Your spoiling will be legendary, even in hell!

Deadline also has word Haunting in Connecticut screenwriters Adam Simon and Tim Metcalfe are now at work on a new “contemporary reimagining” of H.P. Lovecraft's short story, Herbert West: Reanimator.

During a recent interview with Screen Rant, director Dan Trachtenberg discussed developing the Predator's alien language in Badlands.

We reached out to the guy who does the Navi language [for Avatar], who was very occupied, and recommended his mentee. We did it the way that The Lord of the Rings does Elvish or Game of Thrones does Dothraki. Except with those, there's more of a precedent. As we discovered with that language expert… [the Yautja language] in the other Predator movies is complete nonsense. There's no sense to it. People from the internet have tried to make sense of it, but none of it was made with intention. So we decided to make it with intentions. We completely developed the language. Everything they're speaking has actual rules and structure and all that was written as verbal. Early on, we just did explorations with concept art of what we could do.

I think lots of times, when people do more in a franchise, there's a tendency to go into the Senate trading committees. I thought we… should have a sliver of that, but not let the movie be that. When people hear the premise, they may think this is all about the inner workings of the Yautja culture. That's not what we want to do. This is an invention of the premise. Now the Predator is on a planet, and he's going to be hunted by things, and he has to use his guile to figure stuff out.

According to Comic Book, Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning runs 2 hours and 49 minutes long, making it the lengthiest film in the Mission: Impossible franchise and second-longest of Tom Cruise's entire acting career behind Magnolia.

Taskmaster, Ghost, Yelena, and U.S. Agent battle in a four-way brawl before deciding to arrest Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in two new clips from Thunderbolts*.

Elsewhere, the latest TV spot for Until Dawn sells itself on the film's practical effects alone.

During her recent appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast (via The Direct), Bryce Dallas Howard confirmed she's discussed a potential Mace Windu series with Disney and LucasFilm.

Sam Jackson has been incredibly supportive of me and has told me many times that he would act in something that I directed, which is, like, I'm not worthy, basically. And then I went straight to Dave Filoni and I was like, ‘So, let's just talk about Mace Windu and where he is. Can we just talk about this? Because, is he dead? Is he?'

Russell T. Davies discussed casting Rose Ayling-Ellis as a character named Aliss in this week's “scary” episode of Doctor Who.

Aliss wasn't written as a deaf character. But then Rose's name came up, and she's acted for a long time on British television, and I instantly said yes. Because she's just wonderful. It was a delight to work with Rose. As I talked with her, we put things into the script I never would have thought of. She modified things, and we modified things….[after submitting the script for a compliance reading] they tell us what we've gotten wrong, which is exactly the way it should work, [but] it came back with such a glowing report. [There's a line of dialogue] about how hearing people can get paranoid around those who are quietly signing. “I've never seen that said out loud before,” they said. I don't want to give away too much…is she the villain? Maybe she's behind it all?

AMD's third RDNA4 GPU is ready to roll, but it might be exclusive to Chinese customers

AMD is reportedly set to launch its latest and most affordable RX 9070 series graphics card, the RX 9070 GRE (Great Radeon Edition). Videocardz reports that it has official photos of the RX 9070 GRE, indicating that the cards are ready for launch and countering allegedly previous rumors that the GRE variant would be delayed until Q4 2025.

Videocardz obtained pictures of two (out of three) RX 9070 GRE variants from PowerColor, a Red Devil model and a Reaper version, each sporting triple-fan cooler designs with a red and black color scheme. Box art featuring a combination of English and Chinese text indicates these cards could be Chinese exclusive, or at the very least, sold in the Chinese market.

The GPU-focused site confirmed that the RX 9070 GRE Red Devil will feature a dual 8-pin power connector setup, similar to most RX 9070 AIB partner models and lower-end RX 9070 XT trims, and utilize the same cooler as the RX 9070 XT Red Devil. The GRE variant allegedly sports a 650W minimum power supply requirement.

Videocardz also states that previously leaked specs for the RX 9070 GRE are true. The RX 9070 GRE will come with the same Navi 48 GPU die as the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, but it will be severely stripped down, sporting just 3,072 enabled cores, and a stripped-down memory interface sporting a 192-bit bus and 12GB of GDDR6 memory, with a maximum boost clock of 2.79 GHz.

Compared to the previous generation, the RX 9070 GRE is most similar to the RX 7700 XT, which came with 3,456 cores and a 192-bit interface.

AMD has not officially announced the RX 9070 GRE nor which RDNA3 GPU it is aimed to replace. But logically, the RX 7700 XT would be the RX 9070 GRE's predecessor. AMD confirmed previously that the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT were intended to replace the RX 7800 XT, RX 7900 GRE, and RX 7900 XT.

If Videocardz's information is legitimate, the RX 9070 GRE will launch before the RX 9060 XT, which has a rumored launch date of May 18th.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds. Make sure to click the Follow button.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


The best of the best gaming laptops are all about performance, and none have pushed the numbers in our benchmarks further than the MSI Titan 18 HX AI. This 18-inch monster brings an Intel “Arrow Lake HX” Core Ultra 9 processor with 24 cores and Nvidia's flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU with 24GB of dedicated memory. Add triple SSDs, including one with PCIe Gen 5, and this is as serious as a laptop gets.

Naturally, this technological marvel isn't cheap, and it does have downsides, which you'll want to consider before forking over a bank account-crushing $6,379.

Even had MSI not invested time in making this laptop look good, it would stand out for its size alone. Measuring 15.9 x 12.08 x 1.26 inches and weighing 7.93 pounds, this massive slab requires dedication to transport. It's a size up from the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 with a smaller screen(14.06 x 10.0 x 1.18 inches, 5.51 pounds).



The high-quality magnesium-aluminum chassis resists flexing, including the huge lid. Most of the laptop is MSI's usual black, but a gray underside and rear protrusion add contrast. The turquoise rubber highlights across the back and bottom add much-needed color to the otherwise Darth Vader look. The lid logo and the touchpad (which is flush with the palm rest, having no physical border) are both RGB-lit and configurable in the SteelSeries app.



The Titan's port selection spans three sides, starting on the left and right edges with three USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a full-size SD card reader, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and two Thunderbolt 5 (USB Type-C) ports which provide 80 Gbps of bidirectional bandwidth.

Meanwhile, an HDMI 2.1 video output and a 2.5 Gbps Ethernet jack are along the back. The 400 W power adapter has its proprietary connector here. The adapter is relatively compact given its power rating.



For wireless, the Titan features Killer Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4.

We're testing the Titan 18 HX AI in its most powerful configuration, with a Core Ultra 9 285HX processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU (175 W maximum graphics power), and 64GB of RAM.

Playing F1 24 at 3840 x 2400 with Ultra High settings and TAA enabled, I consistently saw between 51 and 60 FPS, making the game playable and stutter-free even with challenging graphics.

The laptops we're using for comparison include the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 (Core Ultra 9 275HX, RTX 5080, 175 W, $3,299 as tested), the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 (Core Ultra 9 275HX, RTX 5080 175 W, $3,099 as tested), and the Razer Blade 16 (AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, RTX 5090 160 W, $4,499.99). They offer similar processors and graphics cards despite using smaller 16-inch screens (with the exception of the Blade, which has a lower-power CPU).

While our comparisons will focus on the 1920 x 1080 numbers, we also tested at each laptop's native resolution, which is 3840 x 2400 for the Titan but only 2560 x 1600 for the others.

In Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest detail preset), the Titan achieved 196 FPS at 1080p, noticeably ahead of the Gigabyte (185 FPS) and the Asus (177 FPS), with the Razer taking last (166 FPS). The Titan's framerates took a serious hit at its native resolution, dropping to 68 FPS.

In Cyberpunk 2077 (Ray Tracing Ultra preset), the Titan again clinched the top spot at 1080p, producing 71 FPS versus the Razer's next-best 66 FPS. Although the Titan's 21 FPS at 3840 x 2400 native resolution is unplayable, we do use the most demanding preset for testing, so reducing the settings a notch or two should boost framerates significantly.

In Far Cry 6 (Ultra preset), the Titan's 115 FPS at 1080p was just below the Gigabyte's 120 FPS and slightly ahead of the Asus' 112 FPS. The Razer trailed, with 97 FPS. At native resolution, the Titan produced 75 FPS.

The Titan didn't complete Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium preset) at 1080p for reasons we due to driver issues that we've seen on other RTX-50 laptops , though it did put up 50 FPS at native, almost catching the Gigabyte (54 FPS), which was outputting at a lower native resolution.

Finally, in Borderlands 3 (at the game's “Badass” preset), the Titan had the best 1080p number of 183 FPS, outperforming the Gigabyte (172 FPS) and the Asus (156 FPS). The Razer didn't complete this test.

Overall, the Titan demonstrated exceptional performance. While its native resolution is challenging (perhaps there's a reason most gaming laptops are topping out at 2560 x 1600 these days), the RTX 5090 is more than capable of handling it, albeit with reduced settings in some games like Cyberpunk 2077.

We stress test gaming laptops by running the Metro Exodus benchmark on RTX settings 15 times, simulating half an hour of gaming. The Titan averaged 145 FPS across all runs, with a low variance of around 1 FPS between runs indicating stable thermal performance. During the test, the P-Cores ran at an average clockspeed of 4.4 GHz and temperature of 77.4 degrees C while the E-cores averaged 2.2 GHz and 71 C. The GeForce RTX 4090 had an average boost clock of 1,884 MHz and temperature of 67 C.

Our Titan 18 HX AI demo model features a Core Ultra 9 285HX processor, 64GB of RAM, and 6TB of SSD storage. It's an absolute monster for any task.

The 6TB is spread across three 2TB drives – one Gen 5, two Gen 4 – in RAID 0 while the RAM runs at a faster-than-usual 6,400 MHz. I'd normally expect the Core Ultra 9 275HX in a gaming laptop, not the Core Ultra 9 285HX, which offers an insignificantly higher boost clock (5.5 versus 5.4 GHz). Its support for Intel vPro Enterprise and ECC memory are unused in this laptop, so it truly appears to have been implemented for its clockspeed bragging rights.

In the Geekbench 6 CPU test, the Titan scored near the top in single-core, with 3,046 points versus the Asus' 3,071 points, but it dominated multi-core, with 22,082 points compared to the Asus' 19,597 points. The Razer's 28W AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 didn't keep up, scoring 2,922 points in single-core and 16,025 points in multi-core.

The Titan's triple SSD array produced record numbers in our 25 GB file transfer test, with an average transfer rate of 2,635.57 MBps. The Asus trailed at what would usually be an impressive 1,841.41 MBps. The Gigabyte picked up last place with an anemic 665.26 MBps.

Our Handbrake video transcoding test was another clear victory for the Titan, which it completed in 1 minute and 55 seconds. The Gigabyte was the next fastest, at 2 minutes and 17 seconds, with the Razer taking last place, finishing the test in 3 minutes and 5 seconds.

I know a laptop that changes the game when I see one. The Titan 18's screen did just that for me. Not only is it massive, spanning 18 inches diagonally, but its mini-LED technology produces an exceptionally bright and vivid picture that needs to be seen to be believed. In fact, I found the brightness overwhelming in a darker room and tended to use the laptop at 60 or 70% brightness most of the time.

Watching Star Wars: Andor, the stark white of stormtrooper armor and the glistening lights of Coruscant's skyline gave me the sense that this is how the show was meant to be watched.

The colorful race cars in F1 24 also stood out, and the screen's excellent contrast helped me make out fine details in the track surface. The 120 Hz refresh rate ensured the image didn't stutter.

This screen also works well for productivity, thanks to a 3840 x 2400 screen resolution. Putting two documents side-by-side is effortless with so much space – it's almost like two screens in one.



The Titan 18's screen covered 87.2% of the DCI-P3 gamut, just edging out the Asus (81.2%) and the Gigabyte (81%). The Razer was even more colorful, though it uses an OLED screen. Brightness is where the Titan is truly in a class of its own, with an average of 729.3 nits. Not shown in the chart, we measured a peak brightness of 762 nits in our HDR tests.

The Titan 18's keyboard stands out for its low-profile Cherry MX mechanical keys. It reminds me more of a desktop than a laptop keyboard, emitting clicks and clacks with luxurious key travel. I nearly broke my MonkeyType record, achieving 124 words per minute with a 1% error rate.



Blissful typing feel aside, this keyboard's layout is less than optimal for productivity. Dedicated Home and End keys are missing, and the Fn key being right of the spacebar makes using it for shortcuts difficult. Furthermore, the arrow keys, while full-size, are forced into the main keyboard area instead of being separated out, compromising the size of several keys.

Many keys are not mechanical, either, including the arrow keys and the number pad. I didn't notice this at first, and while the feel isn't bad, it seems like cost cutting, which shouldn't exist on a laptop this expensive.

The Titan's backlit touchpad offers a unique look and ample size, but those are its only upsides. Its haptic feedback suffers from a small delay between pressing and actuation that makes it seem sluggish. I found clicking and dragging particularly challenging, as it often didn't register when I released the click. Changing the settings in Windows didn't seem to fix this. Most people will probably use one of the best gaming mice with this kind of machine, but the touchpad should still be great.

Although the Titan 18 has more impressive sound quality than most laptops, I was underwhelmed. Its four speakers and two woofers produce acceptable but not room-filling volume. Watching Star Wars: Andor, vocals and blaster fire sounded crisp, but a lack of bass robbed explosions of their thunder. The bass was also an issue in the dance and electronic music I sampled.

The included Nahimic audio app offers treble, bass, and vocal equalizer settings, which do help – I bumped the bass by 6 dB to get some low-end. Music mode works as a good all-around preset.

The Titan 18 HX AI offers more M.2 2280 storage slots – four versus three, including one Gen 5 – than its predecessor, but it has only two SODIMM slots instead of four, limiting its maximum memory capacity to 96GB (two 48GB SODIMMs). The memory is faster this time around, though, operating at 6,400 MHz instead of 5,600 MHz.

Removing the bottom panel requires removing many Philips-head screws (fortunately, all are the same length). I then took a plastic trim tool and popped the clips around the edges.



The four M.2 slots are visible, with the Gen 5 slot on the right featuring its own heatpipe. The two SODIMM slots are under the black rectangular metal heatsink in the middle. The battery and wireless card are also visible and user-replaceable.



The Titan brings back memories of old-school gaming laptops with battery life so brief that we joked they lasted just long enough to power down. Despite using the highest capacity battery allowed on a commercial flight, the Titan lasted just 2 hours and 16 minutes in our battery rundown test, which consists of simulated web browsing, streaming video over Wi-Fi, and running OpenGL tests, all with the screen brightness set to 150 nits. All the other laptops did far better – the Gigabyte went for 5 hours and 2 minutes while the Razer lasted the longest, at 7 hours and 21 minutes.

In more practical use, I got only 1 hour and 15 minutes surfing the Internet at my local coffee shop before a low battery warning. I had the screen brightness cranked since I was sitting in front of the window, which didn't help the time. Nonetheless – yikes!



We measure surface temperature of gaming laptops while running our Metro Exodus stress test. The keyboard between the G and H keys measured 105 degrees F, the touchpad 77 F, and the maximum temperature on the underside was 109 F near the exhaust fans.

Although MSI did a fine job keeping the temperatures low, the fans create enough noise to be audible across a living room. The fans' high pitch adds to the annoyance. The fan speed tends to be constant while gaming, but they can be overreactive while the laptop is idling or Internet browsing, unexpectedly spinning up and creating much noise.

The Titan's 1080p webcam offers passable video quality, showing adequate sharpness in well-lit situations but quickly becomes blurry in low light. It has an infrared sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition logins and a sliding privacy shutter.

Considering the price, it would be nice to see MSI go past 1080p, which we're seeing a lot in the best ultrabooks.

MSI Center is the main app on the Titan 18. It's useful for switching power profiles, hardware monitoring, and keyboard configuration changes, including swapping the Windows and Fn keys and disabling the Windows key. Additionally, it's possible to completely disable Nvidia Optimus so the GeForce RTX 5090 is always active.

The SteelSeries app allows changing the RGB lighting of the touchpad and lid logo. Other software includes MSI Player, which lets you run Android apps; True Color for changing the display temperature; and the mentioned Nahmic audio app.

MSI backs the Titan 18 with a one-year warranty, which is too short for a laptop this expensive.

Our Titan 18 is model A2XWJG-614US, featuring a Core Ultra 9 285 HX processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics, 64GB of memory, and 6TB of storage, which is one 2TB Gen5 SSD and two 2TB Gen4 SSDs in RAID 0.

All Titan 18 laptops at publishing time have a Core Ultra 9 285HX processor, the 18-inch 3840 x 2400 Mini-LED screen, and Wi-Fi 7. The “base” model has an RTX 5080, 64GB of RAM, and a 2TB Gen5 SSD for $5,279.

Competition was scarce as I typed this – the Alienware 18 Area-51 was not yet available with the RTX 5090, though a Core Ultra 9 275HX and RTX 5080 model with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD was $4,149.99. I also saw the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 for $4,499.99, with a Core Ultra 9 275HX and an RTX 5090, though just a 2560 x 1600 display, 16GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD.

MSI's Titan 18 stands at the pinnacle of gaming laptops, combining Intel's “Arrow Lake” HX-class processor with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 to deliver desktop-level performance, all showcased on a breathtaking mini-LED 4K display.

While the Titan 18 excels in most areas, it comes with a few drawbacks. The cooling fans are noticeably loud, meaning gamers will need noise-canceling headphones or powerful speakers for the best experience. Additionally, its touchpad can be a bit finicky, and the battery life is on the shorter side. A fully mechanical keyboard would be a welcome upgrade, as parts of it still rely on membrane switches for a few keys, and more robust speakers could further enhance the experience.

Despite the shortcomings, the Titan 18 achieves its core goal —delivering cutting-edge performance and an unrivaled visual experience. It's pricier than the Alienware and Asus competition, but neither offers a mini-LED display. For those fortunate enough to afford it, the Titan 18 HX AI is nothing short of an exceptional gaming powerhouse.

x86 expands from desktops to dashboards.

Expanding its wings into the automotive ecosystem, Intel shared its upcoming SDV (Software-Defined Vehicle) SoC designs at Auto Shanghai 2025 yesterday. Slated to be the industry's first disaggregated design, the company presented its second-generation SDV SoC, internally codenamed Frisco Lake. A detailed investigation by 3elife, a Chinese tech and news publication, purports these SoCs are derivatives of Intel's Panther Lake design, with their successor allegedly based on Nova Lake.

Software-defined vehicles are automobiles where a majority of the functionality is handled through software, rather than traditional physical, mechanical, or electronic components. Compared to desktops, x86 has seen limited adoption in the automotive industry, primarily due to stringent power consumption requirements, real-time processing demands, and safety and security concerns.

However, as ADAS, autonomous driving, in-car experiences, and the need for high-performance computing in vehicles grow, Intel is positioning itself to gain traction in this market. Last year, the company released the 225W Arc A760A, offering a PC-like experience from the comfort of your car. The Raptor-Lake-based Malibou Lake platform represents Intel's latest SDV offering, featuring up to 14 cores (6P+8E), 24MB L3 cache, 96 EUs, and support for eight cameras, slated for a Q4 2024 launch.

Yesterday, Intel shared several slides detailing Frisco Lake, officially poised to deliver 10 times better AI performance and 61% higher efficiency than current offerings, presumably Malibou Lake. In addition, the inclusion of an Xe3 (Celestial) graphics IP block strongly suggests these SoCs are indeed derived from Panther Lake, a connection that is supported by the source and kernel patches (via Harukaze at X). The use of Intel's flagship 18A process node and the jump from Raptor Cove to Cougar Cove (rumored) would explain the sharp spike in efficiency.

So... -----------202x ApolloLake (Atom-N) 2020 AshCreekFalls (SkyLake-SP-Auto) 2025 MalibouLake (RaptorLake-P-Auto) 2026 FriscoLake (PantherLake-P-Auto) 2028 GrizzlyLake (MonumentPeak) with [NovaLake Only E-Core???] 🤔🤔🤔 pic.twitter.com/KKE5yoWG6QApril 23, 2025

That's not all, as 3elife secured an alleged roadmap detailing Intel's future product offerings from a third party. Assuming this timeline is accurate, Frisco Lake was never actually intended for launch and appears to be a last-minute addition to Intel's product stack. Apparently, Malibou Lake was in line to be superseded by Grizzly Lake, which is now expected to serve as Intel's third-generation SDV SoC design.

Under the Grizzly Lake lineup, the leaked slides mention an SoC codenamed Monument Peak, reportedly offering up to 32 cores, a 7 TFLOPS-capable Xe-based integrated GPU, slated for the first half of 2027. This time frame coincides with Nova Lake, and one rumored configuration of that architecture includes 32 efficient cores (16P+32E+4LPE), likely based on the Arctic Wolf microarchitecture.

So, if these rumors hold true, Intel is porting its consumer-grade architectures to the automotive industry with a one-year cadence. Considering the extensive validation processes and typically long lifecycles of these chips, automobiles usually don't opt for the most cutting-edge core design, unlike the desktop market. It's hard to say what the future holds, but perhaps Intel's limited success in the mobile phone and AI markets might be a catalyst for this drive to establish a strong foothold in the automotive domain.

Thankfully, Nvidia doesn't seem to be pushing the 5060 Ti 8GB cards very hard.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and RTX 4060 Ti 16GB represent the new and old guards of the 16GB realm for Team Green. Both of these are mainstream GPU offerings, ostensibly priced in the $430–$500 range. We weren't particularly impressed with the 4060 Ti 16GB at launch, but our feelings have tempered over time — helped by an unofficial $50 price cut — with both having appeared on our list of the best graphics cards.

The Nvidia Ada Lovelace 4060 Ti 16GB card originally launched over a month after the initial RTX 4060 Ti 8GB card, with a $100 price premium. Throughout the ensuing two years, the 8GB card has been more readily available, though as noted already, street prices on the 16GB card did drop by $50 at times. 

Conversely, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and 8GB variants technically launched at the same time on April 16, 2025, with only a $50 price gap. So far, the 16GB models have been far more widespread in the U.S., to the point where we have not yet been able to purchase an 8GB card at retail for testing.

Given the ongoing concerns with having only 8GB of VRAM, we feel it makes the most sense to compare the new and old 16GB xx60 Ti cards. We'll look primarily at performance, as well as power, features, and pricing. In theory, this should be a very easy win for the new Nvidia Blackwell GPU, but let's see how they actually stack up.

Specifications for the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and RTX 4060 Ti 16GB are mostly similar, with a few key upgrades for the newer GPU. While both the GB206 and AD106 dies have a maximum of 36 SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors), the 5060 Ti uses the fully enabled chip while the 4060 Ti disables a pair of SMs. That cascades through the GPU shaders, tensor cores, RT cores, and TMUs, giving the 5060 Ti a theoretical 6% advantage. However, clock speeds also factor into performance, and the 5060 Ti comes with a 2,572 MHz boost clock compared to 2,535 MHz on the 4060 Ti, another 1.5% advantage.

The core counts are a ""hard"" spec, but the clock speeds are a bit fuzzy. Power limits also come into play, and the 5060 Ti has a 180W TGP compared to 165W on the 4060 Ti 16GB. In practice, across our 21-game test suite, the 5060 Ti 16GB averaged clock speeds of 2,776 MHz compared to 2,725 MHz on the 4060 Ti 16GB — a slightly larger 1.9% advantage in favor of the newer card. Combined with SM and core counts, that gives the 5060 Ti 16GB an 8% advantage in raw compute.

That's pretty negligible in terms of a gen-on-gen increase, but architectural updates can further impact the real-world performance. More pertinent than the raw compute is the memory subsystem. The RTX 5060 Ti 16GB has 28 Gbps GDDR7 memory while the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB has 18 Gbps GDDR6 memory. That means the newer part has a 56% advantage in raw memory bandwidth — though architecture and timings can still play a role.

Taken together, based on the specifications, you should expect to see the newer GPU outperform its predecessor by anywhere from 8% to 56%, depending on whether a particular game or workload relies more on raw compute, memory bandwidth, or a blend of the two. In practice, compute tends to be the more important metric. As such, we'd expect a 15~25 percent lead from the 5060 Ti. Let's see how things go in actual benchmarks.

For most people, gaming performance will be the most important factor in choosing a graphics card. We have a test suite of 21 games, 6 of which have ray tracing enabled and 15 with pure rasterization. Upscaling and frame generation are disabled for all these tests, as we view those as ""performance enhancers"" rather than baseline features that should be compared.

Both the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and RTX 4060 Ti 16GB support Nvidia's various DLSS features, though the 5060 Ti also offers MFG (Multi Frame Generation) — which can smooth out performance but definitely doesn't improve the actual feel of games that support it as much as the numbers might suggest. The experience of DLSS 3 framegen in our view tends to be inflated by about 50–60 percent (meaning, divide the resulting number by 1.5–1.6 to get a realistic view of what it feels like), while MFG 4X is about a 170–200 percent inflation (divide by 2.7–3.0).

Those are fuzzy approximations, but basically if you get less than a 50% ""increase"" in framerates via framegen, we would argue that it actually feels like a step backward. Likewise, less than a 170% increase from MFG 4X would be a net loss. Or to put hard numbers on it, if the base performance is 60 FPS, framegen needs to run at 90 FPS or more and MFG 4X needs to run at 160 FPS or more. Some would argue even those figures are too generous, but our main point is that ""FPS"" inflation via frame generation techniques has been heavily abused as a true indication of performance.

The charts and tables provide all the important numbers, so we're not going to dig into every single result. We're mostly interested in the overall trends, recognizing that individual games can come in above or below the averages. That's why we have an extensive 21 game test suite, with equal weighting given to each result via a geometric mean calculation.

The nice thing about comparing two Nvidia GPUs, even though they're different architectures, is that relative performance ends up being pretty consistent across both rasterization and ray tracing games. AMD and Intel GPUs vary quite a bit more, depending on what specific games are used.

Overall, the 5060 Ti 16GB outperforms the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB by 16% at 1080p medium, 17% in the ray tracing suite, and 16% in the rasterization suite. That means the 5060 Ti and 4060 Ti generally aren't CPU limited, even at 1080p medium. The minimum FPS (1% lows) shows similar consistency. Looking at the individual games, the 5060 Ti 16GB leads by 6% (Assassin's Creed Mirage) to as much as 29% (A Plague Tale: Requiem).

Bumping up to 1080p ultra settings, most of the deltas are virtually unchanged. The 5060 Ti 16GB still leads by 16% overall, 17% in the ray tracing suite, and 16% in the rasterization games. Minimum FPS ends up slightly closer overall at 18%, but with a wider 23% spread in our ray tracing tests and 16% in the rasterization games. Across all 21 games, we measured an 8% (Starfield) to 26% (Plague Tale: Requiem and Space Marine 2) delta in favor of the 5060 Ti.

Given the memory bandwidth advantage, the 5060 Ti 16GB should increase its overall lead at higher resolutions, and it does — just not by much. It's 18% faster overall at 1440p ultra, and 18% in both the rasterization and ray tracing suites. The various games show an advantage of 9% (Starfield) to 29% (Plague Tale and Space Marine 2, again).

Finally, at 4K ultra, we see the biggest lead for the 5060 Ti 16GB. Across the full 21-game suite it's 21% faster than the 4060 Ti 16GB, with a 20% lead in the ray tracing games and a 22% lead in the rasterization tests. The smallest advantage improves to 12% (Avatar), with the biggest lead being 33% (Space Marine 2).

Looking at other potential workloads, we have various disciplines that all loosely fall under the content creation umbrella. AI workloads include Stable Diffusion image generation, LLaMa text generation, image classification, inference, and other tasks. We also have 3D rendering via Blender, video transcoding using SPEC Workstation 4.0, and the Viewport test suite from SPEC Workstation 4.0.

Many people — particularly gamers — may never do any of these tasks on their PC, though it's worth nothing that Nvidia's push for ""neural rendering"" techniques can also extend into AI-powered NPCs. That's not something we can directly benchmark at present, but there's potential for the AI performance to become more important in the coming years if AI NPCs catch on in some major games.

Of all the content creation tasks, we think the AI tests deserve the most attention. As noted above, such workloads could become a bigger part of how people use their PCs and graphics cards in the future, even within games. Overall, the 5060 Ti 16GB delivers about a 24% lead in AI workloads compared to the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB. It's also worth mentioning that none of these AI tests at present leverage the FP4 support that was added to the tensor cores in the Blackwell architecture, so there's potential for even more of an AI deficit if future applications make use of that number format.

Video transcoding ends up being a virtual tie, indicating there's not a huge difference between the NVENC/NVDEC blocks in Ada and Blackwell. The 5060 Ti takes a 4% lead by virtue of running at slightly higher clock speeds, though Nvidia did supposedly improve the encoding quality — that's not something these tests measure, unfortunately.

3D modeling using Blender basically matches what we saw in gaming performance. Overall, the 5060 Ti 16GB runs 20% faster than the 4060 Ti 16GB, with a spread of 14% to 29% in the three different scenes. SolidWorks agrees with that number, while 3ds Max shows an even larger 31% lead for the 5060 Ti.

Those last two are part of the SPEC Workstation 4.0 Viewport tests, which show a 17% lead overall for the 5060 Ti, with a range of 1% (Creo) to as much as 31% (3ds Max). Most of the SPEC Workstation tests are truly for professionals, however, so we wouldn't put too much weight on them. Most paid professionals will have a workstation equipped with a workstation GPU (e.g. Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation or the new RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell).

The vast majority of Nvidia features and software tools are available on both the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB and the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB. As such, it's easy to think that the two are ""tied"" in features. However, there are a few noteworthy exceptions.

First, the Blackwell RTX architecture adds support for Multi Frame Generation. We don't love the way the numbers are used to indicate massive performance improvements (i.e. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tried to claim that an ""RTX 5070 is as far as an RTX 4090"" at the launch event), but MFG isn't inherently bad. There are games where it works better, and the additional frame smoothing can make games feel better, subjectively. It's a nuanced discussion, in other words, and not the ""fake frames BAD"" mentality that often gets tossed around.

Blackwell RTX, and by extension the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, is also supposed to have better support for so-called neural rendering (i.e. Microsoft's Cooperative Vectors API). We don't yet know precisely how much better it might be compared to older GPUs, but we do know Cooperative Vectors is supposed to work with all RTX GPUs — and that it's supposed to be better on Blackwell RTX.

As noted earlier, the RTX 5060 Ti also has support for FP4 (and FP6) numerical formats in its tensor cores. Making proper use of FP4 presents challenges for AI models, but various algorithms have demonstrated superior performance and reduced memory requirements with a ""negligible"" drop in overall inference quality. As AI continues to evolve, it's reasonable to expect the use of FP4 to become more commonplace.

We've seen that with FP8 support as well. First introduced with the RTX 40-series GPUs, the use of FP8 modes was relatively rare for most of the past 2.5 years. However, Nvidia's new DLSS Transformers algorithms for upscaling (super resolution) and ray reconstruction appear to leverage native FP8 support. It's why the performance hit for DLSS Transformers tends to be substantially lower on RTX 40- and 50-series GPUs compared to RTX 30- and 20-series GPUs.

But Nvidia giveth and Nvidia also taketh away. Blackwell graphics cards no longer have PhysX support, so the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB simply can't run PhysX in older games that used the feature. (Not many recent games have used GPU PhysX, so this mostly applies to games like the Batman: Arkham series and Mirror's Edge, all of which are at least 10 years old now.) 32-bit CUDA support was likewise retired, which again mostly impacts older apps that are no longer being actively updated.



The RTX 4060 Ti 16GB launched in July 2023 with an MSRP of $499, $100 more than the 8GB variant. The RTX 5060 Ti 16GB came out in April 2025 with a $429 MSRP. On paper, that clearly suggests a pricing advantage for the 5060 Ti 16GB. In practice, it's also an advantage when shopping around for new cards, but that's because the 4060 Ti 16GB (and the rest of the RTX 40-series) has been retired.

Since both GPU lines are made using TSMC's 4N process node, there's no reason for Nvidia to continue producing the older chips, and in fact all indications are that wafer orders for Ada Lovelace may have ended in the fall of 2024. Supplies have completely dried up and prices have shot up as a result.

The availability of RTX 50-series GPUs has been relatively poor compared to what we saw with the 40-series launch. Sure, the RTX 4090 sold out for the first few months, but eventually it reached the point where you could expect to find some models selling slightly below the base MSRP, and all of the other 40-series GPUs eventually dropped below the base MSRP by late 2023 and early 2024. So far, the RTX 50-series has rarely even approached MSRP, often selling at 20% to 50% above the minimum suggested price.

At present, the least expensive RTX 5060 Ti 16GB card we can find is an Asus Dual RTX 5060 Ti 16GB for $492.98 at Newegg. That's about 15% above the base MSRP that Nvidia set, but Nvidia can't force its add-in board (AIB) partners to actually sell cards at MSRP. With ongoing GPU shortages, it's little surprise that nearly all 50-series GPUs are ""overpriced"" relative to MSRP.

As bad as that might seem, the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB is in an even worse state. With production of those GPUs likely halted last year, only limited supplies remain. Mostly, it's third-party marketplace resellers on Newegg, Amazon, and similar storefronts trying to make some serious money. Even the 8GB cards start at $575 (MSRP is supposed to be $400), while the cheapest RTX 4060 Ti 16GB costs $679. Yeah, that's a bad choice unless for some reason you specifically need the older hardware.

This was pretty much a foregone conclusion, but the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB easily beats the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB in every conceivable metric. There's only one potential advantage to the 4060 Ti, and it's nebulous at best: It supports PhysX and 32-bit CUDA (though both are likely deprecated and will fade away in the coming months).

In contrast, the 5060 Ti 16GB offers about 20% higher gaming performance on average, across nearly all tested resolutions and settings. It's also about 20% faster in AI workloads and 3D rendering, and about 17% faster in a selections of professional applications. That's largely thanks to having 56% more memory bandwidth, courtesy of GDDR7, though other architectural upgrades and slightly increased core counts also factor into things.

The real kicker is the price. Unless you're lucky enough to find an RTX 4060 Ti 16GB on a steep discount, the 5060 Ti 16GB costs quite a bit less at popular online retail sites like Newegg and Amazon. Just say no, in other words. Slower performance, missing new features, and a price that's currently 38% higher? Pass. It's also a poor proposition when you look at total system cost (using $750 for the price of the rest of the PC). The 5060 Ti 16GB delivers 24% more performance per dollar than the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB in that case (using MSRPs for both, which benefits the 4060 Ti).

If you're wondering about power use and efficiency, even though the TGP (Total Graphics Power) on the 5060 Ti 16GB is 15W higher on paper, in practice it averaged lower power use in our testing. Power use was 1W higher at 4K ultra (a setting both GPUs struggle with), 5W lower at 1440p ultra, and 8–9 watts lower at 1080p. With 21% higher performance at 4K, that works out to much improved overall efficiency.



Hopefully it goes without saying, but just because the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB offers more performance and costs less than a new 4060 Ti 16GB, that doesn't mean people who already own the prior generation card should be in a rush to upgrade. A 20% performance uplift combined with a few new features might be nice to have, but we generally only recommend upgrading if you can get at least a 50% performance improvement, and doubling performance is often possible if you're upgrading from a card that's a couple of generations old.

Let's also not forget that there are 8GB variants of both GPUs. Again, just say no to such cards. Unless you can score a particularly impressive deal, the lack of VRAM is increasingly becoming a problem for 8GB cards. Sure, older and lighter games can run just fine on such GPUs, but it's the newer games that need faster hardware, and they're having problems. The 4060 Ti 16GB and 8GB offer nearly identical performance in our test suite at 1080p, but the 16GB card pulls ahead by 7% at 1440p, and by 36% at 4K — with the most demanding newer games exceeding those averages. We anticipate the story will be largely the same with the 5060 Ti 8GB.

So there you have it: While the generational gains of the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB over the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB aren't as large as we've seen with prior architectural upgrades, the lack of progress on process nodes and the relatively similar die sizes and transistor counts mean we shouldn't expect 50% performance improvements at the same price going forward. 20% more performance for an ostensibly 14% lower price is about as good as we're likely to see. That's about 40% more performance per dollar, which beats any of the other RTX 50-series GPUs.

 April 24, 2025  

A new study found that 57.6% of patients with psoriasis achieved super responder status with guselkumab, characterised by complete skin clearance at week 20. Bio-naive status and lower comorbidity rates were associated with superior response, with 85% of super responders maintained Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 100 at year 4.

""Our findings highlight the importance of early and targeted intervention in psoriasis treatment. Identifying predictive factors for super-responder status can facilitate individualised therapeutic strategies, ensuring optimal clinical outcomes, promoting prolonged drug survival, and potentially extending dose intervals for selected patients,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Edoardo Mortato, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" Rome, Italy. It was published online on April 16, 2025, in Dermatology and Therapy.

As a retrospective, observational analysis, this study was subject to inherent biases, including variations in patient management across different centres. The use of real-life data, while reflective of clinical practice, lacked the controlled environment of randomised trials, potentially introducing confounding factors.

No funding or sponsorship was received for this study. Several authors reported serving as speakers and/or consultants and having other ties with various sources.

Hi, I'm Dr Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist. 

GLP-1 medications are making headlines for weight management, but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture. The real goal isn't just weight loss; it's long-term success, weight maintenance, and overall health. 

As healthcare providers, we know that medications alone aren't the solution. Sustainable lifestyle strategies are essential whether or not medications are a part of the plan. 

What should we be emphasizing? Key areas to focus on include improving dietary habits, ensuring adequate protein intake, staying hydrated, increasing physical activity, incorporating resistance training, and prioritizing both quantity and quality of sleep.

Weight management isn't about quick fixes. It's about building sustainable habits for long-term success. Let's empower our patients with the right tools. 

Stay informed and stay inspired with me, Dr J.

A 58-year-old woman has a prolonged episode of chest discomfort that resolves by the time she is seen in the emergency department. She is admitted to the hospital. Several hours after admission, her chest pain recurs and is associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath. A 12-lead ECG is obtained. 

The correct diagnosis is sinus rhythm and acute transmural myocardial infarction (Figure 2).

The rhythm is regular at a rate of 90 beats/min. A P wave occurs before each QRS complex (+) with a stable PR interval (0.16 sec). The P wave is positive in leads I, II, aVF, and V4-V6. This is a normal sinus rhythm. 

The QRS complex duration (0.08 sec) and morphology are normal. The axis is normal between 0° and +90° (positive QRS complex in leads I and aVF). 

T waves that are tall and, most importantly, symmetric in leads V2-V5 (┴) are noted. A normal T wave is asymmetric, with a slower upstroke and faster downstroke. In contrast, these T waves are symmetric. This is the first ECG change of an acute transmural ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall. 

These hyper-acute T waves are caused by local hyperkalemia. This develops from the loss of ATPase activity due to lack of oxygen and inability to resynthesize ATP. Loss of the ATPase pump activity disrupts membrane integrity and potassium leaks from the cell. Because there is no blood flow in or out of the infarcted area, the potassium builds up, causing local hyperkalemia. 

The inward leak of sodium activates a sodium-calcium exchange (which is energy independent) that pumps out sodium and pumps in calcium. This causes intracellular hypercalcemia which shortens the ST segment. The QT/QTc intervals are 280/340 msec.

Although retired from clinical practice, he continues to teach clinical cardiology and especially ECGs to medical students, house staff, and cardiology fellows at many major teaching hospitals in Massachusetts.

Medscape 2050: The Future of Medicine

“A community health worker armed with ChatGPT is probably better at diagnosis and therapy than 80% of doctors out there,” says Ashish K. Jha, MD, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and former White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator under President Biden. 

“Not 80% of doctors in America,” Jha clarifies — around the world. That's how transformative he thinks AI is now and will be in the next 25 years.

Does that mean that doctors are no longer needed? Not at all. Jha says each new technology only makes the physician's role more crucial. “The judgment, the caring, the relationship, the commitment that we have to our patients — no AI system is going to replace that.”

But by 2050, Jha predicts that the physician's role will change. Doctors must adapt as part of a broad healthcare delivery transformation that, he thinks, is long overdue. It's time to end our 1950's-style hospital models, Jha says, and shift toward more ambulatory and home-based care, using sensors, telemedicine, and AI.

“We have entered an age of biology where we are going to see more outbreaks, pandemics, and biosecurity threats. That is inevitable,” he says. Governments need to use the lessons of COVID-19 and invest in preparedness, “so that when the next thing hits us, it doesn't flatten us or shut down society or kill millions of people. All of that is avoidable if we do our job.”

Heterogeneous escalation of radiotherapy dose guided by imaging in locally advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) does not increase early toxicity, a new trial found.

“Patients with [locally advanced] NSCLC can have radiotherapy dose escalation safely performed using mid-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and strict adherence to normal tissue dosimetry. This approach was piloted in the randomized phase 3 Scandinavian NARLAL2 trial that documented improved locoregional control…Whether this approach impacts overall survival now needs to be tested in patients who also receive consolidative immunotherapy,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Tine Schytte, PhD, and Marianne M. Knap, PhD, from Odense University Hospital in Odense, Denmark. It was published online on April 18 in Journal of Clinical Oncology.

This study approach depends on additional mid-treatment PET scans and requires rapid planning turnaround, which may present logistical challenges in implementation. The authors noted that while previous studies showed no increased toxicity with fluorodeoxyglucose PET–driven adaptive dose escalation, those studies had relatively modest dose escalation levels compared with this trial.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I want to briefly discuss a very provocative, important topic related to secondary cancer prevention. This was a paper published in Nature Medicine, entitled, “Supervised, Structured and Individualized Exercise in Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.”

We all know exercise is important. It's certainly important to help one's sense of well-being and cardiovascular illness, and there are population-based data that suggest individuals who exercise and have cancer might have a lower risk of developing recurrence. 

This particular analysis, however, was based on a randomized controlled trial. This study looked at 357 patients with metastatic breast cancer and a life expectancy of 6 months or greater without, as they described, unstable bone metastases. Obviously, we're not talking about a population that would have a risk of having a negative outcome because of bone metastases.

They were recruited at eight study centers across five European countries and Australia. The participants were randomized one-to-one to usual care, where 179 patients would exercise as they chose to, vs a 9-month supervised exercise program, and that was for 178 patients. Again, this is a reasonable patient population that was randomized and, we assume, appropriately stratified for various aspects of the illness. 

The bottom line was that there was a highly statistically significant difference, comparing change from baseline to 3 months, 6 months (which was the primary endpoint), and 9 months among the groups in terms of significant positive effects on physical fatigue as well as measured quality of life. 

Again, this was a randomized controlled trial, so it's as good as we can get in terms of these comparisons. We're not talking about improvement in risk for recurrence here; that's very hard to measure. We're not talking about survival, but quality of life and fatigue, which are very important issues in the metastatic setting and in breast cancer, absolutely.

These are firm data suggesting that a relatively low-cost intervention can have an impact on the quality of life and measured evidence of fatigue. 

This was a very interesting paper and analysis that I think should be discussed by the clinical oncology community, as to how we can use more of these kinds of strategies to positively impact our patients we're treating for cancer.

I thank you for your attention.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Social prescribing has gained traction across Canada, integrating healthcare, social services, and community support to benefit patients and lighten clinicians' loads, according to a new report.

“Clinicians often face constraints on time, resources, or the support needed to fully address nonmedical drivers of health,” Srija Biswas, project manager at the Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing, which produced the report, told Medscape Medical News. “Social prescribing offers a timely, practical response to this growing crisis.”

More than 80% of a patient's health depends on social determinants like adequate food, housing, income, and relationships with others, according to the report. As a formal referral pathway, social prescribing enables healthcare providers to direct their patients to community-based supports and services with the help of a dedicated liaison.

At its core, Biswas said, social prescribing “reframes care to include questions like ‘What matters to you?' It links people to resources such as social supports, financial counseling, housing services, and recreational activities that reflect their needs, goals, and values.”

Link workers or community connectors are a linchpin of social prescribing. These members of the community have a deep understanding of community resources and undergo specific training that enables them to work with patients who are referred to them.

“Physicians remain the trusted access point, while link workers take on the time-intensive role of walking alongside patients to address their broader life circumstances,” Biswas explained. “Clinicians can embed social prescribing into practice by simply integrating a few key questions about life circumstances into intake or check-ins and making a warm referral to a designated community partner.”

Grace Park, MD, a family physician and regional medical director for Home and Community Care at the Fraser Health Authority in British Columbia, said that when she embarked on her practice, she “learned quickly that family physicians are not well equipped to delve into the social context of an individual to address the social determinants of health.” She gave an example of a patient with diabetes with whom she was working, with little success, to keep the disease under control.

“After many meetings and follow-up bloodwork, the patient finally said to me, ‘I don't have enough money to buy the healthy diet you recommend.' That really got to the core of the problem and raised my awareness,” Park said. “If someone can't afford to buy food you know is good for them or can't pay for dental work that will enable them to chew their food properly, that will affect how they're able, or not able, to follow the directions a doctor is giving them.”

In another example, Park recalled a man in his early 60s who was being treated by another practitioner in the health system. The man came into the office because he was feeling “down” and said he didn't have much social activity. The practitioner ultimately made a referral to social prescribing.

“The community connector met with this patient, and instead of saying, ‘Why are you depressed?' she asked, ‘What's the most important thing in your life? What matters to you most?'” It turned out that the man was going to be homeless because his landlord was raising the rent, and he couldn't find alternative housing.

“None of that came out in the discussion with the primary care practitioner, who was only focused on medication,” Park explained. Once the community connector identified a subsidized housing apartment for the man, he revealed that he used to be a musician, and being able to play the guitar again would bring him joy.

“Together, they created a program where older adults from the community organization where the community connector was working could share their music, poetry, and art,” Park said. The ongoing program is led by the patient, whose depression ultimately subsided.

Yet even when clinicians are sensitive to some of the social issues that make patients vulnerable, many are not aware of the supports in the community and the network that's available for them, Park noted. For this reason, she worked with Fraser Health Authority to develop a scheme that makes social prescribing easily available to practitioners. She believes that this scheme is the “first in the country where the health system is fully integrated with the community organizations that provide the social prescribing services.”

Gary Bloch, MD, a family physician with St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, also advocates for social prescribing. The academic hospital and medical center have been addressing social needs alongside physical and mental health needs for more than a decade, he told Medscape Medical News. Members of the healthcare team were referring patients informally until a couple of years ago, when a specific social prescribing program was created.

“Our program targets socially marginalized, low-income older adults who live in our neighborhood,” Bloch said. “It gives us the ability to work in a deep way with those who have high social needs around isolation and other social determinants of health.”

As at Fraser Health Authority, link workers at St. Michael's are hired from within the community. Generally, those workers “will spend at least an hour sitting and speaking with their clients, trying to get a sense of what their lives are like, and then slowly building out what their needs are and what they would like to focus on as priorities,” Bloch explained. Food insecurity is one of the top issues, he said, though poverty, housing insecurity, and the desire for more access to social programs are also areas of concern.

“The work that is done by our link workers is not something clinicians can do themselves,” he continued. “It requires someone who is specifically focused on that type of relationship building and has that type of expertise on the ground.”

But what clinicians do need to do is “shift their outlook and create space within what they're doing for patients to think about this realm of healthcare,” he said. “Screening patients about their social needs and then linking them up with community resources needs to be built into the way we practice.”

Park is convinced that clinicians who aren't pursuing social prescribing “are missing out on the ability to set their patients up for success in their health journeys and to also take advantage of the rich resources and networks that are available in a person's community. If you're able to provide these supports,” she said, “the patients can live normal, healthier lives and reduce some of the barriers that get in the way of doing the right things.”

For example, many older adults who would benefit from exercise programs don't know how to access them, she explained. Link workers from the community can help by finding nearby programs.

In addition, organizations such as United Way also actively support social prescribing. Its Better at Home program helps older adults stay independent and live in the community by providing services such as grocery shopping, shoveling snow, and transportation to doctor's appointments.

St. Michael's is creating a community asset map: A detailed guide to community resources that are available to older adults. “Some resources, such as senior centers, are obvious,” Bloch said. “Others might be much smaller groups or individuals: For example, one or two people running a business that provides cleaning support to seniors. Now everyone on the health team knows about these providers and how to connect with them.

“This is the way of the future for healthcare, certainly for primary care,” he continued. “We've known about the link between social health and physical and mental health for eons. We now have ways to address this, and these ways are becoming increasingly popular. I would be surprised if this doesn't emerge as just a normal part of primary care practice over the next few years.”

Park added, “If we can leverage what's available in the community and use our community connectors, then we're increasing the ability to keep our patients well, increasing the reach of health systems, and reducing the burden on those systems to ensure that they are available for people when they really need them.”

The Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing provides resources for clinicians and community members who want to learn more about this model.

Biswas, Park, and Bloch reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Low-grade systemic inflammation, indicated by elevated levels of systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), was associated with a higher risk of developing psoriasis in a large cohort study.

“We found that low-grade systemic inflammation, measured as SII, NLR, and CRP, is an independent risk factor for psoriasis, especially moderate to severe disease,” authors of the study concluded. “These results support the hypothesis that low-grade systemic inflammation might be a contributing factor in the development of psoriasis. However, the potential clinical utility of SII, NLR, and CRP in prediction, prevention, or modulation of the disease requires further study,” they added.

The study was led by Charlotte Näslund-Koch, MD, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on April 18, 2025, in the British Journal of Dermatology.

Psoriasis diagnoses were limited to hospital-treated cases. Biomarker levels were assessed only at baseline. Additionally, with a median participant age of 58 years, these findings might have limited generalizability to early-onset disease.

The study received support from the Capital Region of Denmark's Research Fund. Näslund-Koch disclosed serving as an investigator for Galderma, AbbVie, LEO Pharma, Novartis, and CSL Behring. Another author reported receiving research funding and having other ties with various sources. The other authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Despite increased participation in long-distance running races in the United States, the rate of cardiac arrests among runners remains stable, but survival has improved dramatically, according to the RACER 2 study.

Almost 30 million people who finished a marathon or half-marathon between 2010 and 2023 were identified for the study, conducted by Jonathan Kim, MD, cardiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, and his colleagues. In their RACER 1 study, the team assessed cardiac arrests in roughly 10 million people who finished a marathon from 2000 to 2009.

So with race participation almost tripling over the past two decades, changes in runner demographics, and improved emergency action plans, the team decided it was time to revisit the issue, Kim explained during his presentation of the RACER 2 results at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Session 2025 in Chicago, which were simultaneously published in JAMA.

In both studies, the incidence of cardiac arrest was about the same: Roughly one in 200,000 people. But the fatality rate decreased significantly between RACER 1 and RACER 2, from 71% to just 34%. In RACER 2, the risk for death in men was about one in 100,000. For women, the risk is much lower, at about one in 500,000. Risk was also higher in full marathons than in half-marathons.

Over the years, “the incidence of cardiac arrest has remained relatively stable, apart from a slight unexplained rise after 2020, but despite that, the risk for death has markedly declined, by close to 50%. We believe this is due to continued enhancements in the emergency action plans,” which are focused on immediate access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), said Kim.

In RACER 1, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was the biggest predictor of survival, but just 58% of runners received it. In RACER 2, that had risen to 100%, and race organizers were ensuring access to more AEDs. In RACER 1, the highest risk for a cardiac arrest was at the end of the race, so by the time RACER 2 was conducted, organizers had learned to strategically position more defibrillators near the finish line.

This highlights the importance of preparation and training for race organizers, said Benjamin Levine, MD, sports cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, which is a major take-home message of the recent scientific statement on the care of competitive athletes with cardiac abnormalities, issued jointly by the ACC and the American Heart Association, which both he and Kim worked on.

“All of us in the sports cardiology world want to prevent death, but you can't do it with screening alone,” Levine explained. “If you want to prevent deaths in sports, you've got to have an emergency action plan, you've got to have an AED, and you have to practice with it.”

Over time, there has also been a change in the causes of cardiac arrests, when they were identified. In RACER 1, the most common cause was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whereas in RACER 2, coronary artery disease took the top spot.

The reason for that change is unclear and should be taken with a grain of salt, given that good clinical information was not available for all of the incidents. “Nevertheless, I think the etiology has shifted in recent decades,” said Levine. And although coronary artery disease was the most common cause of death in RACER 2, it is also the cardiac arrest with the highest survival rate.

The risk is there, but incidents remain rare, and there is a lot that runners can do to reduce their own risk.

“For older runners, in particular, it's important to pay attention to symptoms and ensure your risk factors are as much under control as possible,” Levine said. “And discuss it with your doctor if your personal risk is higher.”

Kim and Levine had no disclosures to report.

Islet transplantation offered significant benefits in reducing mortality and other complications in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) over a median follow-up duration exceeding 10 years. The procedure's long-term safety profile revealed no increased risk for cancer despite the use of immunosuppressive therapy.

""The insights gleaned from this study contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive impact of IT [islet transplantation] on long-term patient outcomes,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Quentin Perrier and Clément Jambon-Barbara, Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, Grenoble, France. It was published online on April 17, 2025, in Diabetes Care.

The control group, while comprehensive, lacked key variables, including metabolic data, laboratory results, and sociodemographic information.The study cohorts were small, with fewer than 100 patients in experimental groups. Patients were not matched on the basis of their cancer history, so the findings of the secondary outcome should be interpreted with caution.

If you have never asked if you can pray for a patient, you might be in the minority.

In a recent Medscape column, Andrew N. Wilner, MD, related the story of a physician offering to pray for his wife at the conclusion of a routine visit. She had no previous relationship with the clinician and only a minor complaint. Wilner found the physician's action disturbing and wrote in his column that while there might be situations where prayer would be appropriate, his wife's visit did not fit in that category.

Some readers took issue with Wilner's response.

“I don't see how your spouse's provider was out of line,” said one physician commenter, adding that he saw it “as an offer of generosity.” He added that medicine is more than just science and that “prayer offers us humility, and without humility in this profession we will fail.”

Another doctor said, “There were times that I sensed a patient desired more support than what I could medically give,” and that he would often “request permission to pray for them at the end of a visit.” Most patients were grateful that he considered their spiritual needs, he wrote.

In response to a Medscape Medical News poll accompanying Wilner's column, half of the more than 2000 respondents said they had offered to pray for a patient. More than half — 56% — said they believed it was appropriate for a physician to ask to pray for a patient, but only if the patient is terminal and religious. Another 10% said it was appropriate solely if the patient was religious, and an additional 4% said they would consider it appropriate if a patient was dying imminently. Just under one third said they did not think it was ever appropriate.

Wilner said he was surprised that half of clinicians polled said they'd offered to pray. He told Medscape Medical News that in his training across the United States and internationally, “I had never seen a doctor offer to pray for a patient,” although he has on occasion joined a family's prayers when invited.

The physician who offered to pray for his wife did so in a very well-meaning manner, said Wilner. But Wilner was not swayed by commenters who felt it was appropriate. His gut feeling, backed up by additional research and discussions with an ethicist, was that his wife's physician acted inappropriately. The doctor did not have any prior knowledge of or interactions with his wife, she did not have a grave illness, and she was not in a good position to refuse the prayer because it was an asymmetric relationship, said Wilner.

He thinks there are a lot of considerations to weigh before a doctor should ask. “Prayer is very personal, and religious beliefs are very, very personal,” said Wilner, adding that “For some people, they're profound.”

Others might be agnostic, and it is not likely possible to know all of this if there is no prior patient-doctor relationship, said Wilner.

“I don't think [prayer] should be out of hand dismissed as categorically inappropriate,” said Benjamin Frush, MD, a postdoctoral research fellow in the McDonald Agape bioethics fellowship at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University, Washington, DC. But he told Medscape Medical News, “It has to be something that's done thoughtfully, carefully, and respectfully” and should “seek to avoid any degree of perceived coercion or over-proselytizing.”

Context is key, he said. Frush identifies as a religious clinician but said that if he has a routine interaction with a patient who is not gravely ill and with whom he does not have a prior relationship, “I would not think those circumstances conducive to necessarily engaging in prayer, as a matter of course,” he said.

Frush said that on the very few occasions he had prayed with a patient, however, “it seems like it's accepted as something that's either benign or well-received.”

Ronald W. Pies, MD, professor emeritus of psychiatry and lecturer on bioethics and humanities, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, is the ethicist Wilner consulted about his wife's case. Pies said that given that the doctor did not know the patient or her religious beliefs, “it was somewhat presumptuous” for the clinician to have asked to pray for her.

He raised a potential harm, also. “Even if the physician minimizes the seriousness of the patient's condition, some patients might be a bit unnerved by the offer — wondering, in effect, ‘What's this doctor not telling me about my condition? Am I in serious trouble?'” he wrote to Medscape Medical News.

Pies wrote that he had “real doubts about the ethics of what this physician did,” but he did not think “that she acted improperly or unethically.”

Some readers also had doubts.

“I would have zero confidence in a physician who believes in their magic sky wizard instead of mine,” commented one doctor. “Praying for someone is like self-stimulation while thinking of someone. It makes the person praying feel good but does nothing for the person they are thinking about.”

Another commenter said, “I don't go to religious leaders for medical care, and I don't go to medical providers for spiritual care.”

Religious clinician and ethicist Frush agreed that patients don't “primarily come to physicians seeking spiritual care.” That doesn't prevent a clinician “from attending to the spiritual components of patients they care for,” he said. But he added that “by praying with the patient, as a physician, you're presuming to be a spiritual expert.”

Offering to pray “presumes that I have some authority as a prayer person that this is going to do the patient some extra good,” agreed Wilner.

Some readers commented that they pray, but privately, and suggested that it could and should be done privately. A nurse said that healthcare professionals can pray “without announcing or making a show of it, quietly, in our own hearts.” She added, “Praying with or over a patient should occur only at the patient's request.”

Another physician said professionals could privately pray “that you offer the best care.”

Many commenters lauded the doctor in Wilner's example for having “asked permission” to pray first, while at least one said that Wilner's wife could have refused.

But both Wilner and Frush noted the power dynamic between doctor and patient. “A physician has a degree of power, based on his or her expertise,” said Frush. “The physician needs to be incredibly thoughtful and certainly never seek to abuse or coerce that to their advantage,” he said.

He also suggested making use of a hospital chaplain when a prayer might seem appropriate, at least in the inpatient setting. They have training and a kind of cultural competency that is not typically in the physician's toolbox, said Frush.

“My role is to help the patient, and whether I'm religious or not religious, or the same faith of the patient, I think that's very secondary to the patient's needs,” said Wilner. But, he said, “If a patient approached me and said, ‘Dr Wilner, will you pray with me?' I would say, absolutely, yes.”

 April 24, 2025  

Past-month binge drinking between 2021 and 2023 was higher among young adult women than among men, reversing a recent period. However, men still drank more heavily than women overall.

“Given rising alcohol-related liver disease and mortality among females relative to males, clinicians should ensure that young adult female populations are being appropriately screened for binge and heavy drinking to mitigate downstream alcohol-related health impacts,” authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Bryant Shuey, MD, MPH, of the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh. It was published online on April 16, 2025, in JAMA.

This study relied on self-reported accounts of drinking. The introduction of web-based surveys in 2020 restricted comparisons between the 2017 and 2019 and 2021 and 2023 periods. Additionally, the assumption that methodological changes did not differentially affect estimates between genders may have limited the study's conclusions.

This study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Three authors reported receiving grants, and one author reported receiving personal fees outside the submitted work.

Having a larger waistline, high blood pressure and other risk factors that make up metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, according to a study published on April 23, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Young-onset dementia is diagnosed before the age of 65. The study does not prove that metabolic syndrome causes young-onset dementia, it only shows an association.

Metabolic syndrome is defined as having excess belly fat plus two or more of the following risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, higher than normal triglycerides, which are a type of fat found in the blood, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or ""good"" cholesterol.

While most dementia is diagnosed in older age, young-onset dementia occurs while a person is still working and perhaps raising a family. Our study found having metabolic syndrome in middle age is a risk factor for young-onset dementia.""

Minwoo Lee, MD, PhD, study author of Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in Anyang, South Korea

For the study, researchers reviewed national health insurance data in South Korea to identify nearly two million people between the ages of 40 and 60 who had a health check-up. The check-up included measurements of waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Of all participants, 25% had metabolic syndrome.

Over an average follow-up period of eight years, 8,921 people, or 0.45% of all participants, developed dementia. For those with metabolic syndrome, the incidence rate was 0.86 cases per 1,000 person-years, compared to 0.49 cases for those without metabolic syndrome. Person-years represent both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study.

After adjusting for age, education and health factors such as level of physical activity, depression and stroke, researchers found metabolic syndrome was associated with a 24% higher risk of dementia. When looking at specific types of dementia, it was associated with a 12% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and a 21% increased risk of vascular dementia.

Researchers found female participants with metabolic syndrome had a 34% increased risk of dementia compared to male participants who had a 15% increased risk. People in their 40s had a greater risk than people in their 50s.

Researchers found each component of metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of dementia, which was cumulative. People with all five components had a 70% increased risk of dementia.

""Our findings suggest that lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and reducing stress, may help reduce the risk of young-onset dementia,"" said Lee. ""Future research that follows people over longer periods of time and uses brain scans to look for biomarkers of dementia is needed to confirm and expand upon our findings.""

A limitation of the study was that researchers did not review genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.

The study was supported by the Korean National Research Foundation.

New evidence highlights how the Mediterranean diet's anti-inflammatory nutrients, like extra-virgin olive oil and omega-3-rich fish, can help manage both joint and thyroid autoimmune disorders, offering a low-cost lifestyle intervention with clinical benefits.

 Study: Unlocking the Power of the Mediterranean Diet: Two in One—Dual Benefits for Rheumatic and Thyroid Autoimmune Diseases. Image Credit: monticello / Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in the journal  Nutrients reviews the effects of the Mediterranean diet (MD) on both systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders, particularly rheumatic and thyroid diseases.

Autoimmune diseases are systemic or organ-specific diseases that are associated with the development of anomalous immune responses against self-antigens. Systemic autoimmune diseases may include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), seronegative spondyloarthritis (SpA), and autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs), whereas Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and Graves' disease (GD) are considered organ-specific diseases.

Autoimmune diseases are triggered by genetic and environmental factors that activate the immune system through various mechanisms, including the production of interferon type I, molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, post-translational modification of proteins, or the presentation of superantigens.

T- and B-lymphocytes are involved in the manifestation of autoimmune diseases, as demonstrated by the synthesis of autoantibodies against self-antigens. Non-immune cells, such as epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblast cells, also damage tissues through the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The MD is rich in fiber, olive oil, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and vegetables, as well as a moderate intake of fish, poultry, and wine. In comparison to Western dietary habits, the MD recommends a moderate consumption of red meat, processed foods, and refined sugar.

Previous studies have highlighted the potential of MD in modulating inflammation due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The MD has also been shown to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which exerts anti-inflammatory effects.

Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of various MD components on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic widespread arthritis (CTD), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and autoimmune thyroiditis. Moreover, the intake of oily fish rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as various fruits and vegetables containing different classes of bioactive compounds, has been shown to mitigate the effects of certain autoimmune diseases.

The high intake of fiber enhances the proliferation of fermenting bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate. Multiple studies have confirmed the anti-inflammatory properties of SCFAs and their ability to alleviate oxidative stress and chemotaxis of immune cells by enhancing the number of Treg cells and the release of interleukin-10 (IL-10).

Furthermore, a recent clinical trial also revealed that ω-3 PUFA supplementation could positively impact the progression of RA by suppressing the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, modulating T-cell differentiation, and reducing the production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by neutrophils.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) contains a wide range of bioactive compounds, such as carotenoids, phenolics, sterols, and triterpenic alcohols. Several preclinical studies have investigated the potential anti-inflammatory properties of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) and its components.

For example, oleocanthal (OL), a typical phenolic component of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), exhibits preventive effects against rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Likewise, a mouse model of pristane-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) showed that EVOO consumption inhibited the release of nitric oxide (NO) and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) recently reported that individuals who consume a pro-inflammatory diet had higher levels of total T4 and total T3. Similarly, HT patients adhering to an anti-inflammatory diet exhibited lower TSH levels, higher free T4 levels, and lower body mass index (BMI) values. Higher adherence to MD also improved thyroid autoimmunity and related dysfunction.

Recently, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) revealed that patients with RA who underwent the MD intervention for 12 weeks exhibited a significant reduction in their disease activity score on 28 joints (DAS28) compared to controls. These patients also experienced improvements in cardiometabolic parameters, including body composition, body weight, blood glucose levels, and plasma vitamin D levels.

Encouraging adherence to the MD could serve as an effective, cost-efficient lifestyle approach to reduce the burden of autoimmune disorders in modern societies.”

The synergistic effect of individual MD components may be sufficient to mitigate the inflammatory processes that occur during autoimmune conditions, thus supporting the incorporation of this dietary approach into the management of autoimmune diseases and their complications. In vitro and in vivo studies, along with clinical trial data, have confirmed the potential of MD as a complementary tool for managing rheumatic and thyroid autoimmune diseases; however, combining MD with exercise has the potential to provide more robust and durable improvements.

Millions of people worldwide are affected by African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and other life-threatening infections caused by microscopic parasites borne by insects such as the tsetse fly.

Each of the underlying single-celled parasites - Trypanosoma brucei and its relatives - has one flagellum, a whiplike appendage that is essential for moving, infecting hosts and surviving in different environments.

Now, a research team at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA, or CNSI, has applied leading-edge atomic imaging and AI-driven modeling to create the most detailed 3D map yet of the flagellum on Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness. The study, published in the journal Science, identified 154 different proteins that make up the flagellum, including 40 that are unique to the parasite.

By capturing the molecular motors that drive the parasite's movement during a key transitional state, the investigators developed a new model for how they swim through blood and tissue. The findings shed light on a critical mechanism essential to Trypanosoma brucei's survival, transmission to hosts and disease processes. This detailed view of the parasite's flagella could help drive progress in treating the illness they cause.

Our study provides a complete molecular blueprint of the flagellum's structural framework, explaining how its movement is powered at an atomic level. By leveraging AI-driven structural modeling, we uncovered unique parasite-specific proteins that contribute to flagellar architecture and function.""

Z. Hong Zhou, co-corresponding authorprofessor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the UCLA College and founding director of CNSI's Electron Imaging Center for Nanosystems, or EICN

The imaging technique used in the study was cryogenic-electron microscopy, or cryoEM, in which frozen biological samples are probed with electrons to reveal details impossible to capture with visible light. Maps generated with cryoEM received further analysis using artificial intelligence tools, such as an algorithm for predicting a protein's shape based on the amino acids that make it up.

The scientists found that tiny motor-like structures in the microbe's flagellum create motion by acting in a coordinated fashion, similar to the way rowers in a dragon boat synchronize their strokes to move through water.

""Trypanosomes have evolved specialized motion to survive in both the tsetse fly and the human bloodstream, making their flagellum a central feature of their biology,"" said co-corresponding author Kent Hill, a UCLA professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and a CNSI member. ""By understanding how their unique structural features contribute to movement, we gain insight into fundamental aspects of parasite adaptation and host interactions.""

Sleeping sickness initially manifests as fever, headaches, joint pain and itching. After the parasite reaches the central nervous system, the disease can progress to spur severe neurological symptoms.

The study may provide potential targets for therapies that effectively eliminate the parasite or block its transmission to humans, as well as give clues about how to address illnesses caused by other related microbes.

Beyond medical treatment, the insights into an understudied microbe could have impacts such as elucidating details of earlier stages in evolution and inspiring engineers who borrow from nature to inform their designs.

The study's first author is Xian Xia, a former postdoctoral researcher and recently promoted project scientist at UCLA. Other coauthors are Michelle Shimogawa, Hui Wang, Samuel Liu, Angeline Wijono, Gerasimos Langousis, Ahmad Kassem and James Wohlschlegel, all of UCLA.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, with data collection and processing carried out at the EICN.

An Italian study challenges the ""white meat is safer"" notion, showing that high poultry consumption, over 300 g weekly, may double gastrointestinal cancer death risk, particularly among men.

 Study: Does Poultry Consumption Increase the Risk of Mortality for Gastrointestinal Cancers? A Preliminary Competing Risk Analysis. Image Credit: stockcreations / Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers investigated the relationship between consuming poultry meat and the incidence of gastrointestinal cancers (GCs) and other causes of mortality.

According to the 2013 Instituto di Servizi per il Mercato Agricolo Alimentare (ISMEA) report, conducted in Italy, weekly poultry consumption was estimated to be 13.3 kg per capita worldwide. Rising rates of poultry consumption have also been reported in Italy over the past decade, increasing from 11.7 kg per capita to the current rate of 12.7 kg per capita.

Poultry is a broad term that encompasses all forms of birds, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guineas, and game birds such as quail and pheasants. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends 100 g as a standard portion for poultry that can be consumed between one and three times each week.

Compared to meat from other sources, poultry is typically lower in fat content. However, widespread industrial processing of poultry products has reduced their nutritional value by adding sodium, saturated fat, sugar, and preservatives into these foods. In fact, current estimates indicate that 26% of the poultry products are processed in the form of hamburger meat, kebabs, rolls, and bites.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer has defined meat as carcinogenic to humans, with red meat probably carcinogenic to humans. Existing evidence indicates that the association between meat consumption and cancer risk is primarily attributed to the intake of red and processed meat. However, it remains unclear whether consuming white meat may also increase the risk of cancer, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract.  

A total of 4,869 participants from the MICOL and NUTRIHEP study cohorts were included in the current analysis. Food and beverage consumption was recorded using the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer (EPIC) Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).

Total meat consumption was stratified by weekly increments of 100 g, from less than 200 g to over 400 g every week. Red meat included lamb, pig, calf, and horse meat, whereas rabbit and poultry were considered white meat.

Red meat consumption was classified by 50 g increments, ranging from less than 150 g to over 350 g per week. Poultry consumption was stratified by 100 g increments, ranging from less than 100 g to over 300 g, every week.

The mean age of the survivors was 66 years, whereas 21% of the cohort died by the end of the study period. The overall mean age at death was 81 years, with men and women dying at a mean of 80 and 83 years, respectively.

GCs accounted for 11% of deaths, most of which were due to colorectal cancer (CRC), whereas 18% of individuals died due to other cancers. The remaining deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia.

Among individuals who died of non-GC cancers, red meat accounted for over 65% of their total meat intake as compared to 56% and 58% among those who died of GC and other causes, respectively. White meat consumption was highest among those who died of GC, with poultry intake accounting for 33% of their white meat intake.

About 56% of cancer-related deaths occurred in individuals who consumed over 400 g of meat every week, largely as part of the Mediterranean diet. Study participants who died of other causes reported total meat intake in the second-highest category.

High red meat consumption was also associated with non-GC cancer deaths. In contrast, a weekly meat intake of 200-300 g was associated with an overall 20% reduced mortality risk from all causes, with this risk further reduced to 27% among men. Study participants who consumed 150-250 g of red meat every week were 29% less likely to die from all causes.

White meat consumption, specifically poultry, correlated with GC deaths. Mortality from all causes rose by 27% among those who consumed over 300 g of poultry weekly, with this risk particularly high at 61% among men. Deaths from other causes and cancers were associated with lower levels of poultry consumption. 

Consuming 100-200 g of poultry weekly was associated with a 65% increased risk of dying from GC, as compared to other cancers, which was dose-dependent. Individuals who consumed over 300 g of poultry every week were 127% more likely to die from GC, with this risk even greater at 161% among men.

Compared to other risks, GC mortality was 54% less likely among those who consumed between 200 and 300 g of total meat weekly, as compared to those who consumed more than 200 g. This risk reduction was particularly evident among men, at a rate of 68%.

Poultry consumption above 300 g/week is associated with a statistically significant increased mortality risk both from all causes and from GCs.”

Future studies are needed to validate these findings and elucidate the role of processed poultry in the increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer-related mortality.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT Rewind: Josh Sargent and Nine Others Score Goals in Busy Weekend","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/04/usmnt-rewind-josh-sargent-score-goals-premier-league-ligue-1-serie-a-mls","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:54:35 GMT","

In what was quite a prolific week for U.S. Men's National Team pool players, it was difficult to keep up with those who were either filling the net or setting up teammates for their respective sides.

Ten players scored goals on both sides of the Atlantic. The list boasted Josh Sargent (Norwich City) , Paxten Aaronson (FC Utrecht), Gianluca Busio (Venezia), Jordan Pefok (Reims) and Tanner Tessmann (Lyon) in Europe, and Brandon Vazquez (Austin FC), Ben Cremaschi (Inter Miami), Djordje Mihailovic (Colorado Rapids), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC) and Brian Gutiérrez (Chicago Fire) in Major League Soccer. Pefok, Tessmann and Cremaschi tallied their first goals of the season.

Mihailovic also recorded an assist. Alejandro Zendejas and Jesús Ferreira each contributed two of their own, while Kevin Paredes and Marlon Fossey had one apiece.

In addition, goalkeeper Sean Johnson earned his second consecutive clean sheet of the season for Toronto FC.

Josh Sargent scored his 15th goal of the English Championship season for Norwich City but was forced out of a 5-3 home loss to Portsmouth with a shoulder injury at halftime on Friday, April 18. The 25-year-old striker slotted home a rebound to knot things up at 1-1 in the 21st minute. Despite missing two months of the season, Sargent is tied for second in goals in the league with Leeds United's Joel Piroe, behind teammate Borja Sainz (17). The Canaries (13-14-17, 53 points), who have won only twice in their past dozen contests and have fallen into 14th place, have dropped out of contention for the promotion playoffs.

Paxten Aaronson put the exclamation point on Utrecht's 4-0 triumph over first-place Ajax in the Dutch Eredivisie on Sunday, April 20. The 21-year-old midfielder scored the hosts' final goal, drilling a 20-yard shot past Brazilian keeper Matheus in the 85th minute, his seventh tally of the campaign. Utrecht (17-5-8, 59) is in fourth place, trailing Ajax (23-3-4, 73) by 14 points.

Forward Jordan Pefok's first goal of the French Ligue 1 season was all Reims needed in its 1-0 victory over 10-man Toulouse on Sunday, April 20. Injuries have kept Pefok sidelined for a good portion of the season before he headed home Sergio Akieme's cross in the 39th minute. Toulouse was forced to play a man down for the final 63 minutes after USMNT defender Mark McKenzie was red carded in the 27th minute.

As it turned out, McKenzie was one of three U.S. players who were awarded red cards over the weekend. The others were Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna in a 1-0 loss to Toronto FC and Crystal Palace's Chris Richards (two yellow cards) in a 0-0 tie with AFC Bournemouth. Luna's red card was ultimately rescinded by the MLS Disciplinary Committee.

Reims (8-14-8, 32) sits in 13th place, five points above the relegation zone.

Gianluca Busio tallied his second goal of the Italian Serie A season for Venezia in its 2-2 draw at Empoli on Sunday, April 20. The midfielder gave the visitors the lead in the 85th minute, but Empoli equalized two minutes later. Busio also scored in a 2-0 victory over Genoa on Sept. 21. Venezia (4-16-13, 25) is in 18th place out of 20 teams and in the relegation zone to Serie B. The club trails Lecce (6-19-8, 26), which is in the safety zone.

Alejandro Zendejas registered a pair of assists and drew a penalty kick in Club America's 5-0 romp over Mazatlán in the Liga MX Clausura on Saturday, April 19. Twice he combined with Álvaro Fidalgo, first in the 13th minute, which gave the home side a 2-0 lead, and then for the team's fourth goal in the 58th minute. He was also fouled to set up Victor Davila's 51st-minute penalty kick. Zendejas has five goals and seven assists this season.

Club America (10-3-4, 34) completed the Clausura — the second half of the split season — in second place behind Toluca (11-2-4, 37). The team qualified for the playoffs and because it was among the top six teams, it will begin its postseason run in the quarterfinals. America won the first-half title and is scheduled to play away in the first leg on May 6 and host the second leg on May 9.

It appeared that Brandon Vazquez was going to be the goat-of-the-game when LA Galaxy goalkeeper John McCarthy saved his 67th-minute penalty kick. But the Austin FC forward made up for the miss not 15 minutes later by scoring the lone goal in a 1-0 home win on Saturday, April 19. Vazquez pushed home a deflection off an Owen Wolfe pass from the right flank for his second tally of the campaign. Second-place Austin FC (5-3-1, 16) is four points behind the Vancouver Whitecaps (6-1-2, 20) in the MLS Western Conference.

Some nice timing by Ben Cremaschi as his first goal of the season boosted Inter Miami CF to a 1-0 road triumph over the Columbus Crew in a game played in Cleveland, Ohio in a battle of the last two MLS unbeaten squads on Saturday, April 19. The midfielder headed home Marcelo Weigandt's right-wing cross from six yards in the 30th minute past goalkeeper Pat Schulte. Luis Suárez started the sequence with a long pass to Weigandt on the right side. Miami (5-0-3, 18) is in third place and the Crew (5-1-3, 18) in fourth in the MLS Eastern Conference. Miami has a better goal differential (plus seven, to plus five).

Djordje Mihailovic continued his hot start to the MLS campaign as he had a hand in both of the Colorado Rapids' goals, scoring one and setting up another, in a 2-2 draw at the Houston Dynamo on Saturday, April 19. He converted a penalty kick into the lower left corner against goalie Jonathan Bond to equalize at 1-1 in the 58th minute. He fed Rafael Navarro with a perfect lead pass that the Brazilian turned into a goal and a 2-1 edge in the 77th minute before Houston knotted things up in stoppage time. Mihailovic has four goals and two assists in the league, and two goals in the Concacaf Champions Cup. He has helped the Rapids (4-2-3, 15) to fifth place in the MLS Western Conference.

Forward Patrick Agyemang broke a personal, three-game scoreless streak in Charlotte FC's 3-0 home win over San Diego FC on Saturday, April 19. Agyemang converted a penalty kick in the 45th minute past a diving Carlos dos Santos to give Charlotte some breathing room. It was his second goal of the MLS season. The victory boosted Charlotte (6-2-1, 19) to the top of the MLS Eastern Conference.

In a late Lyon comeback attempt, Tanner Tessmann struck for his first goal of the French Ligue 1 campaign in a 2-1 defeat at Saint-Etienne on Sunday, April 20. Tessmann side-footed a Georges Mikautadze feed past goalkeeper Gautier Larsonneur in the 76th minute, cutting the host's lead in half. It was Tessmann's first goal in almost 11 months since recording one in Venezia's 2-1 win over Palermo on May 24, 2024. The game was delayed for 40 minutes after an assistant referee was hit by an object thrown from the stands. Despite the defeat, Lyon (15-9-6, 51) is in sixth place, battling for a spot in Europe next season, while Saint-Etienne (7-16-6, 27) is in 17th place out of 18 teams, trying to climb out of the relegation zone.

Brian Gutiérrez pulled one back in the 85th minute of the Chicago Fire's 3-2 defeat at home to FC Cincinnati on Saturday, April 19. He cut the deficit to one, putting away a penalty kick past goalie Roman Celentano. It was his first goal since his brace in the Fire's 4-2 defeat against Columbus Crew in its season opener on Feb. 22. The Fire (3-3-3, 12) sits in eighth place of the MLS Eastern Conference.

Kevin Paredes celebrated his first start and game of the Bundesliga season by assisting on Wolfsburg's first goal in its 2-2 draw at Mainz on Saturday, April 19. He set up Maximilian Arnold's score in the third minute. Paredes, who played 63 minutes, had not seen any action since he suffered a broken foot in pre-season training in August. His last match was in the USMNT's 4-0 quarterfinal loss to Morocco in the Paris Olympics on Aug. 2. Paredes was on the Wolfsburg bench for the last three games.

Jesús Ferreira has forged a reputation as a goalscorer. Playing with the Seattle Sounders this year, he hasn't found the net quite yet in nine MLS matches but has been setting up teammates for goals. Ferreira recorded two assists in the 3-0 home victory over Nashville SC on Saturday, April 19. He set up Daniel Musovski in the 19th minute for a 1-0 lead and Paul Rothrock for the final score in the 34th minute. Seattle, which is in eighth place in the MLS Western Conference, improved to 3-3-3 and 12 points.

Defender Marlon Fossey set up Dennis Eckert Ayensa's 58th-minute goal in Standard Liege's 1-1 home draw with Westerlo on Saturday, April 19. Standard Liege (10-12-12, 23) is in seventh place in the Belgian Pro League.

Goalkeeper Sean Johnson recorded his second consecutive shutout for Toronto FC in its 1-0 win at Real Salt Lake on Saturday, April 19. Johnson made six saves. He came up big twice in the 70th minute, with two impressive stops in quick succession, frustrating Alexandros Katranis and Braian Ojeda. On March 29, he kept his net empty in a 2-0 home victory against Minnesota United.

Mauricio Pochettino is under fire from former USMNT and current MLS team San Jose Eartquakes coach Bruce Arena, who questioned if the Argentine is the right man to lead the Stars and Stripes.

U.S. Soccer hired Pochettino back in September to develop a talented U.S. men's national team into a real contender ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Despite getting off to a winning start, the Stars and Stripes under the Argentine have once again failed to impress.

The USMNT suffered a shocking 1–0 defeat to Panama in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and then lost a third-place match to Canada just three days later. The two poor results prompted harsh criticism from USMNT greats Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, and now Arena is joining in the conversation surrounding Pochettino's early leadership. 

""You know if you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach,"" Arena said on an episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan & Tim Howard. 

""And I think when you have coaches that don't know our culture, our environment, our players, it's hard. I'm sure our coach is a very good coach, but coaching international football is different than club football, it's a completely different job.""

Pochettino is not the first non-American to coach the USMNT. German Jurgen Klinsmann was in charge of the Stars and Stripes from 2011 to 2016 and led the team to a second-place finish in a group with Germany, Portugal and Ghana at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. There was also Serbian Bora Milutinović, who got the team to the round of 16 at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. 

Pochettino, though, has no previous experience coaching a national team. The 53-year-old spent his entire career coaching at the club level throughout Europe, most notably at Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain.

""And I think when you're a national team coach, you need to know your environment, you need to know the animals you coach, and we're lacking that,"" Arena continued. ""If you're an American coaching the U.S. team, you know the culture, you know the pride and how important the national team is. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it, especially in our country, because we're so different.""

Arena knows what it takes to coach the USMNT on the biggest stage in soccer. The American previously led the USMNT to the quarterfinals at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team's best performance since 1930. It is clear that he, along with plenty of other critics, are unsatisfied with the current state of the USMNT, especially for a squad often heralded as the country's ""golden generation.""

""You ask me if we lacked pride, I'm watching and I'm shocked. I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada,"" Arena said. ""I don't want to be disrespectful. I want them to do great in the World Cup, there's no question about it. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they got to get going.""

Before the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the USMNT must first compete in the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer, where they will hope to put in a better performance than their disappointing Concacaf Nations League campaign.

The team's main goal, though, remains on the 2026 FIFA World Cup, unfolding on home soil.

In his latest View From the Front Row on Substack, FrontRowSoccer.com editor Michael Lewis addresses the importance of the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup for the U.S. men's national team.

After failing in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and third-place match to Panama and Canada, respectively, the U.S. needs to bounce back in the next tournament.

USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said that it was finding the right characters. It is also finding the right character in the players.

The former head coach of the US Men's National Team has openly criticized US Soccer for hiring Mauricio Pochettino as manager. 

Bruce Arena, who coached the USMNT in two separate stints, from 1998-2006 and then again from 2016-2017, thinks the job should have gone to an American manager. Discussing the current state of the team and program with former players Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, Arena made the case that Pochettino, who was born in Argentina, doesn't understand the unique culture and structure of US soccer.

""If you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach,"" Arena said. ""And I think when you have coaches that don't know our culture, our players, our environment, it's hard. And listen, (Pochettino) is a very good coach. (But) coaching international football is completely different than club football.""

""When you are a national team coach, you need to know the animal you are coaching,"" said Arena. ""You need to know the environment. And we're lacking that. If you're an American coaching the U.S. team, you know the culture, the pride and how important the national team is. When you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it. Especially in our country, because we're so different.

Pochettino's appointment was widely heralded as a coup for the program. After years of mediocrity and mostly underwhelming leadership, Pochettino brought a world-class track record with him.

But it's been a mixed bag of results thus far, including a disastrous showing in losses to Panama and Canada earlier in 2025. Arena said it didn't appear that the players had ""pride"" in playing for the US. 

""You're asking me if we lack that kind of pride,"" said Arena. ""I'm watching and I'm shocked. I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada. It was shocking to me. I don't want to be disrespectful, I want them to do great in the World Cup. There's no question about that. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they gotta get going.""

Arena has a point in that the US is a unique soccer country on the global stage; it's a massive country with a solid but unspectacular domestic league. Soccer also isn't the biggest sport in the country. It isn't even in the top three or four. He's also right that it's very different coaching international teams relative to high-end clubs. Premier League teams, for example, have significantly more practice and prep time to build cohesion and strategy. 

But the USMNT has been headed in the wrong direction for quite some time, despite arguably the best and deepest talent pool it's ever had. And that wrong direction has been directed by American-born managers. When what you're doing isn't working, it's nonsensical to not try something else. 

Most countries would be thrilled to have Pochettino managing their national soccer teams. Whether it works out remains to be seen, but the process was and is good. That's really all you can ask for.

                                        Bruce Arena, the coach with the most wins for the US men's national soccer team and the only one to lead the team to two World Cups, was discussed as a possible replacement for Gregg Berhalter, who was fired last year. He didn't get the job. It went to Mauricio Pochettino, an Argentine soccer manager who's coached some of Europe's biggest teams, including Chelsea and Tottenham in the English Premier League and Ligue 1's Paris Saint-Germain. But Arena thinks that may have been a mistake. Though Pochettino is ""very good,"" he's not American, and that's a problem, Arena said on an episode of the Unfiltered Soccer podcast, per the New York Times.
                                    


                                        Speaking after the team's painful losses to Panama and Canada in the Nations League finals, Arena noted a national team head coach is usually from that same country. Just nine of 32 head coaches at the 2022 World Cup were foreign-born. The US men's national team has actually had numerous coaches from foreign countries over the years, most recently Jurgen Klinsmann, who led the team from 2011 to 2016. But Arena argues US soccer has a unique culture and environment that a head coach needs to understand. ""And we're lacking that,"" he said. ""I'm watching, I'm shocked. I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada.""
                                    


                                        He continued, ""I don't want to be disrespectful, I want them to do great in the World Cup. There's no question about it. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they gotta get going."" The team's next major challenge is the Concacaf Gold Cup, a competition of 16 nations kicking off June 14 in the US and Canada. The US will face Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti in the group stage. Pochettino, who's questioned players' effort and competitive mentality, says he'll be looking beyond talent to find the players with ""the right mindset"" because ""we must compete hard,"" per ESPN.

Mauricio Pochettino: “The right mindset must be there, because we need to compete for our flag, our country.” (Imagn Images)

In June, the U.S. men's national team will compete in its final tournament prior to the 2026 World Cup – the Concacaf Gold Cup.

After the team's latest underachieving performance in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and third-place match, the pressure will be head coach Mauricio Pochettino to pick the right team and have the team play with intensity.

And no one has to remind him about that.

“The right mindset must be there, because we need to compete for our flag, our country,” Pochettino said on an interview on USSoccer.com. “What we are trying to do as a staff is to optimize every single area of preparation, and the mentality of the players is really important. We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone. We need to have the right characters to be really competitive.”

Pochettino, who had never directed a national team before the USA gig, admitted the team did not show enough fight during the CNL disaster.

“For sure to start we must compete hard,” he said. “We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments they are always motivated to play against the USA. Of course we must perform well to win and you don't always get a result, but for sure in order to win you have to compete.

“It's not just about showing up in your home country and trying to play nice soccer. No, you must be proud, you must fight for the people that would love to be in your position, for the millions of kids that are going to see us and dream to be one day where we are.

“This is the type of responsibility and commitment we need to show in a different way than we did [in the Nations League] in Los Angeles.”

A toxic media culture, stoked by podcast-bro vibes of former players, has made the USMNT a suddenly polarizing topic

Everyone has a podcast these days. It's just what you do. Opinions need to be disseminated into the world, and all that matters is yours. The problem, of course, is that when everyone has a podcast, when everyone is just yelling, no one really listens. So, it just becomes a bit of a race to the bottom.

Only most outlandish opinions stand out. The silliest ""takes"" tend to win. But what happens if you start to believe your own propaganda? What happens if you say something so angsty that people are forced to listen - and it's so good that you may as well just embody it?

Welcome to the world of soccer punditry, where everyone has a bone to pick, and pretty much no one can offer objective analysis. In fairness, it's the media sphere we live in. Clicks are good. Opinions - even wrong ones - are good. Engagement is everything. The value of saying something intelligent is fading.

This has always been the case in the European game, where former players, in particular, disseminate their perceived injustices into the world. Roy Keane is the grumpy one. Gary Neville is the United apologist. Jamie Carragher is the scouse one. Micah Richards brings the #bantz.

In the United States, though, it's a more recent phenomenon, especially around the current iteration of the men's national team - the old heads taking to their home studios to speak their minds. And with every poor performance, every slip, every showing that falls even slightly short of expectations, the noise grows louder. Podcasts become shoutier, dissenters are dissenting more. A previous generation of footballers, the supposed embodiment of the ""good old days"" just becomes one ball of anger, dragging nuance out of the game.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Club World Cup will be televised live on Channel 5 this summer after the free-to-air broadcaster reached a sublicensing agreement for the UK with the global rights holder, Dazn.

The Guardian can reveal that as part of a cross-promotional deal finalised this week, 23 of the 63 matches will be shown on Channel 5 as well as on Dazn – 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The remaining 40 games will be shown exclusively by Dazn, which has committed to making every match in the new expanded tournament available free-to-air globally via its app.

The Club World Cup, which includes Chelsea and Manchester City, will be the highest-profile sports event televised by Channel 5, which has held live rights to the Europa League and numerous highlights packages. Channel 5 is also in talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board about buying two men's and two women's England T20 matches this summer as it seeks to expand its sports coverage. It is owned by the American film giant Paramount.

Dazn paid $1bn (£787m) for global Club World Cup rights in February in a surprise deal that appears to have been largely funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, with the kingdom's Surj Sports Investment group last month confirming it had taken a minority stake in the streaming company valued at $1bn. Fifa subsequently announced the prize and appearance fund would also be $1bn, with the tournament winners to receive up to $125.8m depending on their results and Chelsea and City to bank $38.19m for qualifying.

The Dazn/Surj partnership spared Fifa's blushes after a lengthy TV rights sales process which had concluded with it failing to find rights partners. Apple TV withdrew from advanced negotiations over a global deal last summer after a disagreement over valuation, with Fifa reportedly demanding $4bn, and a subsequent attempt to sell the rights on a regional basis foundered.

Although Dazn's latest accounts say it has 300 million monthly users globally, it remains a challenger company in certain markets, including the UK, which led to an agreement to sublicense the rights to ensure larger viewing figures for Fifa and its commercial partners. Warner Bros has a sublicensing deal in the United States.

The Guardian reported this month that the BBC and ITV had opted not to bid because their main football focus will be their joint coverage of England's defence of the Women's European Championship. Channel 5 beat Channel 4 to an agreement with Dazn, the deal brokered by Lee Sears, Paramount's president of international ad sales.

“We're delighted to be able to have agreed this fantastic partnership with Dazn to expand free-to-air coverage of the Fifa Club World Cup, live on 5,” Sears told the Guardian. “It's going to be one of the sporting events of the summer with most of the matches played in the evening peak time and 32 of the world's biggest clubs involved.” Sears said the ambition was to offer viewers and advertisers “even more [sport] in the months to come”.

Channel 5 will take Dazn's coverage and promote Dazn's brand rather than use its own staff.

Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga has suffered a left abductor tear.

Sources close to the club and player fear he will not recover in time for the Club World Cup, which begins in mid-June with the final on July 13.

The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Madrid's 1-0 win over Getafe on Wednesday. He came on as a substitute at half-time, replacing David Alaba who was feeling discomfort himself, and ended the match limping. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said after the game that both players were dealing with “muscular problems” before the club confirmed Camavinga's injury on Thursday.

“Following tests carried out today on Eduardo Camavinga by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a complete tear of the tendon in his left abductor muscle,” Madrid said in a statement.

The injury is a significant blow to Madrid, ruling Camavinga out of Saturday's Copa del Rey final against Barcelona and potentially the rest of the domestic season. Madrid's first game of the expanded Club World Cup is set to take place on June 18 against Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.

Camavinga has made 34 appearances in all competitions this season, scoring twice, in what has been an injury-disrupted campaign.

A knee injury in August kept the France international out for more than a month before suffering a hamstring injury in November that caused him to miss five matches. He injured his hamstring again in January, sidelining him for another three weeks.

This is the latest injury setback for Madrid, who have had a host of players miss time this season, including Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao who are out with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears.

Left-back Ferland Mendy has been out since mid-March with a hamstring injury, though the club say that he is making good progress and has a chance to feature on Saturday alongside Kylian Mbappe, who missed the Getafe game. The club also say Alaba could be part of the squad if he gets through training without issue.

Arder Guler, making only his 11th start of the season, scored the only goal of the game against Getafe. Aurelien Tchouameni picked up a yellow card during the game which the club say they plan to appeal. Tchouameni is at risk of being suspended for Madrid's clash with Barcelona in La Liga on May 11 if he is booked in the side's next league fixture against Celta Vigo.

Madrid are second in La Liga on 72 points, four points behind leaders Barcelona with five games to play.

Analysis from Tomás Hill López-Menchero

Camavinga has been in and out of the team this season, but his injury only underlines what a torrid campaign this has been for Real Madrid.

Raul Asencio, Luka Modric, Arda Guler and Endrick are their only players not to have missed games through injury this term. Right-back Carvajal and Militao are out with long-term knee injuries while Mendy has missed nine matches with his hamstring injury.

Camavinga might have been in line to start at left-back in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona before this latest setback. That is not the Frenchman's preferred position but he has often performed better there than Fran Garcia, who struggled against Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-finals. After the win against Getafe, Ancelotti admitted that academy graduate Garcia would have to play the Clasico.

But this is also another blow for the versatile Camavinga, who has yet to fully establish himself at Madrid since moving to the Spanish capital in 2021. Madrid are still struggling to move on from Toni Kroos in midfield after the German's retirement last summer — they need all the help they can get in that department if they are to have any hopes of winning the Copa del Rey or La Liga before the revamped Club World Cup in the United States this summer.

According to Sky Sports, Chelsea are tracking some of Europe's best centre backs and attackers and want deals done before the Club World Cup.

The Blues came from a goal down to score two very late goals to win the game 2-1 against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon in what was a very dramatic game of ups and downs. But for 80 minutes, it was a lot of downs for Chelsea and the woes were continuing. Thankfully, they managed to get two late goals from individual brilliance to win the game.

Still, manager Enzo Maresca did not celebrate the Chelsea win over with the away fans like all the players did at the end of the game, which was very odd. But he has explained his reasoning for this in the post match press conference, although it wont wash.

The fans were furious throughout most of the game though and certainly let the manager and the players know this at half time and throughout the game. Pedro Neto responded to the fan anger in his post-match comments after the game on Sunday.

The Blues are also set for another very busy transfer window this coming summer as they look to add players to a number of positions yet again in more big spending expected.

Sky reports that Chelsea are tracking some of Europe's best centre-backs and attackers in an effort to try and complete some deals before they play at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

They also say that we can expect another busy summer at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea targeting the arrivals of a forward, a winger and a central defender.

They've mentioned 11 names including Liam Delap, Victor Osimhen, Dean Huijsen, Marc Guehi, Nico Williams, Jamie Gittens, and more…

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Conor Bradley: World Cup 2026 spot with Northern Ireland would be 'special' says Liverpool player","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g23g9e8j8o","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 06:00:20 GMT","

Conor Bradley has scored four goals for Northern Ireland in 24 caps

Conor Bradley says it would be the ""thing of dreams"" to help Northern Ireland to a World Cup.

The 21-year-old, who could earn a Premier League winners' medal with Liverpool this weekend, has become a key figure for Michael O'Neill's side and served as captain on two occasions during last year's Nations League.

While he missed the most recent friendly games against Switzerland and Sweden last month, he will be expected to play a huge role in the side's efforts to become the fourth Northern Ireland side to reach the World Cup when qualifying for the 2026 tournament begins in September.

""That's everyone's dream,"" said Bradley, who has been named International Personality of the Year by the Northern Ireland Football Writers' Association.

""We know how difficult it is because not many Northern Ireland teams have done it, we know how special it would be.

""It would be unbelievable, the thing of dreams. Hopefully one day we can get there and if we keep working hard, I'm pretty sure we can.""

Northern Ireland have lost the likes of Steven Davis, Stuart Dallas and Jonny Evans to retirement, the latter solely in the case of international football, since their last attempt to qualify for a World Cup.

In their stead, O'Neill has relied on younger players like Bradley, Shea Charles, Isaac Price and Trai Hume.

""We've got potential but we need to fulfil that,"" Bradley added.

""Obviously we're still really young as it is, we've lost a lot of experience.

""We have to keep getting experience together and keep improving together, hopefully there'll be good things around the corner.""

The UEFA qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will take place in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, feature a new structure and expanded slots for European teams. With 16 direct qualification spots up for grabs, the stakes are high for established footballing powers and emerging nations. Below, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of each group, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the teams and offering predictions for who will qualify. The draw occurred on Friday, 13th December, at noon in Zurich, Switzerland.

Analysis: This group is set to be dominated by either Germany or Italy, depending on which team finishes higher in the UEFA Nations League. Both countries have a rich footballing pedigree and are expected to secure automatic qualification. Slovakia has shown improvement in recent years and could challenge for second place. Northern Ireland's consistency has waned, while Luxembourg's progress in European football is notable but unlikely to translate into a qualification spot, but not enough to earn them at least a playoff spot, as despite being a good team as a unit, they still lack that individual talent up front, with an aging Rodrigues currently looking off the pace as he is playing his club football in China.

Prediction: Germany/Italy will win the group, with Slovakia as a potential playoff contender. Third place Northern Ireland and fourth Luxembourg (both with the same amount of points collected but Northern Ireland with a better direct encounter)

Analysis: Switzerland's experience and consistency make them favorites to top Group B. They have consistently qualified for major tournaments in recent years. Sweden's youthful attacking talent, led by Alexander Isak, will be key to their campaign. Slovenia's defensive resilience makes them tough to beat. Still, Sweden will edge them out for third, as in terms of individual talent and tight matches, the Swedes will have a little more experience in the locker, while Kosovo's unpredictability could make them a potential spoiler; however, in tight-margin matches, they will find it difficult. However, all in all, it is a close group for everyone, including Kosovo; hence, this group will be a tough nut to crack.

Prediction: Switzerland to win the group, with Sweden taking second place. Slovenia in third and Kosovo fourth.

Analysis: The loser of the UEFA Nations League matchup between Portugal and Denmark will be the favorite to win this group. Both nations have immense quality, with Portugal's attacking depth and Denmark's tactical cohesion giving them the edge over Greece and Scotland. Scotland has made great strides in recent years, but Greece's defensive prowess will make it a close fight for second place. Belarus's limited squad depth leaves them as outsiders, but they can gain points against the likes of Greece and Scotland and will push the Danes and Portuguese.

Prediction: Portugal/Denmark (loser) to win the group, with Greece edging Scotland for second place and Belarus finishing fourth.

Analysis: France or Croatia, depending on their UEFA Nations League performance, will likely dominate this group. Both teams have world-class talent, with France's depth giving them an edge. Ukraine's resilience under tough circumstances should see them compete for second place; however, in spite of Iceland's golden generation fading away, I do see them edging out Ukraine, with the war-torn country just missing out while the Nordic side just passes through on equal points and a better goal difference, while Azerbaijan's prospects are slim, but they can give Ukraine and Iceland a very good fight indeed, as previous results to the likes of Slovakia have shown they cannot be underestimated.

Prediction: France/Croatia (winner) will win the group, with Iceland in contention for second place, third will surprisingly go to Ukraine, and fourth to the Azeris.

Analysis: Either Spain or the Netherlands will claim the top spot in this group. Spain's technical brilliance and depth make them strong contenders, while the Netherlands' resurgence under Ronald Koeman has been promising. Türkiye's young, talented squad can compete for second place, but Georgia's emerging stars, such as Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, could provide an upset. Bulgaria is unlikely to challenge.

Prediction: Spain/Netherlands (winner) to win the group, with Türkiye taking second place and Georgia and Bulgaria finishing third and fourth, respectively.

Analysis: The winner of the UEFA Nations League clash between Portugal and Denmark will likely dominate this group. Hungary's recent rise in European football has been impressive, with Dominik Szoboszlai leading the charge. The Republic of Ireland has struggled for consistency in recent years, while Armenia will be the dark horse of this group, but the Magyars will edge them out for second, hence another tasty group.

Prediction: Portugal/Denmark (winner) will win the group, with Hungary finishing second, Armenia in third, and the Republic of Ireland finishing fourth.

Analysis: The loser of the UEFA Nations League matchup between Spain and the Netherlands is expected to win this group. Poland, with Robert Lewandowski still a key figure, will compete for second place. Finland's compact style and defensive strength make them potential spoilers; however, the Poles will edge them out. Both Lithuania and Malta are unlikely to contend, but in the race for 5th place, Malta looks more in form as a side right now, and they will likely edge out the Baltic side by the courtesy of equal points but a better direct encounter.

Prediction: Spain/Netherlands (loser) to win the group, with Poland securing second place, Finland in third, Malta fourth, and Lithuania fifth.

Analysis: Austria's squad depth and quality give them an edge in this group. Romania's revival has been steady, and they have a chance to finish second. Bosnia and Herzegovina's experience, with Edin Džeko still leading the line, could push them into contention. Cyprus will finish fourth, collecting points at home against Romania and even predicting a home victory against Bosnia, while San Marino will likely finish at the bottom; however, this group will be a good preparation for their potential play-off World Cup spot as they will know the intensity of the sides they will come up against.

Prediction: Austria to win the group, with Romania finishing second, Bosnia and Herzegovina third, Cyprus fourth, and San Marino fifth.

Analysis: The loser of the Germany vs. Italy UEFA Nations League matchup is heavily favored to win this group. Norway's firepower, with Erling Haaland leading the line, gives them a strong chance to claim second place and can even challenge the Germans and Italians for first; however, they will be second in the end. Moldova's dynamic young talent could cause problems for their rivals, and I will put them at third, in addition to also having a potential play-off spot to their name. Estonia and Israel are unlikely to contend; however, it is Israel who, in spite of having a positive Nations League campaign with a victory over Belgium in a group containing France and Italy, cannot underestimate both Moldova and Estonia, who can compete against Israel; however, they will finish fourth, just edging Estonia and under Moldova.

Prediction: Germany/Italy (loser) to win the group, with Norway taking second place, Moldova third, Israel fourth, and Estonia fifth.

Analysis: Belgium's generational shift hasn't diminished their status as favorites. Wales will need to adapt post-Gareth Bale, and some of their squad have diminished in quality and might even fall to third place. North Macedonia's capacity for upsets shouldn't be overlooked, and second place is achievable; however, Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein will likely finish near the bottom, although Kazakhstan might put up a historical surge and compete for that second place, seeing the results they have put in the last four years.

Prediction: Belgium to win the group, with North Macedonia finishing second, Wales finishing third, Kazakhstan fourth, and Liechtenstein fifth.

Analysis: England's star-studded squad is the clear favorite. Serbia's attacking duo of Aleksandar Mitrović and Dušan Vlahović should see them finish second. Albania's growth in recent years makes them a dark horse, and I will put them at second, just edging Serbia in what is a heated clash between these two sides that share a hostile history with each other and a repeat fixture of the Euro 2016 qualifying encounter, which event ended with the fixture being suspended and eventually Albania handed a walkover. While Latvia and Andorra will struggle, however, they will both have interesting battles between them; however, with a more offensive style of play, Latvia will be a better side in both direct encounters.

Prediction: England to win the group, with Albania securing second place, Serbia third, Latvia fourth, and Andorra fifth.

Analysis: France or Croatia, depending on the UEFA Nations League outcome, are heavy favorites. Czechia's pragmatic approach should see them finish second, just edging a very tricky Montenegro by a few points, while the Faroe Islands are likely to win both direct encounters against Gibraltar by a slim margin in a clash that features two micro-members in the UEFA confederation where they share a population of 90,000 inhabitants between two members.

Prediction: France/Croatia (loser) to win the group, with Czechia taking second place, Montenegro third, Faroe Islands fourth, and Gibraltar fifth.

With 16 UEFA teams guaranteed qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, competition is fierce. While traditional powers like Germany, France, and Spain are expected to qualify, there's room for surprise entries like Hungary, Romania, and Norway. Each group has its own drama, and the expanded World Cup slots mean more nations have a chance to shine on the biggest stage. The road to North America promises to be one of the most exciting UEFA qualifying campaigns in recent history.","{'href': 'https://www.meer.com', 'title': 'meer.com'}","soccer"

GOAL tells you everything you need to know about the in-demand 24-year-old being tipped to star for Germany at the 2026 World Cup

Real Madrid are presently paying a heavy price for failing to replace Toni Kroos last summer, but then it was always going to be a tough task. For starters, the now-retired German ranks as one of the finest deep-lying playmakers of the modern era.

Secondly, as Liverpool know only too well, finding a specialist No.6 is extremely difficult these days. Were it not for Arne Slot's successful conversion of Ryan Gravenberch into a defensive midfielder, the Reds would not be on the verge of winning just their second Premier League title right now.

It's clear, though, that Liverpool require another option in front of the back four, just as Madrid desperately need to belatedly find a worthy successor to Kroos. Consequently, there's every chance that they could end up battling for the same player this summer, namely Angelo Stiller, the Stuttgart star being touted as 'the new Toni Kroos'...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

A toxic media culture, stoked by podcast-bro vibes of former players, has made the USMNT a suddenly polarizing topic

Everyone has a podcast these days. It's just what you do. Opinions need to be disseminated into the world, and all that matters is yours. The problem, of course, is that when everyone has a podcast, when everyone is just yelling, no one really listens. So, it just becomes a bit of a race to the bottom.

Only most outlandish opinions stand out. The silliest ""takes"" tend to win. But what happens if you start to believe your own propaganda? What happens if you say something so angsty that people are forced to listen - and it's so good that you may as well just embody it?

Welcome to the world of soccer punditry, where everyone has a bone to pick, and pretty much no one can offer objective analysis. In fairness, it's the media sphere we live in. Clicks are good. Opinions - even wrong ones - are good. Engagement is everything. The value of saying something intelligent is fading.

This has always been the case in the European game, where former players, in particular, disseminate their perceived injustices into the world. Roy Keane is the grumpy one. Gary Neville is the United apologist. Jamie Carragher is the scouse one. Micah Richards brings the #bantz.

In the United States, though, it's a more recent phenomenon, especially around the current iteration of the men's national team - the old heads taking to their home studios to speak their minds. And with every poor performance, every slip, every showing that falls even slightly short of expectations, the noise grows louder. Podcasts become shoutier, dissenters are dissenting more. A previous generation of footballers, the supposed embodiment of the ""good old days"" just becomes one ball of anger, dragging nuance out of the game.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Scotland star is one of the key characters in an epic battle that could end in a play-off if both teams win all their remaining games

Aurelio Di Laurentiis made a movie about Napoli's glorious 2023 Serie A triumph. And he intends to produce another about the current campaign. ""I hope to release it in cinemas in June,"" the Partenopei president revealed in an interview with Radio Crc last week, ""and I'm also discussing it with streaming platforms. The film of the Scudetto was successful, so I asked myself, 'Why don't we tell every Napoli season in the same way?'""

As every cinephile knows, the sequel is nearly never as good as the original, but this particular follow-up could be one of those beloved exceptions to the rule - whether Napoli win this season's Scudetto or not. Indeed, what makes the 2024-25 Serie A title race so riveting is that even with just five rounds remaining, nobody has any idea how it's going to end. 

While Napoli's victory two years ago was historic (their first since the days of Diego Maradona) and led to a seismic eruption of joy felt all across the footballing world, the final outcome was never really in doubt from about January on. 

This time around, though, we have two compelling protagonists in Napoli and Inter locked together at the top of the table in a fight that really could go either way, while the stellar supporting cast features two fantastic characters in Simone Inzaghi and Antonio Conte, as well as Scott McTominay, the unlikely hero who has already played a key role in setting the scene for a wonderfully dramatic finale...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL breaks down all of the major MLS moves in the primary window, assesses implications for players and clubs involved

The 2025 MLS primary transfer window is closed. The next window will not open until July 24, meaning the current league rosters are what we will see for the next few months. Of course, free agent signings will still be allowed, but transfers and trades are an hold until mid-summer.

And make no mistake, this was a window for the ages for MLS. Multiple teams broke their respective transfer records, such as Austin FC with U.S. international Brandon Vazquez and winger Myrto Uzuni. And there was the emergence of a new mechanism, called Cash for Players - an internal transfer market within MLS that is exactly what it sounds like, as teams can pay cash fees for players within the league.

The mechanism allowed the likes of Jack McGlynn, Evander, Lucho Acosta, and Daniel Gazdag all to make blockbuster switches over recent months.

The MLS transfer record was smashed, with Atlanta United bringing in Ivorian striker Emmanuel Latte Lath for a reported fee of $22M. They were also reunited with former club stalwart Miguel Almiron, brought in for $10M. For the Five Stripes though, it's been a rocky start to the campaign - it's too early to pass judgement.

Charlotte FC had the smartest window: they added a bonafide superstar in Wilfried Zaha and filled the gaps with role players who will be crucial to their success. FC Cincinnati, too, were successful. Sure, they lost Lucho Acosta, but they replaced him with Evander - arguably a better long-term choice for the club.

Some, such as CF Montreal, really struggled, while there are other teams that you just have to question, what the hell is the front office doing?

Both the LA Galaxy and LAFC fall into the latter category. The reigning champions are winless, stuck at the bottom of the MLS table, and have been torn apart down to their skeleton. LAFC, meanwhile, failed to replace key players they lost this offseason, and they're sinking as a result.

And then there's like Real Salt Lake. They gave their fans a bit of anxiety by waiting so long, but they ultimately got the job done. It took until the final hours of the window closing, but they secured a goal-scoring No. 9 in now ex-Sporting Kansas City forward Willy Agada.

A dramatic window, riveting and historical in many ways, to be sure. But it's closed, and so it's time to evaluate. GOAL takes a look at major winners and losers from the primary transfer window.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Alcaraz withdraws from Madrid","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-madrid-2025-preview-thursday","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz has withdrawn from the Mutua Madrid Open due an adductor injury sustained in Barcelona. The 21-year-old announced the decision during his pre-tournament press conference on Thursday in the Spanish capital.

""In the Barcelona final I felt something in the left hamstring, I didn't think that it was that serious,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm really disappointed that I'm not able to play here in Madrid. It is a place that I love playing in front of my people, in front of my family, my friends. They are not able to travel so much, so here is a special place for me.

""It was a really difficult situation, really difficult to decide, not [being] able to play. I think it is what it is. Tennis is really a demanding sport. Playing week after week, so many matches in a row and you have to heal your body sometimes and take difficult decisions. I will come back stronger. I will come back with a lot of power for the next tournaments. I'm really disappointed [to] not be playing here in Madrid.""



The Spaniard received treatment on his upper right leg during his defeat to Holger Rune in the Barcelona final last week. The two-time Madrid champion, who also won the title in Monte-Carlo earlier in April, was hoping to be fit to play at the ATP Masters 1000 event but feels that the tournament has come too soon.

“It was the first year I went really far in Monte-Carlo but it was also the first year I lost in the first match in Miami, so I had time to prepare for the clay season,” Alcaraz said. “But it is not easy. A different surface, coming from hard court to clay court and playing so many matches in a row and having no time to rest, is not easy. Tennis players have to take difficult decisions sometimes.”

Alcaraz is now hoping to recover in time to play in Rome, a tournament he missed last season due to an arm injury.

""My plan is going to Rome. My mindset is to do everything it takes to be 100 per cent for Rome. I will do some tests at the beginning of next week just to see how it's improved and from that let's see how it's going to be the next days,"" Alcaraz said. ""My hope is to play in Rome. If not, the next tournament is Roland Garros for me. So I will try to be on court as soon as possible.""

Alcaraz holds a 24-5 record on the season, highlighted by titles in Monte-Carlo and Rotterdam. The Spaniard is first in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Medvedev weighs in on Mensik, Fonseca & Tien; shares thoughts on Rublev-Safin partnership","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/medvedev-madrid-2025-feature","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 15:26:37 GMT","

The #NextGenATP stars are making waves in 2025 and their rapid rises are hard to ignore. Learner Tien made history at the Australian Open, where he became the youngest man to reach the fourth round since 2005, Joao Fonseca captured his first tour-level title in Buenos Aires and Jakub Mensik shocked Novak Djokovic to claim his first ATP Masters 1000 crown in Miami.

For World No. 10 Daniil Medvedev, the surge of these young talents is a reminder of how the landscape of tennis is changing. Having fallen to Tien at the Australian Open, Medvedev is all too aware of the rising threat from these hungry up-and-comers.

“The next generation, especially the guys coming through in the last year are very strong,” Medvedev told ATPTour.com on Media Day in Madrid. “They've put themselves on the big stage pretty quickly. Jakub just won a Masters 1000, which is amazing. At 19, I was still playing Challengers. So, it's great for him.

“He played really well at the Australian Open too, as did Learner and Joao. There are a lot of strong guys coming up. I think it's a very talented generation. We'll see how it unfolds though, it is early stages and hard to predict.”



Medvedev knows firsthand that consistency is key to success. The 29-year-old won 20 tour-level titles between 2018 and 2023, spending the majority of the past seven years inside the Top 10.

“I think consistency is the toughest challenge,” Medvedev said. “Everyone has different weapons. If I compare Learner and Joao, they're two different types of players. Learner is more of a counter-attacking player, but still able to attack with intelligence. Joao is, of course, also very smart, but his game is about pure power. You see some of the forehands he unleashes. It's about understanding your game better and developing your skills.

“I'm pretty sure both of them will make the Top 10 at some point. Whether they'll be No. 1 for 220 weeks or stay in the Top 10, though, is something only time will tell. Tennis is a tough sport with so much competition.”

Andrey Rublev knows all too well about the power Fonseca possesses. The Brazilian defeated Rublev at the Australian Open. In a quest to improve his game, Rublev has since added former World No. 1 Marat Safin to his coaching team, with the pair joining forces for the first time in Monte-Carlo.

Good friends with Rublev and Safin, Medvedev shared his thoughts on their partnership. 

“Having Marat on Tour is great. It's nice to have him around the lounge and everything. With his experience, he could help anyone,” Medvedev said. “I wonder how it will work long-term, but so far, I think it's going great. The results have come in just two tournaments, so we'll see how things go further.

""I'm trying not to get too much into it because I could ask Andrey, ‘Oh my god, how's it working? What's he telling you?' But I always respect other people's personal space. I do know a little about their conversations or how things are going, but I try not to intrude. I think it's always the same: if you believe something can work, it can be with anyone.”

This week, Medvedev will hope to get his season back on track when he competes at the Mutua Madrid Open. The World No. 10 did reach the semi-finals in Indian Wells in March but has struggled to find his best level this year, holding a 14-8 record.
""Honestly, I feel great. The season hasn't been perfect and I know that. I'm okay with admitting it. But here I'm feeling great,"" Medvedev said. ""I'm practising well, doing all the right things and I believe they're going to pay off eventually.
“I have been trying everything. Sometimes I practise with someone new, sometimes just with Gilles [Cervara]. We have experimented with new shots, maybe new trajectories on clay. Other times, we decide that it's not bad and we just need to find that final step. We are trying everything and we will just stick to the right lead.”
Medvedev, chasing his first title since Rome in 2023, will face Laslo Djere in his opening match on Friday in the Spanish capital.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Djokovic still hungry in Madrid amid changing of the guard","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-madrid-2025-preview","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:14:25 GMT","

There is a certain inevitably in sport: a torch passed, a chapter closed, a new era born. Yet Novak Djokovic isn't quite ready to turn the page.

As tennis moves into a future filled with new stars and fresh rivalries, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings remains determined as ever. Returning this week to the Mutua Madrid Open, where he is a three-time champion, Djokovic was asked about the changing landscape of the ATP Tour, and where he fits into it.

“You can feel there's a shift,” Djokovic said in his press conference at the ATP Masters 1000 event. “Not only in terms of the generations of players [who now have] the main focus and attention, but I guess it takes a little bit of time for people to accept the fact that Roger and Rafa are not playing, and Murray, and I guess one day myself, but I'm still trying to stay there and represent the older guys, the older generation.”



Djokovic arrives in the Spanish capital looking to rebound from a shock opening-round exit in Monte-Carlo earlier this month, when he fell to Alejandro Tabilo. The defeat followed a loss in the Miami final to #NextGenATP Czech Jakub Mensik, denying Djokovic a chance at securing his 100th tour-level title.

The 40-time ATP Masters 1000 champion, Djokovic remains on the brink of joining Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the history books. But for the 37-year-old, it's not just the records and trophies that keep him motivated.

“That's also one of the reasons why I keep on playing is because I feel like it also helps tennis still thrive on the attention and crowd coming in, watching tournaments and getting interested,” added Djokovic. “If you see the numbers actually of the attendance in the Grand Slams, and some [other tournaments], [there has been] record-breaking crowds in the last few years.""

The Masters 1000 in Indian Wells notably set an all-time attendance record last month, with 504, 268 fans passing through the gates during the fortnight.
""[It's] good news that it shouldn't be dependent on the big stars or legends of the game that retired,"" Djokovic continued. ""The sport should outlive everyone, the sport will outlive everyone, and the sport is more important than anybody individually. So we are all here in the service of a sport as well.”

When asked about the changing era's in men's tennis, Djokovic was quick to highlight Alcaraz's rapid rise and remarkable achievements.
“We have to remember that his age and what he has done for his age is also not normal,” Djokovic said of Alcaraz. “I'm sure that we'll see a lot of him on the big stage with trophies in the future in 10 years, 15 years, as long as he's playing. The competition is always there. I think every generation has its different competition.”

Kei Nishikori earned his 450th tour-level win in style on Thursday at the Mutua Madrid Open, where he notched a piece of history.

The Japanese star outlasted Aleksandar Vukic 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 to become just the eighth active ATP Tour player, and the first Asian, to reach that milestone. Nishikori, who made the Madrid final in 2014, now boasts a 19-8 record at the ATP Masters 1000 event.

“I had no idea,” said Nishikori when asked of his 450th tour-level win. “I just try to play one match at a time. It's a lot, yes... I have played for 18 years now, hopefully I can reach 500 [wins].”

Nishikori, the former No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has been hampered by various injuries in the past three years, notably undergoing hip surgery in 2022. Yet the 35-year-old marked his return by reaching the quarter-finals at the Masters 1000 in Montreal last August and earning a nomination for ATP's Comeback Player of the Year award in 2024.

In the second round in Madrid, Nishikori takes on 29th seed Denis Shapovalov.

“I'm happy to be back here,” said Nishikori, who is competing in Madrid for the first time since 2021. “It's different conditions, a little tougher… But I have good memories, I played in the final a long time ago.”

In other early Madrid action on Thursday, Tomas Martin Etcheverry overcame Hamad Medjedovic in a gruelling three-hour, 16-minute battle. The Argentine saved 14 of 15 break points in the deciding set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, including eight in a nervy game to hold for 5-3. Etcheverry has set a second-round meeting with 10th seed and recent Monte-Carlo finalist Lorenzo Musetti.

Alexandre Muller led David Goffin 6-3, 3-6, 1-0 in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash before the Belgian was forced to retire. The Frenchman Muller will next face countryman and 21st seed Ugo Humbert.

Carlos Alcaraz is the reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion

Carlos Alcaraz has withdrawn from the Madrid Open because of injury - but is hopeful of being fit for his French Open title defence.

The Spanish world number three said he had injured his hamstring and groin during the second set of Sunday's Barcelona Open final.

""In a week or two I shall return to training, but I will take it step by step,"" Alcaraz, who has won four Grand Slam titles, said.

""I couldn't practice the entire week. I needed to listen to my body and make the right decision.

""I don't want to get too far ahead but I hope I shall be ready for the French Open.""

Alcaraz is a two-time champion in Madrid and won the Monte Carlo Masters in April.

The 21-year-old left court for treatment during the Barcelona final against Holger Rune and was able to resume the match, with the Dane going on to win 7-6 (8-6) 6-2.

Alcaraz said he intends to travel to Rome for the Italian Open, which begins on 6 May, before the French Open starts on 25 May.

Even if he is not able to play competitively before Roland Garros, Alcaraz remains confident he will still be able to challenge for the clay-court Grand Slam title.

""The tennis that I've played in the past few weeks has been great,"" he said.

""Mentally I think I'm strong to play good tennis again, so this is not going to take my confidence away.

""If I don't play Rome, or if I don't play any tournaments before Roland Garros, I don't care about it.

""I know what is my level, I know what I have to do to play good tennis.""

With the news that Carlos Alcaraz may miss the 2025 Madrid Open due to injury, Italian tennis great Adriano Panatta has speculated that the two-time champion may be indirectly responsible for his setbacks due to his full schedule.

Alcaraz is coming off a runner-up finish at the Barcelona Open, where he fell to Danish star Holger Rune in straight sets. Before Barcelona, the former World No.1 had competed at the Monte-Carlo Masters just a week earlier, where he battled his way to the title.

In the past, Alcaraz has spoken out on the length of the ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, claiming the prestigious two week-long events can be physically taxing. However, Panatta believes the reason for Alcaraz's physical struggles may be due to the Spaniard's unforgiving schedule.

""I read that the Spaniard complained that the Masters 1000 lasts two weeks, but let's look carefully at his schedule,"" said the 1976 Roland Garros champion. ""After Monte-Carlo, he went to Barcelona, then he will do Madrid, Rome, and Paris without interruption. Is it a problem of the calendar or a problem of the schedule because he plays all the time?""

Alcaraz is yet to confirm his withdrawal from the Madrid Open, although his team did announce he had suffered an adductor injury during the final against Rune in Barcelona. The Spaniard has a first-round bye in Madrid, with his second-round match set to take place on Friday.

Carlos Alcaraz has withdraw from the Madrid Open in a possible blow to his French Open hopes. The Spaniard's start to the clay court season and his preparation for Roland Garros have been thrown into disarray by an adductor injury.

Alcaraz suffered the problem in his straight-sets defeat against Holger Rune in the Barcelona Open final. He initially hoped that he would be able to play in Madrid but has now decided to withdraw after tests showed the extent of the injury. Spanish reports claimed this morning that there are doubts over the tennis star's participation in the Italian Open at the start of May, although the world No. 3 is yet to confirm whether he will take part.

""I wanted to play here, but we've decided not to take any risks,"" Alcaraz revealed in Madrid.

“As you all suspected, since I haven't been able to train these days, the physio came in for the Barcelona final to treat my abductor muscle, but I also noticed something else in my left leg. On Tuesday, I had tests, and I assessed with my team to see if we could play in good condition in Madrid, and we did everything possible, but things didn't improve much.

“You have to listen to your body. Madrid is a city I look forward to playing all year. It's an exciting tournament, and I play it with a lot of emotion, but things didn't go the way I wanted to play here. In the end, we decided not to take any risks, as I was going to be more than I expected. I'll try to rest and recover so I can be back on the court as soon as possible.”

It comes after Alcaraz said following his 7-6 6-2 reverse against Rune: ""I feel fine physically. I've had tests, and we'll see what the results say. I'm used to playing with discomfort, so let's hope I can play and enjoy Madrid.""

There is reportedly hope that he will be fit for the French Open, which begins on May 25. The Italian Open, which starts on May 6, could be less likely.

Having received a bye to the Madrid Open second round as a seeded player, Alcaraz was due to play his first match tomorrow. He was scheduled to play the winner of Zizou Bergs vs Gabriel Diallo, but Polish star Kamil Majchrzak will now take his place in the draw.

Alcaraz has endured a largely difficult year. He was beaten by Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open quarter-final and his form since then has been inconsistent. There was also a defeat in the semi-final of Indian Wells against British star Jack Draper, who went on to win the tournament. His two titles this year have come at the Rotterdam Open and the Monte-Carlo Masters.

The four-time Grand Slam champion had only won one tournament by this point last year, having triumphed at Indian Wells. A maiden French Open followed before he successfully defended his Wimbledon crown in another epic showdown with Djokovic.

MADRID — Home-crowd favorite Carlos Alcaraz withdrew from the Madrid Open on Thursday because of muscle injuries, saying he didn't want to risk making things worse before the French Open.

The third-ranked Spaniard blamed his injuries on the “really tight"" schedule that is part of the “demanding sport” of tennis.

Alcaraz said he has not fully recovered from the upper leg ailment that bothered him during the Barcelona Open final last Sunday. He also said he has a left leg injury. His first appearance at the Caja Magica in Madrid was scheduled for Saturday.

Alcaraz is a two-time champion in Madrid, having won in 2022 and 2023. He was the second seed this week and in the same half of the draw as Novak Djokovic.

Alcaraz said he did “everything possible to play” but had to make the “tough decision” to withdraw after listening to his body and talking to doctors.

“Madrid is one of the special tournaments for me, it's a tournament that I enjoy, I get to play in front of my fans, it's one of the first tournaments I attended when I was a kid,” Alcaraz said. “These types of decisions are not easy to make but sometimes you have to think about your health and about what is important. A Grand Slam is a Grand Slam. If I play here, I could make the injuries worse and stop for several months and that's not worth it.”

He said he felt “secure” about recovering in time to play next month at Roland Garros, where he is the defending champion. He won the Roland Garros final last year against Alexander Zverev, who has just leapfrogged the Spaniard to No. 2 in the world after winning in Munich last week.

“I'm not really worried about it,” Alcaraz said. “I believe it's going to take one week, one week and a half, two weeks maximum, but I won't have doubts about coming back and moving 100% again.”

He said he plans to play in Rome ahead of the French Open, which begins on May 25.

“My mindset is to do everything it takes to be a hundred percent for Rome. I will do some tests at the beginning of next week just to see how it's improved, and from that let's see how it's going to be the next days,” he said. “My hope is to play in Rome. If not, next tournament is Roland Garros for me. So I will try to be on court as soon as possible.”

Alcaraz needed treatment on his leg during his straight-set loss to Holger Rune in the Barcelona final. He had not practiced in Madrid yet, and said this week that he felt “fine” but was waiting on medical test results to determine whether he would play.

Alcaraz, who will turn 22 on May 5, won in Monte Carlo to start his clay-court campaign and on a nine-match winning run until the Barcelona final. He said he later also felt pain in a muscle in his left leg.

Alcaraz vowed to “come back stronger” but complained of the tennis schedule.

“Tennis is really a demanding sport,” he said. ""Playing week after week, so many matches in a row, and you have to heal your body sometimes and take difficult decisions.""

The four-time Grand Slam champion has a 24-5 record this year. In addition to Monte Carlo, he also won in Rotterdam on hard court in February.

“The schedule is really tight, really difficult tournaments week after week, and sometimes you have to think about yourself sometimes, and make the right decisions as to your health.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Joao Fonseca reveals why he would 'love' to face Novak Djokovic in French Open first round","https://www.tennis365.com/french-open/what-joao-fonseca-say-about-playing-against-novak-djokovic-roland-garros","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 10:54:20 GMT","

Young players usually prefer to avoid the biggest guns in tennis during the first few rounds of a Grand Slam, but Joao Fonseca has a different mindset than most.

Aged just 18, Fonseca has already notched up several milestones as he won his maiden ATP Tour singles title at the Argentina Open in May, becoming the fourth youngest title winner since 2000.

He has peaked at No 58 in the ATP Rankings with his current position of 65 high enough for a direct entry into the main draw of the French Open.

It will be the first time that he has qualified outright for a Grand Slam as he made his major debut at this year's Australian Open after coming through qualifying.

He then claimed the scalp of ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the first round before losing in five sets against Lorenzo Sonego.

Fonseca is unlikely to be seeded at Roland Garros and he admits he would love to face one “iconic” players in the opening round namely Novak Djokovic.

“When we start these biggest tournaments, the Grand Slams, the ‘qualies', I always tell my coach: ‘If I go to the main draw, I want to play Djokovic,' because it's probably one of the last times. I hope I can play him,” he told RolandGarros.com.

“I'd love to face Djokovic first, second round. I'd try to play my best tennis, the result wouldn't matter, I'd just enjoy it.

“I like to play the top seeds, I like the challenge. I play with no pressure, so I think I can play well there.

“I like to play with the crowd also, so it's an experience I want to have. Some players will want to play ‘easier' first, but I want to play the iconic ones.”

Joao Fonseca turned down a ‘mega money offer' before becoming a tennis professional

With a Grand Slam match win under his belt, his next goal is to win two matches at a major event, but he is aiming much higher than a couple of wins at the Slams.

“I'm rising fast. One of the goals I want to get to a third round of a Grand Slam. Maybe it can be at Roland-Garros? I play well on clay, was born on clay, grew up on clay, I feel confident,” he said.

“My goal for the future is to be No 1, that's the dream, but I know it's a long way to go. I have to work even harder, go step by step.

“I need to get more experiences, like this. Roland-Garros will be my first direct entry into a Grand Slam. This all helps me develop, to evolve, alongside putting in the necessary work. I think that's the way of achieving the highest goals.”

Many consider Wimbledon to be the most prestigious tournament in all of tennis, as fans from around the world enjoy the action at SW19.

The only grass court Major tournament is a big hit every summer, when the stars of the ATP Tour battle it out for the trophy.

Swiss legend Roger Federer has won more Wimbledon titles than any other player in men's tennis history, securing eight victories during his career.

In 2023 and 2024, Carlos Alcaraz won Wimbledon, beating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic on both occasions.

The Spaniard will be the favorite once again when tennis returns to London in June, as he now reveals what happened when he nearly broke one of Wimbledon's ‘strictest' rules.

Speaking in his new Netflix documentary, Alcaraz shared his thoughts on the history of Wimbledon.

“For me Wimbledon is one of the most beautiful tournaments in the world, if not the most beautiful, both because of its prestige and its rules,” he said.

“You can't step onto the court unless you're dressed all in white.”

The dress code once caused issues for the 21-year-old, who now reveals what officials said to him when he wore the wrong colored underwear.

“My underwear was a different colour, it was slightly see-through so they called me out,” said Alcaraz.

“They said ‘No, we won't let you play in the next match.'

“I mean that shows you how strict they are.”

Alcaraz and others have accepted the tournament's strict rules, as they enjoy performing at their best on the grass.

Several tennis legends gave their verdict on the sport's most ‘historic' event.

“The Wimbledon tournament is the one that you dream of getting to. All the players want to be a part of that,” said John McEnroe.

“Wimbledon is the only one on grass, you really feel the history here, more than any other tournament,” added Martina Navratilova.

“Nothing is more luxurious, elegant, and historic than being in that tournament. For me, Wimbledon was pure ecstasy,” said Garbine Muguruza.

The Spaniard is 3/4 of the way to a Career Grand Slam, having secured victories at the French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open.

But at which of the four Grand Slam events has Alcaraz performed best during his career to date?

Alcaraz has remarkably won 90% of his matches at the All England Club, last losing at Wimbledon, 1,026 days ago.

There he fell to defeat against his biggest rival, Jannik Sinner, who advanced to the quarterfinals in four sets, 6-1, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3.

The Spaniard had lost to another Grand Slam winner in his one previous visit to Wimbledon in 2021, falling to defeat against Daniil Medvedev in the second round, 4-6, 1-6, 2-6.

Following Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal's retirements in 2024, Alcaraz will return to Wimbledon in 2025, as one of just two active players to have lifted the title.

Djokovic could well prove to be Alcaraz's biggest threat on the grass, having reached the final in each of the last six Wimbledon tournaments.

The pair battled it out in a thriller two years ago, when Alcaraz won in five sets to clinch his first title at Wimbledon, a match many consider to be one of the greatest in the tournament's history.

Only time will tell if the pair will meet in a third consecutive final this year, but it will certainly be something to look out for.

Carlos Alcaraz has revealed the unlikely secret behind his back-to-back Wimbledon triumphs – cutting loose in Ibiza.

In the new Netflix documentary ""Carlos Alcaraz: My Way,"" the Spanish tennis star opens up about defying his team's advice and heading to the party island to blow off steam after a crushing loss to Novak Djokovic in the 2023 French Open semifinals.




“I had a friend with a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends,” Alcaraz said. “I ended up going. They knew exactly what I was going there for. In Ibiza, I'm not going to lie – it's all about partying and going out.”

“I basically went there to reventar – to let loose, to explode,” added the now four-time Grand Slam champion.




It wasn't the typical road to Wimbledon glory – and his agent, Albert Molina, advised against it – but for Alcaraz, it was exactly what he needed to reset and come back stronger.

Ibiza's tonic paid off spectacularly, too. Just a few weeks later, at age 20, he defeated the Serbian star in the Wimbledon final.

“I tried to explain to him that it might not be the best idea to go to Ibiza for three or four days on vacation when he had Queen's the following week and then Wimbledon,” Molina said.

Alcaraz repeated the trick in 2024, taking another Ibiza trip before the grass-court season. His fitness coach, Juanjo Moreno, accused him of being selfish.




In the documentary, his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero even questions whether Alcaraz has the dedication required to emulate the likes of Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

“He has a different way of understanding work and sacrifice,” Ferrero said. “It's so different that it makes me question whether he can really be the best in history.”

But Alcaraz has no regrets.

“They always want to protect me, but I'm getting older. I'm starting to make my own decisions, and that's what I want,” he said. “I don't take care of myself as much. I spend a lot of days enjoying life – maybe more than I should.

“But I want to do it my way.”

Alcaraz, who turns 22 next month, is the No. 2 seed at this week's Madrid Masters.","{'href': 'https://www.dailysabah.com', 'title': 'Daily Sabah'}","tennis"

LONDON– Carlos Alcaraz has lifted the lid on his secret for winning his first Wimbledon title in 2023 and defending the title a year later — partying hard in Ibiza.

In a new Netflix documentary, “Carlos Alcaraz: My Way”, the Spaniard describes how he went against the advice of his team to let his hair down on the Mediterranean island.

“I had a friend who had a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends,” the now four-times Grand Slam champion said.

“I ended up going and they know what I'm going there to do. In Ibiza, I'm not going to lie, it's pretty much all about partying and going out.

“I basically went there to reventar (literally, ‘burst' in Spanish), I'm not sure if that's the best way to put it but I went there to go out.”

It might not have been textbook preparation for Wimbledon, and his agent Albert Molina warned against it, but Alcaraz said he had to let off steam after losing to Novak Djokovic in the 2023 French Open semis having suffered with nerves and cramps.

Premieres at Gold Coast Film Festival Saturday May 3 from 12noon.



A powerful new documentary goes behind the scenes of one of the world's four Grand Slams, telling the story from the perspective of the hidden figures who power the Australian Open – the ballkids.

Presented by AO Originals, Ballkids was produced by Run Wild Productions in association with Mischief Media.

Premiering in Australia at the Gold Coast Film Festival on Saturday 3 May at 12noon, Ballkids lifts the curtain on the inner workings of one of the world's most prestigious tennis events from the perspective of its youngest stars, whose work ethic rivals that of the athletes on court.

Narrated by Celia Pacquola, one of Australia's most beloved comedians and actors known for her roles in Utopia, Rosehaven, and Thank God You're Here, the film chronicles the experiences of rookies and seasoned veterans as they strive to become a Top Gun – the best ballkids of the tournament, chosen to work on Rod Laver Arena for the prestigious finals matches.

From the early morning training sessions to the pressure of working with the whole world watching, their story is one of grit and determination.

“We've always known that the ballkids are integral to the smooth running of the tournament, but Ballkids shows just how much effort, skill, and determination it takes to make it to the top,” Scott Baskett, Director and Producer at Run Wild Productions, said.

“This documentary is not just about tennis, it's about resilience, teamwork, and the pursuit of perfection — values that transcend the sport itself.”

Xavier Muhlebach, Tennis Australia Head of Original Content, said, “Ballkids is all about celebrating the amazing kids who keep the Australian Open moving. Filming with them was such a fun and inspiring experience – seeing their dedication and love for the game up close really brings a fresh perspective to what they do.

“We're thrilled to premiere Ballkids at the Gold Coast Film Festival, especially as we know Queenslanders love their tennis.”

Filmed during Australian Open 2023 and 2024, Celia Pacquola's witty and engaging voice lends a unique charm to the film, adding both humor and heart as she guides viewers through the thrilling, emotional journey of the ballkids.

Naomi Just, Producer at Mischief Media, said “We hit the jackpot with Celia Pacquola as our narrator for Ballkids. She has such warmth and humour which perfectly complements the inspiring, high-energy stakes of the film.

“We're so thrilled the Gold Coast Film Festival is the home for Ballkids' Australian premiere and we really look forward to showcasing these incredible young people who help bring to life one of the biggest sporting events in the world.”

Ballkids will screen at the Gold Coast Film Festival at Home of the Arts at 1pm on Saturday 3 May and 12pm on Tuesday 6 May 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz withdraws from Madrid","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-madrid-2025-preview-thursday","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz has withdrawn from the Mutua Madrid Open due an adductor injury sustained in Barcelona. The 21-year-old announced the decision during his pre-tournament press conference on Thursday in the Spanish capital.

""In the Barcelona final I felt something in the left hamstring, I didn't think that it was that serious,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm really disappointed that I'm not able to play here in Madrid. It is a place that I love playing in front of my people, in front of my family, my friends. They are not able to travel so much, so here is a special place for me.

""It was a really difficult situation, really difficult to decide, not [being] able to play. I think it is what it is. Tennis is really a demanding sport. Playing week after week, so many matches in a row and you have to heal your body sometimes and take difficult decisions. I will come back stronger. I will come back with a lot of power for the next tournaments. I'm really disappointed [to] not be playing here in Madrid.""



The Spaniard received treatment on his upper right leg during his defeat to Holger Rune in the Barcelona final last week. The two-time Madrid champion, who also won the title in Monte-Carlo earlier in April, was hoping to be fit to play at the ATP Masters 1000 event but feels that the tournament has come too soon.

“It was the first year I went really far in Monte-Carlo but it was also the first year I lost in the first match in Miami, so I had time to prepare for the clay season,” Alcaraz said. “But it is not easy. A different surface, coming from hard court to clay court and playing so many matches in a row and having no time to rest, is not easy. Tennis players have to take difficult decisions sometimes.”

Alcaraz is now hoping to recover in time to play in Rome, a tournament he missed last season due to an arm injury.

""My plan is going to Rome. My mindset is to do everything it takes to be 100 per cent for Rome. I will do some tests at the beginning of next week just to see how it's improved and from that let's see how it's going to be the next days,"" Alcaraz said. ""My hope is to play in Rome. If not, the next tournament is Roland Garros for me. So I will try to be on court as soon as possible.""

Alcaraz holds a 24-5 record on the season, highlighted by titles in Monte-Carlo and Rotterdam. The Spaniard is first in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

Hubert Hurkacz and Brandon Nakashima are entered in ATP Challenger Tour 175 events held from 13-18 May, during the second week of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. The Pole Hurkacz is signed up for Piemonte Open Intesa Sanpaolo in Turin, Italy while Nakashima is on the list for the BNP Paribas Primrose in Bordeaux, France.

Hurkacz, No. 28 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is the highest-ranked player on either list and has not competed on the ATP Challenger Tour since 2019. Home favourites Lorenzo Sonego and Luciano Darderi are the among the potential starters in Turin, where 17 players inside the Top 100 are on the entry list.

Other Italians that could compete in Turin include Luca Nardi and defending champion Francesco Passaro. Last year, Passaro defeated five Top 100 players en route to the title, becoming the first player since Robin Soderling in 2009 to achieve that feat at the Challenger level. 

In Bordeaux, Nakashima is joined on the entry list by fellow Top 50 players Sebastian Baez, Tallon Griekspoor, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Alexandre Muller.

Introduced in 2023, the Challenger 175 category tournaments are held during the second week of select ATP Masters 1000 events and often attract world-class fields. Joao Fonseca won the Arizona Tennis Classic in March while Kovacevic was crowned champion in the Dominican Republic. The ATP Challenger Tour will feature two events at 175 level next week, in Estoril and Aix-en-Provence.

They've been with her, in body and spirit, for some of her biggest wins and most emotional moments.Two years ago, after winning the National Bank Open in Montreal, Pegula posted a poignant tribute to Dexter, her German shepherd, who had passed away a few weeks earlier. She thanked him for “looking out for me” from above, and helping her go from “crying on my couch” to one of the most important titles of her career.“His favorite thing in the world was tennis,” she said.That bittersweet triumph made it even more special when Pegula had a chance to bring Maddie, her mini Australian shepherd, on stage for the trophy ceremony after she made another title run, at the Charleston Open in April. The victory, her first on clay, vaulted her back to a career-high No. 3 in the world, and No. 1 in the States.“The love from your dogs is unreal,” Pegula said last week from Stuttgart, where she was starting her red-clay swing. “They aren't going to sit there and judge you; they just listen and love back, no matter what. They help me bring me back to appreciating the small moments at home, no matter what tough moments I'm facing.”

Pegula's pet love led her to start A Lending Paw, a charity that supports organizations that rescue and rehabilitate dogs. This year, inspired by the health issues that she saw Dexter struggle with, she has taken on a spokesperson role with Maev, a brand that bills itself as “healthy human-grade raw food for dogs.”Now Pegula can sit down and share a meal with her dogs—a prospect she seems to find appetizing.“I love that Maev is human grade, meaning I could eat it if I wanted,” she says.More important, of course, the dogs like it. Pegula says the food helps with their weight and energy level, and the fact that it's frozen makes for less laborious teeth-cleaning duties for her.“Our pets are part of our family,” she says, “so why not do the best to make them feel great?”

As for Pegula the tennis player, she has rarely felt, or played, better than she has over the past six weeks. After a surprisingly early exit at the Australian Open, she worked out the kinks in practice in February, which led to a pent-up explosion of wins in March. She went 17-2, won titles in Austin and Charleston, made the Miami Open final, and overtook her friend and former doubles partner Coco Gauff as the top American on tour.The streak was another validation of the coaching system that Pegula put in place a year earlier. Many were surprised when, at the start of 2024, she ended a successful partnership with David Witt, and replaced him with “The Marks”—Mark Knowles and Mark Merklein—who take turns traveling with her.

Wouldn't hearing two voices leave her confused? After an adjustment period early in 2024, Pegula's results have proven the doubters wrong. Last summer she made her first Grand Slam final, at the US Open, and she looks ready to make another in 2025.“At first it was just getting comfortable and getting into a routine with both, especially on the road,” Pegula says. “Now that we've worked together enough, it feels easy. They get along well, which is important, and they agree on how I should play and what I should improve.”“I like that I can get different outlooks based on what I need at the time. Also, the weeks on the road get long. It's hard spending so much time with just one person. Having two helps mix things up and keeps it fresh.”

Pegula's success with The Marks has taken her back to a place she first reached in 2022, when she jumped from No. 18 all the way up to No. 3. Not much has changed up there over the last three years; the same two players—Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek—are still in front of her. To win a major or move higher, Pegula will likely have to conquer at least one of them, if not both, on a big stage. As of now, she has a combined 6-13 record against the Top 2, and over the last eight months Sabalenka has stopped her in finals at the US Open, Cincinnati and Miami.Pegula is typically matter-of-fact about the number next to her name, and about running up against the same Sabalenka-Swiatek ceiling over and over. To her, just having the chance to face them is a sign of success.“It's funny because there are a lot of people who didn't realize I've been No. 3 before,” she says. “To me there's not that much of a difference.”“Aryna and Iga are proving week in and week out that they're at their best consistently. Playing them a lot means I'm going deep in tournaments, and that's just the challenge you face when you're trying to be the best.”

Clay has challenged me to adapt; I'm excited to see if I can use those tools this swing. Jessica Pegula

Does Pegula have a chance of being the best this time around? Now 31, she was a late-bloomer whose rise was stalled by injury multiple times. She didn't crack the Top 10 until she was 28. For most of her career, the idea of winning a Grand Slam title or becoming No. 1 may have felt like a distant dream. While those dreams have slowly come closer to fruition, maybe some of that un-entitled mindset is still with her.When a reporter mentioned to her that Swiatek is a “fast-twitch” athlete, Pegula joked that she must be “slow-twitch.” When another reporter asked what she thought she “represented,” Pegula said, “maybe I'm the one who sees things in perspective.” Before her final with Sabalenka in Miami, she said that winning would be “awesome,” but even if she lost, she would be “super excited about where I put myself at the beginning of the year.”In that match, and in her other recent final-round losses to Sabalenka, I had the sense that Pegula had to work herself up to believing that she had a chance to win. In Cincinnati and at the US Open, she played better as the match went along, and grew more confident that she could counter Sabalenka's bombs from the baseline. Both times, though, her surge came too late to get her into a third set. After the final in New York, Pegula described herself as “annoyed” by the loss, and how close she had been, as if her expectations for herself had risen as the match went along.

Pegula is a flat-hitting hard-courter at heart, and she usually plays her best tennis during the North American summer swing. This year she has peaked earlier, just as clay season begins. Normally, this is a time and place where hot streaks by Americans go to die. Could it be different for Pegula over the next couple of months? She just won on green clay in Charleston, and she has made the Madrid final and the Roland Garros quarters.“Maybe it's not naturally the best suited for my game, but I don't mind clay at all,” she says. “It has challenged me to adapt and change a few things, but I love that challenge. I feel like I've added things to my game I didn't have before, and I'm excited to see if I can use those tools and execute them this swing.”Pegula has scaled the mountain again. With three Grand Slams ahead, and just two players above her, the next five months may be her best chance to reach take the few steps to the top.

The 'John Wick' and 'Hunger Games' studio got overwhelmingly support from investors for a full separation to create two standalone publicly-traded companies.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Lionsgate investors have given their backing to the proposed full separation of Lionsgate and Starz into standalone publicly-traded companies.


	During a special shareholders meeting on Wednesday, shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the planned splitting of the studio business and Starz, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. Other proxy resolutions, including voting in a new slate of board of director nominees and another on executive compensation, also received strong approvals by a majority vote.




	The vote tallies from the shareholders meeting were released by Lionsgate as part of an SEC filing on Thursday. Investors voted on a proposed formal separation of the studios business, to be called Lionsgate Studios Corp., and its media networks business, mainly Starz, which is to be renamed Starz Entertainment Corp.

	As part of the separation proposal, 72.5 million class A shares were voted in favor of the transaction, while 128,587 voted against. And 125.9 million class B shares voted to support the transaction, while 922,864 shares voted against. The proposal required two-thirds of the votes cast to support the transaction to secure overall approval.

	After the separation, Lionsgate will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LION, while Starz will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol STRZ. Earlier, Lionsgate spun off its film and TV studios business in a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) to create a separately traded public company, with an eye to a formal separation from Starz down the road.


	That allowed Lionsgate Studios to launch as a standalone company with a listing on NASDAQ, with its biggest assets being a vast library of movies and television franchises. After the closing of the planned formal separation to create the two separately traded public companies, the goal appears to be creating two companies so investors can value the Starz and studio assets separately amid a contracting media and entertainment landscape and financial markets uncertainty.

The Hollywood Reporter went inside the showcase of 150 posters, hand-painted by director Yang Yu, aka Jiaozi, to get a firsthand sense of the passion that the $2 billion-plus movie hit has ignited in its fans.

Ne Zha, a mischievous underdog, has put a spell not only on China and its box office, but also on other parts of the globe. Enlight Pictures' Ne Zha 2 recently topped the $2 billion box office milestone to become the world's highest-grossing animated hit of all time.


	It comes as no surprise then that the 15th edition of the Beijing International Film Festival, which runs through April 26, has scheduled events to celebrate the huge success, including a special exhibition of hand-painted posters.




Ne Zha is an imaginative twist on Chinese mythology and a famous 16th-century novel. In the 2019 original, the namesake hero is born an underdog and the reincarnation of a demon. And he must overcome his fate to save his village. In the sequel, Ne Zha faces new trials as he challenges the corrupt gods and demons who oversee the heavens.

	On Thursday, The Hollywood Reporter had a chance to walk through the exhibition of 150 posters for the sequel, hand-painted by director Yang Yu, aka Jiaozi (meaning “dumpling”), that also celebrates its key box office milestones so far.


	The visit also provided an opportunity to soak up some of the excitement that his fans brought to the special Beijing experience.


	At the entrance of the showcase at the Chinese capital's Langyuan Station event space, people use communications and social media platform WeChat to scan a QR code and then show their WeChat confirmation to an attendant to enter. 


	Fans are then greeted by the poster shown on the photo above before entering an area that displays the hand-drawn posters and also lets them discover cutouts and other visual displays of Ne Zha and other characters from the film franchise. Even though THR walked through the space at a less busy time, visitors, younger and older, were busy trying to avoid stepping into the frame of others excitedly snapping photos. 


	It surely helps add another layer to the experience, but you don't really need to be able to read and understand Chinese to find the posters in the exhibition, including the ones in the picture above, entertaining.


	And you start feeling like you are getting more insight into the mind of Jiaozi, who became an overnight celebrity in China, and a role model for some, after the first Ne Zha movie's success.

	











	After all, he is understood to have channeled his unconventional spirit into Ne Zha and its sequel. In the Ming Dynasty-era text Fengshen Yanyi (also known as The Investiture of the Gods), a well-known work of classical Chinese mythology, Ne Zha is one of the heroes. But he has often been portrayed as an attractive young figure, while the hit animation films depict him as a mischievous boy with cute and ugly features. 


	You probably don't even have to have seen the Ne Zha films to enjoy 15 minutes of fun in the free exhibition about the lovably defiant underdog character who has to overcome prejudice.


	The end of the exhibition in Beijing gives us a bit of a taste for the passion that the animated character has ignited in its fans. First, there is a big wall that is full of scribbled text and drawings from fanboys and fangirls.


	And then there is a small merchandising area, including such products as key chains and drinking bottles. On Thursday, families and single visitors were busily asking for the prices of various items and lining up for a spot to pay for a souvenir. Somewhere, Ne Zha is watching — probably, with a mischievous smile.

After blowback for their ""F--k Israel"" graphics, the Northern Irish group said they've spoke about Palestine at every gig since their formation.

	Gil Kaufman



	Northern Irish hip-hop group Kneecap have responded to calls from Sharon Osbourne to have their U.S. work visas revoked following their airing of anti-Israel messages during the trio's second Coachella weekend appearance. In an email to Rolling Stone, group member Mo Chara  (born Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) said that the messaging was in keeping with their career-long views on Palestine.

	He said the group have talked about Palestine “at every single gig since the band's formation, long before [the deadly Hamas attack on Israeli civilians] October 2023 as the oppression and brutal occupation of Palestine has been ongoing for 77 years.” 

	











	Kneecap claim that their anti-Israel messages were censored on the livestream of their set during the first weekend of Coachella, but at the end of their show last Friday (April 18) they closed by projecting the phrases: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people… It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.” The audience then reportedly broke into a “Free Palestine” chant.


	“Not the only thing that was cut – our messaging on the US-backed genocide in Gaza somehow never appeared on screens either,” Kneecap wrote on their social feeds in response to reports about the first weekend feed cut. “Back next Friday Coachella and it'll be sorted,” they promised before the controversial second weekend set.


	“We believe we have an obligation to use our platform when we can to raise the issue of Palestine, and it was important for us to speak out at Coachella as the USA is the main funder and supplier of weapons to Israel as they commit genocide in Gaza,” Chara told RS. “As I said from the stage, ‘The U.S. government could stop the genocide tomorrow.' It's important that young Americans hear and know it.”


	He added that the band didn't initially realize their political statements were not viewed when the YouTube livestream was cut off. “We only heard about it the next day and haven't heard from anyone officially,” he said. “It's not surprising, large companies don't like to hear the truth unless it suits their narrative and pocket.”


	Chara said the “Free Palestine” chant is something that “happens at all of our gigs from Spain to Scotland and Ireland to Iceland because people know what's happening is wrong and are angry about it. The crowd chanting ‘Free Palestine' at Coachella was a message of solidarity to the people of Gaza from regular Americans who want to see an end to the genocide, despite their government's arming and funding Israel.”

	











	According to The Hollywood Reporter, insiders claimed Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett was “blindsided” by Kneecap's actions. In lengthy note condemning Kneecap's actions, Osbourne decried what she called the politicization of Coachella, saying that this year's shows will be remembered “as a festival that compromised its moral and spiritual integrity… Goldenvoice, the festival organizer, facilitated this by allowing artists to use the Coachella stage as a platform for political expression,” she said of the event, where a number of other acts, including Green Day, Bob Vylan and Blonde Redhead, respectively, altered lyrics to reflect the plight of Palestinian children and displayed Palestinian flags on stage. “At a time when the world is experiencing significant unrest, music should serve as an escape, not a stage for political discourse,” Osbourne said. 


	“While festivals like Coachella showcase remarkable talent from around the globe, music's primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organizations or spreading hate,” London-born Osbourne added, ending with a call for the “revocation of Kneecap's work visa.”


	“As someone with both Irish Catholic on my Mothers side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on my Fathers side, and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved,” Osbourne, who has managed husband Ozzy Osbourne for more than 45 years, added. “Goldenvoice's claim of being ‘blindsided' by Kneecap's performance seems implausible given the circumstances. I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap.”

	











	In the wake of Hamas unprovoked attack on Israeli citizen on Oct. 7, 2023 in which nearly 1,200 mostly civilian Israelis were killed and nearly 250 were taken hostage, Israel has waged a devastating war against the militant group in the Gaza Strip and West Bank in which a reported 50,000 people have been killed and most of the territories' infrastructure has been decimated. One of the most devastating attacks on Oct. 7 was a raid on the EDM Nova Music Festival  celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, where Hamas militants killed 364 civilians, as well as wounding and sexually assaulting scores more.


	Kneecap's actions at Coachella are in keeping with what has been described as a long-held solidarity between the people of Northern Ireland and Palestinians based on the 800-year British occupation of Ireland that lasted until 1921.


	Organizers of the Nova Festival have invited Kneecap to view the Nova Oct. 7 6:29 a.m. – The Moment Music Stood Still: The Nova Music Festival Exhibition in Los Angeles — a chronicle of the Hamas attack on the music fest brought to the U.S. by HYBE America CEO and former Justin Bieber manager Scooter Braun —  to “experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those who are still being held hostage,” according to RS, which reported that Chara did not respond to questions about whether they'd accept that offer. 


	The call from Osbourne to have Kneecap's visas revoked for their anti-Israel sloganeering comes as the Trump administration has been targeting universities for defunding and revoking the visas and/or deporting students who it says participated in protests against Israel's war in Gaza.

	











	Kneecap, which also features members Naoise Ó Cairealláin (stage name Móglaí Bap) and JJ Ó Dochartaigh (stage name DJ Próvaí), are slated to launch their largest North American tour to date in October.

""It's not my job to ruin their night,"" the comedian says of checking in with Blanco & his fiancée Selena Gomez about a joke

	Despite her success at celebrity roasts and comedy specials, comedian Nikki Glaser revealed at the TIME100 Summit on Wednesday (April 23) that there was one joke she told during the 2025 Golden Globes on Jan. 5 that she worried went too far.


	“I didn't say anything that was like, calling anyone ugly or fat,” she told TIME deputy editor Kelly Conniff in New York City. “I think I get a reputation of being mean because of the roasts. I'm hired to be mean for those. [At] the Golden Globes, it's not my job to ruin their night.”

	











	However, she conceded she was initially concerned enough about a quip aimed at Selena Gomez's fiancé, producer Benny Blanco, that she ended up texting Blanco to get his permission to go ahead with the line.

	“I said that ‘Selena Gomez is here because of Emilia Pérez and Benny Blanco is here because of the genie who granted him that wish.' And looking back, I'm like, that could [seem] mean, because everyone's like, ‘He's not attractive enough for her,'” she said. “For me, I've never looked at them and actually thought that. I feel like she won too. I think he's really cool. So, because that joke didn't actually come from a mean place, I felt like it was OK for me to say.”


	Still, she was concerned enough about it that she texted him. “I got his number. I said ‘You don't know me, but I'm hosting this thing, and I hear you're going to be there. Can I say that you're there because a genie granted you a wish?' He was like, ‘That's hilarious; let me run it by Selena.' We were all just waiting in the writers' room. He said ‘Selena thinks it's great.' So they gave me permission. It was actually Jimmy Kimmel who told me if you're worried about a joke and how it's going to go over, just ask them.”


	The fact that Glaser reached out to Blanco to get his permission to tell a borderline-mean joke shows her character. And the fact that Blanco gave her the go-ahead to tell a joke at his expense shows his.


	Gomez was nominated for three awards at this year's Golden Globes: best supporting actress, motion picture for Emilia Pérez as well as two awards (acting and executive producing) for Only Murders in the Building. She didn't go home with a Globe, but she went home with something better – a partner who is secure in himself and has a good sense of humor.

	











	Glaser was the first woman to host the Globes solo and has already been hired to lead the awards show again in 2026.


	At the TIME event, she said that she sensed that the audience this year was unsure of how hard she was going to go in her humor. “When I first walked out, I knew the energy was like ‘We don't know what she's going to do. We've seen her do the Tom Brady roast most recently' – that's kind of where I popped for most people. In retrospect, I looked back at how terrified they all looked because they were like, ‘She's going to roast us! She's going to be just as mean as she was to Tom Brady.' So, I heard from a lot of them that they were really, really scared. I wish I would have known that. I would have done something to defuse that a little bit.


	“Next time is going to be a lot more fun because I think they know the tone that I have now. I go [for jokes], but I'm not going to embarrass you. And if you laugh, I'm only going to make you look good because you're going to look so relatable laughing. It's one of the best ways for an untouchable kind of celebrity on a pedestal to look normal.”


	Here's a link to Glaser's 17-minute conversation at the TIME100 Summit.

The video for Lorde's first new single in four years also features footage shot at Tuesday's pop-up event in New York City.

	Just a day after surprising fans with an in-person preview of her new single, Lorde has officially dropped her latest track, “What Was That.”


	Announced by the New Zealand singer just 12 hours before its arrival, “What Was That” serves as Lorde's first piece of new music since her 2021 album Solar Power. Co-produced by Lorde alongside Jim-E Stack and Dan Nigro, the single arrives as less of a continuation of her previous record and more of a revisiting of her chart-topping 2018 album Melodrama.


	“What Was That” received its live debut on Tuesday (April 22) in New York City's Washington Square Park. The singer initially invited fans to “meet me in the park” for an unspecified event which was soon shut down by local law enforcement due to a lack of appropriate permits for a concert event.

	Though it's unclear if a concert from Lorde was the original plan, patient fans who remained after being told to move on by law enforcement were rewarded by an appearance from the singer. Thanking fans for their support, Lorde didn't perform the new single live, but danced along to the track as it was played by Dev Hynes of Blood Orange fame.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Footage of this appearance has also appeared in the accompanying music video for “What Was That,” which captures Lorde on location in various areas around New York City.


	Lorde has been teasing her new era for two weeks now, first previewing “What Was That” by way of her debut video on TikTok, and later sharing voice memos with fans to raise excitement about what was to come. “I just wanted to say hi, because everything is about to change,” she said in the message. “These are the last moments where it's just us, which is crazy. But so right. I'm so ready.”

The festival's brand and IP are on the market after the follow-up event was indefinitely ""postponed."" 


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



Billy McFarland says he's ready to sell Fyre Festival 2 to the highest bidder.


	Earlier today, the convicted fraudster took to social media to post a mea culpa about his failures as a festival promoter while once more rebranding Fyre Festival as “one of the most powerful attention engines in the world,” in his words.


	The double-speak is part of McFarland's attempt to liquidate Fyre Festival's only assets — its trademarks and IP — to the highest bidder now that Fyre Fest 2 has been indefinitely postponed. Early this month, government officials with the city of Playa del Carmen, Mexico, poured cold water on the long-shot festival — designed in part to rehabilitate McFarland's image following the disastrous, aborted 2017 edition of the event in the Bahamas that resulted in global mockery, competing documentary films and a federal prison sentence for McFarland — by writing on social media that “there is no record or planning of any such event in the municipality.”


	McFarland has said the idea for a follow-up festival came to him while serving time in solitary confinement, and he began pitching Fyre Festival 2 after his release from prison in 2022, hyping his plans on social media with splashy videos and spurious claims. As McFarland would finally admit on Wednesday (April 23), he has failed to regain the trust of fans, major talent agencies and the municipal government of Playa Del Carmen.


	In his letter to fans, McFarland explained, “I can't risk a repeat of what happened in Playa Del Carmen, where support quickly turned into public distancing once media attention intensified,” noting, “For FYRE Festival 2 to succeed, it's clear that I need to step back and allow a new team to move forward independently, bringing the vision to life on this incredible island.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	On Fyre's website, where McFarland once hawked $1.1 million ticket packages for Fyre Fest 2, he now features a short pitch deck for the sale of Fyre's IP, sharing details about Fyre's web traffic and Google analytics while noting he's ready to hand off the tarnished brand. 


	Giving control “to a new group is the most responsible way to follow through on what we set out to do: build a global entertainment brand, host a safe and legendary event, and continue to pay restitution to those who are owed from the first festival,” McFarland wrote, noting that he owes his victims from the first Fyre Festival more than $26 million.


	On Monday (April 21), news broke of Fyre's first licensing deal: an agreement for Fyre Music Streaming Ventures, LLC, a fan-curated on-demand music video streaming service and ad-supported TV channel. As its founder, Shawn Rech, told Billboard: “I just want people to remember the [Fyre] name.”

Firmly established as an icon to British youth, the Londoner discusses his upcoming fourth album, masculinity in the wake of Netflix's Adolescence and his huge Glastonbury slot.


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



The shift in Loyle Carner's persona in recent times is exemplified by the opening songs on his two most recent LPs. On “Hate,” the scorching opener to 2022's hugo, the south Londoner starts by offering to “let me tell you about what I hate.” He rages against racial profiling, the limited opportunities for young Black men, the pitfalls of his own success and his relationship with his father, concluding: “I fear the color of my skin.”


	Now, on his upcoming fourth album, hopefully ! (Island EMI), he strikes a different chord. The opening track — as yet unannounced — is built around a skittish drum beat and soft guitars, and sees Carner, a father of two, singing amid the hum of domesticity. His son plays the xylophone while Carner ponders about his sleeping youngsters, “What language do they speak inside your dreams?” It has the feel of light peeking through the curtains amid the dawn chorus. Let him tell you what he loves.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	When we meet Carner for his first Billboard U.K. cover shoot — and first interview about hopefully ! — he brings that lightness with him. The 30-year-old arrives in London on a break from filming a TV project in Scotland, excited about an upcoming holiday with his girlfriend and two children. hopefully ! (due June 20) is about healing, unconditional love and this new phase of his life; recent double A-side “all i need” and “in my mind” both showcase a sense of serenity and contentment with his lot.


	“My relationship with [hopefully !] throughout was quite healthy,” he says in a quiet corner of Shoreditch Studios. “I didn't have grand expectations and didn't put loads of pressure on myself. I was able to get to the point where I'm lucky to be able to enjoy it.” In the past, he was “trying to prove something, worrying about what people think” of his music. Now he's just grateful for the joy these songs give him. He wears a beaming smile as he speaks.


	For the past decade, attention has closely followed Carner (born Ben Coyle-Larner) on his journey to becoming a British youth icon. His debut live performance was supporting MF Doom at a show in Dublin, and by age 17, he was on tour with hip-hop don Nas. Debut LP Yesterday's Gone (2017) was a love letter to the rap that supported him following the death of his stepfather and earned him a nomination for the prestigious Mercury Prize; his sophomore record, Not Waving, But Drowning (2019), spawned a number of streaming hits, including the jazz-tinged “Ottolenghi.”

	











	Throughout his career, he has used his platform to campaign for better awareness of ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), something that he lives with, and the benefits of cooking to help manage those symptoms. His singular voice is a crucial one for Gen Z at a time when British male stars are lacking, and his live shows attract a wide cross-section of U.K. youth culture.


hugo was a huge leap forward. Across the record, he ruminated on his mixed-race heritage (Carner's mother is white; his biological father is Guyanese) and his place in British society, enlisting esteemed poet John Agard for a spoken word meditation on “Georgetown,” produced by Madlib. On “Blood on My Nikes,” Carner contemplates the knife crime epidemic among young men — both as victims and perpetrators — in the capital. It's a socially conscious record, but not overwhelmingly bleak, either; he knows when to pair light with shade in order to document the human experience.


	It was his depiction of a difficult relationship with his biological father that resonated with listeners. For many years, the pair were estranged, with Carner describing him as “present at times and not present at other times.” hugo was written and recorded as Carner became a father himself, reflecting on the cycle of resentment and anguish, and how to rebuild a parental relationship. The album closed with “HGU,” seeing the pair share a mundane conversation about driving lessons, which Carner took with his father during the pandemic lockdown.


hugo became his highest-charting and best-selling album yet, landing at No. 3 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart and earning him another Mercury Prize nomination. The Guardian called it a “beautiful, blistering masterpiece.” He reimagined the album with an orchestra for a one-off show at London's Royal Albert Hall, headlined Wembley Arena and then hosted an even bigger performance at London's All Points East Festival in August 2024. The 35,000-capacity gig cemented his place at British music's top table, with a supporting cast of OutKast's André 3000 and, to come full circle, Nas. In June, he'll headline Glastonbury's The Other Stage, putting him on a par with Charli xcx and The Prodigy.

	











	“I think that [hugo] was necessary for a lot of people,” he says of the album's success. “I still have people messaging me saying, ‘Yo, I just heard that album for the first time yesterday, and it made me want to go and connect with my mum, or grandad,' or whoever. That to me is the beauty of it, that it's still doing its job.”


hopefully ! is something of a departure for Carner. More in tune with his love for alternative and indie music, his hip-hop stylings make way for inspiration by Irish rockers Fontaines D.C., cult star Mk.gee, Big Thief, Idles and more. The band he assembled for hugo's live shows followed him into the studio to bring new textures to his compositions.


	“It's a lot of pressure to step out singularly as a rapper. And I'm not even, like, a ‘rapper.' I just make music, and people like to put me in that box,” he says. “I loved the anonymity of being in a band. I wanted to be around when the magic is happening and to not just be sent a beat after all the fun parts had already happened. I wanted to move away from the words being all that I can contribute.”


	Carner's pen is still mighty, but in a different way. Since his earliest releases, his words have been what has carried him forward and provided renewed inspiration. On 2019's “Still,” which he described as his “favourite-ever song” during its performance at the Royal Albert Hall, he speaks about his insecurities with a disarming honesty. The rhyming couplets on hugo's “Nobody Knows (Ladas Road)” and “Homerton” show remarkable dexterity. He knows when to build tension, but also when to let the words breathe. It's a skill he learned from his poet heroes like Agard and the late, great Benjamin Zephaniah, the man Carner was named after.


	As his family has grown, Carner's techniques and influences have changed. He describes his son as his muse, and his presence is felt throughout the album. hopefully !'s artwork features a snap of Carner and his son, with colorful scrawls and additions only a child can make with such purpose. His voice babbles away throughout the record and his mischievous personality shines. Words could not contain the emotions Carner feels toward him, so the songs became looser, less literal but still emotionally resonant, and with a greater focus on capturing his son's “melodic” personality in his songwriting structures.

	











	On one album highlight, Carner speaks of the transition of becoming a father and notes that he's “falling asleep in a chair I used to write in.” Later, he speaks directly to his son, saying, “You give me hope in humankind.” He has learned to embrace sonic imperfections and to capture a feeling, letting broad brushstrokes stand proudly. There's a childlike wonder to the rawness of these songs; from snatches of phrases to choruses that linger in your head long after music has ended.


	“If you try and color around something or touch it up… you always f–k it up,” Carner says. “That's what I love about my son's paintings. It might even be just one line across the page, but the simplicity of how he works and moves on. That's how I feel now.”


	Carner used the opportunity to embrace his role as a producer-curator. “As a rapper, the insecurity is that I don't have any musical talent or whatever, so I'm like, ‘F–k, I better fill every gap so people know that I was there, too.' But now I don't mind people hearing a song and I'm barely on it, because I'm so across from everything else [in the creative process].”


	He sings much of what's on hopefully !; singing with his son on his bike, in the car and at home encouraged him to let his voice shine. “He never says, ‘Dad you're way out of tune,' even if I know that I am.” Here, Carner's voice has an intimate quality, like he's caught singing under his breath without a thought as to who might hear it.

	











	He adds: “It's fearless, but I'm not embarrassed about it and I don't care because that's the truth of how I felt. It's that kind of bravery to me that is a reflection of what it was like to be a man. This living, breathing, feeling, flawed, emotional person that is willing to turn over heavy stones and be accountable for failing.”


	Entering his 30s and becoming a parent for a second time brought Carner an emotional clarity about his relationship with his biological father. His stepfather, Nik, who raised him alongside his mother, Jean, died suddenly in 2014 when he was 19. The forthcoming LP encouraged him to embrace his softer side and the personality traits that Carner wished he had experienced with his biological father.


	“Me and my dad are cool now, but he wasn't really around when I was young,” he says. It was time to take a different approach. “My inner child is getting an experience of fatherhood that I never had, which is crazy. I'm not only being a father to my son, I'm also being a father to myself. I'm a person that I never thought I could become.”


	Making the record has given Carner a greater perspective about his role and place in the world and in the family dynamic. “I'm not the main character in the movie any more. It's my son and daughter's film, and I'm just some extra in that.”


	Carner has long been an advocate for a more healthy relationship with masculinity, having worked with suicide prevention charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably). He gave a passionate speech at Reading & Leeds Festival in August 2023 decrying the “toxic masculine bulls–t” that plagued his childhood. His records and shows have helped unlock certain conversations, but the issue remains prescient. Netflix's streaming hit Adolescence, which examines the fallout from a misogynistic murder by a 13-year-old boy, has sparked new discussions around the manosphere and its pervasive influence.

	











	Carner saw the intensity of the show — which uses one-shot takes — up close on-set; he's close friends with actor-creator Stephen Graham and director Philip Barantini. The topics at hand need urgent attention, Carner says. “We're at an essential need for conversation for young boys to let go of this fear, frustration and anxiety and be able to pass it to someone.


	“I'm very glad that my son has my daughter to live with,” he adds. “That's a huge thing for me, and also for me to be in the presence of someone who is growing up to be a woman. For my son, it's even crazier, as it's so natural and safe and understood and demystified.”


	The aforementioned Zephaniah features on hopefully !, a full-circle moment for Carner, given his profound influence on his life and as a male role model. Zephaniah, who died in 2023 at 65, was a towering figure in literature, music and politics, vocalizing the Black experience in post-war Britain. Carner honors his hero by sampling a clip of Zephaniah speaking on the Brixton riots, but also the potential and hope of the youth to change things.


	“He articulates something that my brain has always wanted to say about masculinity,” Carner says. “Kids that look like me or are stereotyped are full of feeling and emotion and pain, shame, joy, guilt, hope and naivety. And nobody knows how to deal with it.”

	











	Why that clip? “He's saying what I'm saying about having pent-up rage and emotion; I'd rather use my pen to express it that way in a palatable and safe way.”


	Zephaniah's work, Carner says, taught him how to be a man who feels secure in himself. “His work shows the joy of not taking life so seriously and realizing that it's fine to be a bit lighter or softer, and know that it doesn't discredit my legacy or my story to be silly and to let go.”


Later this year, Carner will head on a mammoth U.K. and Ireland tour that takes in residencies at some of the nation's most historic venues, like London's Brixton Academy and Manchester, England's Victoria Warehouse. Before then, he'll headline The Other Stage at Glastonbury Festival on the Friday-night lineup (June 27) alongside Charli xcx and The Prodigy; it follows his 2023 top billing on the West Holts stage. Recent headliners on the coveted Other Stage include Megan Thee Stallion and Lana Del Rey — comfortably putting him in the big leagues alongside international superstars.


	When the slot is mentioned, he's speechless for a moment. “It feels like an amazing, monumental part of my career,” Carner eventually says. His whole family will be coming to watch on Friday, and then he can celebrate the rest of the weekend and “go see Doechii” the following night on the West Holts stage.


	It's just one page in this new chapter. In March, it was announced that Carner would star in an acting role for BBC's upcoming crime drama Mint, directed by Charlotte Regan (Scrapper) alongside Emma Laird (28 Years Later) and Sam Riley (Control). The new disciplines that have come with being on-set have inspired him to write and direct his own upcoming project. He wants to promote poetry workshops in schools to the next generation. There are many strings to Carner's bow as a complex, charismatic cultural figure.


	He's most excited for hopefully ! to come out and for his children to hear the snapshot of this moment, about this family, and about the man their dad was when they were little. But what about the fans' reaction to the new sound and what they might take from it? “Honestly, I don't care. It's totally up to them. They could take nothing and not find it for 10 or 20 years or even hate it, but…”


	Carner throws his arms up and laughs. “I haven't even thought about it, actually. I hope that people that do find it and that it can be a good friend to them.”

	Cannes parallel section Directors' Fortnight has added Israeli director Nadav Lapid's Yes! (Ken!) to its 2025 selection.


	Set in the aftermath of the October 7, Hamas attacks on Israel, the film revolves around a struggling jazz musician, and his wife Jasmine, a dancer, who give their art, souls, and bodies to the highest bidder, bringing pleasure and consolation to their bleeding country.


	This endeavor sees the jazz musician entrusted with a mission of the utmost importance: to set a new national anthem to music.

	Lapid was last in Cannes in 2021 with Ahed's Knee which shared the Jury Prize with Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Memoria. Prior to that, he was in Cannes with breakout feature The Kindergarten Teacher, which premiered in Critics' Week in 2014.


	His new film is one of two Israeli features playing in Cannes this year alongside Or Sinai's debut feature Mama, which was among 16 titles added to the Official Selection on Wednesday.


Yes! joins 18 other features previously announced for the section, overseen by the French Directors Guild (Société des Réalisateurs de Films), which include Enzo by late director Laurent Cantet and Robin Campillo, Eva Victor's Sorry, Baby and Christian Petzold's Miroirs No. 3.


	The 57th edition runs from May 14-22.

	Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap have responded to criticism over their controversial Coachella performance, after Sharon Osbourne called for them to have their U.S. working visas revoked.


	The band met fierce criticism from several quarters, including Osbourne and Fox News, after their performance last Friday at Coachella's Sonora stage included projections “fuck Israel” and “free Palestine” and other messages of protest against U.S. support of the Israel-Hamas war.


	After being approached for comment by BBC News Northern Ireland over the backlash, Kneecap, whose autobiographical movie won several awards last year, said: “Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.”

	The trio's manager, Daniel Lambert, also told Irish radio that the band received praise for their actions, but also a number of death threats that were “too severe to get into.”

	Their comments came after reality TV star and wife of rocker Ozzy Osbourne said Kneecap should not have included “aggressive political statements” in their set, adding: “Music's primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organisations or spreading hate.” She also demanded U.S. authorities revoke their working visas.


	Earlier this week, the divisive set saw Jewish organization the Simon Wiesenthal Center denounce the group, saying it was “remarkable that Kneecap used a music festival to foment hate, exactly the kind of gathering where, on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists brutally murdered, raped, burned and kidnapped innocent young people at the Nova Music Festival in Israel.” At the same time, it offered them the chance to visit its Roxbury Drive office to discuss the impacts of their actions.


	Since the war broke out after the Hamas-led terror attack on Israel 19 months ago, more than 51,300 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-led health ministry. Almost 2,000 have died from Israeli military actions since a ceasefire ended on March 18. Israel continues to demand the release of 59 hostages it says Hamas is still holding, around 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. Around 1,200 Israelis were killed in the October 7 attacks. An Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid in Gaza, which has been condemned by the UN, remains in place.

Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said.

In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen.

“I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. “No matter what happens with PK and I, he's always been my best friend, my husband, we're family. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.”

A post shared by PK (@paul_kemsley_pk)

In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began.

Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. But when he was invited to attend the reunion taping, he declined and sent a statement instead.

Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion.

“I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com.

“Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. “That statement is both heartbreaking and false. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.”

“Those closest to us know the truth,” PK added. “Many have wanted to speak out, but I have asked them not to because the truth should never need a champion. I refused to stoke a fire I did not ignite. The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. That woman embodied kindness, integrity, and grace. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.”

A post shared by Dorit Kemsley (@doritkemsley)

PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. Am I correct?” Dorit responded that she was wrong.

In a confessional, Kemsley explained, “There are times that I think PK's the greatest father in the world. But is he the most hands-on father? The truth is, no. He would disappear and be gone for weeks and weeks without even calling the kids. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.”

Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. She explained that her comment came as she was still reeling from a multi-page email her ex had sent her.

Speaking with Rollacoaster, Kemsley said she never wants to go  “toe to toe” with PK.

“I know his feelings about what I had said in the moment about him not being a great dad, I not only apologized to him, but I – in my confessional and in the after show – immediately took it back and explained that this is after a couple of months of not speaking, I was really worried about the kids,” she explained. “I felt very, very bad. It was in a weak, vulnerable moment after a seven-page vicious email. You can only take the high road for so long.”

While her marital problems are still being sorted out, Kemsley said she is looking forward to her next chapter. “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Carrie Underwood Admits Feeling Simon Cowell Put a 'Target on My Back' During Her 'American Idol' Journey","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/carrie-underwood-simon-cowell-prediction/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:59:21 GMT","

As the top 14 contestants on season 23 of “American Idol” prepare for the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame episode, knowing viewers' votes will send two of them home, judge Carrie Underwood remembers her own Top 12 episode with fondness and fear. 

On April 24, 2025, as part of her “Idol to Icon” web series, the country superstar reviewed her performance from the same week of competition back in 2005, when she sang Heart's “Alone.” She did so well that then-judge Simon Cowell made the now-infamous prediction that she'd not only win the competition, but “sell more records than any other previous Idol.”

Although his feedback was thrilling to hear, Underwood admitted she felt like she suddenly had “a target on my back.” 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Underwood blew away the judges with her performance of “Alone,” with Randy Jackson telling her it was “one of your best performances yet” and Paula Abdul applauding her “taking risks.” 

Cowell, who rarely doled out compliments, told Underwood, “You know, you're not just the girl to beat. You're the person to beat. I will make a prediction. Not only will you win this show, you will sell more records than any other previous Idol.” 

Reflecting on that moment, Underwood paused the video and said, “What an incredible prediction — from me, you know, thinking ‘I'm gonna sing this song, oh my gosh, you know, they're probably gonna hate it, but I'm gonna do it anyway,' and then to get that reaction.” 

She continued, “At the time, I thought, ‘This is amazing,' and then about five seconds later, I thought, ‘I have a target on my back. Now everybody's gonna hate me.' Just because that's a such a bold tip me, you told me I was going to win the show. I remember thinking people might not like me after that, and being really nervous.”

Of course, Underwood did go on to win the show and sell more records than any “Idol” in history. When a producer of the “Idol to Icon” web series asked how it feels knowing that, she replied diplomatically. 

“I feel like there's so many incredible artists that have come from this show, winners and non-winners,” she said. “I mean, this is a life changer for so many of us, and we're still … going! And that's, you know,why we're we're here. Now, I would love to, at the end of this, have a winner that you know beats us all you know, in in sales and numbers. That would be absolutely incredible to be a part of that for somebody else.”

Re-watching her performance of “Alone,” Underwood saw her 21-year-old self talk about how she decided to break out of her country music shell and do a rock song instead.

Reflecting on that brave decision, Underwood paused the video and said, “Song choice is so difficult when you are doing something like this, because just as much as people are listening to you sing it, they're thinking about the original song. And I remember week to week, you know, we would get critiqued, and it would be like, ‘Oh, you know, you're playing it so safe. You're beingso safe with your choices.' And it's like, ‘Well, does that matter if I do a good job?'” 

“And this week,” Underwood recalled, “I was like, ‘Okay, I'm just gonna throw caution to the wind. And I think I even remember, like, writing in my journal how much they were not gonna like me singing this song and being not so much worried. I was like, ‘They're gonna hate it, (but) whatever. I really want to do it. So, okay, let's go.' Never know what's gonna happen. Just gotta do the best you can.”

A decade past its namesake video game, Sony's “Until Dawn” adaptation isn't the “best” possible outcome. To get that ending, the studio would've had to move faster, turning its popular PlayStation title from 2015 into a movie — preferably, back when it had a prayer of casting Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek as the mo-cap teens they played then.

The original “Until Dawn” follows a group of grieving friends terrorized by a mysterious presence at a snowy cabin. It's got multiple endings, famously determined by player choice, but the game also has a memorable narrative with the potential to win nostalgia points among gamers at the box office. Theoretically. What director David F. Sandberg does with his take on “Until Dawn” is something altogether stranger, with an approach more bizarre than almost any film 10 years ago would have tried.

Written by Gary Dauberman and Blair Butler, this “standalone” spin-off is set in the same universe as the game but departs from the source material so completely that the title isn't earned at all. It's another blow against Sony's reputation as an opportunistic Hollywood conglomerate. But it's also an inventive experiment with pops of explosive humor that manage to seriously entertain… if not always by design.

We meet our deeply disinteresting heroes at the tail-end of an unusual road trip. Clover (Ella Rubin) lost her mom to cancer last year. Not long after that, her sister, Melanie (Maia Mitchell), disappeared. Now, our wistful protagonist and her friends are looking for clues along the edge of a supernatural abyss known as Glore Valley. Even caring for Clover, the clairvoyant Megan (Ji-young Yoo), the lovestruck Max (Michael Cimino), the headstrong Nina (Odessa A'zion), and the arrogant Abe (Belmont Cameli, a total scene-stealer) will regret stopping to see this particular roadside attraction, several times over.

The desolate area, we learn, is an old mining town. Ambling around a dirt parking lot, it's obvious the newcomers don't fit in. They're quickly warned of the area's many vague dangers by a creepy gas station attendant, played by genre and games icon Peter Stormare. Instantly recognizable to “Until Dawn” players as Dr. Alan J. Hill, the actor's arrival is the first sign that something is really wrong in this otherwise totally forgettable dramedy. You know, besides the cold-open chase scene where we saw Melanie — oh, look, it's Melanie! — scrambling out of a dark hole, running from a monster and a masked murderer, while helplessly screaming, “NO! I CAN'T DIE… AGAIN.” Again? Yeesh.

 










The movie version of “Until Dawn” has been marketed with its so-called time-loop “twist” in plain sight, and that may have been Sony's biggest mistake. The most common character posters show Clover in various states of destruction, seemingly having faced her own death ad infinitum. That fate sounds horrifying, no doubt (see Christopher Landon's “Happy Death Day” for details), and the concept works wonders for the movie overall. With a cursed hotel guest book doubling as their save checkpoint — and a golden skull timer counting down how long they must survive each night — the gang battles an onslaught of enemies to uproarious effect. And yet, front to end, Sandberg's story still betrays its source material by fundamentally misunderstanding why “Until Dawn” was fun.

From developer Supermassive Games, the choose-your-own-nightmare experience is often enjoyed as a multi-player affair. It lets you and your friends embody an entire cast of classic genre characters, each with their own obstacles, survival advantages, and personality quirks. Half the puzzle is anticipating how your favorite meat bag might get picked off thanks to your actions, and unlike your standard Pac-Man or Mario, “Until Dawn” characters don't come back. That made the stakes in the game feel considerably more dramatic. But the film takes the opposite approach, instead finding increasingly inventive ways to make its metaphysically-challenged victims miserable.

 










Caught between “Cabin in the Woods” and the mystifying “Serenity,” “Until Dawn” makes countless gestures at being an incisive horror comedy — some good, some bad — but works better approached as a full-blown spoof. If that was the intent here, a better name might have been something like “Video Game: The Horror Movie” (or maybe “Horror Movie: The Video Game: The Horror Movie?”) A self-aware original moniker that could not only better prepare audiences for the ridiculous grab-bag of carnage to come but even help sell the highest-scoring moments in this baffling attempt as camp.

From Sony Pictures, “Until Dawn” is in theaters Friday, April 25.

A few days before “You” Season 5 premiered on Netflix, I went to see Christopher Landon's “Drop” in theaters. As we emerged from the “punchy, ridiculous thriller” into broad daylight, my friends were quick to dismiss it, to engage in the common but misguided practice of conflating highbrow quality with entertainment value. “Drop” is no cinematic hallmark (though some of Marc Spicer's shots will stay with me for a long time), but it kept me engrossed, entertained, and invested in the final outcome.

The same approach will pay off with the end of “You,” created by Sera Gamble and Greg Berlanti and brought to the bloody finish line by showrunners Michael Foley and Justin W. Lo. If you've stuck with the series thus far, you signed up for outrageous twists, cartoonish characters, and an exorbitant number of murders, all tied together by Penn Badgley‘s bewitching performance. It's not prestige TV, but it's unapologetically entertaining, and Season 5 delivers on everything that got audiences obsessed with this series.

Set a few years after Joe rose from the dead in London, he's now part of a prolific power couple with wife Kate (Charlotte Ritchie) and back in his old Manhattan stomping grounds. Kate and Joe are adored for their against-all-odds love story and fierce philanthropy — but when someone threatens their new status quo, Joe handles it the old-fashioned way and lights the fuse on blowing up his entire life.

There's also a new liability in the form of Bronte (Madeline Brewer), a manic-pixie-literary-dreamgirl perfectly calibrated to unravel Joe with just a look. She's written as a vexatious ingenue, which has to be deliberate, highlighting just how unimaginatively Joe perceives women and how little it takes to tempt him away from the life he allegedly holds so dear (Badgley and Brewer are close to the same age, but Bronte is clearly supposed to be in her early twenties — which reads less as Joe's patronizing impression of her than a classic Hollywood gaslight).

In fact, Joe and Bronte's interactions lead to some of the season's best comedy, all at the expense of our pseudo-feminist murderer (she loves books! she hates the rich! is she The One??). Badgley is legitimately laugh-out-loud funny as his character reacts to her smallest hints of flirtation, falling into his usual patterns with sitcom-level predictability, all reinforcing his constant failure to change. Badgley is still magnificent in a dark, demanding, and disturbing role, turning Joe into a masterclass of internality that never softens his sinister nature. It's been a killer performance, from start to finish, and undoubtedly the reason that the show found both popularity and endurance.

 










He's not the only one having fun during the final hurrah; a cast highlight has to be Anna Camp as Kate's twin half-sisters, both equally exaggerated and delightful. The “Pitch Perfect” star is all but showing off in the scene-stealing dual roles, sinking her teeth into the series' unhinged tone like she's been there from the start (what better way to lean into the show's campiness than with literal Camp?). Griffin Matthews deftly balances this out as grounded brother Teddy, and more players pop in and out throughout the ten episodes.

Like its previous seasons, Season 5 starts slow before gaining momentum — but Netflix made the smart decision to release the whole thing at once, unlike Season 4's misguided two-part drop. The midway twist paves the way for uncharted narrative territory, from Joe's close relationships to his public persona and the unanswered questions from his past. 

Surely, he can't outrun his fate forever — but my goodness, it has been fun to watch him try.

“You” Season 5 is now streaming on Netflix.

Roberto Minervini's narrative debut “The Damned” revisits the U.S. Civil War in a cinema verite style. Minervini, who has helmed a slew of documentary films, deployed his nonfiction techniques for the feature that premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard program. Minervini won the Best Director award for “The Damned” at the festival. 

Jeremiah Knupp, René W. Solomon, Cuyler Ballenger, Noah Carlson, Judah Carlson, Tim Carlson, and Bill Gehring are among the actors playing Civil War soldiers in the feature set during the winter of 1862. The official synopsis reads: “In the midst of the Civil War, the U.S. Army sends a company of volunteer soldiers to the western territories, with the task of patrolling the uncharted borderlands. As their mission ultimately changes course, the meaning behind their engagement begins to elude them.”

Minervini said in a press statement that “The Damned” sets out to undo the tropes of other war films. 

“I've always had an issue with war movies because of the archetypes that are present in them: the idea of the just cause, good versus evil, revenge, heroism,” he said. “There's never been an approach that I would call humane. Instead we have archetypes that propagate false ideas and beliefs about war. It's crazy to me that people tend to trust a government — especially here in the U.S. but not only here — in matters of war and defense. War becomes an untouchable thing and the heroism of war becomes something sacred.” 

“The Damned” also has a timeliness to it amid the current American political climate. “This film is heavily informed by my previous work, for sure, and by my experience of living in the South for more than a decade,” Minervini said. “It was a very conscious choice to go back to a moment where a lot of these roots were being planted: the great divide between North and South, Christianity, a kind of toxic masculinity. I wanted to understand how these issues persist, why there is still a lot of nostalgia for the Civil War, how that time shaped a sense of distrust toward institutions. I wanted the film to tie into the experience of people who were left in limbo during the war, in the middle of a transition from very conservative values to a new society: people who didn't even know what to fight for. Many in the U.S. Army were mercenaries who enlisted without fully grasping the cause. With a country in shambles, people took sides, sometimes geographically, sometimes opportunistically. The approach here was to put a bunch of people in the middle of nowhere, or rather in the wilds of Montana, who are trying to figure out why they are there.” 

 










“The Damned” is produced by Paolo Benzi for Okta Film, Denise Ping Lee and Roberto Minervini for Pulpa Film, and Paolo Del Brocco for Rai Cinema. Teresa Mannino, Jean-Alexandre Luciani, and Annette Fausboll executive produce. 

“The Damned” opens in theaters May 16. Check out the trailer below.

Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi has announced his next film, four years after winning the Cannes Grand Prix in 2021. The Oscar-winning director will helm “Parallel Tales,” also known as “Histoires Parallèles,” with Isabelle Huppert and Vincent Cassel starring. Farhadi is set to begin production in Paris in fall 2025, with a release in France planned for spring 2026.

“Parallel Tales,” which will be a French-language film, brings Farhadi back to France after he previously filmed 2013's “The Past” there. The “Parallel Tales” cast marks the first collaboration between iconic French stars Huppert and Cassel, who will also be joined by Virginie Efira, Pierre Niney, Catherine Deneuve, and “Ghost Trail” breakout Adam Bessa. No other details on the plot are available at this time.

The film will be an official French-Italian-Belgian coproduction between Alexandre Mallet-Guy's Memento Production in France, Andrea Occhipinti's Lucky Red in Italy, and André Logie's Panache Productions and Gaëtan David's La Compagnie Cinématographique in Belgium. 

Anonymous Content in the U.S. will also co-produce the film. Farhadi and David Levine produce. Carole Baraton, Yohann Comte, Pierre Mazars, Yousra Filali, Stefano Massenzi, Chadwick Prichard, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Maciej Musial, and Lila Yacoub are executive producing.

“Parallel Tales” will launch as a sales title during the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, with Charades handling international sales and UTA Independent Film Group for U.S. rights. Memento is already distributing the film in France. 

This is the fifth consecutive collaboration between Farhadi and Memento Productions. The preceding features include 2014's “The Past,” 2016's “The Salesman,” 2018's “Everybody Knows,” and 2021's “A Hero.” 

Farhadi's Golden Globe-nominated “A Hero” was part of a plagiarism lawsuit after one of Farhadi's former students, Azadeh Masihzadeh, alleged that Farhadi based the film off a documentary she had made in one of his Tehran-based filmmaking workshops in 2014. Both her documentary and Farhadi's narrative feature were inspired by a real-life incident in 2011 in which a man in Iran on furlough from a debtors' prison found a bag of gold coins and returned them to their owner rather than keeping them for himself. 

 










“Incorrect information has been corrected,” Farhadi said in May 2022 while serving on the jury of the Cannes Film Festival. “What is in the film ‘A Hero' is different. You have to see why certain journalists spread misinformation. What I did in ‘A Hero' is not related to that workshop; it is based on a current event two years prior. ‘A Hero' is one interpretation of the event. The documentary is another approach, they are not the same at all.”

Farhadi was acquitted by an Iranian court in 2024.

Kanopy, the streamer that's free and accessible to anyone with a library card, has moved from being the “best kept secret” in streaming to the secret being out. At least that's the feeling of Kanopy's GM Jason Tyrell, who has watched as the streamer has grown in popularity since launching in 2008. 

When we spoke with Tyrell in March 2024, Kanopy was accessible via roughly 40 percent of libraries in North America. That number is now closer to 50 percent.

But the next frontier of Kanopy's growth is reaching people who don't yet have a library card and might be inclined to sign up for one or seek one out. That's why Kanopy on Friday is releasing its first original film title as part of a new division at the streamer dedicated to seeking out and distributing original films and series.

The film is called “Banned Together,” a documentary about the history of banning books and the current state of combatting censorship and erasure of literature in U.S. public schools. Just as with any of the other 30,000+ titles Kanopy licenses, “Banned Together” is available to every library using the platform, and anyone accessing Kanopy with a library card can watch it with no added fee or ads. 

The film, directed by Kate Way and Tom Wiggin, follows three students in Beaufort, South Carolina who fought back when 97 books were pulled from their school's library.

Because it's all about books, it's obviously a topic that's close to home for libraries and their continued existence. But “Banned Together” isn't the only project Kanopy hopes to release, and it's all part of the streamer's goal to meet the needs of libraries and an ever evolving academic mandate.

“We've seen the landscape for independent film shift after being very heavily embraced by the major consumer streamers. It's been pretty grim over the past couple of years,” Tyrell said. “Meanwhile, there are these fantastic stories out there that are resonating with audiences; they're just not finding either a production partner or a streaming home that's going to invest in them. So that led us to say, outside of just acquisitions, what can we do that's aligned with the needs of libraries where we can find the right mix of stories that appeal to library audiences in maybe a different way than what they're finding in commercial streaming?”

 










Kanopy came aboard “Banned Together” about two years ago when the film was just beginning production. And while the film seemed like the perfect fit, the decision to branch into originals was hatched hand in hand with becoming a co-producing partner on the documentary. 

Kanopy had already done a number of co-acquisition partnerships, most notably last year's Oscar-nominated doc “Soundtrack to a Coup D'Etat” alongside Kino Lorber, joining the film as its official library and educational distributor. But “Banned Together” is the first time they're working as co-producers and releasing the film exclusively via libraries and academic institutions.

The film will be available through other digital distribution means via FilmHub, and other rights are still available should another streamer or network want to make it (or other future Kanopy originals) available as part of a second release window. Like any producer, even though Kanopy is releasing the film to free for libraries, it has a fiduciary responsibility to the filmmakers to get it to the widest audience possible. That means finding other means of release down the road, be it physical media or broadcast licensing.

Up next for Kanopy: an original, unscripted series called “America's Next Great Author.” Tyrell says it's “The Voice” but for authors, and it's created and hosted by bestseller Kwame Alexander. The series is in development now and will air in 2026. 

 










Tyrell says the goal is to release two to four original titles a year. Kanopy won't be competing with A24 for Sundance titles anytime soon, but Tyrell hopes to pursue not just documentaries but fictional book adaptations that can tap into a crossover audience of film lovers and avid readers. 

“If you think about a library, we don't want to do something throw away. We don't want second screen type content,” Tyrell said. “We're really looking for stories, whether it's documentary or narrative, that feel like they deepen your experience, introduce you to new worlds or perspectives, and things you may not have engaged with before, but also bring an element of charm and delight in the same way that discovering something new at a library uncovers for people.”

“Banned Together” starts streaming Friday, April 25 on Kanopy.

Lorde has shared “What Was That,” her first original solo track since releasing Solar Power in 2021. The single was teased through a series of cryptic social media posts, voice notes, and audio snippets, and Talia Chetrit shot the cover art. Watch the new song's video below.

“What Was That” got its live debut on Tuesday when Lorde sang along to the track at New York's Washington Square Park while playing the song on a small speaker. Hours earlier, the New Zealand pop star sent a mass message via her fan text line that she would appear there: “Meet me in the park Tonight 7pm - x x.” Local police and park rangers quickly shut down the event, however, due to an unmanageable crowd size. Footage from the event is featured in the new video.

Lorde co-wrote “What Was That” with Jim-E Stack, and she co-produced it with Jim-E Stack and Daniel Nigro. Jim-E Stack also provided drums, keyboards, piano, synthesizer, and engineering, while Nigro contributed bass and electric guitar, piano, synthesizer, and engineering. Another notable electric guitarist on the track is Inc. No World's Andrew Aged.

Solar Power, the highly anticipated follow-up to Lorde's 2018 album Melodrama, was led by the singles “Solar Power,” “Stoned at the Nail Salon,” and “Mood Ring.” A majority of songs from the record eventually received music videos, including “Fallen Fruit,” “Leader of a New Regime,” “Secrets From a Girl (Who's Seen It All),” “The Path,” and “Oceanic Feeling.”

Lorde stayed quiet over the next couple of years, popping up to join Muna onstage at New York's Terminal 5 in 2023 and contribute a cover of “Take Me to The River” to A24's Talking Heads tribute album in 2024. Then, last summer, she was tapped by Charli XCX for a remix of the Brat track “Girl, So Confusing,” all but confirming her as the song's original subject. They've since performed “Girl, So Confusing Featuring Lorde” together at Charli XCX's Madison Square Garden concert and, earlier this month, her Coachella weekend one set.

Haim have officially announced their new album, I Quit. Out June 20 via Columbia, the follow-up to 2020's Women in Music Pt. III was produced by Danielle Haim and Rostam Batmanglij. With the announcement comes their third single of 2025, “Down to Be Wrong,” which follows “Relationships” and “Everybody's Trying to Figure Me Out.” Listen to it below before the video release tomorrow morning.

Paul Thomas Anderson, a Haim family friend and longtime collaborator of the band, shot the new album's artwork. Anderson previously directed the trio's videos for “Man From the Magazine” and “Summer Girl,” and he cast Alana Haim in his films Licorice Pizza and One Battle After Another. He also shot the cover artwork for Women in Music Pt. III.

A video revealing the album details presented a series of “I quit” statements, starting with “I quit what does not serve me,” before taking in “overthinking,” “nicotine,” “shame,” “dick,” and “my job,” among other dependencies. The Haim sisters' last release before the I Quit campaign was “Home,” a contribution to Barbie the Album.

Broken Social Scene have announced a new covers album that celebrates their 2003 breakout full-length, You Forgot It in People. Out June 6, via Arts & Crafts, Anthems: A Celebration of Broken Social Scene's You Forgot It in People invites over a dozen artists—including Toro y Moi, Mdou Moctar, the Weather Station, and more—to reimagine a song from the LP. First up is Maggie Rogers and Sylvan Esso's joint take on “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl,” which you can listen to below.

“‘Anthems' is one of those songs that fundamentally changed my life,” Rogers said in a statement. “There's something about the lyrical repetition that functions as a sort of mantra within the song and it made me understand at a very early point in my creative life that music could be a form of meditation. Broken Social Scene has long been one of my all-time favorite bands and covering it with my dear friends Nick and Amelia from Sylvan Esso was an absolute joy beam dream.”

Sylvan Esso added, “It was a joy to cover this beautiful song with Maggie—we all grew up loving this record—to be asked to cover 'Anthems…' together was an honor and led to a truly lovely time.”

On the 20th anniversary of You Forgot It in People, Broken Social Scene once again performed the album in full on a North American tour. During one of those shows, the long list of people who've covered “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl” expanded to include Meryl Streep and Tracey Ullman, who joined the Toronto indie-rock band onstage in New York to sing along.

Last year, the new documentary It's All Gonna Break, directed by Stephen Chung, premiered at Woodstock Film Festival. Drawing its title from the closing track on their self-titled album, the film documents the early years of Broken Social Scene and the creation of their first three albums.

David Thomas, the founder and frontman of the influential, avant-garde rock band Pere Ubu, died yesterday (April 24) at his home in Brighton, England, the band wrote on Facebook. The statement attributed his death to a long illness, adding, “MC5 were playing on the radio. He will ultimately be returned to his home, the farm in Pennsylvania, where he insisted he was to be ‘thrown in the barn.'” Thomas was 71 years old.

During their initial run from 1975 to 1982, Pere Ubu were an untamable band, merging the loose energy of garage rock with 1960s rock, as well as funk bass, unwieldy saxophones, and Thomas' commanding presence. Though they predated the surge of the post-punk genre, Pere Ubu embodied that sound in all of its sharp, pent-up, and unpredictable nature, largely thanks to Thomas' wild spirit and exclamatory delivery of tirades about rejection, war, and defiance. Once alt-rock started taking off in the 1980s, Pere Ubu's artful absurdity inspired other bands in their wake, including Joy Division, Sonic Youth, Pixies, and R.E.M.

Though born in Miami, on June 14, 1953, Thomas primarily grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, where the city's burgeoning rock scene would impact his passions. After toying with the idea of starting a band, Thomas finally started his first formal project, Rocked From the Tombs, in 1974. Their raucous punk take on rock never materialized into a record deal, and the band chose not to enter a studio to record their original songs. Barely a year later, Rocket From the Tombs fizzled out, with Thomas feeling particularly disheartened by his bandmates' desire to play cover songs.

Eager to continue pursuing original music, Thomas funneled his adventurous nature into the formation of a new band, Pere Ubu, with Rocket From the Tombs guitarist Peter Laughner, as well as bassist Tim Wright, drummer Scott Krauss, and synthesizer player Allen Ravenstein. Lifting their name from a character in an Alfred Jarry play—“I wanted to create a band that Herman Melville, William Faulkner or Raymond Chandler would have wanted to be in,” Thomas later said—Pere Ubu debuted with the sprawling, noisy, avant-garde single “30 Seconds Over Tokyo” and followed it with the sneaky jam “Heart of Darkness” and the explosive rock song “Final Solution,” the latter of which would become perhaps their most popular single in underground circles.

After dropping a few more singles, Pere Ubu signed to Blank Records and released The Modern Dance, their debut album, in 1978. Though never a commercial success, the LP made its way into the hands of oddball punks and art-rock weirdos in the Midwest, intriguing many with its aloof approach to merging rock, punk, new-wave, and experimental prog.

A few lineup changes and a brief disbandment later, Pere Ubu had dropped four more albums in a creative frenzy. Song of the Bailing Man briefly served as the band's final album when they broke up in 1982. For their 1987 comeback, Pere Ubu recorded The Tenement Year the following year and picked up major label support, spawning an MTV hit in the shape of “Waiting for Mary” from 1989's Cloudland. Pere Ubu reunited in fits and spurts over the ensuing decades in the hands of Thomas, who remained the only original member throughout the band's tenure, and released 14 albums, not including live records. Pere Ubu's final full-length album with Thomas would be 2023's Trouble on Big Beat Street.

“We aren't experimental—we know what works and what doesn't,” Thomas told Louder Sound in 2024. “If you sit down and really analyse Pere Ubu songs, they don't make a speck of sense, but there is this organic wholeness to it – some of the beats have been flipped around, dropped and picked up again later and you have to remember all that, but it all sounds natural. I think that's a prog rock idea. But I wouldn't want to go out and [be] ‘pastiche.' It would be as false as some white band from Birmingham playing reggae.”

The statement announcing Thomas' death noted that he and his band had been recording a new album. “He knew it was to be his last,” the statement read. “We will endeavour to continue with mixing and finalising the new album so that his last music is available to all. Aside from that, he left instruction that the work should continue to catalog all the tapes from live shows via the official bandcamp page. His autobiography was nearly completed and we will finish that for him. Pere Ubu's Patreon will continue as a community, run by communex.”

The statement concluded, “We'll leave you with his own words, which sums up who he was better than we can: ‘My name is David Fucking Thomas… and I'm the lead singer of the best fucking rock n roll band in the world.'”

Upon learning of Thomas' death, numerous artists have shared tributes online in his honor, including David Grubbs, Wolf Parade's Dan Boeckner, and more. “Such sad news of the passing of the darkly brilliant David Thomas of Pere Ubu. singer and larger-than-life persona,” wrote Elliott Sharp. “I had been a huge fan of the EP Datapanik In The Year Zero, and LPs The Modern Dance, and Dub Housing. In 1979, the Scientific Americans opened for Pere Ubu at Rahars in Northampton MA. I would guest on tenor sax with the SciAms and on this gig, met and hung out with the Ubus and especially bonded with bassist Tony Maimone, the beginning of many years of friendship and collaboration. Touring in Germany in 1983, I opened for David Thomas with Chris Cutler and Lindsay Cooper. Thomas was stellar and hilarious, firing Cutler onstage with a slow burn. Later, we met in various European festivals. David Thomas & Two Pale Boys was an incredible group and one of my favorite situations to see and hear David.”

7.7

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Method 808

April 24, 2025

SHERELLE is more than just a DJ; she's a scholar. BBC Radio calls upon the British artist to dissect the influence of the Amen Break, possibly electronic music's most omnipresent sample. Through her organization Beautiful, she hosts events about Black and queer communities' foundational role in the history of dance music and offers free studio time to up-and-coming producers. Before her 2019 Boiler Room set went viral and earned her international acclaim among breakbeat and jungle enthusiasts, she even had a stint at Mixmag, making videos exploring the dusty annals of DJ culture. Point being, SHERELLE knows her shit. This expansive knowledge forms the basis of WITH A VENGEANCE, her much-anticipated, surprise-drop debut album that marries just about every genre under the 160bpm umbrella into 10 tight, adrenaline-pumping tracks.

In the hands of a less talented producer, a project that frenetically shifts from footwork to drum 'n' bass to jungle might sound overstuffed; here, the range serves to showcase SHERELLE's savvy. As it stands, the record is exhilarating rather than exhausting. On the title track, acid house sirens wail menacingly before one of the album's dozens of breakbeats jitters into the mix like machine-gun fire blasting at the doors of your underground bunker. The title “WITH A VENGEANCE” is apt—at times it feels like SHERELLE isn't making music for you so much as at you, strapping you into a roller coaster of her own design with no emergency brake.

The rapidly pulsating “DON'T WANT U” also exemplifies SHERELLE's propensity for raw, unfiltered production; the track's intensity steadily ratchets up thanks to bouncing bass and itchy hi-hats until the beat drops and a voice ferociously exclaims, “I don't need you no more!” Sometimes, sample work on jungle or drum 'n' bass records can come off as tongue-in-cheek, even bordering on campy, but SHERELLE's masterful selections imbue WITH A VENGEANCE with an unexpected emotionality. “XTC”'s elated sample conjures not only the drug the title references but the light-headed joy of falling in love: Behind classic jungle flourishes and 8-bit keyboard blips, the up-pitched vocal “in love, yeah/Ecstasy!” reverberates into space. While the album is most certainly designed for the dancefloor, you're left with the impression that blowing the roof off the club is the secondary objective here. Through her meticulous examination of these particular high-speed dance genres, SHERELLE crafts something deeply personal, as narrative and feeling-forward as hip-hop or R&B.

The most blatant instance of this is “FREAKY (JUST MY TYPE),” the album's only vocal track, where SHERELLE enlists newcomer George Riley for a sugar-coated house-pop song as indebted to breakbeat as sultry '90s R&B. Riley's exuberant soprano soars above a caffeinated garage beat, until the song's midway point, where the uptempo drive briefly gives way to almost balearic synth chords plucked straight from the first cracks of dawn at a euphoric beach rave. “FREAKY” is the album's most radio-friendly moment, but as the track progresses, SHERELLE steers it decidedly back towards the DJ booth, stretching out its last minutes with rolling jungle beats and layered vocal runs. The album's subsequent tracks—the driving acid techno of “READY, STEADY, GO!”, the madcap hardcore of “SPEED (ENDURANCE)”, the static-drenched footwork of “XTC SUSP9ND3D” —spelunk even deeper into the dank clubs where these sounds originated. This mood culminates with the penultimate track, “LOVE YOUR ENEMIES,” which layers spoken-word samples in patois with plaintive saxophones courtesy of London producer Cameo Blush.

SHERELLE packs WITH A VENGEANCE with a litany of sharp, dense references, avoiding repetitiveness while never once letting her foot off the pedal. The album radiates a deep appreciation for the communities and history behind the global rise of dance music—and, as WITH A VENGEANCE's title implies, a successful campaign to enshrine SHERELLE in its ranks.

April 24, 2025

How do you pin down a band like Broncho? Since its 2011 debut, the Oklahoma quartet served up cheeky, cocksure albums of indie rock, throughout which frontman Ryan Lindsey aimed to goad us into fighting, fucking, and raising hell. It landed the band spots in HBO's Girls, a Cartoon Network joint, and even a Fabletics commercial. Though their sound was eclectic and ever-evolving, Broncho always maintained their moxie. But the last we'd gotten of that Broncho attitude (as a full album, anyway) was more than six years ago—and a lot can change in six years, as evidenced on their fifth LP, Natural Pleasure. Broncho's mellowed out; the band's memories of life, love, and pain sound woozier, gentler. But even amid Natural Pleasure's introspective haze, the band's signature playfulness still remains in clear view.

Throughout Natural Pleasure, the spaciness of Broncho's garage-rock grit thickens into something rounder, lusher—it's chiller than ever. The first two songs, “Imagination” and “Funny,” kick off the album with rich guitar and echoing, blissed-out vocals. The album's overall attitude is more assured; here, Broncho expresses subtler emotions with a breezy poise. “Cool” replaces the glib flirtation of older songs like “Class Historian” with a coy trip-hop horniness, as metallic drums and Mezzanine-esque bass roil beneath Penny Pitchlynn's breathy crooning. And “You Got Me” is a slow, surprisingly tender ode from Lindsey to his two children, in which he expresses his care with a sense of humor: “Safe drivin', don't die.” There's not much drama in these lyrics: no more Taj Mahals, no femme fatales spilling blood down Harry Hines Boulevard. Instead, the album zeroes in on little vignettes and everyday reflections, with stripped-down lyrics that bring each emotion into focus.

Natural Pleasure isn't all business, mind you. Broncho's first proper dance-along anthem, “Get Gone,” marries atmospheric vocals with new wave-y synths and a thumping four-on-the-floor drumbeat. Even on “Original Guilt,” which delves into heavier subject matter, Lindsey's avowal that “nobody's evil” is followed up with the goofy statement that “nobody here is totally Knievel.” These songs don't show Broncho totally forgoing depth; instead, they acknowledge that there's sincere feeling to be mined, Rorschach-style, from even the most unserious of statements.

This pervading haze is double-edged, though, as the album admittedly gets a little repetitive once the more upbeat tracks give way to a slower second half. It's a gorgeous listen, but the line between mesmerizing and soporific starts to blur as the songs' edges melt into one another, kind of like how couchlock can feel amazing until you realize you haven't gotten up in hours. Here, Broncho's writing is as evocative as it's ever been. The textures are just decadent. But the album's strongest tracks are its most upbeat, which—given Natural Pleasure's pacing and tone—means the record suffers from an early peak and a drawn-out comedown. Thankfully, the country-tinged lilt of “Dreamin'” adds sharpness to the album's conclusion, like a soothing wake-up call.

Natural Pleasure may not be the band's most thrilling release to date, but success doesn't always have to sound like an adrenaline rush. Lindsey has cited Iggy Pop as a longtime influence in unseriousness, and even Iggy Pop's given up railing lines of blow and carving himself up like a wiry, scary ham in lieu of sobriety and qigong. Natural Pleasure shows us Broncho's biggest tonal shift yet. Maybe introspection and maturity and all of that would be a death knell for a more two-dimensional band, one without much to show for itself beyond bluster. But Broncho has made it clear that not only do they still have their wit and charm—they know where it comes from, when to use it, and when to let themselves kick back. They've already proved themselves; now, they can just enjoy the ride.

David Thomas, lead singer of the avant-garage band Pere Ubu and the Cleveland proto-punk group Rocket From the Tombs, has died at the age of 71.


	Pere Ubu's official Facebook announced Thomas' death Thursday, adding that the singer died following a long illness; Thomas previously revealed that he was battling kidney disease.


	“On Wednesday, April 23 2025, he died in his home town of Brighton & Hove, with his wife and youngest step-daughter by his side. MC5 were playing on the radio. He will ultimately be returned to his home, the farm in Pennsylvania, where he insisted he was to be ‘thrown in the barn,'” the band said in a statement.


	Thomas first emerged out of the fertile Cleveland rock scene of the mid-Seventies with the influential punk group Rocket From the Tombs, which paired the singer with cult guitarists Peter Laughner and Cheetah Chrome. Out of the ashes of that band's initial short-lived tenure — which produced no official releases but spawned oft-bootlegged tracks like “Ain't It Fun” (later covered by Guns N' Roses) and “Sonic Reducer” (often performed live by Pearl Jam) — rose Dead Boys (co-founded by Chrome, with singer Stiv Bators) and Pere Ubu, which Thomas formed alongside Laughner in 1975.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	While Laughner died in 1977 from the effects of alcoholism, Pere Ubu continued on, releasing their debut album The Modern Dance in 1978. The band became known for their lo-fi meshing of disparate musical styles (prog-rock, avant-garde, garage-punk) as well as Thomas' boisterous role as frontman, where he'd perform against type in a suit and tie.


	Soon after The Modern Dance, Pere Ubu released what is considered their most enduring album, 1978's Dub Housing. The band would release three more, equally experimental LPs before dissolving in 1982. Thomas next put out a trio of solo albums with his backing band the Pedestrians in the Eighties before reconvening Pere Ubu, with whom Thomas remained (albeit with an ever-rotating lineup) until his death on Wednesday.

	In addition to leading the second wave of Pere Ubu — yielding another dozen studio albums, including the standout 1989 LP Cloudland — Thomas also reformed Rocket From the Tombs in the early 2000s alongside Cheetah Chrome and Television guitarist Richard Lloyd, with that group releasing their first three albums over the next decade. The always-active Thomas also kept busy with his own solo projects as well as theatrical productions and other collaborations, like a star-studded album of sea shanties.

	“David Thomas and his band have been recording a new album. He knew it was to be his last,” Pere Ubu's statement continued. “We will endeavor to continue with mixing and finalizing the new album so that his last music is available to all. Aside from that, he left instruction that the work should continue to catalog all the tapes from live shows via the official bandcamp page. His autobiography was nearly completed and we will finish that for him.”


	The band added in conclusion, “We'll leave you with his own words, which sums up who he was better than we can – ‘My name is David Fucking Thomas…  and I'm the lead singer of the best fucking rock n roll band in the world.' Long live Pere Ubu.'

Imogen Heap, whose 2005 track “Headlock” just became her biggest hit ever after a belated viral surge on TikTok, is now letting fans legally borrow its vibe for their own songs via generative AI. Heap is the first artist to sign on for a new feature from AI-music platform Jen that lets users “infuse the vibe, feel, rhythmic style, instrument textures” of licensed songs into new creations, according to co-founder and CEO Shara Senderoff. Heap also licensed four other tracks for use as what the company calls StyleFilters: “Goodnight and Go,” “Just for Now,” “Last Night of an Empire,” and “What Have You Done to Me.


	The leading AI music platforms were trained on vast libraries of copyrighted songs without permission, but Jen only uses fully licensed music, which is why Heap agreed to partner with them. “The really exciting thing about Jen is it's the first service I feel fully understands the importance of waiting to get it right,” she says. “They've gone the really long way around.”

	











	The service pays artists 70 percent of the revenue each time someone uses their StyleFilter.  Users pay $4.99 to generate up to 90 minutes of music laced with the essence of Heap's songs — or $7.99 for a “high-strength” setting where song generations will be more obviously influenced by her work. In a press release, Jen's other co-founder, Mike Caren, frames the feature as a new business model for artists: “Think of StyleFilters like an app for music creators. You're not licensing a song, so much as you're launching a product. You become software.”Heap is taking advantage of a bit of fortuitous timing: Just as “Headlock” took off on TikTok, the rights to some of the singer's most popular works reverted back to her after 20 years. “It is like this perfect storm,” she says. The deal works through Heap's own technology platform, Auracles, which she's been developing for a decade. Auracles serves as a rights management system, allowing her to quickly provide Jen with all the metadata and permissions for her tracks, and she hopes other artists will see its advantages. With the notable exception of Timbaland, who is a wildly enthusiastic user of the AI-music engine Suno, vanishingly few artists, songwriters, or producers have publicly embraced AI — instead, they've largely condemned companies who use their music without permission. “It's not that I'm just like, ‘Yay, AI,'” Heap says. “I'm ‘Yay, AI' with people who have ethics and morals that I align with and a future outlook of something that I feel makes sense to me and the planet.… I want to build a system that enables as much collaboration, open collaboration, as possible with trust.”

	For Heap, traditional music industry models are obsolete. She hasn't released an album since 2014, and has no plans to return to that medium: “Never. A hundred percent. No. I just think that whole industry is baked around ‘Let's make money for record labels.” Her recent experiment selling song stems on a remix platform yielded $12,000 from 400 downloads at $30 each – far outpacing streaming revenue. “The same song on Spotify, maybe half a million plays, less than a thousand pounds,” she says.

	Heap thinks more artists should find ways to embrace licensed AI. “The more open you are, the more things are likely to happen,” she says. “The more [artists] that stick their head in the sand,, the more likely it's gonna go to the people who are doing it for profit and won't be thinking about them.”

	The president of Harvard has no plans of backing down in the institution's defiance of the Trump administration, arguing the government's threat to freeze $2.2 billion in federal funding violates constitutional rights.


	“We are defending what I believe is one of the most important lynchpins of the American economy and way of life, our universities,” Alan Garber, who has held the post for over a year, told NBC during an interview aired on Wednesday. “We cannot compromise on basic principles like defense of our First Amendment rights.” 


	The administration has targeted college campuses across America in recent months, revoking students' visas and attempting to defund universities over pro-Palestine activism — canceling funding for Columbia and freezing funding for Brown, Cornell, and Northwestern over what the government says is antisemitism on campuses.


	Garber, who is Jewish, said that antisemitism at Harvard is a “real problem” that they are trying to address, but that “putting that research at jeopardy because of claims of antisemitism seems to us to be misguided.” He told the outlet: “The effort to address antisemitism will not be advanced by shutting off funding.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Although Harvard previously agreed to the definition of antisemitism promoted largely by the right, it pushed back against the administration's attempts to seize greater control by demanding the university allow the government to audit who it hires, fires, and admits into the school or risk a freeze of $2.2 billion in grants. “That is what we are objecting to,” said Garber.


	On Monday, Harvard filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration and accused it of violating the First Amendment. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber said in a statement at the time. Garber warned that research for child cancer, s outbreaks, and easing the pain of wounded soldiers on the battlefield will be at risk, as well as future “opportunities to reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.”

	When asked by NBC if this was a fight he could win, the head of Harvard University replied: “I don't know the answer to this question, but the stakes are so high that we have no choice.”

	











	Trump lashed out at the university on Thursday. “Harvard is an Anti-Semitic, Far Left Institution, as are numerous others, with students being accepted from all over the World that want to rip our Country apart. The place is a Liberal mess, allowing a certain group of crazed lunatics to enter and exit the classroom and spew fake ANGER AND HATE. It is truly horrific!” the president wrote on Truth Social, adding that the esteemed institution is “a threat to Democracy.”

	America has stood as a world superpower for the past century or so, and much of that power has been derived from the country's scientific and technological prowess. From medicine to aerospace, some of the greatest thinkers in modern history have called the United States their home and pushed boundaries while residing within its borders. 


	That tradition is under threat in ways it has never been before as Donald Trump's administration engages in the mass firing of scientists in the federal government, cuts funding to scientific research, and generally pushes an agenda that opposes scientific inquiry.


	The Trump administration has thrown out hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research projects, fired thousands of the agency's scientists, and looks intent on further dismantling the agency. Research funding for universities is also being stripped. So is climate science.  Science is under attack in the United States basically everywhere you look.

	











	Trump's attacks on science are making American scientists anxious, and many are considering leaving the country indefinitely. Nearly 2,000 members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine signed a letter in March warning of the administration's threat to science. A poll from the international science journal Nature in late March found that 75 percent of American scientists are considering leaving the United States. European countries are planning on increasing their science funding, and countries like France, Belgium, and the Netherlands have launched programs to lure American scientists.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Jan Danckaert, rector of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, says his university has launched its own program to attract American scientists.


	“Our university is establishing a dedicated contact point for researchers who want to continue their work in Brussels,” Danckaert tells Rolling Stone. “U.S. universities and their scholars are victims of political and ideological interference by the Trump administration. They are seeing millions of dollars in research funding being abruptly cut for ideological reasons.”

	In France, Aix-Marseille University has received nearly 300 applications from Americans for its “Safe Place for Science” program. Europe saw many scientists flee for the U.S. during World War II, and it now appears that experts are starting to flow in the opposite direction. 

	











	“I never thought I would live in a country where I would see scientists basically seeking asylum,” says Jennifer Jones, director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Massachusetts-based Union of Concerned Scientists. “Some are seeking asylum because their work is no longer valued or funded. Some just don't see the future of their career here.”


	Jones says she's heard from scientists who are “actively looking for positions overseas,” and that these scientists are often at the beginning or end of their career. Those who are just starting out can easily relocate, and some who are at the tail end of their career might want to finish it off somewhere else. Many scientists are also from outside of the U.S. and are considering returning home. 


	“If we lose elements of both generations, that's so hard. You're losing the most senior, deep level of expertise,” Jones says. “They're also the ones who mentor and train the next generation. When you lose early career folks, you lose capacity that could take years or decades to regain.”


	Adam Siepel, a computational biologist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, says he's been seriously considering moving to Europe or Canada. He says the atmosphere in America is “very spooky” right now and “almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany or the Cultural Revolution in China.” He says a lot of scientists are worried about the future.

	“You start to wonder if it's going to be possible to do science in this country, and if there is a major flow of scientists to other countries, where should we go?” Siepel says. “I'm not ready to leave the United States yet, but I think we're all keeping our eyes open and looking for our options if things do turn out really badly.”


	Dr. Stephen Jones, a biochemist who now works at Vilnius University in Lithuania, started considering leaving the U.S. during the 2020 presidential election while he was finishing his postdoc at the University of Texas. He and his wife weren't sure how the election was going to turn out, but there was a lot of anti-science sentiment during the Covid-19 pandemic and Europe looked appealing. Even though Trump didn't win that election, they decided to leave.


	“You know what I don't have to experience right now? I haven't had to kick any students or any researchers off my team. My funding is more secure than ever,” Jones says. “I have a friend who had to start a GoFundMe to keep her laboratory going [in America]. I'm not thinking about those things.”

	











	Jones says he's advised other scientists on how to exit the U.S. for Europe. He says he was not having those meetings “before January of this year.” He also just welcomed an American researcher to his team who recently completed his PhD. Some European scientists who were considering moving to the U.S. for work have told him they're no longer considering that option.


	“It's going to become, and it's already becoming, a brain drain,” Jones says. “It's the kind of thing you don't see immediately. This takes time to manifest itself — sometimes because it has to get bad enough for people to decide to finally go somewhere else.”


	America's brain drain hasn't just affected scientists. Jason Stanley, a former Yale philosophy professor, expert on authoritarianism and author of How Fascism Works, decided to take a job at the University of Toronto earlier this year. He said he feared the U.S. was at risk of becoming a “fascist dictatorship” under Trump. (Surely there's no reason to worry about a fascism expert deciding to pack his bags and flee the country.) 


	The Trump administration claims to want to reduce government spending, but if that's part of its rationalization for gutting the sciences, then it's not behaving logically. Investing in basic science often generates more money than it costs.


	“Every dollar spent on NIH research results in about $2.50 worth of economic growth,” Siepel says. “I think around 90 percent of FDA-approved new drugs started out with NIH support.”

	All of the scientists aren't going to leave at once, and so far it's only a trickle exiting the U.S., but it's clear that the future of science is in question in America. If things continue on the path they're on, more and more scientists will decide to work elsewhere. This will make the U.S. less competitive and deprive it of important innovations. 


	“It's a lot easier to break things than to build them. Unfortunately, we're in the breaking phase right now,” Dr. Jones says. “The building materials are being used elsewhere in the world now.”

	A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to return a second migrant who was deported to El Salvador's notorious prison system despite a previous court settlement barring their removal.


	It might be hard for the president and his officials to argue the ruling is the work of a radical left, activist judge, as Trump appointed her. 


	According to ABC News, Maryland District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled on Wednesday that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of a man referred to as “Christian” in court records. Christian was one of hundreds of migrants deported to El Salvador and imprisoned in the notorious CECOT mega-prison without due process. Christian was previously party to a 2019 class action lawsuit that reached a settlement with the U.S. government allowing adults who entered the United States without documentation as unaccompanied minors to remain in the U.S. while their asylum claims were adjudicated.


	In her ruling, Gallagher referenced the case of Kilmar Abgrego Garcia, a Maryland man who has also been sent to El Salvador by the Trump administration, despite a protective order barring his deportation to the country over fears for his safety. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Like Judge [Paula] Xinis in the Abrego Garcia matter, this court will order Defendants to facilitate Christian's return to the United States so that he can receive the process he was entitled to under the parties' binding Settlement Agreement,” Gallagher wrote in her ruling determining that the government had violated the conditions of the 2019 settlement.


	The Trump administration has countered that because they have deemed Christian an “alien enemy” under the Alien Enemies Act — an archaic wartime law that grants the president powers to deport citizens of nations the United States is engaged in armed conflict with without due process — he is no longer protected by the settlement. 


	Gallagher determined that the government must make “a good faith request to the government of El Salvador and to release Christian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS.”

	Gallagher's decision came after Maryland District Court Judge Paual Xinis issued a sharp rebuke of the Trump administration's defiance of the courts, accusing it on Wednesday of engaging in “a willful and bad faith refusal” to comply with orders related to the Abrego Garcia case. 

	











	The Trump administration is not pleased with their series of losses in court. In a Wednesday interview with Fox News, White House Deputy Chief of Staff called for “radical left wing judges” to be removed from the bench.

	“Either we all side and get behind President Trump to remove these terrorists from our communities or we let a rogue radical left judiciary shut down the machinery of our national security apparatus,” Miller screamed at Fox News Host Sean Hannity. “President Trump will make this nation safer than ever before and do it over the fighting and opposition of the communist left-wing judges.” 


	Someone should let Miller know that in the case of Christian, the “communist left-wing” judge ruling against their attempts to ignore the rule of law is a Trump appointee.

Pedro Pascal blasted J.K. Rowling's anti-trans stance in response to the author celebrating a recent U.K. ruling that transgender women should not be recognized as women under Britain's Equality Act.


	The actor's response to Rowling was posted in the comments of an Instagram video posted by activist Tariq Ra'ouf, who pointed out Rowling's financial connection to the For Women Scotland campaign that ultimately resulted in the U.K. Supreme Court ruling.


	“Awful disgusting SHIT is exactly right,” Pascal wrote in response to Ra'ouf's video (via People). “Heinous LOSER behavior.”


	Pascal has long been a supporter of trans rights, as the actor's sister, Lux Pascal, came out as transgender in 2021. At the U.K. red carpet premiere of the Marvel movie Thunderbolts earlier this week, Pascal — who stars in the upcoming Fantastic Four: First Steps — notably wore a shirt with the phrase “Protect the Dolls,” which is part of a fundraising campaign to bring attention to the wave of anti-transgender sentiment worldwide.

	Pascal wearing the shirt coincided with the U.K. Supreme Court ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based solely on biological sex, thus excluding transgender women from equality laws, and could potentially bar transgender women from women's sports in the U.K.

The Last of Us star isn't the only actor to speak out against Rowling: Harry Potter castmates like Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have all previously criticized the author's persistent and very public transphobia.

The actress and mom is loving her new role on the quirky SyFy show 'SurrealEstate', which she says is 'Scandal meets Ghostbusters'

Olivia Wong/FilmMagic

 It's been exactly five years since Sarah Levy said farewell to the hit show Schitt's Creek, where she played the waitress, Twyla. Since then, she's gotten married, become a mom, and now stars on SyFy's SurrealEstate, which she says is a total blast.


 ""I kind of look at it as Scandal meets Ghostbusters,"" Levy, 38, says of the series, now in its third season. (The first two seasons stream on Hulu.)


 The show follows a group of realtors who sell haunted houses — but first, they need to figure out what happened to the ghosts that make the homes haunted, and help the spirits move on.


 ""The characters are so rich and fleshed out, and there is a common theme through what they're going through in their lives, but then every episode is different and a new case,"" she continues. ""And it turns out it's a real thing! I read a story in the New York Times about a woman who actually does this exact thing — she became popular for selling haunted houses. I was like 'Yes! Our little show is validated!""


Syfy

 Levy says she's a firm believer in the paranormal herself.


 ""Definitely,"" she says. ""You can't help but think there's so much to the world than just us. I haven't personally had a ghost experience, but we shot the first two seasons in Saint John in Newfoundland, Canada, which is notoriously haunted. All the locals had stories and experiences. They say it's because there was a huge fire there in the late 1800s that killed a lot of people, so there are a lot of stuck souls.""


 SurrealEstate also stars Tim Rosen as Luke Roman, who runs the Roman Agency.


 ""Luke has an ability to speak to spirits, and when I come on board, I learn from him. He's created an entire world of how to communicate with these entities: we have the researcher, we have the physicist who assembles devices to then communicate with these metaphysically engaged properties. Then we help them move on.""


 While Levy says she's happy to be on a totally new series, she does miss Schitt's Creek — and completely understands why so many fans loved it so much.


 ""There's just such a comfort in it,"" she says, adding that she and her husband like to rewatch Arrested Development themselves for the same reasons.


 ""It's just like a world that creates this comfort, where nothing really bad happens. It's a way to tune out and laugh. We're always bombarded with the news and info, and it's hard to find peace. So if you have a hobby or a show that can take you away for a little bit, it's just the best.""


 SurrealEstate airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on SyFy.

The Psychic Vincent Sisters, who are originally from Butler County, are speaking at the Butler Paranormal Conference on April 26.

The sisters, Jean and Suzanne Vincent, will share their experiences assisting Cyril Wecht on the case of the Blairsville Dentist and as paranormal investigators, paranormal experts and psychic detectives. The Vincent Sisters have been featured on “The Dead Files” on Travel Channel.

Suzanne Vincent said the sisters will talk about their investigation of the Riverside Inn in Fredericktown, in Washington County.

“We were called up from ‘The Dead Files' to go up to the Riverside Inn because people were saying items were taken out of their room, people were seeing apparitions on the stairs,” Suzanne Vincent said. “We burned sage and went to the place, we also got a hold of some holy water.”

Head Editor

Jamie founded Listverse due to an insatiable desire to share fascinating, obscure, and bizarre facts. He has been a guest speaker on numerous national radio and television stations and is a five time published author.

The demands of everyday life, in the form of natural stimuli, prompt the development of the various behavioral traits and physical structures of plants and animals. In trying to envision the appearance of extraterrestrial beings, scientists once turned to Earth's fossil record. After all, it provided evidence as to how organisms had already evolved on this planet.

Likely, they supposed, evolution would have produced similar effects on the flora and fauna of the aliens' worlds. Later, they understood that, while this assumption is generally valid, evolution had to adapt alien life to its planets' environments, not to Earth's.

This list explores ten conceptions of what extraterrestrial life could look like based on alien nature's demands and evolution's accommodations.

K2-18b, a planet 120 light years from Earth, may be covered by an ocean. The James Webb Telescope has discovered a “possible sign” of life there: an abundance of a molecule that, on Earth, is known to come from living organisms like algae.

If scientists eliminate “non-biological sources of the molecule,” it's more likely that K2-18B may, in fact, harbor life, although it may not be intelligent life. If it is intelligent, though, NASA anticipates that the announcement of such a discovery would be, well, earth-shaking.[1]

Could the oceans beneath the frozen surfaces of Jupiter's moons be home to alien life? That's a question that the European Space Agency hopes to answer. It's possible that the moons' icy surfaces, shielding marine organisms against space's radiation, and their “warm interiors” could allow life to survive.

The Space Agency will focus its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, on Callisto, Europa, and Ganymede as the spacecraft's 10 instruments map them and “peer below their frozen crusts,” allowing scientists to assess whether the moons provide life-support conditions.

If so, the life would probably be microbial, says Professor Andrew Knoll of Harvard University, since it would depend wholly on chemosynthesis for its energy.[2]

As Peter Fimrite reports, physicist Enrico Fermi suggests that if we do encounter extraterrestrials, they may be “alien microbes” that a civilization among the stars dispatched throughout the Milky Way” as a means of introducing “directed panspermia.”

Others, Femrite says, suggest that alien life forms might be inactive spores by which intelligent aliens reconnoiter our solar system to evaluate whether we Earthlings are “a threat [that needs] to be eliminated.”

Still, others contend that we may ourselves be extraterrestrials who were shot into space when our ancestors' home planet was struck by a giant meteor.[3]

The online, or virtual, Xenobiology Museum features alien life that is “imagined by a human, generated by AI.” The museum's founder, xenobiologist Dr. Tanya Singh, explains that the images must be created according to specific guidelines based on established biological principles and the “specific challenges posed by studying aliens.”

More specifically, the images focus on the biological function of “body parts and features.” They are produced with the aliens' environments in mind and are based on both “species' physical and behavioral characteristics.” (LINK 5) It helps that the prompt's specifications are precise and that image production is exacting. (LINK 6)

The museum features alien mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, anthropods, invertebrates, and, of course, “unclassified xenoforms.” The Skeleton Closet exhibit, for example, includes 50 skeletal structures that, to the human eye, look bizarre, indeed, whether because of triangular skulls trailing a serrated bony projection and a long, thin neck connecting the rest of the nightmarish skeleton or a set of bones that look as though they belonged to an animal that was half lizard and half armadillo.[4]

The appearance of alien organisms would be restrained by the same constraints that nature places on Earth's plants and animals. It's unlikely that any will look like the green aliens that are, in some cases, still staples of science fiction novels. But, according to a BBC Science Focus article, biomechanical experts and astrobiologists suggest that extraterrestrials might resemble those featured in two cult documentaries that aired over 20 years ago: Natural History of an Alien (1198) and Alien Planet (2005).

One such conception envisions walking trees equipped by evolution “with beating hearts, or with feet to move to better positions as they compete for light and water.” An artist's conception of the hybrid animal-plant shows a cluster of projecting protuberances, out of which grow clumps of vegetation. It walks on five spindly, root-like legs, one of which branches into two. Unlikely? Not if such developments were successful adaptations to the environmental stimuli of the creature's environment.[5]

The Natural History of an Alien was a BBC Natural History Unit and Discovery Channel production featuring a panel of scientists and other experts from various UK universities and NASA. The film dismisses the trope of humanoid aliens, positing, instead, a number of others that would be more likely to evolve in other forms.

Science writer and paleontologist Dougal Dixon introduces viewers to one such possible alien species, the “gasbags” of Furia, an imaginary world with a highly sulfurous atmosphere. Anchoring themselves to Furia with stalks grown from their undersides to a length of thousands of kilometers, the mushroom-shaped “barrage balloons,” or “gasbags,” are supported by gas generated by themselves. They obtain energy from the sun and reproduce by “rubbing against one another to exchange their genetic material.” The offspring bud from their parents. When their stalks have grown long enough to reach the planet, they detach, becoming independent.[6]

Alien Planet, also a Discovery Channel production, further speculates on the appearances of alien life forms, envisioning, among other incidents, a groveback's encounter with a field of beach quills. Again, a panel of scientists and other experts comment on the footage.

Visiting the imaginary planet Darwin IV, an unmanned spaceship from Earth releases a pair of probes, Leonardo da Vinci, or “Leo,” and Isaac Newton, or “Ike,” to investigate the planet's flora and fauna, if any. They discover several, including the five-story-tall groveback with a distinctive diamond-shaped head, diamond-shaped body, elephantine legs, and a “grove” of sharp spires projecting from its back. The groveback's fate illustrates the narrator's observation that “just walking on Darwin IV is a hazardous undertaking.” 

Encountering a colony of beach quills, which launch an attack, the enormous animal screams in pain as hundreds, if not thousands, of quills deeply penetrate its hide. The groveback stumbles, crashing to the quill-littered ground, as the dart-like projectiles deliver a fatal dose of neurotoxin. Within seconds, the beach quills “consume the groveback alive.”[7]

As Newsweek's senior science reporter Pandora Dewan states, the University of Oxford researchers' paper “Darwin's aliens” indicates how the same models of evolution used to explain life on Earth could be used to speculate about life on other planets or, for that matter, Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. Its ocean contains phosphorus, an element that is critical for DNA and is also present in ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

According to the paper, one of the extraterrestrials on Enceladus, the octomite, resembles a “budding tardigrade on steroids.” It is comprised of a hierarchy of entities with aligned evolutionary interests, each part specializing in a specific task. The organism reproduces by budding.[8]

In his children's book Alien Worlds, illustrator David Aguilar melds art and science to imagine how alien creatures might adapt to their environments. He explores this concept with reference to eight worlds. Each world and its life forms are informed by Earth's history. Like others on this list, it rejects the view of humanoid aliens, convinced that, on other worlds, “we are going to find bizarre adaptations.”

His book depicts Beachrollers, Seapups, Coneheads, Cave Crawlers, Windcatchers, Arrowheads, Netserefs, and Temmets. He rendered the style of the last of these aliens “after an actual fossil, [the] Hallucinenia, a small worm with spikes on its backs and tentacles for legs.”

The Temmet's large size fits with a low-gravity planet. Its proboscis sucks up lake water, and it finds its way with sonar instead of eyes. Its spikes emit acoustic signals that bounce off their surroundings, which explains the functions of the Temmet's body parts.[9]

Oxford University researchers disagree that extraterrestrial organisms will necessarily follow the evolution pathways of Earthly plants and animals. Consequently, researcher Sam Levin says he and his colleagues used “evolutionary theory to make predictions independent of Earth's details” and in consideration of aliens that are based on silicon, lack DNA, and “breathe nitrogen.”

The researchers conceived three aliens, labeling them “A,” “B,” and “C.” Each of them has a more complex level of adaptability than its predecessor in the sketch. “A” is a simple replicating molecule. “B” is a cell-like entity that would undergo natural selection despite its simplicity. “C” is an alien with many intricate parts working together and would likely undergo major transitions.

Indeed, a sketch of “C” shows it as having six stubby feet and an hourglass shape that ends in a circular top surrounded by tentacles. An umbrella-like appendage, growing from the center of its top, bears small circular growths from which short shoots radiate.[10]","{'href': 'https://listverse.com', 'title': 'Listverse'}","other"

From your WhatsApp messages to your work emails, it can sometimes feel like emoji are everywhere you look.

But tonight, a rare astronomical display will take this to new levels - as an extraterrestrial emojii forms in the night sky.

In the early hours of the morning, a rare 'smiley face' conjunction will line up just above the horizon.

Experts say this alignment of Venus, Saturn, and the thin crescent moon will bear a striking resemblance to a smiling face turned on its side.

The good news is that you won't need a telescope to see this spectacular celestial display - you'll just need to make an early start.

The conjunction should slide into place from 05:00 BST and remain visible until just before the sun rises at 05:45 BST.

Jess Lee, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told MailOnline: 'You can see this just with your eyes and without any special equipment, but you'll need to be awake at 5 am and have a clear view of the east.

'You'll need to turn your head sideways and really squint, but then you might be able to see the two planets as the eyes and the moon as the mouth of the face.'

Tonight's smiley face is not a unique type of event, but rather a type of planetary alignment called a conjunction.

As the planets orbit the sun, from our perspective there are times when they seem to come very close together although, in reality, they are still millions of miles apart.

On some occasions, two or more planets move closer to the moon in an event which astronomers call 'massing'.

For all of next week, both Venus and Saturn will be low on the horizon in the mornings, placing them close to the path of the rising moon.

Venus will be especially bright, rising at around 05:00 BST and remaining visible until around 06:00 BST.

The moon, having been full on April 13, is now waning - growing smaller - towards the new moon on April 27 which will leave a very thin crescent visible tonight.

Saturn is also visible but will be fainter and later rising, staying closer to the horizon.

In order to see this rare alignment all you need to do is look towards the East early in the morning.

Venus, the second planet from the sun, is a rocky world about the same size and mass as the Earth.

However, its atmosphere is radically different to ours — being 96 per cent carbon dioxide and having a surface temperature of 867°F (464°C) and pressure 92 times that of on the Earth.

The inhospitable planet is swaddled in clouds of sulphuric acid that make the surface impossible to glimpse.

In the past, it has been suggested that Venus likely had oceans similar to Earth's — but these would have vaporised as it underwent a runaway greenhouse effect.

The surface of Venus is a dry desertscape, which is periodically changed by volcanic activity.

Find a spot that gives you a clear, unobstructed view of the horizon free of any trees or buildings that might block your view.

Starting from about 05:00 am, you will then need to wait and watch as the conjunction slowly rises over the next half an hour.

Ms Lee says: 'On the morning of the 25th of April, in the eastern sky just before sunrise you'll be able to see a thin crescent Moon. Above the Moon, Venus will be bright and easily visible.

'Below Venus on the other side of the crescent moon Saturn will technically be visible.

'However, Saturn rises just before the Sun and the sky will be brightening by the minute. Saturn will be faint and hard to see, so it will be a challenge to spot but give it a go!'

Since Saturn will be low to the horizon close to dawn, you also need to be careful not to look directly at the sun as it rises.

For this reason, it is recommended that you do not use binoculars or a telescope to try and look at the planets since this could magnify the sun's light and cause serious eye damage.

Unfortunately for many British stargazers, the weather forecast for early tomorrow morning does not look particularly promising.

The Met Office forecasts cloud cover over large parts of the UK with a few breaks over parts of the Southeast, Southwest, and southern parts of Scotland.

Keen skywatchers in Northern Ireland will fare particularly poorly as heavy rain is forecast over the entire region.

If you happen to miss out on tonight's display, there's no reason to be disappointed.

Ms Lee says: 'The planets pass through the same area of sky where we see the Moon, and so it won't be rare for Saturn or Venus to be near the moon - however how often we can interpret them as smiley faces, I think depends on individual imaginations.'

There will be another great opportunity to see the conjunction of Saturn and Venus on April 28.

From 20:00 BST, the planets will come very close to each other within the constellation of Pisces.

Since this conjunction is after sunset you will also be able to safely use binoculars or a telescope to get a better view.

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system after Jupiter.

It is regarded as the 'jewel of the solar system' with its sunning rings.  

It is not the only planet to have rings but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.

Like Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with some heavy elements.

Its core stretches out to cover 60 per cent of the radius of the world.

It is similar to the rest of the planet, but made of a 'slush' like material of gasses, metallic fluids, rock and ice. 

The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the naked eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. 

The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter. 

While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.

Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.

The science of our age is computational. Without models, simulations, statistical analysis, data storage and so on, our knowledge of the world would grow far more slowly. For decades, our fundamental human curiosity has been sated, in part, by silicon and software.

The late philosopher Paul Humphreys called this the ‘hybrid scenario' of science: where parts of the scientific process are outsourced to computers. However, he also suggested that this could change. Even though he began writing about these ideas more than a decade ago, long before the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), Humphreys had the foresight to recognise that the days of humans leading the scientific process may be numbered. He identified a later phase of science – what he called the ‘automated scenario', where computers take over science completely. In this future, the computational capacities for scientific reasoning, data processing, model-making and theorising would far surpass our own abilities to the point that we humans are no longer needed. The machines would carry on the scientific work we once started, taking our theories to new and unforeseen heights.

According to some sources, the end of human epistemic dominance over science is on the horizon. A recent survey of AI researchers offered a 50 per cent chance that, within a century, AI could feasibly replace us in every job (even if there are some we'd rather reserve for ourselves, like being a jury member). You may have a different view about whether or when such a world is possible, but I'd ask you to suspend these views for a moment and imagine that such artificial superintelligences could be possible eventually. Their development would mean that we could pass over the work of science to our epistemically superior artificial progeny who would do it faster and better than we could ever dream.

This would be a strange world indeed. For one thing, AI may decide to explore scientific interests that human scientists are unincentivised or unmotivated to pursue, creating whole new avenues of discovery. They might even gain knowledge about the world that lies beyond what our brains are capable of understanding. Where will that leave us humans, and how should we respond? I believe we need to start asking these questions now, because within a matter of decades, science as we know it could transform profoundly.

Though it may sound like the stuff of science fiction novels, Humphreys's automated scenario for science would be yet another step in a centuries-long trend. Humans have never really done science alone. We have long relied on tools to augment our observation of the world: microscopes, telescopes, standardised rulers and beakers, and so on. And there are plenty of physical phenomena that we cannot directly or precisely observe without instruments, such as thermometers, Geiger counters, oscilloscopes, calorimeters and the like.

The introduction of computers represented an additional step towards the decentring of humans in science: Humphreys's hybrid scenario. As one prominent example documented in the book Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly (and subsequent film), the first United States space flights required computations to be done by human mathematicians including Katherine Johnson. By the time of the US lunar missions, less than a decade later, most of those computations had been passed off to computers.

Our contribution to science remains critical: we humans still call the shots

The following decades witnessed continual, logarithmic growth of computational processing and power, and a correlated decrease in the price of computation. We are now at what we might call an advanced hybrid stage of science with an even greater reliance on computational systems. As one example, the philosopher Margaret Morrison explained how computational simulations were essential to the discovery of the Higgs boson – helping scientists know what to look for and sorting through the data from high-energy collisions.

And now AI has begun to have a large impact on science. AlphaFold, for example, is an AI designed to help predict how proteins will fold, given their chemical makeup. While humans can do this work independently of computers, it is time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. The creators of AlphaFold – Google DeepMind – claim that it has saved ‘hundreds of millions of years in research time'. Similar benefits can be seen across the sciences: the analysis of extremely large data sets in astronomy and genomics, the development of novel proofs in mathematics, predicting the weather, developing new pharmaceuticals, and more.

When the contributions of computational AI begin to be measured in ‘hundreds of millions of years', it starts to feel a bit like we humans are the underperforming members of the group project. So, we might wonder whether we are already in the automated scenario. However, we are not yet there. Our contribution to science remains critical: we humans still call the shots – we identify the scientific questions, we interpret the results and we, ultimately, determine its progress.

If we follow Humphreys's trajectory, the full abdication of our epistemic throne of science would occur only at a later stage. At this point, artificial superintelligences would not only be capable of completing tasks we set for them (a continuation of the hybrid scenario) but would also be capable of setting their own tasks: their own research agenda, data collection, modelling and theories, according to their own independently identified set of theoretical virtues and values – a science all their own.

It's worth pausing here to marvel at the possibilities open to an artificial superintelligence unbound by human physical and epistemic limitations. Many scientific tasks sit outside the scope of human possibility, because there would never be funding to pursue the question or because there is simply not enough human interest. As I write this, for example, I am looking at a partially decayed leaf in my yard. Perhaps an artificial superintelligence would be interested in developing a predictive model that explains, with exacting particularity down to the second, the decaying processes and rates of any given leaf, depending on the species of tree, size of leaf, historical contact with various microbial life, presence or absence of sunlight and moisture, and so on and so forth – an extremely complex question for which such detail offers no obvious value. Or, in fulfilment of a question my son once asked me, perhaps a superintelligence would be able to develop a model that predicts precisely when the water molecules of a snowball he left in the mountains will flow by our house in the river that drains that mountain system. Such a prediction would require an extremely complex and detailed model of the river basin, fluid dynamics, the climate and a whole range of other features of the system.

It's not that we humans couldn't ever answer these questions. With sufficient focus and funding, I suspect that scientists could develop effective predictive models of these and other esoteric phenomena. But the reality is that we won't. For better and for worse, science today is shaped by strongly human factors: economic value, political priorities, career prospects, cultural trends, and a range of human biases and beliefs. Imagine the science if all that baggage could be abandoned.

As the superintelligences execute their own research agendas, their work would become unintelligible for us

The automated scenario does not just permit the efficient exploration of scientific projects we cannot or would not pursue. Though the artificial superintelligences might continue to work within the paradigms of our current theories, there is no reason they would have to do so – they may quickly choose to begin afresh with a new theory of the world. Similarly, though they may use mathematics and symbols familiar to human scientists, they would not be bound by these conventions – they may quickly develop new mathematics and systems for expressing those.

Given the possibility (and, in my view, likelihood) that such AIs would quickly abandon human epistemic baggage, we may choose to follow a Wittgensteinian line of reasoning and think of the automated scenario as the stage at which they would begin to speak and develop an independent and new scientific language. Ludwig Wittgenstein famously (and, true to form, enigmatically) says in Philosophical Investigations (1953): ‘If a lion could talk, we wouldn't be able to understand it.' Though the statement feels contradictory, Wittgenstein's point is that the meaning of language is deeply embedded and intertwined with the internal experience of being human. So, too, for science. As the superintelligences begin to set and execute their own research agendas, the work they do would therefore become unintelligible for us because we would lack the internal perspective necessary to understand their science. From our view, their research would be a science created for theoretical-aims-we-know-not-what, with purposes-we-know-not-what, to be interpreted in ways-we-know-not-what.

It is at least possible that there are limits to our human epistemic capabilities: untold mathematics we can never understand or multidimensional concepts that are beyond our three-dimensional experiences. The fact that there are limitations to the intellectual capacities of other animals (try explaining general relativity to the smartest chimpanzee to ever exist) is reason to think that there are possible limitations to our own intellectual capacities too: ideas too complex to understand. Even supposing that we are not subject to limited epistemic capacities, there is also the problem that the reasoning of artificial superintelligence may be in practice beyond our capacities. Understanding the science of the automated scenario may require, for example, the simultaneous consideration of hundreds of complex models, each with hundreds of parameters, none of which links up to a familiar human concept. While it may be that we could understand the parameters (and maybe even the models) individually, we would lack the capacity to hold them all together at once.

Depending on your predilections about technology, AI, and the singularity, the above may all read to you as either incredibly bleak or extremely exciting. If you are like me, it all strikes you as simply strange. If the results of the completely automated scenario are outside of our understanding, then why would we want to devote economic resources and intellectual talent towards its development? Though this question is often swept away by flattening assertions that the future will come, whether we like it or not, I think it is worth our time identifying what reasons we may have for such a future, before we begin our wilful abdication of the epistemic throne of science.

One such reason may be that we think that positive advancements will follow. Perhaps the superintelligences would occasionally create things: pieces of technology, resources or new ways of solving problems. Since I've already used up far more than my allotted quota of speculation in this essay, I will remain open to what exactly these products might be, simply noting that the superintelligences may occasionally send us products it decides would be good for humans to have. Human engineers (if there are any remaining who haven't themselves been replaced) may then take these new technologies and identify uses for them, even if they don't understand exactly how they work. It would be akin to the way I don't understand the process by which my monitor or word processor can create and display visual documents, but I can put them to use in writing this essay. This task will be less like today's science and engineering and much more like simple discovery, the sort of primitive recognition that, for instance, a vine works well to tie tree branches together when building a shelter. It would be similar to stumbling upon some resource or substance in the world (as we stumbled upon coal or penicillin). There may indeed be a second kind of science that springs up as well: a form of backwards engineering of what an AI gifts us, to advance and modify our own theoretical understanding of the world.

Perhaps we might think that it is our moral responsibility or destiny to spread intelligence across the Universe

A different reason for enabling artificially superintelligent science would be aesthetic. Aesthetic reasons already hold a strong motivating factor when I, personally, think about the funding we as a society give to science. Though I do not have the time nor capacity to understand all of science (who possibly could?), I find it beautiful and good that there are so many smart scientists pursuing their human curiosities – even if they do not all positively impact my life or my understanding of the world. There is something aesthetically pleasing in knowing that the world is being known, studied and understood. Might that translate to nonhuman scientists? Perhaps not overnight. However, future generations, who have learnt to live alongside AI, may even take it as a mark of a good society that it would be willing to enable this extrahuman understanding.

Alternatively, humanity might pursue the automated scenario out of beneficence: because we think it would be good for the artificial superintelligences to pursue their own advanced science. While we might find it frustrating – perhaps even upsetting – that the artificial superintelligences will know things that we don't, we may pursue it all the same out of a moral obligation or feeling of goodwill towards our artificial progeny.

There are other motivations that may result in the automated scenario as an unintended consequence. Perhaps, for example, we think that it is our moral responsibility or destiny to spread intelligence across the Universe. If that intelligence just so happens to pursue automated science on its interstellar journey, then so be it.

Equally as numerous are those reasons why we might decide not to pursue the automated scenario. Perhaps the discoveries the artificial superintelligence makes and passes on to us would yield new and terrible weapons. Or maybe we think that, since they would require some internal and unchecked agency, it would increase the risk of a doomsday scenario such as human enslavement or annihilation. Perhaps it's simply the concern that some of the superintelligences will begin to operate with an uncannily human hubris, experimenting in ways that are dangerous, unethical or contrary to humanity's shared values.

But, despite these concerns, it seems unlikely that we will be able to stop its development, if it becomes technically possible. Arguably, the most likely reason we will end up with the automated scenario is because we simply cannot escape the forces of capital and competition. We may arrive there without much thought, simply because we can or because someone wants to build it first. The future may simply happen to us, whether we reflectively want it or not.

We will be stuck with our curiosity to understand and explain the natural world around us

Careful readers will note that there are several motivations that are absent from the litany of possible reasons for pursuing the automated scenario: most notably, all the reasons we currently pursue science. We would not pursue the automated scenario out of a desire to enhance our own knowledge and understanding of the world, to be able to give better explanations of phenomena, or exhibit greater interventional control over the natural world. These cannot be the reasons for pursuing the automated scenario because they are ruled out by the kind of science it is. Automated science takes the epistemic throne from humans, excluding us from the internal perspectives on the new and likely complex-beyond-our-ken discoveries. It would not, therefore, fulfil our human desires for understanding, explanation, knowledge or control. Perhaps with time we could learn to give up these desires – become a species uninterested and incurious. But I doubt it. Like the future, I suspect that these desires will come whether we like them or not.

So, what will we do? In his original presentation of the automated scenario, Humphreys suggested that the automated scenario would replace human science. I disagree. Since our desires for understanding, explanation, knowledge and control will remain, we cannot help but take actions to address those desires – to continue to do science. We humans create beautiful things, pursue interhuman connection in friendship and romance, and find and construct meaning in life. The same holds true for our motivations for science. We will be stuck with our curiosity to understand and explain the natural world around us.

If the automated scenario comes to pass, it seems that it will have to be as some new, alternative, secondary path – not a replacement, but an addition. Two species, pursuing science side by side, with different motivations, interests, frameworks and theories. Perhaps there will also be parts of science that artificial superintelligence is simply less interested in, such as the human quest to better understand our own minds, choices, relationships and health.

Indeed, if we are to remain human (and I cannot but hope that we will), we must continue to pursue science. What are we, really, if we are not beauty-seeking, friendship-making, meaning-constructing, hopelessly curious animals? Perhaps it is my limited powers of imagination that prevent me from conceiving of a future world in which we have abandoned these human desires. There are plenty of transhumanists who may think so. But I do not count it as a lack of creativity to see the goodness in beauty, in love, in meaning, and in science. Quite the contrary. I, for one, take hope in our hopeless curiosity.

Ghost Town delivers a brilliant supernatural puzzle adventure that you won't want to miss. Read on for our full review.

Mysteries are one of my oldest loves in fiction, and that's only grown through video games. Watching detectives pour over a murder case is one thing, yet user controlled spaces like games can sometimes struggle without the narrative luxury of pre-defined pacing. It's not enough to simply have a great story, you need to make the player an active participant who can feel accomplished without making it too difficult. It's a fine line, one that Ghost Town walks almost flawlessly.

Fireproof Games have supported modern VR since the beginning with Omega Agent, and it wasn't until five years later where the studio truly left its mark with The Room VR: A Dark Matter. The team's flagship puzzle series immediately left an impression in VR with its rich production values and satisfying puzzles, and Ghost Town builds upon these fine foundations well.

Gameplay footage from the first level captured by UploadVR

Ghost Town takes a supernatural approach that immediately intrigues, only this time we're in the '80s as an Irish witch turned exorcist and ghost hunter, Edith Penrose. Joined by our paranormal detective agency partner, Rina, what follows is a thoroughly gripping narrative that sees us searching for Edith's missing brother. Fireproof's not afraid to have some fun with this story, balancing good humor while effectively building up suspense.

Ghost Town splits each major segment into chapters, set in different locations across the UK as we uncover the wider mystery. I'm enjoying how the game blends its narrative with the gameplay. Understandably, you can't leave an area during an active cutscene without getting a warning flash up, though a particularly striking incident occurs midway through.

My favorite example is when you're receiving crucial information about a suspect, with the information projected around you while placing your hand on an orb. All very atmospheric until I accidentally discovered that removing your hand causes the scene and music to fade, while the other character continues talking. Moments like these add crucial immersive depth, and there's every chance someone unaware of this could miss that entirely.

Edith doesn't spend her entire journey simply chatting away and holding strange orbs. However, I'm hesitant to say too much because half the joy of puzzle solving comes from finding the answers yourself. What I can say is that most of these are well-designed without too much hand holding; the environmental storytelling merges nicely with exploration to provide the answers.

Most puzzles aren't overly challenging, either. There's enough thought required to make you feel accomplished, and I'm impressed at how intuitive solving many of them feels. Whether it's finding the right settings combination for electrical devices or attuning your scanner to the right wavelength, Ghost Town helpfully provides enough information through the environment without simply handing you the answer. I've only been stuck on two occasions, assisted by the optional hint system that provides useful advice in three parts.

These puzzles are only boosted by some great interactivity with good physicality. You can gently feel the haptics as you cast spells with responsive motion controls to help trapped spirits return to the afterlife, achieved by severing their links to key objects from their pasts. Pulling inventory items out of a flat menu that appears when pressing a face button isn't the most immersive method, but it's a minor thing and I still feel like part of this world.

My only major complaint is that I wish there was more here, and Ghost Town takes roughly five hours to complete. Which in itself is fine. The story never feels drawn out, the general pacing works well, and this leads to a satisfying conclusion. It's just that good, and I'd love to see more in a sequel, which I hope happens given the game ends with some open-ended threads. Each level hides a set of collectible magazines, though it's not a big replayability incentive on its own.

Ghost Town offers two movement options; artificial stick-based locomotion and teleportation. You can adjust the speed with an 'analog movement' setting that gradually increases the acceleration instead of using a constant movement speed. Snap turning and smooth turning camera options are both available with adjustable speeds.

Snap fade can also be implemented for additional comfort alongside movement vignettes. Seated and standing gameplay modes are supported. You can adjust the size and height of subtitles, should you wish to have them on. Various audio sliders are included, controller vibration can be turned off, and a hint system can also be switched on.

Still, Ghost Town's a visual treat for Quest 3 that pushes the limits of this headset. Each environment is great to explore, character models look nice, resolution seems sharp and I never encountered any performance issues. From London apartments to a haunted Scottish lighthouse, there's great atmospheric design that's complemented by a fitting soundtrack. The only downside is that the level of detail isn't always the best, and I can occasionally see textures change in front of me. 

I haven't had the chance to check how Ghost Town runs on Quest 2 by comparison right now, and I'm keen to see how the Steam and PlayStation VR2 versions compare when those editions launch later this year. When it's already looking this good in standalone VR, I'm feeling optimistic for higher spec hardware.

It's not a stretch to say that Ghost Town is one of the best VR games so far this year. Fireproof Games has delivered a worthy spiritual successor to The Room VR: A Dark Matter that employs a similarly strong level of VR interactivity, backed up by great visuals on Quest 3, a thoroughly engrossing supernatural narrative and intuitive puzzles. I do wish the journey lasted just a little longer, but what's here is an essential experience that you won't want to miss.

FORT WORTH — Lauren Yee's ability to tame her wild imagination into coherent narratives anyone can relate to has made her not only popular with theater companies but also an in-demand writer of series television.

Circle Theatre's regional premiere of her widely produced play The Hatmaker's Wife is the latest example of how Yee strikes a credible balance between crowd-pleasing entertainment and a deeper look at the human condition.

A comedy with serious undertones about the nature of relationships, Hatmaker's is structured as a story-within-a-story with gently applied supernatural elements as the glue. The wall talks. Pages of text fall from the ceiling. Eventually, a goofy golem shows up.

A young couple (Sky Williams and Jon Garrard) is moving into their first house. They joke about its modesty. Boxes sit haphazardly in the living room. A couch stands on its side. Before they're introduced, an older man (Randy Pearlman) clutches a hat, raising it to his head with a sigh. Enter his long-suffering wife (Krista Scott) and best friend and neighbor (Patrick Bynane).

The audience's view is partially blocked by window frames in front of the stage suggesting we're privy to intimacies that don't often see the light of day. But like Hetchman, the puttering, dissatisfied hatmaker of the title, we've all struggled to locate the TV remote. To comic effect, he manages to pick it up with a metal grabber.

“Have you seen my hat?” he inquires in a thick Eastern European accent.

“You think I look at you every day,” his wife retorts in the specifically similar tones of 20th-century Jewish immigrants.

Williams, whose character is a copy editor of safety manuals, follows the action as pages of the Hetchmans' story begin dropping into her hands. She can see the couple. Her boyfriend Gabe, a schoolteacher, cannot. Whooshing sounds signal the arrival of this strangely comic dimension.

It's the bittersweet tale of a lost fedora and the owner's wife who goes on the hunt for her own, mirroring the less overt tension between the young couple now occupying the Hetchman home.

As she begins her off-stage journey, Mrs. Hetchman rolls out of the fireplace with the missing hat, a cloud of fog trailing her like a train leaving the station on a winter morning. It's funny because the supernatural is rendered with such low-tech effects.

But despite the magical twists, the plot is grounded in the ordinary. The play even feels lighthearted — including a talking wall (Daniel Ruelas) that Hetchman and his friend Meckel are aware of — until it doesn't. Yee's script and the direction from Circle artistic director Ashley H. White hint at the darker aspects of the characters' relationships. They have secrets from each other that will eventually emerge.

Seen at the production's last preview before opening night, the cast is uniformly believable. But Scott's character, quietly stewing under an engulfing wig, glasses and frumpy clothing, stands out. Bynane's chatty, upbeat Meckel also charms. The comedy grows with the arrival of a ratty version of a resourceful golem portrayed by Garrard before a darker shift in tone.

When Yee closes the circle between the two couples with a paranormal occurrence near the end of The Hatmaker's Wife, it's hard to swallow. It's not a happy ending but more of an attempt at a plausible explanation for why these people have been drawn together. Yee and Circle have created an amusing, otherworldly scenario that also comments on the difficulties of loving the people closest to you.

      Metal, Hardcore, Indie, Rock    

Wretched Blessing is back and heavier than ever with their new EP “Psychic Barriers to Entry”, out today (April 24) via their own label, Two Mongrels Recordings. The Chicago duo — Rae Amitay (Immortal Bird) and Kayhan Vaziri (Yautja) — go all in on a noisy fusion of death metal, hardcore, and punk, throwing in gritty samples and unpredictable rhythm shifts for good measure.


The opening track “Decalcified” sets the tone with a ruthless blend of d-beat grooves and doomy chaos, capped by a crushing finale. Amitay says the song draws influence from RFK Jr.'s infamous brain worm story and Ministry's “TV II”, which pretty much sums up how unhinged and intense it sounds.



Lyrically, the EP vents about modern-day frustration and mental collapse, pushing the band further into raw, unfiltered heaviness. With thunderous production and punchy riffs, this one hits hard from start to finish.

Summary: A deep psychological need to feel significant drives much of human behavior, and can also lead people toward conspiracy theories and extremist beliefs. Drawing from decades of research and real-world examples, experts explain how feelings of insignificance, especially in uncertain times, make people more susceptible to narratives that promise belonging, identity, and a sense of control.

Conspiracy theories often offer a seductive appeal: they make people feel special, “in the know,” and provide a clear villain to blame for their suffering. The analysis argues that self-awareness is critical in avoiding these traps, urging individuals to understand their personal motivations and emotional triggers.

Key Facts:

Source: Taylor and Francis Group

While all people are innately driven to find meaning in their lives, this subconscious desire pulls some people to conspiracy theories and dangerous belief systems.

After an extensive review of psychological research, renowned social psychologist Arie Kruglanski and journalist Dan Raviv show how people's need for ‘significance' propels our actions, governs our feelings, and dominates our thoughts in their new book The Quest for Significance.

“Experts on human motivation contend that all people share the same set of basic needs, and everything people do, try to attain, or avoid is in the service of satisfying one or more of those basic needs,” they explain.

“The need for significance and mattering is one such pre-eminent basic need that all people have.”

Drawing on both academic, peer-reviewed research and the personal experiences of the authors, including Kruglanski's childhood in Poland during the Holocaust, the authors explore how this need for meaning can motivate people towards harmful and even violent acts – including believing conspiracy theories.

They also suggest that self-awareness is key to how people can avoid becoming susceptible.

The authors spotlight factors that make modern society ‘fraught with uncertainty', from financial chaos to the Ukraine war, the rise of authoritarians, and global health crises.

“But it is not the uncertainty alone that has been so troubling to so many,” they explain. “It is a loss of significance that the uncertainty connotes.”

They explain that for some people, uncertainty suggests that worst case scenarios are possible or even likely – for example that financial instability will leave them homeless, or increased numbers of immigrants will mean no resources left for themselves.

“The loss of significance that people around the globe have been experiencing makes them vulnerable to a particular brand of narratives; ones that acknowledge their fears and anxieties and blame some agent or entity for nefarious plots and actions aimed at humiliating and diminishing them,” they explain.

“An important aspect of those narratives has been a call to arms against the party or parties allegedly responsible for these evil machinations.

“In recent years, there has been a proliferation of conspiracy theories identifying an assortment of culprits as the enemy that must be violently confronted and whose satanic plans must be aggressively thwarted.”

The authors include examples such as the conspiracy theory by David Icke that an interdimensional race of reptilians has assumed human form and is plotting to take over the world, including 43 U.S. presidents and the British Royal Family – a theory which he has spread in multiple books and lectures.  

“From a psychological perspective, the real question is what do these theories offer Icke's audiences that motivates them to take the claims seriously? In fact, they offer quite a lot. First, to be privy to a truth so scandalous and shocking makes a person feel very special, one of a select few ‘in the know',” they explain.

The science of psychology reveals that people's judgments and beliefs are strongly guided by their motivations, and because conspiracy narratives make people feel significant and special and often offer hope for a better future, they tend to be taken seriously by ‘significance-deprived' audiences exposed to them.

The authors point out that particularly when people's sense of significance is lowered by negative life circumstances, they are susceptible to narratives that offer to raise their dignity and sense of mattering.

“Disseminated by social media at lightning speed, conspiracy narratives purport to identify the alleged culprits responsible for proliferating misery,” they explain.

 “In our private lives, and on the world stage, the challenge is to find ways that can enhance our significance as a win-win project, rather than through a bitter, competitive zero-sum game.”

Self-awareness is key

The authors suggest the biggest threat to society is that ‘self-knowledge is typically in short supply', and they urge people to understand their own drives for meaning, to better understand what motivates them or what damages their sense of significance.

They explain: “People are often blissfully unaware of why they do what they do, and what basic motives underlie their choices, decisions, and actions. Despite these misgivings, it may be better to face the truth about ourselves and navigate it, rather than bury our head in the proverbial sand.”

To increase one's chances of finding happiness and success, the book suggests understanding one's own needs – but also to listen to and observe family, work colleagues, and peers, because it is often easy to provide that person with significance, and then benefit from respect and significance given in return.

Rigorous psychological research has previously documented how most people are oblivious to what causes even their most routine actions – let alone beliefs.

The authors suggest that to protect ourselves against harmful quests for significance, including conspiracy theories, we should learn what makes us tick – whether we are motivated by money, love, values or some other ambition.

“If you can somehow quantify how important significance is to you, how strongly you react to challenges to your dignity, how badly you feel when “put down” by others, and what arouses your envy, empathy, or admiration, then you might identify guidelines for navigating your life more successfully,” they explain

“This part of “knowing thyself” may suggest to you which situations could be beneficial and which ones to avoid, which invitations to accept and which to turn down, which friends to choose or to eschew, and which goals to commit to or reject.”

A North Alabama realtor has been missing for months. His family is desperate to find him. This month – there's been a big turn in the case.

Ronald Dumas, Jr – a Huntsville area realtor and father of three went missing back in December. Two suspects were caught April 8th. 32-year-old Quintarius White is wanted for kidnapping and 27-year-old Kierra Clark is wanted for conspiracy to commit kidnapping. Both are from Memphis. Three are still on the run.

“This has taken a toll on our family,” Shakeria Samples said. “We are trying to be as positive as we can be but the kids notice – they're very intelligent. To go from seeing and talking to someone every day to not seeing or talking to them for 109 days – it's heartbreaking.”

The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, the world's largest solar telescope, can see the sun in unprecedented detail. Here is the first image from its newly-activated camera.

Weather on Earth can be wild, but it's not the only kind of weather we have to deal with. Space weather — all the winds and particles streaming off the sun — can have major impacts on Earth and human infrastructure. In the worst cases, this can mean dangerous disruption to our power grids and communications satellites.

To help us predict these space storms, astronomers have a newly improved space weatherman — and it's the best one to date. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), perched atop the Hawaiian mountain of Haleakalā, is the world's largest telescope used for studying the sun and predicting these storms.

The team behind this technological marvel recently hit a major milestone, finally turning on one of DKIST's most powerful cameras — known as the Visible Tunable Filter, or VTF — after more than a decade working on its creation.

This camera is the final piece of the puzzle for DKIST, and the VTF's addition ""will complete its initial arsenal of scientific instruments,"" Carrie Black, director of the National Solar Observatory, said in a statement.

""The significance of the technological achievement is such that one could easily argue the VTF is the Inouye Solar Telescope's heart, and it is finally beating at its forever place,"" Matthias Schubert, project scientist for the VTF, said in the statement.



VTF's first image shows a major clump of sunspots, dark blobs on the sun's surface caused by its intense magnetic field, each blob measuring wider than the continental United States. This impressive camera can see details down to a resolution of about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) per pixel on the solar surface — an absolutely wild resolution given that the sun is tens of millions of miles away from us.

VTF provides more than just a simple snapshot. It captures images at multiple wavelengths of light to measure a spectrum, while also gathering information on how the light's electric field is oriented (known as polarization). These extra perspectives on the sun help reveal details of the solar surface, magnetic field and plasma that are otherwise invisible, informing our predictions for space weather and solar flares.

During just one observation of the sun, this instrument can collect more than 10 million spectra — graphs of the light's intensity over different wavelengths — which help scientists determine how hot the solar atmosphere is, how strong the sun's magnetic field is and more.

Today's news is only the beginning for the VTF and DKIST. The incredibly complex instrument still requires more testing and set-up, which is expected to be completed by next year.

But the newly released first images show great promise for how much we can learn about the sun, our nearest star. These images are ""something no other instrument in the telescope can achieve in the same way,"" said National Solar Observatory optical engineer Stacey Sueoka. ""I'm excited to see what's possible as we complete the system.""

Researchers may have discovered Mississippi's largest ever mosasaur after pulling a Cretaceous-aged fossil out of a riverbed south of Starkville.

A giant ""sea dragon"" backbone plucked from a riverbank in Mississippi could belong to the largest mosasaur ever found in the state, scientists say.

Researchers only found a single vertebra from the creature and aren't sure exactly how large the mosasaur was in total, but it is estimated to have been at least 30 feet (9 meters) long, Hattiesburg American reported.

Mosasaurs, or ""sea dragons,"" ruled the oceans when dinosaurs dominated the land towards the end of the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago). The newly discovered fossil belonged to Mosasaurus hoffmanni, which was one of the largest — if not the largest — mosasaur species.

James Starnes, a geologist at the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, spotted the fossil protruding from a stream bed just south of Starkville on April 15, he told Live Science in an email. His fellow geologist, Jonathan Leard, then carefully pulled it out of the sediment. 

""I immediately knew what it was, but was completely awe struck by its size,"" Starnes said. ""The feeling you get when you find a fossil, even as a professional, never gets old. But when you find something you have never seen before, the elation can be overwhelming.""

Mosasaurs were a diverse group of marine reptiles. Researchers are still figuring out the sizes of the largest mosasaur species, but they likely reached a maximum length of around 50 feet (15 m). One of the largest specimens on record is a skull that belonged to M. hoffmanni and is estimated to be around 56 feet (17 meters) long, according to a 2014 study published in the journal Proceedings of the Zoological Institute RAS.

The newly discovered vertebra fossil is more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) wide at its widest point. Starnes and his colleagues compared the fossil to the largest mosasaur remains held in the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, which include jaws, portions of a skull and a tooth. Starnes noted that the jaws and skull appeared to be from a smaller individual than the individual represented by the new vertebra, but the tooth looked like it belonged to an individual that was more comparable in size to the new specimen. In other words, the new fossil seemed to belong to a mosasaur that was bigger or as big as the largest in the state museum. Starnes noted it could be the largest in the state's history.

""It may represent the largest,"" Starnes said. ""The lumbar vertebra we found is a good indicator to the relative size of the animal. This is the biggest one that I have ever encountered.""

M. hoffmanni was an apex predator, hunting down prey with large jaws and cone-shaped teeth. Large mosasaurs likely ate whatever they wanted for the most part, including fish, sharks, sea birds and even other mosasaurs — researchers have found the remains of mosasaurs in the fossilized stomachs of other mosasaurs. The giant mosasaur that left behind this particulare vertebra likely had no shortage of food in what is now Mississippi, which had a very different environment towards the end of the Cretaceous.

""Mississippi was completely covered at the time by warm shallow tropical sea that was teaming with life, including a wide diversity of sharks, fish, marine lizards, and ammonites,"" Starnes said. ""Pterosaurs and even some birds would have been flying overhead while a variety of both plant and meat-eating dinosaurs of different sizes and kinds would have been walking the shore lines and through the wooded forests along the coastal estuaries.""

As well as being one of the largest, M. hoffmanni was also one of the last mosasaurs. The group went extinct alongside non-avian dinosaurs after the Chicxulub asteroid slammed into Earth 66 million years ago. The rich marine ecosystems that mosasaurs depended on collapsed following the strike, bringing the reign of this dominant ocean predator to a permanent end.

In this article

OKLAHOMA CITY — Amazon and Nvidia executives said Thursday that the construction of artificial intelligence data centers is not slowing down, as recession fears have some investors questioning whether tech companies will pull back on some their plans.

""There's been really no significant change,"" Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said at a conference organized by the Hamm Institute for American Energy. ""We continue to see very strong demand, and we're looking both in the next couple years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up.""

The comments run contrary to worrying buzz building on Wall Street about tech companies changing data center buildout plans. Wells Fargo analysts said Monday that Amazon Web Services is pausing some leases on data center commitments, citing industry sources. The magnitude of the pause was unclear, the analysts said, but the comments raised fears that Amazon was doing something similar to Microsoft's recent move to pull back on some early stage projects.

Miller said ""there's been little tea leaf reading and extrapolating to strange results"" about Amazon's plans.

Nvidia is also not seeing signs of a slowdown, said Josh Parker, the chipmaker's senior director of corporate sustainability.

""We haven't seen a pullback,"" Parker said. The advent China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a selloff in power stocks earlier this year as investors worried that its AI model is more efficient and data centers might need as much energy as originally anticipated.

But Parker said Nvidia sees compute and energy demand only rising due to AI, describing the reaction to DeepSeek as ""kneejerk."" Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark said 50 gigawatts of new power capacity will be needed by 2027 to support AI. That's the equivalent of about 50 new nuclear plants.

""Anthropic and the other AI companies, what we're seeing is tremendous growth in the need for new baseload power. We're seeing unprecedented growth,"" Clark said.

The executives were speaking at a gathering of tech and energy companies at a conference in Oklahoma City organized by the Hamm Institute to discuss how the U.S. can address the growing energy needs for artificial intelligence. There's a growing consensus in both industries that natural gas will be needed to meet the power needs.

Allegation against Rinaldo Nazzaro, founder of the Base, could shed new meaning on group's efforts inside Ukraine

Alleged former members of an international neo-Nazi terrorist organization are claiming its Russia-based and American leader is a Kremlin spy, according to online records reviewed by the Guardian.

The allegation that Rinaldo Nazzaro, a former Pentagon contractor and founder of the Base, listed as a designated terrorist organization all over the world, is an alleged Russian intelligence asset could bring new meaning to his group's latest effort: sabotage and assassination missions inside Ukraine to weaken the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

A website circulating on far-right Telegram channels is claiming to speak on behalf of former members of the Base and said it was “exposing” the group for what it really is: the cutout of Russia's federal intelligence agency, the FSB.

The members allege that they were always suspicious of Nazzaro's behavior and worried about who his handlers really were.

“[Nazzaro] presented himself as an army veteran who has been to Afghanistan, however during gun ranges he mentioned how he's never touched a shotgun in his life,” wrote the members.

“Things started becoming really SUS when a few members could see him texting on the phone in Russian, in a fluent/at least a good level as he was writing fast and seemingly naturally, all of that alone led to the belief that [Nazzaro] might be a Russian federal asset, and at that time it was already obvious that he was flying to Russia back and forth.”

For example, when a number of Base members were first being arrested, they noted he quickly, “gets into a plane to Russia”.

During the height of the Base's activities, it came to light that Nazzaro had worked in a top secret capacity as a drone targeting analyst for American special forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there were no records of him being in ground combat.

The ex-members also claimed how the Base's latest venture into Ukraine, where it is offering cash for operatives to carry out assassination and sabotage missions, is a Russian intelligence operation that is gaining traction. Recent videos online show the Base burning military vehicles with Ukrainian license plates, electrical boxes, and other activities inside the country.

The writers said the new Base cell in Ukraine was “bigger than any other fedop” carried out by Nazzaro.

“[Thus] not only are they trying to disrupt the system but also dislocate the Ukrainian forces which AGAIN furthers the interests of Russia,” they said.

Other evidence provided to the Guardian shows that whoever is running the account for the Base's Ukraine cell on Telegram, has paid for a bot army to up its follower numbers into the tens of thousands.

“How does The Base have money for so [many] bots and rewards for actions?” wrote a user affiliated with the website on Telegram. “I wonder who funds them.”

Nazzaro has increasingly leaned on Russian digital infrastructure to operate his global organization. Posts calling for attacks on Ukraine first appeared on the Base's VK account, which is hosted in Russia and run by Nazzaro. The recruitment email for the Base is also a Mail.ru address – the email provider of a well-known ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

Nazzaro, however, has repeatedly maintained that he is not affiliated with any spy agencies, even making an uncanny appearance on Kremlin state television in 2020, telling a reporter that he “never had any contact with any Russian security services”, something the ex-members also reference.

“That these accusations are also coming from alleged former members of the group is particularly interesting, given inside knowledge of the group they may have and Nazzaro's role within the global accelerationist white power movement,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a far-right analyst who saw the website and allegations circulating.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Follow:


            President Donald Trump's unprecedented tariffs, particularly on China, and recent attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell caused alarm among some of his top advisers and America's biggest CEOs, who warned of financial chaos and store shelves that could go bare, people familiar with the conversations said.
    


            The warnings — and the markets' own volatility this week — seemed to have broken through. Trump backed down Tuesday from his threats to try to remove Powell from the job, telling reporters in the Oval Office: “I have no intention of firing him.”



            That prompted sighs of relief on Wall Street. A day after markets boomed on comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that Trump would seek to de-escalate the trade war with China, US markets gained again on Wednesday.
    


            Top administration officials were also relieved by Trump's Oval Office statement on Powell, the people familiar with the matter said. The officials had become unnerved by the heated rhetoric and wary of a prolonged legal battle should Trump attempt to unseat the Fed chair.
    


            The Dow closed higher by 420 points, or 1.07%. The broader S&P 500 gained 1.67% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5%.
    


            The three major indexes held on to a rally but finished well below their highest levels of the day. The Dow surged nearly 1,200 points in the morning before pulling back: Stocks came off their highest levels after Bessent cautioned that it could take considerable time to rebalance trade between the United States and China.
    


            There is a “2 to 3-year timeline for the full rebalancing,” Bessent told a group of reporters on Wednesday after delivering a speech at an event hosted by the Institute of International Finance, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.
    


            The comments, previously reported by Bloomberg News and CNBC, underscore how obstacles remain even as investors are eager for trade agreements and CEOs seek clarity on tariffs.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday said on Fox News there will be “no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China.”
    


            “The president has made it clear China needs to make a deal with the United States of America, and we are optimistic that will happen,” Leavitt said. “And when that continues, it will be up to the president what the tariff rate on China will be.”
    


            Trump on Wednesday told reporters that his administration will get a “fair deal” with China on trade, adding more broadly that negotiations with countries “are going very well.”
    


            When Trump was asked in an impromptu gaggle outside the White House if he was talking to China actively, he responded: “Actively. Everything's active.”
    


            “Every country wants to partake, even countries that have ripped us off for many, many years. China is an example, but it's not just China, European Union. They ripped us off for many, many years, and those days are over,” he added.
    


            US Treasury bonds initially rallied Wednesday before giving back those gains in a stark reversal. The benchmark 10-year yield fellow below 4.3% in the morning before rising back up to almost 4.39%, just below where it had settled Tuesday. Yields and prices trade in opposite directions.
    


            Trump's notable shift in tone toward Powell and China came a day after he met privately in the Oval Office with chief executives of four major US retail companies who conveyed concerns about rising economic fallout from Trump's tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created for financial markets.
    


            The CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot, all of whom delivered a blunt message about interruptions in the supply chain and its effects on consumers, were invited to the White House as part of an ongoing internal campaign to make the case to Trump about the real-world impact of his policies, administration officials said.

Trump can't make up his mind about why he's doing tariffs



            Trump's tariffs have placed significant pressure on the retail sector. The business leaders warned that store shelves across America could “soon be empty,” two people familiar with the meeting said, as they presented a dire economic picture that could come into sharper view within weeks.
    


            For weeks, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior advisers have been fielding alarming calls from business leaders about the fallout from Trump's tariff policies and his ongoing threats to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Taken together, the president's words have rattled markets and shaken confidence in the administration's stewardship of the economy.
    


            Bessent, who has emerged as one of the leading Cabinet officials whose words have calmed financial markets, played a key role in arranging the meeting of CEOs, officials said, as part of an effort to show Trump how serious the economic challenges facing the administration have become.
    


            Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart who has developed a cordial relationship with Trump through meetings at Mar-a-Lago and several mutual friends, bluntly told Trump that the trade war with China had already started to disrupt the supply chain, officials said, and would only intensify by summer.
    


            Axios first reported the fallout from the president's meeting with CEOs.
    


            Many Trump advisers did not ultimately believe the president would attempt to fire Powell, given the warnings he'd been receiving from his economic team — including Bessent — stretching back several months.
    


            And Trump had seemed to absorb the notes of caution.
    


            But his amped-up rhetoric over the past week had caused fresh uncertainty about his intentions — in particular, his message on social media Thursday that Powell's “termination cannot come fast enough!” and his follow-up Monday calling Powell a “major loser.”

            Trump has argued that the Fed should cut rates soon to speed up the economy, perhaps as a way to counteract the significant economic drag that his massive tariffs are expected to create. But Powell has said repeatedly the Fed will only make a decision to raise or lower rates after careful consideration and would not rush a decision or issue an emergency rate cut before the rate-setting committee's next scheduled meeting in May.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued Trump's line of attack Tuesday in a press briefing, in which she defended the president for criticizing the Fed. She suggested that the Fed's action to lower rates in the late stages of the Biden administration — but not (yet) under Trump — could be political. There is no evidence the independent Fed is taking a political stance, and Powell has vehemently and repeatedly denied suggestions that the Fed plays politics when making its monetary policy decisions.
    


            “The president believes they have been making moves and taking action in the name of politics rather than the name of what's right for the American economy,” Leavitt said prior to Trump's Oval Office comments. “The president has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.”
    


            Trump's top economic adviser Kevin Hassett also told reporters the White House was studying whether Trump could fire Powell, and said a potential “new legal analysis” might ease market concerns. That represented a break from Hassett's prior comments in support of the central bank's independence.
    


            Leavitt said Tuesday that Hassett had recently changed his mind on the Fed after Powell insisted the central bank wouldn't rush a decision to cut rates.
    


            “I also spoke to Kevin Hassett about the Fed as well and he has called into question the Fed's independence and whether they are actually doing things out of the best interest of the economy or are they doing it for partisan reasons,” she said.
    


            But White House officials had long determined that firing Powell would spark legal challenges and market tumult.
    


            And if any study was actually underway, Trump suggested Tuesday it wasn't necessary. He said in the Oval Office he “never did” have any intention of removing Powell from the job.

Ukraine will have to compromise to achieve a peace settlement with Russia, Polish President Andrzej Duda has said. In an interview with Euronews on Thursday, Duda argued that a lasting peace must be built on mutual concessions.

Warsaw has been one of the staunchest supporters of Kiev in its conflict with Moscow. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has spoken out against any peace deals that would require Ukraine to cede territory.

“It has to be a compromise... in my personal opinion… each side will have to give in in some sense. Well, Ukraine will also have to give in in some sense, because that is probably what will happen,” Duda said.

Discussing US-led peace efforts, Duda argued that only US President Donald Trump, who he described as someone who “plays very tough,” is capable of mediating an end to the hostilities. Duda was the first EU leader to meet with Trump in person following his inauguration in January.

Acting as a mediator in the ongoing negotiations, Trump reportedly presented a peace framework to Kiev earlier this week. The proposal is said to have included the recognition of Crimea as Russian.

The peninsula, where most of the population is ethnically Russian, held a referendum to rejoin Russia in 2014 after a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky insisted on Wednesday that Kiev will never officially recognize Crimea as Russian – which elicited a sharp rebuke from Trump.

Moscow has also ruled out territorial concessions, saying the status of Crimea and the four other former Ukrainian regions that joined Russia after referendums in 2022 is not up for negotiation. Moscow has insisted that a peace deal must recognize the “reality on the ground.”

MOSCOW, April 24. /TASS/. NATO is strengthening its presence near Russia's western borders and expanding military infrastructure, effectively forming a ""strike fist,"" Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu told TASS in an interview.

""In the past year, the military forces of NATO countries deployed near Russia's western borders have increased nearly 2.5 times,"" Shoigu stated.

""This includes consistent development of military infrastructure across Eastern European states, deployment of strategic missile defense systems, and measures aimed at maintaining high combat readiness of tactical nuclear capabilities in Europe.""

He further highlighted that NATO is transitioning to a new combat readiness system, capable of deploying a force of 100,000 troops within 10 days, 300,000 within 30 days, and up to 800,000 after 180 days. ""These operational capabilities were openly tested during drills held in 2023-2024,"" Shoigu noted.

The Baltic States are utilizing Western funds to construct defense lines and establish NATO military bases within their territories. In addition to US Abrams tanks, Poland is actively acquiring South Korean armored vehicles and making plans to obtain 180 K2 Black Panther tanks by 2026. The country is also purchasing over 200 South Korean self-propelled artillery systems K9 and multiple launch rocket systems K239. Shoigu emphasized that these developments clearly point to whom this ""strike fist"" is being directed against.

NATO countries are also modernizing their air defense systems. ""Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands are upgrading their fleets of combat aircraft, purchasing American F-35 fighters, while Romania and Bulgaria are acquiring F-16 tactical fighters,"" Shoigu explained. Meanwhile, on the eastern flank, preparations are underway to expand the NATO airfield network to support increased aviation activity.

Shoigu also commented on the paradoxical trend: economically dependent countries, especially those in the EU, adopt increasingly aggressive rhetoric. ""The explanation is straightforward: these politicians fear losing financial subsidies from NATO and European funds and to secure further support they indulge in excessive Russophobia,"" he remarked. ""Otherwise, they would need to focus on resolving internal economic and social issues, which they are currently unable to address.""

He underscored that NATO's combined military expenditures far surpass Russia's, being more than 14 times greater. ""The Trump administration has demanded that European allies raise their military budgets to 5% of the GDP,"" Shoigu recalled. ""This proposal received mixed reactions within the alliance. Poland and the Baltic states supported the idea; Warsaw aims to increase defense spending to 4.7% of the GDP in 2025, while Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys announced plans for Vilnius to allocate between 5 and 6% of its GDP to defense from 2026 through at least 2030. Estonia also intends to reach a 5% defense spending target. These dependent states, heavily reliant on EU subsidies, are choosing to spend these funds on military buildup against an imaginary ‘Eastern threat,' rather than on social programs,"" he concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Thousands of mining insiders descended on Toronto in March for the annual Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada conference, the industry's premier convention. This year, not surprisingly, the one thing on everyone's mind was tariffs. We sent photographer Sage Szkabarnicki-Stuart to talk to delegates.

Louis Fourie, senior manager, geology, Respec (Saskatoon)

“There's ore in old mines and in the ground that we couldn't process historically but that we can now. Once we look past the speculation and buzzwords, there's a lot that we can do to make it beneficial for local communities. You can't have the energy transition without the minerals we need for it.”

Noah Singer, geology consultant (Montreal)

“If companies cut down on their orders, even if the tariffs magically go away overnight, it will take years to rebuild that volume, if ever. That means less money for investment and thus fewer workers—and often interns and juniors are first to be on the chopping block.”

Danette Schwab, VP of Exploration, Pacific Ridge (Vancouver)

“Start talking to First Nations early, before you start permitting. Many Nations are not outright opposed to resource development, but there must be benefits and environmental and cultural considerations.”

Kiera Broda, geoscience PhD candidate, McGill University (Montreal)

“Tariffs create uncertainty. However, they also offer an opportunity to reassess our economic practices. By improving permitting processes and strengthening local production, we can enhance economic resilience and foster national pride, enabling Canada's mining and mineral exploration industry to remain a leader in innovation.”

Ige Olusegun Omoniyi, Mary A Ogbe, Obadiah Simon Nkom and Olajide Olushola B., delegates from Nigeria.

Mary A. Ogbe, Ministry of Solid Minerals Development (Nigeria)

“Before Nigeria's independence, its GDP was sustained by mining. Then they discovered oil, and the focus changed. Mining has seen a comeback in the past four or five years—nickel, lithium, gold, copper, lead, zinc and more. Nigeria is going to do many more exploration projects very quickly, applying the latest tech and focusing on the green energy .”

Eduan Pieterse, country manager, VBKOM Mining Consultants Canada (Toronto)

“Typical drill rigs require a lot of space and create a lot of environmental disturbance. With this compact rig, you don't have to clear a lot of bush—it can be dragged around by a snowmobile. And because it's light, it doesn't consume a lot fuel, plus it's air-liftable.”

Bruce Achneepineskum, Chief, Marten Falls First Nation (Ontario)

“The Marten Falls community access road, which will connect to the road that goes up to the Ring of Fire mining area, winds around important sites for the community, including sacred sites. Any development projects happening on Treaty 9 territory—like the Ring of Fire—will need to be done in consultation with, and in collaboration with, the Matawa First Nations tribal council.”

David Truchot, managing partner, Veltiosis Consulting (Minneapolis)

“Imposing tariffs on such a critical industry, where it takes years, if not decades, to start a mine, is totally counterproductive. Miners need stability, not a whirlwind of flip-flopping economic conditions.”

Mike Carter, founding partner, First Green Energy (Vancouver)

“If you don't have social buy-in in Peru, they will shut down your project. Caring about the locals isn't just a nice-to-have anymore. You don't get a mine built without meaningful community support.”

Israel and the Jewish diaspora are marking Holocaust Remembrance Day, amid the ongoing war in Gaza. During the official ceremony, one Holocaust survivor defied protocol by calling for the release of hostages.

Commemorated both in Israel and in Jewish communities around the world, this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day started with a ceremony on Wednesday evening at Yad Vashem, the world's most well-known Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.

The ceremony took place amid the ongoing war in Gaza, and with the political situation in Israel threatening to escalate into an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Israeli officials, ambassadors and Holocaust survivors were in attendance.

The rest of the world observes International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27, the date when the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp was liberated by the Soviet Red Army. But Israel and the Jewish diaspora have their own memorial day on the Hebrew date of Nissan 27, a date chosen due to its close proximity to the beginning of the monthlong Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April 1943.

Similar to last year's event, the official ceremony and speeches on Wednesday evening centered on the terrorist attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023 which killed some 1,200 people, and the ensuing war in Gaza launched by Israel. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, Germany, the US and other states.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who arrived late to the ceremony due to what his office said was a security incident, once again echoed his comparison of Hamas members to ""Nazis, like Hitler,"" who were responsible for the deaths of 6 million European Jews during World War II.

""They want to kill, to destroy all the Jews,"" said Netanyahu. ""They openly declare their intent to destroy the Jewish state, and that will not happen.""

Yad Vashem and its head, Dani Dayan, have repeatedly called for refraining from comparing the October 7 terrorist attacks to the Holocaust, in an effort not to marginalize both events.

Some of the hostages released from Hamas captivity in Gaza were also in attendance as this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day events got underway.

Other former hostages, as well as the families of the Israelis currently held in Gaza, traveled to Poland to take part in the March of the Living, the annual event to commemorate the death marches from Auschwitz to Birkenau.

During the official ceremony in Jerusalem on Wednesday evening, Tunisia-born survivor Gad Fartouk defied protocol by shouting that the hostages should return home while lighting one of six torches in memory of Jews murdered in the Holocaust.

Fartouk, 93, the first Holocaust survivor of North African descent to light a memorial torch during the official ceremony, told Israeli outlet Ynet he felt it was ""empty"" not to mention the 59 hostages — some 20 of them believed to still be alive — still held by Hamas in Gaza.

The WHO, UNICEF and Gavi said there has been a rise in diseases like measles, meningitis and yellow fever. Funding cuts, misinformation and humanitarian crises have worsened the problem.

The WHO, UNICEF and Gavi vaccine alliance on Wednesday warned that there has been a global uptick in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, meningitis and yellow fever. 

The joint statement was made at the start of World Immunization Week, which takes place from April 24-30. 

""Vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past five decades. Funding cuts to global health have put these hard-won gains in jeopardy,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. 

The statement said measles was making a dangerous comeback, with cases rising by 20% within a year to reach 10.3 million in 2023. This upward trend is likely to continue in 2024 and 2025.

In the past year itself, 138 countries have had measles cases with 61 reporting outbreaks. This is the highest number observed since 2019.

""The global funding crisis is severely limiting our ability to vaccinate more than 15 million vulnerable children in fragile and conflict-affected countries against measles,"" added UNICEF chief Catherine Russell.

In the first three months of 2025, more than 5,500 cases of meningitis and about 300 deaths were reported in 22 African countries. In 2024, 26,000 cases and almost 1,400 deaths were reported across 24 countries. 

The statement also said cases of meningitis and yellow fever have been on the rise in Africa in 2024. After a decline over the past decade, 124 cases of yellow fever were reported in 12 countries last year. 

There has also been a rise in children missing their routine vaccine doses, despite efforts being made to catch up after the pandemic. About 14.5 million children missed all of their routine vaccine doses in 2023.

Gavi has called for at least $9 billion (€7.9 billion) in funding ahead of its June 25 pledging summit ""to protect 500 million children, saving at least 8 million lives from 2026-2030.""

This comes amid massive cuts in vaccine funding, misinformation as well as other humanitarian crises such as the war in Gaza.

US President Donald Trump has drastically cut humanitarian aid to various agencies since taking office.

When Stephen Matthews votes in Canada's election on Monday, the country's cost of living will be at the forefront of his mind.

“I'm a lifelong Liberal but I'm definitely leaning Conservative,” he said as he picked up his iced coffee order at a Starbucks in the bellwether constituency of Peterborough about an hour's drive from Toronto.

The country's topsy turvy election has shifted one way and then another.

Pierre Poilievre, the populist Conservative leader, ran up a massive poll lead at the start of the year only for Donald Trump to undermine his position by setting his sights on making Canada the 51st American state.

And he lost his best chance of victory when the Liberal Party ditched Justin Trudeau, whose popularity cratered after 10, scandal-hit years in power, for Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England.

Behind those upheavals, the polls show another seismic shift: younger voters have moved to the Conservative Party in search of change and help with the soaring cost of living. At the same time older voters have stuck with the Liberal Party as the best way to keep Mr Trump at bay.

Mr Matthews, 33, who works at a superstore, said he was back living with his parents.

“The biggest thing for us is to own a piece of property,” he said, describing how his parents had land that perhaps one day he might be able to build on. “But otherwise we're not gonna own a house.”

“We'd have to win the lottery,” said Jessica Wynne. She looks far from a typical conservative voter, with a streak of blonde running through her dark hair, but she said she was also thinking of voting Conservative for the first time, as she described living pay cheque to pay cheque from her job as a housekeeper.

In Toronto, the standard price for a home is now 1.4 million Canadian dollars (more than $750,000). That is almost double the price from four years ago.

Many voters blame the Liberal Party, which has been in power for 10 years. Mr Trump's tariffs have only heightened worries about job losses or a recession.

Polls show how voter priorities change with age.

While the top issue for Boomers over the age of 60 is dealing with Mr Trump. Among Gen Z it is the cost of living.

Some 46 per cent said that was the most important factor in the election, according to a recent poll by Abacus Data, followed by the price of housing on 33 per cent. Only 15 per cent cited the American president as the top issue.

David Colletto, founder of Abacus, said: “Both men and women over 60 are strongly in Mark Carney's camp right now, and that is a reversal of what we have seen over the last 10 years with Trudeau.”

While younger voters were moving away from the Liberal Party, he said Boomers “are overwhelmed with the uncertainty and the fear that the Trump stuff has done to them. They're paying, you know, a lot more attention to the news than younger Canadians.”

Mr Carney was in Peterborough last weekend. It is Conservative-held but has a reputation as a bellwether, generally falling to the overall victor.

And it lies in the belt around Toronto that will have a huge say in who becomes prime minister. House prices are an ever present part of conversation.

Supply has not kept up with demand across the country, and Mr Poilievre has hammered the issue during the campaign. He has accused Liberal governments of breaking “Canada's promise” that anyone who works hard should be able to afford their own home.

Polling tracker websites show him an average of four to five points behind Mr Carney.

Across town, Robert Howitt was sitting down to a late breakfast at the Lock Street Diner, an old-fashioned eatery decorated with ice hockey memorabilia.

His story reflects the other part of the demographic divide.

“I was going Poilievre but then Carney is walking into a forum that he is extremely confident in and where he has had success,” the 74-year-old retired investment adviser said, adding that he wanted a leader who would stand up to Mr Trump.

“He was governor of the Bank of Canada, governor of the Bank of England, he's been on several boards so he's very well schooled in politics and, more importantly, in diplomatic relations.”

Mr Trudeau, he added, had “driven the country into a hole”. Mr Carney, he said, was just enough of a change to keep him voting Liberal.

Follow:


            A federal judge significantly curtailed the Trump administration from implementing a policy that threatens to withhold federal funding from schools for engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion – or DEI – programs or if they incorporate race in certain ways in many other aspects of student life.
    


            US District Judge Landya McCafferty said in a scathing opinion that the administration's policy, laid out by the Department of Education in a letter to educators earlier this year, was “textbook viewpoint discrimination,” likely violating the First Amendment's Free Speech protections.
    


            She also concluded that the National Education Association, the administration's opponent in the case, was likely to succeed in its arguments that the policy was unconstitutionally vague and that the agency ran afoul of procedural steps required by law in how it implemented the policy.
    


            “The ban on DEI embodied in the 2025 Letter leaves teachers with a Hobson's Choice,” the judge, a Barack Obama appointee who sits in New Hampshire, wrote, noting that the educators must choose between teaching curricula that invites penalty from the federal government or risking their professional credentials by aiding by the Trump policy.
    


            “The Constitution requires more,” she wrote.
    


            McCafferty declined to issue a nationwide order blocking the policy, but is halting the administration from enforcing it against any school that employs members of the National Education Association and receives federal funding.
    


            Her preliminary injunction comes after the administration and the challengers had reached a short-term agreement to delay implementation of the policy, included a certification process that would require schools to turn over certain information, so that the judge could consider the case. That agreement was set to expire on Thursday.
    


            At least two other courts are considering challenges to the policy, including a DC judge who is hearing arguments in the lawsuit before her on Thursday.
    


            Thursday's ruling is the latest development in legal challenges to Trump's policy targeting DEI programs in schools. During the two-week enforcement pause, the administration was not allowed to bring any enforcement actions or investigations under a so-called “Dear Colleague” letter sent to schools in February that threatened to withhold federal funding from schools if they engaged in diversity, equity and inclusion programs or if race played a role in other aspects of student life.
    


            The letter was geared toward all preschool, elementary, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, as well as state educational agencies that receive financial assistance from the federal government.
    


            The National Education Association and its New Hampshire chapter sued over the policy, alleging the letter as both impermissible vague and encroaching “on teaching and academic freedom.”
    


            Trump has waged war on DEI efforts since the start of his second term and has taken action against several elite universities, demanding changes to their DEI programs. The administration has already rolled back DEI programs, arrested international students and revoked their visas, and frozen federal funding for schools that refused to submit to its demands.
    


            The administration froze over $2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts at Harvard University after its leaders refused to make key policy changes, including eliminating DEI programs, resulting in a clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight as Harvard sued the federal government.
    


            Policy changes were also demanded of Columbia University, though the school later announced several changes to address the Trump administration's demands, an apparent concession to the federal government.

Follow:


            The Justice Department terminated hundreds of grants this week, effectively slashing the budgets for organizations across the country that assist crime victims and fight both gun violence and opioid abuse.
    


            The cancellations, which claimed that the more than 350 already-distributed grants “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” sent shockwaves through grantee organizations.
    


            “I was flabbergasted,” said Renee Williams, who leads the non-partisan National Center for the Victims of Crime. Her organization has operated a hotline for 10 years through a DOJ grant, and connects victims of heinous crimes to specialists that help them navigate everything from legal assistance to state bureaucracies.
    


            That grant was cut Tuesday evening.
    


            “I genuinely believed that this administration had victims in the forefront of their mind,” Williams told CNN. “But to get that email to see that they were cutting out victims, and that this hotline – which we know is a lifesaving resource to so many people – was no longer a priority was just stunning.”
    


            It is not unusual for new administrations to review applications for federal grants, or award grants based on their political preferences. But it is highly unusual for grants to be clawed back once the money is allocated and is being used, former DOJ officials told CNN.
    


            And though the cuts represent a relatively small portion of the grants administered by the department, experts worry that the funding cuts will fatally impact organizations whose projects are already underway.
    


            “People who have been hurt by crime are just going to be hurt again when they try to get help,” Kristina Rose, the former director of the Biden Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime, which oversees billions of dollars in grant funding. “Everyone eventually will feel the impact of this.”
    


            The cuts were first reported by The Washington Post.
    


            “This Department of Justice is focused on prosecuting criminals, getting illegal drugs off of the streets, and protecting American institutions from toxic DEI and sanctuary city policies,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in response to CNN's questions about the cuts. “Discretionary funds that are no longer aligned with the administration's priorities are subject to review and reallocation.”
    


            Among programs whose grants were cancelled are organizations who work to protect and help individuals who were the victims of a crime.
    


            Those groups – many of which have received bipartisan support in the past – say that without their funding, the victims they support could be left without legal help, safe housing, medical and trauma support, or even funeral expenses to bury a loved one who had been murdered.
    


            Copies of several grant termination letters shared with CNN say the DOJ has “changed its priorities,” and want these federal grants to be “more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and better coordinating law enforcement efforts at all levels of government.”
    


            But many grant recipients believe this action will do the opposite by pulling the rug out from programs that have been working in communities across the country.
    


            One program at risk of immediate shutdown is a group who sends advocates to the bedside of someone in the hospital who has been injured from gunshot or other type of assault. The advocates can help them navigate how to report the crime if they choose and can help the victims find services to assist in their recovery.
    


            Another DOJ grant that funded trauma recovery centers in Iowa was also cancelled, as were grants that put kennels in domestic violence shelters so that victims could bring their pets with them when they fled. The Justice Department restored at least some of the shelter pet programs Wednesday evening, a source told CNN.
    


            When news of the cuts first surfaced Tuesday, dozens of grantees gathered on a videoconference to discuss their options, including whether to take legal action.
    


            Many of the organizations found that they had already been cut off from the financial systems from which they could access their grant money, one official said. Others tried to contact their grant managers at the Justice Department.
    


            “I want to believe, and I want to hope it's a mistake, and that mistake will be rectified,” said Williams.
    


            The terminated grants also touch local government groups whose efforts are focused on research, statistics and efforts to reform things like policing and the juvenile justice system.
    


            “Instead of helping to keep our residents safe, the Trump Administration is once again cruelly clawing back critical public safety funding for our state,” wrote Democratic New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin in a statement.
    


            “Cutting critical initiatives to fight hate crimes, to prevent violence in our communities, and to combat opioid abuse is as reckless as it is dangerous,” Platkin continued.
    


            In Kansas City, Missouri, officials in city hall learned Wednesday a grant that funded counseling and treatment programs through their mental health court had been terminated.
    


            “It takes away a tool that we have to give people treatment and then break the cycle of recidivism that we see on nuisance offenses,” Democratic Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.
    


            Lucas argued that judges cannot jail people with mental health issues for an extended amount of time for nuisance crimes, and that without treatment, those offenders will be back on the street without help and resources.
    


            “I think it's going to lead to vastly inferior outcomes for people in Kansas City who want to be safe,” said Lucas.

Live Updates


            • Russia-Ukraine war: President Donald Trump reiterated his displeasure at deadly overnight Russian strikes on Kyiv, but said he still believes President Vladimir Putin is serious about a peace deal. Trump said Putin is offering to “stop taking the whole country” of Ukraine, which he called a “pretty big concession.”
    


            • Trade policy: Trump aired frustrations with China as the trade war he initiated continues between the world's two largest economies. The president said his administration had meetings with Chinese officials regarding trade this morning, while China has denied it is engaged in direct talks with the US.
    


            • Legal issues: A federal judge blocked parts of an executive order that sought to boost requirements that Americans show proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Meanwhile, another judge ruled a policy that would withhold federal funding from schools with DEI and other race-related programs is likely unconstitutional.
    


            President Donald Trump today pressured Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, saying new data on home sales were “really good numbers, and that's despite interest rates.” Trump did not specify which data he was referring to.
    


            However, existing-home sales, released this morning, showed that sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the market, dropped 5.9% in March from the prior month. The sales pace was the weakest March since 2009.
    


            Trump has demanded the Fed lower interest rates for the past week, including calling Powell a “major loser.”
    


            “We should lower interest rates, that's the Fed, I hope they lower interest rates. That's the smart thing to do,” Trump said today.
    


            Trump's public attacks on the Fed last week — including saying Powell's “termination cannot come fast enough” — raised fears on Wall Street that he'll try to dismantle the central bank's independence, sending markets tumbling.
    


            However, Trump recently toned down his criticism of the Fed, saying Tuesday he has “no intentions” of firing Powell. That was after top administration officials grew skittish over a prolonged legal battle should Trump attempt to unseat the Fed chair, CNN previously reported.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed optimism today about the prospects of a new US trade deal with South Korea.
    


            “We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today,” Bessent told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that the talks “may be moving faster than I thought.”
    


                    Bessent continued: “We will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. So South Koreans came early, they came with their A-game, and we will see if they follow through.”
                





Some context: The Trump administration has expressed interest in negotiating regional trade deals with some of China's neighbors — including South Korea and Japan — to apply pressure on Beijing.
    


            President Donald Trump indicated that many world leaders want to meet when he travels to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis.
    


            “They all want to meet, and they want to meet about trade, and we are making some great inroads and great deals,” Trump said.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that Russia has offered a significant concession in peace talks with Ukraine by not “taking the whole country.”
    


            Responding to a reporter question about what Russia was offering in peace talks, Trump responded: “Stopping the war.”
    


                    “Stop taking the whole country, pretty big concession,” Trump added during an Oval Office meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
                





            Russian President Vladimir Putin was widely denounced by other countries for invading Ukraine in February 2022, and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has sharply pushed back on even formally recognizing Russian control over the region of Crimea.
    


            Earlier in the week, Trump suggested Zelensky was holding up negotiations, saying the embattled leader has “no cards.” And after voicing displeasure at the deadly overnight Russian strikes on Kyiv, Trump said today he still believes Putin is serious about a peace deal.
    


            Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy sharply disagreed with that characterization, saying in a post on X that: “Putin doesn't want peace. He's stalled every negotiation and keeps bombing civilians.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Thursday he “wasn't happy” with President Vladimir Putin after Russia launched its deadliest strike on Kyiv in months, elaborating on comments earlier in the day urging Putin to halt his bombardment.
    


                    “I didn't like last night — I wasn't happy with it, and we're in the midst of talking peace, and missiles were fired,” Trump said in the Oval Office in response to a question from CNN about what he meant after posting “Vladimir, STOP!” in a post on Truth Social.
                





            The president declined to say if he is considering additional sanctions on Russia if the attacks don't stop, telling reporters, “I'd rather answer that question in a week.”
    


            “I want to see if we can have a deal. No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy,” he added. “Let me put it that way — things, things will happen.”
    


            Pressed on if Ukraine may have to cede some territory to Russia to secure a ceasefire, Trump stayed vague, saying, “It depends what territory.”
    


                    “We'll do the best we can, but they lost a lot of territory,” the president said, noting Russia seized control of Crimea under former President Barack Obama. “They say, ‘Well, can you get it back?' I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do.”
                





More context: As it tries to end the three-year war, the administration has proposed recognizing Russian control of Crimea, officials familiar with the details have told CNN.
    


            Such a move would reverse a decade of US policy and could upset the widely held post-World War II consensus that international borders should not be changed by force.
    


            Still, Trump insisted Thursday that the US is “putting a lot of pressure” on Putin to negotiate a deal.
    


            “We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know or [Putin] wouldn't be talking right now,” he said.
    


            A federal judge has blocked parts of an executive order signed President Donald Trump that sought to boost requirements that Americans show documents proving their citizenship when registering to vote.
    


            Senior District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly blocked a Trump directive in the order that the requirement be added to a federal voter registration form that is available for most Americans to use.
    


                    “Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States — not the President — with the authority to regulate federal elections. Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the President purports to order,” she wrote. “And no statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order.”
                





            The judge is also pausing a separate provision in the executive order that would require federal agencies that offer registration opportunities to assess a person's citizenship before providing a person a voter registration form.
    


            The challengers in the cases before her targeted other parts of the executive order, including its provisions aimed at punishing states that count mail ballots that arrive in a certain period after Election Day. The judge said that she was not blocking those provisions yet because arguments were procedurally premature or because they're more squarely in front of other courts.

            A federal judge significantly curtailed the Trump administration from implementing a policy that threatens to withhold federal funding from schools for engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs or if they incorporate race in certain ways in many other aspects of student life.
    


            US District Judge Landya McCafferty said in a scathing opinion that the administration's policy, laid out by the Department of Education in a letter to educators earlier this year, was “textbook viewpoint discrimination,” likely violating the First Amendment's free speech protections.
    


            She also concluded that the National Education Association, the administration's opponent in the case, was likely to succeed in its arguments that the policy was unconstitutionally vague and that the agency ran afoul of procedural steps required by law in how it implemented the policy.
    


                    “The ban on DEI embodied in the 2025 Letter leaves teachers with a Hobson's Choice,” the judge, a Barack Obama appointee who sits in New Hampshire, wrote, noting that the educators must choose between teaching curricula that invites penalty from the federal government or risking their professional credentials by aiding by the Trump policy.
                





                    “The Constitution requires more,” she wrote.
                





            McCafferty declined to issue a nationwide order blocking the policy, but is halting the administration from enforcing it against any school that employs members of the National Education Association and receives federal funding.
    


            At least two other courts are considering challenges to the policy, including a DC judge who is hearing arguments in the lawsuit before her today.
    


            The Defense Department will resume giving US service members gender-affirming care, including surgical procedures and cross-sex hormone therapy, according to a memo obtained by CNN.
    


            The memo comes roughly a month after a federal judge indefinitely blocked President Donald Trump from banning transgender service members. The Defense Department referred questions about the memo today to the Department of Justice. The memo was first reported by Politico.
    


                    “Within the direct care component, comprised of the military medical treatment facilities (MTF)s, service members and all other covered beneficiaries 19 years of age or older may receive appropriate care for their diagnosis of (gender dysphoria), including mental health care and counseling and newly initiated or ongoing cross-sex hormone therapy,” the memo states. “Service members may also receive voice therapy and appropriate surgical procedures,” it adds.
                





            The memo was signed Monday by Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.
    


            Ferrara's memo also says troops can begin receiving care through the Supplemental Health Care Program, which provides insurance coverage for troops to visit civilian doctors. All waivers through the SHCP that had been “paused and subsequently cancelled are hereby reinstated,” Ferrara said.
    


More background: The legal challenge to Trump's trans military ban was brought by a group of transgender active-duty service members and people who were hoping to enlist but would have been barred from entering service.
    


            Trump's ban was outlined in an executive order in January. The Pentagon planned to kick out currently serving troops with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria.
    


            A lawyer for New York Attorney General Letitia James called allegations she engaged in mortgage fraud “threadbare” and urged the Justice Department to close a referral seeking a criminal investigation.
    


            James's office retained Abbe Lowell, a powerhouse lawyer who previously represented Hunter Biden, in recent days after the director of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, William Pulte, sent a letter to the Justice Department referring James for criminal prosecution
    


            Pulte alleged James may have engaged in mortgage fraud by making false or misleading statements on property records, including a loan application document indicating a property in Virginia is James' primary residence, a building record stating her multifamily Brooklyn property incorrectly has five residences, not four, and a mortgage application that falsely stated James was her father's spouse.
    


            In the letter sent Thursday to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Lowell acknowledged there were “insignificant” mistakes on lines in some records, but he said the FHFA director “cherry-picked” those while ignoring multiple accurate documents that were part of the same record.
    


                    “Look at the entire file of each event, the haste in which one document has one line filled out in error, and the clear fact that, with the exception of attending school, Attorney General James has only lived in Brooklyn, and the ‘criminal referral' becomes three pages of stale, threadbare allegations with no reason to proceed other than they are ‘[b]ased on media reports' and are the next salvo in President Trump's revenge tour against Attorney General James,” Lowell wrote.
                





            Lowell attached several pages of exhibits to his letter to counter the allegations. He asked Bondi to close the criminal referral.
    


Some context: James and Trump have a long history of tension.
    


            In the middle of Trump's first term, her office launched an investigation into the Trump Organization's finances, which help lead to a criminal tax fraud conviction of the Trump Organization. She filed civil fraud charges against Trump, his adult sons and his real estate business claiming they inflated the value of some of his most prized assets.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that his administration had meetings with Chinese officials regarding trade earlier in the morning, countering earlier statements from China representatives that they have not been meeting with the US.
    


            “They had meetings this morning, and we've been meeting with China,” Trump said at a bilateral lunch with the Prime Minister of Norway.
    


            Trump said they may reveal who was in the meeting later, but did not specify with whom they met with from China. Chinese officials have denied they are engaged in direct talks with the United States, calling suggestions otherwise “fake news.”
    


            “To my knowledge, China and the United States have not engaged in any consultations or negotiations on the tariff issue, let alone reached any agreement,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said earlier Thursday.
    


            Trump said yesterday that his administration was talking to China “every day” as a trade war between the two countries drags on.
    


            President Donald Trump told reporters in the Cabinet Room Thursday that he still believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about  a peace deal — despite Russia launching overnight its deadliest wave of attacks on Kyiv in nine months.
    


            “We are thinking very strongly that they both want peace, but they have to get to the table — we're waiting a long time, they have to get them to the table, and I think we're going to get peace,” Trump told reporters in response to a CNN question during a lunch meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
    


            The US has been engaged in negotiating a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks, and Trump has made clear he is growing frustrated by the lack of progress.
    


            In a post to his Truth Social platform earlier Thursday, Trump urged Putin to stop his bombardment on Ukraine, writing: “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!”
    


            At least 12 people died in the strikes and 90 were injured, according to Ukraine's emergency services. Casualties may grow, as it's suspected that some people may be trapped under rubble.
    


            Trump acknowledged “a lot of hatred” between Ukraine and Russia, but insisted: “I think they both want to make peace, I do believe so.”
    


            The president wouldn't say if he was mulling new sanctions on Russia if the country did not cease its attacks.
    


            There was no evidence Putin was prepared to seriously engage in peace talks that do not favor his maximalist aims in the country, three sources familiar with US and western intelligence told CNN earlier this year.
    


            President Donald Trump is meeting today with Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was inadvertently added last month to a Signal group chat that involved classified information and several top Trump officials.
    


            Trump said he is partaking in the interview “out of curiosity” and “as a competition with myself” to judge if The Atlantic can truthfully write a story about him. He claimed the publication writes “fictional stories.”
    


            “Are they capable of writing a fair story on “TRUMP”? The way I look at it, what can be so bad – I WON!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            Even before he reported on so-called “Signal-gate,” Trump had raged against Jeffrey Goldberg, who wrote a story in 2020 about him calling Americans who died in war “suckers” and “losers.” Trump today again called the report a “made-up HOAX.”
    


            The Trump administration has denied the Signal chat, which detailed bomb strike targets in Yemen, included classified information.
    


            Trump said Goldberg will be accompanied by Atlantic colleagues Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker.
    


            Hours after President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine sat down with Ukrainians and Europeans in London to advance US efforts toward an end to the Ukraine war, US officials acknowledged that there remain substantial disagreements over the proposed US framework and timeframe to drive an end to the conflict.
    


            Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine who attended the meetings, told CNN that he believed this round of talks were “candid, positive, and productive.”
    


            But another senior US official said that there remain a wide range of disagreements with Ukraine after the meeting, including on the issue of sequencing and whether a ceasefire an agreement on the Trump administration's broad framework comes first.
    


            Still, US officials are not counting out the possibility of a ceasefire even though they are pressing for Russia and Ukraine to agree to the framework they have put on the table.
    


More on Ukraine talks: Publicly and privately US officials say that time is running out, though there is no explicit deadline that they have cited. Late last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the United States could end its efforts on ending the conflict within “days” if there are no signs of progress.
    


            European officials insist there was progress in London in getting the Ukrainians to consider conversations about giving up territory but fear that will fall short of Trump's expectations.
    


            “We managed to convince the Ukrainians to convince themselves to get in a more US administration-friendly position,” said a European official following Wednesday's discussions.
    


            But the Ukrainians want a ceasefire before getting into the painful discussions about concessions and Trump appears to be blowing past the idea of a ceasefire and insisting on final peace deal, the official said.
    


                    “I think they've [Ukraine] accepted that they're going to have had to move but there is clearly real difficultly domestically for the president in Ukraine to get anywhere close to where the US administration wants them to be on territorial issues,” the European added.
                





            President Donald Trump aired frustrations with China today as the trade war he initiated continues.
    


            Trump vented on Truth Social that China is sending Boeing jets back to the United States, after China stopped taking delivery of the aircraft due to tariffs.
    


                    “Boeing should default China for not taking the beautifully finished planes that China committed to purchase. This is just a small example of what China has done to the USA, for years,” Trump posted.
                





            Trump also reiterated one reason why he said he initially issued tariffs against China, accusing the country of having a role in fentanyl coming into the US. Yesterday, Trump said that his administration is engaged in “active” and direct talks with China on trade “every day.”
    


            However, CNN reported that two senior Chinese officials in Washington for meetings yesterday and today are not planning to meet with any Trump aides while here.
    


            The Trump administration today asked the Supreme Court to let it begin enforcing a ban on transgender service members, escalating a fight over a controversial policy that has faced numerous legal setbacks in recent weeks.
    


            The emergency appeal thrusts the high court into another politically charged dispute over a key aspect of Trump's agenda. It comes as the justices have increasingly been pressed by the administration to unlock various parts of his agenda that have been held up by lower courts reviewing the legality of the initiatives.
    


            The military ban was announced by Trump earlier this year and would have taken effect late last month. But several lower courts issued rulings against it before it could be implemented.
    


            In the case at hand, a federal judge in Washington state decided that the policy likely violated the constitutional rights of a number of active-duty transgender service members and an individual who wants to join the military.
    


            Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller warned today that the trade war President Donald Trump has ushered in could soon result in job losses.
    


            To counter the effects of that labor market weakness, he opened the door to a rate cut. The central bank last cut rates in December.
    


                    “It wouldn't surprise me that you might start seeing more layoffs, a tick up in the unemployment rate going forward if the big tariffs in particular come back on,” Waller said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “If I see a significant drop in the labor market, then the employment side of the mandate, I think, is important that we step in.”
                





            American jobs are at risk primarily due to the retaliatory tariffs other nations have placed on US goods. Export-reliant industries could be forced to lay off workers if foreign customers cut back on orders.
    


            Waller said those effects are unlikely to show up in economic data until July if the status quo on tariffs is maintained. The United States is currently charging a 145% tax on most goods coming from China, and China is charging most American goods a minimum 125% tax.
    


            Additionally, Trump has slapped a 25% tariff on imports of steel, aluminum and cars as well as a 10% tariff on just about every country's imports. These tariffs have prompted some retaliation as well on American goods.
    


            The Fed has said tariffs represent a challenge for policymakers: Trump's trade taxes carry an inflationary risk, but cutting rates could fuel even higher inflation.
    


            Top State Department official Michael Anton will lead the US technical team working to negotiate a new Iran nuclear deal, according to State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce.
    


            Anton, the State Department's head of policy planning, will head the team of roughly 12 working level experts from various agencies of the US government, a source familiar told CNN.
    


            Bruce would not go into details about how Anton was chosen for the role or who else is on the technical team.
    


            The technical talks are expected to be held Saturday in Oman. This team will discuss more granular details about a path toward a new nuclear agreement with Tehran, such as potential sanctions relief and limitations on Iran's nuclear program. This will be the first round of technical talks.
    


            Another round of political-level talks, led by US envoy Steve Witkoff, is also expected Saturday, CNN reported previously, but sources noted that the planning has been fluid.
    


            Politico first reported Anton's role leading the technical team.
    


Some background: The two countries have had decades of animosity and have long been in dispute about Iran's nuclear capabilities. US President Donald Trump has insisted on striking a new nuclear deal within a matter of weeks.
    


            The US and Iran had a second round of talks in Rome, Italy last week. The Trump administration expressed optimism following the talks, pointing to “very good progress” following the meeting. “Today, in Rome, over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” a senior administration official told CNN
    


CNN's Betsy Klein, Jennifer Hansler and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report, which was updated with State Department attribution. 



            The Trump Organization parted ways with top conservative attorney Bill Burck today after President Donald Trump complained that the lawyer was also working for Harvard in the university's fight against the administration.
    


            Eric Trump confirmed the organization would no longer use Burck, telling CNN in a statement Thursday: “I view it as a conflict and I will be moving in a different direction.”
    


            In a post calling Harvard “an Anti-Semitic, Far Left Institution,” Trump said Burck should be forced to resign or be fired. Burck is a managing partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. He was hired only months ago to represent the Trump Organization as an outside adviser.
    


            “He's not that good, anyway, and I hope that my very big and beautiful company, now run by my sons, gets rid of him ASAP!” the president wrote.
    


            Burck is a longtime conservative attorney in Washington who represented multiple people in Trump's circle during former special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the president's 2016 campaign. Burck did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


More on Harvard crackdown: Harvard's brawl with the Trump administration over academic autonomy and government control exploded on the national scene in recent weeks, with the White House accusing the school of tolerating antisemitic behavior and academic leaders saying in a lawsuit filed earlier this week that the government is trying to pressure the school to submit to its demands.
    


            A court hearing is set for next Monday on Harvard's lawsuit alleging the Trump administration illegally froze more than $2 billion in federal funding.
    


Kara Scannell contributed to this report.



            The judge overseeing Harvard's lawsuit alleging the Trump administration illegally froze more than $2 billion in federal funding has set a court hearing for Monday.
    


            Lawyers for the nation's oldest university filed a lawsuit earlier this week and asked the judge last night to hold a status conference to move the case forward expeditiously.
    


            Judge Allison Burroughs, an Obama-nominated judge, asked the lawyers to appear in person, if possible, on Monday.
    


            It will be the first courtroom showdown between Harvard and administration attorneys.
    


            President Donald Trump signed a slew of executive orders yesterday mostly aimed at restructuring and reconfiguring the Education Department the week after his administration announced a sweeping $2.2 billion funding freeze on Harvard University, setting up a major clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight.
    


Here's details on the education-focused orders:

            President Donald Trump voiced displeasure today at overnight Russian strikes on Kyiv, instructing his Russian counterpart to halt the assault.
    


                    “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin by name. “Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!”
                





            The comments came a day after Trump accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war by not agreeing to a US peace proposal that would in essence cede control of all Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine to Moscow.
    


            Trump said Zelensky, who he has repeatedly disparaged, was more difficult to manage than Putin.
    


            “I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky and I hope that Zelensky – I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy — so far it's been harder,” Trump said in the Oval Office.
    


            Hours later, Russia began its deadliest assault on Ukraine's capital in nine months, killing at least eight people, according to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office. Zelensky said he believed the bombardment was to “pressure” the White House over the American proposed ceasefire deal.
    


            “Today's attack is one of the most complex, most daring attacks coming from Russia,” Zelensky said during a trip to South Africa.
    


                    “Russia understands that Ukraine is standing and protecting its right, and (Russia) is pressuring our people. It is also pressuring the US, which I also think is related to this attack. Rather first and foremost,” he told reporters.
                





            Harvard University has asked a federal judge to fast-track its challenge to the Trump administration's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, arguing it threatens critical research and academic endeavors.
    


                    “Until set aside by this Court, the Freeze Order, as well as the looming threat of additional cuts, chills Harvard's exercise of its First Amendment rights and puts vital medical, scientific, technological, and other research at risk,” the university wrote in its filing requesting a status conference in service of an expedited judgment.
                





            The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Harvard's complaint.
    


            Harvard's motion came two days after it sued the Trump administration, accusing it of orchestrating an “unconstitutional” campaign to pressure the university into complying with at least sweeping federal demands, including audits of academic programs and appointment of administrators tasked with enacting White House directives.
    


            President Donald Trump, who has been trying to “reclaim” American colleges and universities, has framed the conflict with Harvard as a fight against antisemitism. The university says the White House is trying to control it.
    


            Russia launched a wave of deadly attacks against Kyiv early Thursday, hours after US President Donald Trump accused his Ukrainian counterpart of harming peace talks in a fresh tirade against Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


            Russia launched 70 missiles and 145 drones toward Ukraine, mainly targeting the capital, Ukraine's Air Force said.
    


            At least eight people were killed and more than 70 wounded in the attacks, which emergency services said struck 13 locations in Kyiv, including residential buildings and civilian infrastructure.
    


            Following the attacks, Zelensky announced he was cutting short his visit to South Africa, where he landed late on Wednesday, to return to Ukraine.
    


                    “It is extremely important that everyone around the world sees and understands what is really happening” he said, adding that Ukraine would immediately contact its international partners regarding its requests to strengthen air defenses.
                





            European stock markets were trading lower Thursday after US President Donald Trump said he could re-impose “reciprocal” tariffs on some countries as soon as in two or three weeks' time.
    


            Germany's DAX index and France's CAC index were 0.4% and 0.7% down in early trading, respectively, while London's FTSE 100 was trading flat.US futures were also pointing lower.
    


            The Dow was set to open 0.5% down, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures indexes were on track for 0.6% and 0.4% falls, respectively.
    


Some context: Earlier this week, Trump had signaled a potential U-turn on his trade war with China as well as on his intention to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. But, on Wednesday, the president said he would consider re-imposing sooner the “reciprocal” tariffs he had paused for 90 days earlier this month on some of America's trading partners.
    


            Iran's top diplomat briefed his Chinese counterpart on the status of indirect talks with US officials over his country's nuclear program during a visit to Beijing, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry.



            Ahead of a third round of indirect negotiations scheduled for the weekend, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi thanked Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for Beijing's “constructive and effective policy on Iran's nuclear issue and sanctions removal,” the Iranian ministry said on Wednesday.
    


            Wang said Iran had a right to “the peaceful use of nuclear energy,” and expressed China's appreciation for Iran's commitment to not developing nuclear weapons, according to Chinese state media.
    


                    China is “committed to a political and diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue and opposes the abuse of force and illegal unilateral sanctions,” Wang said.

Ashley Dayer's dream of winning a National Science Foundation grant to pursue discoveries in bird conservation started when she was an early-career professor with an infant in her arms and a shoestring laboratory budget.

Competition is intense for NSF grants, a key source of funding for science research at U.S. universities. It took three failed applications and years of preliminary research before the agency awarded her one. 

Then came a Monday email informing Dayer that President Donald Trump's administration was cutting off funding, apparently because the project investigating the role of bird feeders touched on themes of diversity, equity and inclusion.

“I was shocked and saddened,” said Dayer, a professor at Virginia Tech's department of fish and wildlife conservation. “We were just at the peak of being able to get our findings together and do all of our analysis. There's a lot of feelings of grief.”

Hundreds of other university researchers had their National Science Foundation funding abruptly canceled Friday to comply with Trump's directives to end support of research on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the study of misinformation. It's the latest front in Trump's anti-DEI campaign that has also gone after university administrations, medical research and the private sector. 

More than 380 grant projects have been cut so far, including work to combat internet censorship in China and Iran and a project consulting with Indigenous communities to understand environmental changes in Alaska's Arctic region. One computer scientist was studying how artificial intelligence tools could mitigate bias in medical information, and others were trying to help people detect AI-generated deepfakes. A number of terminated grants sought to broaden the diversity of people studying science, technology and engineering.




NSF, founded in 1950, has a $9 billion budget that can be a lifeline for resource-strapped professors and the younger researchers they recruit to their teams. It has shifted priorities over time but it is highly unusual to terminate so many midstream grants. 

Some scientists saw the cuts coming, after Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz last year flagged thousands of NSF-funded projects he says reflected a “woke DEI” or Marxist agenda, including some but not all of the projects cut Friday.

Still, Dayer said she was “incredibly surprised” that her bird project was axed. A collaboration with other institutions, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, it tapped into Project Feederwatch, a website and app for sharing bird observations. 

Dayer's team had collected data from more 20,000 Americans on their birdwatching habits, fielding insights on how outdoor feeders were affecting wildlife, but also people's mental well-being. 

The only mention of the word “diversity” in the grant abstract is about bird populations, not people. But the project explicitly sought to engage more disabled people and people of color. That fit with NSF's longtime requirement that funded projects must have a broad impact. 

“We thought, if anything, maybe we'd be told not to do that broader impacts work and to remove that from our project,” Dayer said. “We had no expectation that the entire grant would be unfunded.”

On the day the grants were terminated, Sethuraman Panchanathan, the NSF's director since 2020, said on the agency's website that it still supported “research on broadening participation” but those efforts “should not preference some groups at the expense of others, or directly/indirectly exclude individuals or groups.”

The NSF declined to share the total number of canceled grants, but Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, run by billionaire Elon Musk, posted on X that NSF had canceled “402 wasteful DEI grants” amounting to $233 million. It didn't say how much of that had already been spent. Grants typically last for several years.

Caren Cooper, a North Carolina State University professor of forestry and natural resources, said she expected her work would be targeted after it made Cruz's list. Her grant project also sought to include people of color and people with disabilities in participatory science projects, in collaboration with the Audubon Society and with the aim of engaging those who have historically been excluded from natural spaces and birdwatching groups.

One doctoral student had left her job and moved her family to North Carolina to work with Cooper on a stipend the grant helped to fund. 

“We've been trying to make contingency plans,” Cooper said. “Nonetheless, it's an illegal thing. It's violating the terms and conditions of the award. And it really harms our students.”

Along with eliminating DEI research, NSF said it will no longer “support research with the goal of combating ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' and ‘malinformation' that could be used to infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advances a preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.”

Several researchers said they weren't sure why their funding was terminated, other than that their abstracts included terms like “censorship” or “misinformation.”

“The lack of transparency around this process is deeply concerning,” said Eric Wustrow, an engineering professor at the University of Colorado Boulder whose grant aims to study and combat internet censorship in countries like China and Iran. “Did they just Ctrl+f for certain words, ignoring context?”

NSF said on its website that “there is not a list of words” to avoid, but that misinformation research is no longer aligned with NSF's priorities.

Wustrow said his research supports free speech and access to information around the world, and he plans to appeal the decision to terminate the funding. Meanwhile, he's looking at potentially working for free this summer without a grant to fund his salary.

Even for those who did intend to address misinformation, the cuts seemed to miss the point. 

Casey Fiesler, of the University of Colorado Boulder, had a project focused on dispelling AI misconceptions and improving AI literacy — also a priority of Trump's education department. Cornell University's Drew Margolin said his work set out to help people find ways to combat social media harassment, hate speech and misinformation without the help of content moderators or government regulators.

“The irony is it's like a free speech way of addressing speech,” Margolin said.

The NSF declined to say if more cuts are coming. The terminated funding mirrors earlier cuts to medical research funding from the National Institutes of Health.

A group of scientists and health groups sued the NIH earlier this month, arguing that those cuts were illegal and threatened medical cures.

The cuts at NSF so far are a tiny portion of all of the agency's grants, amounting to 387 projects, said Scott Delaney, a research scientist at Harvard University's school of public health who is helping to track the cuts to help researchers advocate for themselves. Some received termination letters even though their projects had already ended. 

“It is very chaotic, which is very consistent with what is happening at NIH,” Delaney said. “And it's really unclear if this is everything that's going to get terminated or if it's just the opening salvo.”

Dayer is still figuring out what to do about the loss of funding for the bird feeder project, which cuts off part of summer funding for four professors at three universities and their respective student teams. She's particularly worried about what it means for the next generation of American scientists, including those still deciding their career path.

“It's just this outright attack on science right now,” Dayer said. “It's going to have lasting impacts for American people and for science and knowledge in our country. I'm also just afraid that people aren't going to go into the field of science.”

Major U.S. airlines are reducing their flight schedules and revising or withdrawing their profit outlooks for the year due to less domestic travel demand as sentiment about the national and global economies sours.

American Airlines pulled its financial guidance for 2025 on Thursday, joining rivals Southwest and Delta in declaring the economic outlook too uncertain to provide full-year forecasts. All three airlines cited weakening sales among economy class leisure travelers. 

“We came off a strong fourth quarter, saw decent business in January, and really domestic leisure travel fell off considerably as we went into the February time frame,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC.

Consumer reluctance to book vacations would correspond with a new poll that showed many people fear the U.S. is being steered into a recession and that President Donald Trump's broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.

There's also increasing concerns about international travelers. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said in a client note that anti-American sentiment could be spurring a travel dropoff, with data showing that international visitors to the U.S. are running about 5% lower than a year ago.

“In recent weeks there have been numerous news stories about tourists canceling trips to the U.S. in protest of the perceived heavy-handedness of recent trade policies,” he wrote. “This points to potentially another channel to consider in assessing the effects of tariffs on economic activity.”




Some economic indicators point to expectations of a slowdown. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes slowed in March, and U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in April, the fourth consecutive month of declines. However, fears of a downturn have not translated into layoffs. 

Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2 that triggered panic in financial markets and generated recession fears, leading consumers and businesses to start pulling back on spending, which includes travel. The president put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes but increased his already steep tariffs against China.

Beijing increased its import tax on American goods to 125% in retaliation. On Thursday China denied Trump's assertion that the two sides were involved in active negotiations to end or mitigate their trade war. 

American Airlines said it would give an update on its full-year guidance “as the economic outlook becomes clearer.” Airline executives said sales among business travelers and for premium seats on long-haul international flights remained solid.

Southwest Airlines reported late Wednesday that it would trim its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. The company also said it could not reaffirm its 2025 and 2026 outlooks for earnings before interest and taxes, given “current macroeconomic uncertainty.” 

United Airlines last week gave two different financial forecasts for how it may perform this year, one if there's a recession and one if not. The airline said it planned to reduce its scheduled domestic flights by 4% starting in July in response to lower-than-expected demand for economy fare tickets.

“We think there is a reasonable chance things can weaken from here,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. 

Delta Air Lines, the nation's most profitable carrier, predicted as recently as January that the company was on track for the best financial year in its history. Earlier this month, the airline scratched its performance expectations for 2025 and said it was putting a planned flight schedule expansion on hold. 

“With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said at the time. “In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control. This includes reducing planned capacity growth in the second half of the year.”

The parent companies of Frontier Airlines and Alaska Airlines also pulled their 2025 guidance.

NEW YORK (AP) — Female bonobos find strength in numbers, teaming up to fend off males in the wild, a new study finds. 

Along with chimpanzees, bonobos are among humans' closest relatives. Scientists have long wondered why bonobos live in generally female-dominated societies since the males are physically bigger and stronger.

Three decades of observations in Congo — the only place the endangered bonobos are found in the wild — lend support to the idea of a sisterhood where female bonobos band together to assert their power. 

These girl groups chased male bonobos out of trees, securing food for themselves, and females that grouped more ranked higher in their community's social ladder, researchers found. 

“It's very clear that you don't want to overstep as a male bonobo,” said study author Martin Surbeck from Harvard University.

Findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Biology.

Female bonobos' combined numbers seem to turn the tide against a male's physical strength, Surbeck said. It's one of the rare times such a strategy has allowed females to come out on top in the animal kingdom. Spotted hyenas similarly find power in groups.

Female bonobos linked up even when they didn't have close ties, supporting one another against the males and cementing their social standing. The observations show how female bonobos work together to protect themselves from male violence, said biological anthropologist Laura Lewis with the University of California, Berkeley. 




The findings support “the idea that humans and our ancestors have likely used coalitions to build and maintain power for millions of years,” Lewis, who was not involved with the research, said in an email.

South Carolina Superintendent of Education Ellen Weaver joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's plans to return education to the states.

A federal judge in New Hampshire on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from cutting funding to public schools that maintain diversity programs, a setback to its broader crackdown on DEI.

U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty said the effort by Trump's Education Department to block federal funding to public schools that continue to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs likely violates the First Amendment, presenting what she described as ""textbook viewpoint discrimination.""

At issue is a memo sent by the Education Department this month to public schools nationwide, threatening to withhold Title I federal funds from public schools that continue to ""unfairly"" promote DEI views or programs.

The effort sparked an immediate wave of concern, and lawsuits, across the country from education groups that cited the importance of Title I funds as a critical source of funding for many low-income public schools.

The DEI-slashing effort was met with a wave of court challenges, including a lawsuit filed by the National Education Association, the group's New Hampshire affiliate chapter, and the Center for Black Educator Development, who challenged the case in New Hampshire's federal court.

Two other U.S. courts are slated to hear similar challenges to the Education Department's effort, with one case in Washington, D.C., expected to be heard as early as this week.

McCafferty's ruling stopped short of issuing a nationwide injunction to block the policy in all 50 states. 

Rather, it blocks the Trump administration from halting the disbursement of Title I funds to any schools that employ or contract with plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 

""The right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is ... one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes,"" McCafferty said in her 82-page opinion, adding that the actions taken by the Education Department ""threate[n] to erode these foundational principles.""

She also said the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a sufficient definition of the DEI programs that were at risk as a result of the anti-DEI push.

The order comes after the Trump administration and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit reached a short-term agreement to delay the policy from taking force.

That agreement was slated to expire Thursday, prompting the court to rule on the matter.

President Donald Trump will sign a memorandum on Thursday cracking down on “straw donors” and foreign contributions, in a move widely seen as targeting Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue.

The memorandum, per a fact sheet obtained by the Washington Examiner, follows reports and congressional investigations over what Republicans say are unlawful fundraising activities conducted by ActBlue and other online campaign finance platforms.

ActBlue has faced accusations in Washington, D.C., and across the country of a wide range of wrongdoing, ranging from foreign money laundering to contributions from terrorist groups.

Trump's memorandum “directs” Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate and “take appropriate action” concerning allegations that online fundraising platforms such as ActBlue are used to funnel illegal “straw” or “dummy” contributions to left-leaning U.S. political candidates and committees.

The memo says that congressional investigations have revealed “significant fraud schemes” via ActBlue, and that hundreds of donations made on the platform over a 30-day period ahead of the 2024 election came from foreign internet protocol addresses using prepaid cards, which could violate U.S. law.

Bondi will report the results of the investigation to Trump through presidential counsel.

ActBlue is a not-for-profit payment processor used by Democratic political campaigns at all levels of government and left-of-center activist groups to handle online contributions. The platform plays a vital role in the liberal financial ecosystem, having processed well over $16 billion in donations since its founding in 2004.

The liberal payment processing juggernaut, however, has been thrown into disarray this year. The New York Times reported on March 5 that at least seven senior staffers resigned in late February, including its top legal officer. The reason for the exodus is not yet known.

Conservatives initially complained that ActBlue accepted donations without input credit verification value, the three numbers on the back of credit cards, which they claimed increased the risk of fraudulent contributions.

ActBlue patched that up but still allowed contributions from PayPal, Google Pay, or Venmo accounts and prepaid gift cards, as well as other forms of untraceable funds, its critics say.

“President Trump is taking action to address malign actors and foreign nationals who seek to illegally influence American elections, undermining the integrity of our electoral process,” the fact sheet reads.

The White House alleges that “bad actors” have evaded source and donation amount limits by breaking large donations into smaller ones attributed to numerous individuals, sometimes without their consent or knowledge. 

“ActBlue has become notorious for its lax standards that enable unverified and fraudulent donations,” the fact sheet says, citing 237 donations made from foreign IP addresses using prepaid cards during a 30-day period last year.

Chaos and fraud: A look at the allegations facing ActBlue

Several state-level attorneys general have also opened investigations into ActBlue over suspicious donations, aiming to enhance what conservatives describe as election integrity.

Ever since I was in grade school, I loved visiting the National Museum of American History in Washington, one of the many Smithsonian museums scattered across the city.

Since I was a homeschooled student who grew up within easy driving distance of Washington, visiting museums was a regular part of my education, to the point where I had the layout of most of the major Smithsonian museums just about memorized. I could spend hours, days even, wandering each one, but the war and transportation exhibits at the American History Museum have always been my favorite sites to visit.

Now one of the most prominent buildings on the National Mall, the museum opened in 1964 after President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation in 1955 authorizing its construction. Aside from a two-year closure in the 2000s for a major renovation, it has welcomed millions of visitors each year.

While the stream of visitors has remained steady over the years, the contents of the museum are constantly changing. In the years since I visited the museum as a wide-eyed youngster who was fascinated by the trains and cars from bygone eras and the heroic exploits of America's servicemen, a new emphasis has creeped in, one that has enslaved the museum to the cultural fads of the far Left rather than celebrating the history and culture of the United States.

I had not visited the museum in nearly a decade until a few weeks ago, shortly after President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which was a shot across the bow at the Smithsonian's standard operation.

“Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,” the order reads. “This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”

The order charges Vice President JD Vance, in his capacity as a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents and in consultation with various advisers in the administration, to “remove improper ideology from such properties, and shall recommend to the President any additional actions necessary to fully effectuate such policies.”

“We will restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness,” according to the order, “igniting the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of American history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of all Americans.”

While it is certainly possible that the insidious ideologies and historical revisionism that have poisoned much of modern education were present in the museum when I was young, during my recent self-guided tour, I was stunned by the degree to which the place had been so thoroughly handed over to the political Left's accounting of history.

The first clue that much had changed was, of all places, in an exhibit about the food people consumed throughout the last 250 years.

Emblazoned at the entrance of the exhibit is a graphic that invites visitors in to view the display and features a series of bubbles with quotes such as, “Bagged lettuce — the best thing since sliced bread?” or, “My grandmother cooked three meals a day. Most of mine come from the freezer.” But there were two messages, one that reads, “Can we stop calling it ethnic food already?” and another, “I like to share abuelita's recetas with friends,” that caught my eye.

On its face, these are harmless. But these two quotes, next to an array of messages that had more to do with what or how we eat, were out of place. Both challenged the notion that the American diet is something born out of our unique cultural development that unified peoples from Britain, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Mexico, and the Far East, to name a few.

Within the exhibit, the messaging was far less subtle and parroted the Left's approach, not only to race and culture, but also diet and health. For example, one panel of text that focused on dieting seemed to downplay the notion that physical activity is necessary for health, with the quote, “As attitudes about food, nutrition, and the body continue to change, many eaters have embraced the idea that good health also requires attending to mental and physical fitness.” Next to it was a graphic on the body mass index, which contained one of the most astounding quotes in the entire museum, directly challenging the relation between weight and health: “Many people question the validity of BMI as a measure of overall health because it does not consider different body types and lifestyles.”

Its health revisionism aside, the food exhibit, much like the rest of the museum, has become a shrine to the immigrants and the cultures of each nation that populated the U.S. in the latter half of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century and a mea culpa for slavery. But even there, subtle omissions advance a narrative.

A display about “The Migrants' Table” features information about Asian and Latino food but entirely omits the Italian and Irish immigrant experience, two groups that today find themselves lumped together as “white.” In fact, in another exhibit about immigration at large, there is not one mention of the experience of immigrants from several European countries, including Italy, who populated large areas of the Northeast.

But the most egregious racial identitarianism was reserved for the exhibit about the “American Latino,” which decried colonialism and the Spanish conquest of Latin America, while making no mention of the barbaric actions, including human sacrifice, of the native populations. At the same time, the Monroe Doctrine, a principle that Europe should stay out of the Western Hemisphere and informed much of U.S. engagement with Latin America, was trivialized as a policy that was “used to justify future U.S. military invasions.”

The whole exhibit reads like a call for a revolution against oppressors. At a time when Hispanics in the U.S. are increasingly shifting toward conservatives, the museum is selling a narrative that is a deliberate attempt to tie the Latin American experience to revolutionary action and the same principles that animate the Black Lives Matter movement. There is even an explicit call for American Latinos to become a monolithic political force.

“The idea of Latina/o as an identity including everyone with Latin American and Caribbean roots remains hotly debated. Latina/o is an umbrella label that coexists with other identities. It offers the possibility of greater political power for diverse Latino groups acting as a collective.” That quote is accompanied by a group of young activists from Puerto Rico raising their fists in support of Black Lives Matter.

The racial and indeed anticonservative narrative can even be found in a small exhibit about currency. In it, a $20 bill with the face of President Andrew Jackson has a silhouette of Harriet Tubman superimposed on it with an accompanying caption that excoriates the first Trump administration for reversing the decision to replace Jackson with Tubman.

But implementing Trump's order to reform this ideologically captured institution is a complicated task. The Smithsonian Institution was established in 1846 by congressional statute and is governed by the Board of Regents, which appoints a secretary. The vice president and the chief justice of the Supreme Court are two ex-officio members of the board, and three senators and three representatives fill out the remaining positions held by government officials, four of which Democrats currently hold. Nine other seats are filled by private citizens who are nominated by the board itself and then appointed through an act of Congress that requires the president's signature. Of the nine private citizen members, six will see their terms expire at some point before the Trump administration ends in January 2029.

The current secretary is Lonnie Bunch, who has held the position since 2019. The year he took the job, he was quoted on record praising the New York Times's 1619 Project, which attempted to frame the founding of the U.S. around the arrival of the first slave ship in 1619, rather than with the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

PURGING DEI FROM THE SMITHSONIAN IS NO EASY TASK

“Everybody that thought about the 1619 Project, whether they liked it or disagreed with it, saw that the Smithsonian had fingerprints on it, and that, to me, was a great victory,” Bunch said at the time. He also espoused support for Black Lives Matter and said he wanted “the Smithsonian to make diversity and inclusion so central that it's no longer talked about.”

At the National Museum of American History, “diversity and inclusion” and the emphasis on race and class politics are not only talked about but shoehorned into every corner of the museum, even in places that strain credulity. Today, the museum is a caricature display of far-left identity politics. Changing that and reforming the Smithsonian Institution as a whole will be no easy task.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

One of the most notable things about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, a federal agency tasked with “improving the health, safety, and well-being of America”—is how confidently he distorts the basics of health, safety, and well-being.



In his short stint as health secretary, Kennedy has touted cod-liver oil as a valid measles treatment (it's not), said that Americans are being “poisoned” by seed oils (they're not), and claimed that “many” vaccines are not adequately safety-tested (they are). And he has readily cherry-picked and exaggerated findings to suit his own needs: “There's a scientist at Harvard now who is curing schizophrenia with a carnivore diet,” he said at a press conference in March (it's not a carnivore diet, and it's not a cure).



The secretary also seems to think he knows what causes autism, a topic that scientists have been looking into for decades without producing a simple, clear-cut result, M. Daniele Fallin, a genetic epidemiologist at Emory University, told me. Kennedy, however, is adamant that a series of new investigations by his department will reveal at least “some of the answers” by September. “And we will be able to eliminate those exposures,” he said at a recent Cabinet meeting.



Since its first days, the new Trump administration has clearly shown where it thinks scientific attention should not be focused: It has attempted to censor federal scientific data, cut billions in government spending on research, and compromised care for some of the world's most at-risk populations. Now, as the nation's leaders have begun to encourage inquiry into specific areas, they are signaling that they're willing not just to slash and burn research that challenges their political ideology but to replace it with shoddy studies designed to support their goals, under the guise of scientific legitimacy.



Just last week, in a press conference discussing a new CDC report that described a continued rise in the prevalence of autism, Kennedy pledged to “follow the science no matter what it says.” And in an email, Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me that the administration's intention is “to leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of America's epidemic of chronic diseases and conditions.” But those statements seem at odds with Kennedy's behavior.



Among scientists who study and treat autism, the consensus has long been that “there is no ‘one cause'” of autism, Neelkamal Soares, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician in Michigan, told me. Genetics are likely to play a role; researchers have also explored the possible contributions of factors such as parental age; labor and delivery conditions; and exposures to certain chemicals, medications, or infections during pregnancy. Experts also generally agree that much of the growing prevalence of autism can be attributed to increased awareness and diagnosis—an explanation that the CDC, an agency Kennedy oversees, cited in its report.



But at last week's press conference, Kennedy dismissed that explanation as “a canard of epidemic denial.” He instead claimed, without citing any data, that autism rates soared after “industry” contaminated Americans with a “toxin,” and called genetics a “dead end” for future research. “Somebody made a profit by putting that environmental toxin into our air, our water, our medicines, our food,” he said. And he appears to be trying to bolster that viewpoint with what will now count as official government research—“a series of new studies,” he said, “to identify precisely what the environmental toxins are that are causing it.”



Kennedy did promise to look at all possible environmental factors “agnostically.” But several experts told me they're worried that the secretary has at least one particular exposure in mind. For years, Kennedy has championed the debunked idea that childhood vaccinations cause autism. And in March, he reportedly tapped David Geier, a discredited health analyst who has long promoted the notion that vaccine ingredients cause autism, to lead an HHS study to once again search for a link between immunizations and the neurodevelopmental condition. Kennedy didn't invoke vaccines when describing this new research, and since his confirmation as HHS secretary, he has been more sanguine—albeit inconsistently—about the benefits of shots. But vaccines have, for years, stood out in his rhetoric as “a very clear preconceived hypothesis,” Megan Pesch, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at the University of Michigan, told me.



Kennedy, who has no scientific or medical training himself, also seems confused about what a scientifically rigorous investigation would entail—and how long it might take. During this month's Cabinet meeting, he said that by September, HHS would complete “a massive research and testing effort involving hundreds of scientists from around the world.” At last week's press conference, however, his comments suggested that HHS might rely heavily on AI and electronic-health-record data, which aren't gathered uniformly, can depend on self-reporting, and cover only populations that interact with the health-care system. And Jay Bhattacharya, the new, Trump-appointed director of the National Institutes of Health, recently gave a presentation detailing the administration's plans to source data for these investigations from hospitals, pharmacies, wearable devices, and other private sources with limited reach.



That approach, experts told me, can't provide enough evidence to definitively pinpoint autism's cause, much less guide policy to eliminate it. “The chances of getting garbage are so high,” Catherine Lord, a clinical psychologist at UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, told me. Desai said that Kennedy had promised “an exhaustive examination of the underlying causes of autism,” which “naturally would include use of data points such as electronic health records, among other data sets,” and noted that the secretary is focused on fulfilling President Donald Trump's directives “with the Gold Standard of Science.”



No matter which methodologies Kennedy chooses, his September deadline “is ridiculous,” Lord said. Even the job of assembling the expert task force to initiate such a project could go past September. And Bhattacharya has already suggested that getting results could take longer. (When asked about the practicality of this timeline, Desai replied, “Would the preference be vague timelines and no commitments to address a matter of utmost concern for millions of Americans?”) One way to rigorously gather more data on autism's causes would involve following a large, representative sample of the American population over time, tracking participants' exposures, taking into account their genetic and health history, and monitoring whether any of them develop autism. The process would take years—and still may not yield causes as clear-cut or easy to “eliminate” as Kennedy seems to expect. But an administration that already knows the answers it wants doesn't need years to find them.





Government-funded science has, to some extent, always been subject to the political priorities of leadership: The NIH, for instance, is run by a political appointee. Trump and his allies, however, have already demonstrated that they are willing not just to set priorities, but to engage in science theater, with even more broad-reaching interference in the field of trans health.



From the start, the new administration's views on transgender health care have been clear. Since January, Trump has issued executive orders denying the existence of gender and describing hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery for children as “maiming,” “sterilizing,” and “mutilation.” One order announced that the administration would not “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition' of a child from one sex to another” and instructed federal agencies to end such procedures at government-funded institutions, leading hospitals and clinics across the country to pause gender-affirming care for young people. Through the NIH, the administration has also slashed funding from more than 100 research grants involving trans people.



In place of this research, HHS is pursuing a pointed agenda to confirm the president's statements. Last month, Matthew Memoli, the acting director of the NIH at the time, sent top agency officials a memo with instructions to urgently “fund research” into “regret and detransition following social transition as well as chemical and surgical mutilation of children and adults.” (In his email, Desai described the memo's stipulations as “realigning taxpayer-funded research to align with the priorities of the American people.”) “This is very important to the President and the Secretary,” the memo read.



The outcomes of gender-affirming care do need further study across the age spectrum, experts told me. Scientists still don't have a full sense of the long-term outcomes of transition on mental and physical health, or how to best tailor interventions to patients. (Extended use of certain hormones, for instance, could raise people's risk of some cancers or cardiovascular complications.) More research is needed, in particular, on how best to support gender-diverse youth, a growing sector of the population. But the kinds of research that the Trump administration is pursuing won't help clarify or alleviate those concerns. And of all the scientific questions that could be asked about trans health, “regret and detransition aren't the major problems,” Arjee Restar, a social epidemiologist at Yale, told me: Studies have found that adults and adolescents are generally very satisfied with the outcomes of hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, and that rates of regret following surgeries are about just 1 percent.



NIH officials found the memo's directives appalling. “This is not how we do science, ever,” one of them, who requested anonymity out of concern for professional retribution, told me. “This is politicized research, exactly what we were always told we would never do.” In his memo, Memoli specified that studies into the outcomes of gender-affirming care should deploy “methods that don't themselves subsidize or incentivize such practices as previous NIH studies have done.” (Desai pointed to a case in which an NIH-funded researcher cited politics to help explain her hesitation to publish a study with unfavorable results about puberty blockers.) But previous NIH studies have never “subsidized or incentivized” gender-affirming care, the NIH official told me. Rather, they followed the recipients of that care over time, and observed the results.



In contrast, Memoli's memo unabashedly advertised the conclusion that the administration is pushing for: that gender-affirming care is harmful and regrettable. The directive also implicitly solicits researchers who “are following the administration's example,” Logan S. Casey, the director of policy research for the Movement Advancement Project, an equality-focused think tank, told me—and potentially, for participants who might share those viewpoints as well. That makes it all the more likely that those projects will produce the skewed results the administration wants to see.



This is consistent with everything Trump and his allies have revealed about their views on science since January: that it is not a means to better understand objective reality, but a political weapon that they must guard against, or deploy themselves. In recent months, Kennedy has accused the expert committee that counsels the CDC on its nationwide vaccine recommendations of being in the pocket of vaccine manufacturers; the administration has also fired from HHS several scientists who were prominent leaders in the COVID-19 response, including a few closely affiliated with Anthony Fauci, whom Trump has ridiculed as a “disaster” and an idiot and Desai derided as one of many “demonstrably fallible ‘experts.'” Last week, administration officials also redirected two federal websites, once used to share information on COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines, to a page promoting the idea that the coronavirus pandemic began as a lab leak, rather than Fauci's “preferred narrative that COVID-19 originated in nature.”



The causes of autism, the outcomes of gender-affirming care, and the origins of SARS-CoV-2 are all topics worthy of scientific investigation. But how questions are asked can influence the answers they yield—and directly affect the populations they're asked about. The language in the NIH memo is “alarming and inflammatory,” Camie Nitzel, a psychologist who specializes in transgender and gender-diverse people, told me: It shows that the administration is pursuing these studies not from a place of genuine inquiry, but from prejudice. Disdain is coded into the administration's methodology on autism, too: In his briefings on HHS's new pursuits, Kennedy has repeatedly described autism as a scourge worse than COVID-19 that “destroys” families and children, and insinuated that it should be purged from the population. But the implication of both the administration's statements and its proposed studies is that neither trans people nor autistic people should visibly exist in America. Science is now yet another tool that the government is using to disappear anyone it deems undesirable.

Immigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.

by  Eric Levitz

President Donald Trump has been sending undocumented immigrants to a mega prison in El Salvador without due process. Most of these deportees have no criminal record, yet our government has condemned them to indefinite incarceration in an infamously inhumane penitentiary. 

In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration admits that its deportation order was unlawful. In 2019, a court had ruled that Abrego Garcia could not be sent to El Salvador, as he had a credible fear of being persecuted in that country. The White House attributed his deportation to an “administrative error.” 

The Supreme Court has ordered Trump to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, but the White House refuses to comply and has publicly vowed that Abrego Garcia is “never coming back.”

Some Democrats believe that their party must call attention to this lawless cruelty. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and four progressive House members have traveled to El Salvador in recent days to check on Abrego Garcia's condition and advocate for his due process rights. 

But other Democrats fear their party is walking into a political trap. After all, voters are souring on Trump's handling of trade and the economy, but still approve of his handling of immigration. Some Democratic strategists therefore think that Van Hollen and other progressive advocates for Abrego Garcia are doing the president a favor: By focusing on the plight of an undocumented immigrant — instead of the struggles of countless Americans suffering from Trump's tariffs — they have increased the salience of his best issue and reinforced the narrative that Democrats care more about foreigners than about the American middle class.

Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. 

As one strategist told CNN, “The impulse among lots of Democrats is to always crank the volume up to 11 and take advantage of whatever the easiest, most obvious photo opportunity is. In this case, you get a situation where you're giving the White House and the Republicans a lot of images and visuals that they think are compelling for them.”

Some progressives have declared this argument morally bankrupt. But I don't think that's right. Democrats have a moral responsibility to defend both America's constitutional order and its most vulnerable residents. It does not follow, however, that they have a moral duty to hold press events about Abrego Garcia's case — even if such photo ops do nothing to abet his liberation, while doing much to boost Trump's political standing. 

In my view, the argument that Democrats are doing more harm than good by taking a high-profile stand in favor of due process is not immoral, but simply mistaken. Van Hollen's trip has plausibly benefited US residents unlawfully detained in El Salvador. And the political costs of such dissent are likely negligible, so long as Democrats keep their messaging about immigration disciplined and eventually shift their rhetorical focus to Trump's economic mismanagement. 

So far as I can tell, no Democrat is arguing that the party should acquiesce to Trump's lawless deportations. The concerned strategist who spoke with CNN stipulated that “Democrats should stand up for due process when asked about it.” 

Rather, the argument is that 1) the party should not go out of its way to elevate immigration as an issue, or invite the impression that the rights of undocumented immigrants are its chief concern, and 2) congressional delegations to El Salvador risk doing precisely that. 

The case for this position is fairly simple. Voters are much more supportive of Trump's handling of immigration than of his economic management. In data journalist G. Elliott Morris's aggregation of recent issue surveys, voters approve of Trump's handling of immigration by 2.7 points, while disapproving of his approach to inflation and the cost of living by 21.8 points. 

Therefore, anything Democrats do to increase the salience of immigration plausibly aids Trump. What's more, elevating Abrego Garcia's cause above other issues could give voters the impression that Democrats are not prioritizing their own economic concerns. 

Or at least, this is what Republican strategists seem to believe. Following House progressives' trip to El Salvador, National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement, “House Democrats have proven they care more about illegal immigrant gang bangers than American families.” The NRCC proceeded to air digital ads against 25 swing-district Democrats, in which it offered to buy the representatives' airfare to El Salvador if they promised to “livestream the whole thing and snap plenty of selfies with their MS-13 buddies.”

For those urging Democrats to embrace message discipline, focusing on the due process rights of the undocumented is a lose-lose proposition, accomplishing nothing of substance while damaging the party politically. In this view, Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador did not actually help Abrego Garcia, whose fate still lies with America's court system and the White House. To the contrary, Democrats are effectively giving Trump an incentive to ship more undocumented immigrants to a foreign prison without due process. After all, the president wants his opponents to take high-profile stances in defense of the undocumented. If Democrats teach him that they will do precisely that — so long as he violates immigrants' due process rights — then they will have made such violations more likely in the future, not less.

Meanwhile, this faction of wary strategists insist that their party has a genuine image problem. Yes, Trump's tariffs are deeply unpopular. And as their economic impacts surface, the president's trade policies are liable to become more salient, no matter what Democrats say or do. But thus far, the public's declining confidence in Trump is not translating into rising confidence in the Democratic Party. 

Historically, Democrats always outperformed Republicans on the question of which party “cares more for the needs of people like you,” outpolling the GOP by 13 points on that score as recently as 2017. Yet in a Quinnipiac poll taken after Trump single-handedly engineered an economic crisis with his “Liberation Day” tariffs, the two parties are tied on that question.

What's more, even as the public sours on Trump, the GOP remains more popular than the Democratic Party. In a new Pew Research survey, voters disapproved of Trump's job performance by a 59 to 40 percent margin. Yet the Republican Party's approval rating in that same survey was 5 points higher than the Democrats', with only 38 percent of voters expressing support for the latter. 

Democrats have time to improve their image; the midterms are well over a year away. So some might wonder why the party should fret about increasing the salience of an unfavorable issue so far from Election Day. But there's an argument that the party should be doing everything in its power to increase its popularity — and reduce Trump's — right now. Businesses, universities, and various other civic institutions will need to decide in the coming weeks and months whether to comply with the president's illiberal attempts to discipline their behavior. The weaker Trump appears to be, the less likely it will be that American civil society acquiesces to authoritarianism.

Thus, from this vantage, message discipline is a moral imperative. Centering Democratic messaging on Abrego Garcia's case might help ambitious Democrats earn small-dollar donations and adoration among the party's base. But it undermines effective opposition to Trump's authoritarian regime. 

This argument is reasonable. But in my view, it understates the potential benefits of vigorous advocacy against Trump's lawless deportations and overstates the political harms. 

On the substance, Democratic officials flying to El Salvador to check on Abrego Garcia's condition could plausibly deter abuses against him and other immigrant detainees in that country. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele may be a reactionary aligned with Trump, but he is surely aware that the United States has a two-party system. His government therefore must give some thought to its relationship with a hypothetical future Democratic administration. Thus, by advocating so forcefully for US residents unlawfully imprisoned in El Salvador, the Democratic Party has given Bukele some incentive to, at a minimum, keep Abrego Garcia and others like him alive (something that his government routinely fails to do with its prisoners).

Meanwhile, bringing a measure of comfort to an American unlawfully disappeared to a foreign prison is a clear moral good. In an interview with Vox's Today, Explained podcast, Van Hollen said that Salvadoran authorities have not allowed Abrego Garcia to communicate with his family or his lawyers. Rather, they had kept him isolated from the entire outside world, until a US senator demanded a meeting with him. Only through Van Hollen's intervention was Abrego Garcia's wife able to send her greetings to him, or even confirm that her husband was still alive. If an elected official has the power to serve a constituent in this way, it seems worthwhile that they do so.

The prospect that Van Hollen might have effectively encouraged more unlawful deportations by taking this course of action — since Trump wants his opponents to do photo ops on behalf of undocumented immigrants — merits consideration. But it strikes me as far-fetched. One could just as easily posit that Democrats ducking this issue entirely would have emboldened Trump to ramp up unlawful deportations. Ultimately, I think the president's ambitions on this front will be determined by the scope and persistence of the judiciary's opposition, not by Democratic messaging.

It seems possible — perhaps, even likely — that Democrats loudly advocating for Abrego Garcia is politically suboptimal, relative to a monomaniacal focus on the economy. But so long as Democrats act strategically on other fronts, I think the political costs of taking a stand on due process are likely to be negligibly small, for at least five reasons:

First, as far as progressive immigration positions go, “The Trump administration should honor court orders and the due process rights of longtime US residents” is pretty safe territory. In March, a Reuters-Ipsos poll asked Americans whether Trump “should keep deporting people despite a court order to stop?” — they said no by a margin of 56 to 40 percent. And an Economist-YouGov poll released Wednesday found voters specifically agreeing that Trump should bring Abrego Garcia back by a 50 to 28 point margin.

If Democrats frame Abrego Garcia's case as a question of Americans' civil liberties — while reiterating their party's commitment to enforcing immigration law and securing the border — they should be able to mitigate any political cost inherent to elevating this issue. And that has largely been Van Hollen's message. As the senator argued at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, “I keep saying I'm not vouching for Abrego Garcia. I'm vouching for his constitutional rights because all our rights are at stake.” 

Second, there does seem to be some scope for eroding Trump's advantage on immigration. On March 1, polls showed voters approving of the president's immigration policies by more than 10 points. Surveys taken in the last 10 days, by contrast, show that margin has fallen to 2.5 points. It is unclear whether Democrats' messaging on the Abrego Garcia case had any impact on this decline. But given the timing, that possibility cannot be summarily dismissed

Third, some influential right-wingers endorse the Democratic position on Abrego Garcia. Last Thursday, pro-Trump podcaster Joe Rogan detailed his misgivings about the president's violations of due process:

What if you are an enemy of, let's not say any current president. Let's pretend we got a new president, totally new guy in 2028, and this is a common practice now of just rounding up gang members with no due process and shipping them to El Salvador, “You're a gang member.” “No, I'm not.” “Prove it.” “What? I got to go to court.” “No. No due process.”

Defending a principle mutually endorsed by Joe Rogan and the Roberts Court does not seem like the riskiest stand that Democrats could take.

Fourth, I'm not sure that the media's coverage of this controversy looks all that different in the alternate dimension where Democrats voiced opposition to Trump's actions when asked, but otherwise spoke exclusively about his failed economic policies. The president exiling US residents to a foreign prison — and refusing to attempt to repatriate one of them, in defiance of the Supreme Court — is a huge news story. This is a much more shocking and unprecedented event than the House GOP's quest to cut Medicaid, even if the latter will ultimately inspire more voter backlash. 

In a world where Van Hollen and his House colleagues never go to El Salvador, the general subject of immigration might have received marginally less media attention over the past week. But I think the effect here is quite small. 

Fifth, Democratic officials are not speaking out on this entirely at their own direction. Their party's base is understandably alarmed by the president's lawlessness. Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost said he traveled to El Salvador because he had received “hundreds and hundreds” of emails and calls from his constituents demanding action on this issue. Thus, there might be some cost to Democratic fundraising and morale, were the party's officials to uniformly avoid calling attention to the controversy. 

All this said, I think it's true that the optimal political strategy for Democrats is to focus overwhelmingly on economic issues. Voters are more concerned with prices and economic growth than with due process. And Trump is most vulnerable on tariffs, Medicaid cuts, and his economic management more broadly.

I just don't think that dedicating some time and energy to championing bedrock constitutional principles — 19 months before the midterm elections — is by itself a perilous indulgence. In any event, to this point, it has proven entirely compatible with driving down Trump's approval rating, which has fallen by 7 points since February in Pew's polling. 

Going forward, Democrats do need to convey that their top concern is Americans' living standards. If Trump moves ahead with anything resembling his current trade policy, his approval is likely to fall, irrespective of Democratic messaging. But the party needs to make sure that voters see it as an effective alternative on economic issues — one that cares more about the needs of people like them.

Throughout the US today, a large and growing number of small business owners, workers, and retirees are suffering as a direct result of Trump's mindless economic policies. If congressional Republicans get their way, millions more will lose their health insurance as a result of Trump's fiscal agenda. Democrats must find ways to elevate these stories. Van Hollen's decision to go to El Salvador evinced some verve and creativity. His party must apply similar energy to the task of dramatizing Trump's economic misgovernance and communicating their party's vision for redressing it.

How a day off can (and can't) help children.

by  Anna North

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

It's a stressful time to be a kid.

Young people are watching environmental disasters, school shootings, and economic and political uncertainty, all with a level of media (or at least social media) coverage that would have been unimaginable for previous generations. Against this backdrop, they're also expected to have their lives figured out by an early age, and rack up a laundry list of achievements to cite in an increasingly lengthy and comparison-filled college application process. “You almost have to start working on your college career in middle school,” Jennifer Rothman, director of youth and young adult initiatives at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told me.

Given all this, it's perhaps no surprise that kids need a break. Mental health days — a day off to deal with depression or anxiety, or simply to tend to mental well-being, gained currency among adults during the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic — and they've taken off among young people as well, with at least 12 states passing laws allowing excused absences for mental health reasons. 

But as chronic absenteeism remains a problem around the country, some school officials are worried that giving kids mental health days could encourage an attitude that school attendance is optional. “There's a lot of misconceptions about how important it is to be in school — if I didn't come to school at all in the pandemic, why do I urgently have to keep coming to school now?” Kent Pekel, superintendent of Rochester Public Schools in Minnesota, said during a webinar last year, according to EdWeek.

While concerns about mental health are far from gone, they're also being joined by fears of learning loss and the acknowledgement that missing even a few days of school can be detrimental to kids' education. There's also a widespread worry that students are reaching college, the job market, and the ballot box without basic skills like reading.

Some experts also caution that taking a day off for the wrong reasons could actually make matters worse. “When you get yourself in the trap or downward slide of school avoidance, that's really hard, and it happens really quick,” Sarah Cain Spannagel, a clinical psychologist in Cleveland who works with children and families, told me.

How can kids, families, and educators navigate all this? How do we support kids through a time that's often scary even for adults, while also making sure they get an education? I posed these questions to experts this week, and the answers I got suggested that while a day off won't cure a kid's depression or anxiety (sadly, that doesn't work for grown-ups, either), time for reset and recovery can help protect kids from getting to a crisis point in the first place. A day off could even show families and schools what's missing from a kid's life, leading to less stress and pressure in the future. 

Doctors and teens alike have been especially concerned with young people's mental health in the last five years, with Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general under President Joe Biden, warning in 2021 of a mental health crisis among adolescents. More recent surveys have shown some improvement in the prevalence of teen sadness and depression, but clinicians are still seeing “alarming rates” of anxiety and depression, as well as suicidality and self-harm, Amber Childs, a psychiatry professor at Yale School of Medicine who works on youth mental health, told me.

Allowing mental health days can also help destigmatize mental illness, and encourage young people to be open about any struggles they're going through, rather than hiding them, kids and experts say. 

Among teens, mental health days have emerged as a popular coping strategy. Students began advocating for them even before Covid hit, and lawmakers in states from Oregon to Utah have agreed, giving kids a designated number of mental health days per year, or simply changing the definition of an excused absence to include psychological reasons.

While hard numbers on how many days kids are actually taking are hard to come by, the practice seems to be increasing, perhaps driven by a growing awareness that psychological well-being is as important as physical health, Spannagel said.

The concept of a mental health day might sound pretty foreign to previous generations. Growing up, “I never got any days off,” Rothman of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who has three teenagers, told me. “Your parents were kind of like, you either have to have a fever or you're throwing up, that's the only way you're staying home.”

But adults today need to understand “how different the world is now for our kids than it was for us,” Rothman said.

Because of social media, young people today don't have much downtime from social interaction, news, or, well, anything really, Childs told me. Being able to unplug “not only from our digitally enabled lives, but also from the routine things that happen in the social and academic space” can be positive, “whether or not something bad is happening.”

Allowing mental health days can also help destigmatize mental illness, and encourage young people to be open about any struggles they're going through, rather than hiding them, kids and experts say. 

However, the way we often think about mental health days might not be the most helpful for kids. Rather than using them when a child is already in crisis — “taking the release valve off of the pressure cooker,” as Childs put it — families and schools should use them as “a preventative tool” to keep that pressure from building up in the first place.

Ideally, parents can look ahead to a time when kids might have a lot of stressful events coming up, like big exams or performances, then schedule a day off ahead of time. They should also plan how to use the day well. “A mental health day doesn't equate to chilling on a couch for eight hours straight binging TikTok and television,” Childs said.

Instead, Rothman suggests getting outside, reading, drawing, or playing card games — “whatever is calming and helps them feel more like themselves.” For teenagers especially, a day off could be a time to just catch up on sleep, something they're often lacking due to early high school start times.

What kids feel the need to do on a mental health day can also give adults “clues about what might be crowded out during a typical school day or week,” and help build those activities back in on ordinary days so kids don't get as stressed out and depleted, Childs said. (If kids keep taking days off to sleep, it might be time for the school to consider a later start time.)

Taking a day off shouldn't be a way for kids to avoid something they're anxious about, like a class, a difficult friendship, or school in general, experts say. Childs suggests that parents look for patterns — if kids keep asking for a mental health day on a Monday, it's an opportunity to delve deeper into what's happening at school on Mondays that might be stressing them out.

If requests for a day off are very frequent, or if feelings around them are intense, it could be a sign that “you're getting avoidance of a problem that most likely is going to be there in two days” when the kid goes back to school, Spannagel said.

Meanwhile, if symptoms like stress or sadness are going on for more than two weeks, or parents see major changes to behavior like eating or sleeping, it could be time to reach out to a child's primary care doctor to have them evaluated for mental health conditions, Rothman said.

Kids with ADHD, autism, or learning differences might need the reset of a mental health day more than the average kid, to help them recover from sensory overload or fatigue, Spannagel said. At the same time, a kid frequently feeling too exhausted or overwhelmed to go to school could mean they need additional help with executive functioning or social skills, or that the accommodations they have at school aren't meeting their needs. 

When it comes to concerns about absenteeism and academics, families and teachers can have a conversation about making up any work a child misses on an occasional day out, Spannagel said. 

And while some fear that allowing mental health days could encourage kids to skip school, that concern is “giving me like, if we talk about sex with them, they're going to want to have more sex,” Childs said. “I think the question is more complex, which is: What about the current environment has lent itself to kids not feeling engaged in school?” 

A few mental health days aren't going to fix problems with the school environment, not least because giving a kid a day off in the middle of the school year just isn't possible for every family. Experts don't recommend leaving kids home alone if they're struggling mentally, and many parents don't have the job flexibility to take extra time off with their kids. But schools can help by building aspects of a mental health day into the school week, adding time to shift the focus “away from academics and performance into exploration of self,” Childs said.

Having resources in the classroom, like a quiet corner where kids can take a moment to themselves, can also help support kids' mental health day-to-day, Rothman said. (My older kid's teacher brought this calming dog stuffie to their classroom in the fall, and I honestly would like one for myself.) 

Talking about mental health in school is also crucial, whether that's part of a formal program or just a teacher “being open about the things that they're feeling,” Rothman said. “It fights the stigma around it.”

Seventy-four percent of teens say social media helps them feel more connected to their friends, but 48 percent also say the platforms harm people their age, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

The Trump administration is reportedly seeking to eliminate Head Start, the federal program that provides early education to more than half a million kids from low-income families. One graduate calls the program “one of the few times in my early life where I felt truly loved, seen and supported in a place of learning.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s remarks about children with autism who “will never pay taxes” recall the dark history of eugenics, writes Jessica Grose at the New York Times.

My older kid and I are reading the Aster series of graphic novels, about a little girl who moves to the countryside so her mom can pursue her career as a robot-bird scientist, leading to friendships with an 800-year-old woman, a sheep wearing a tie, and three chestnuts who are also knights, among other colorful characters.

Two weeks ago, I wrote about how tariffs could drive up the cost of items like strollers and car seats, making it harder to have a kid in America. Reader Diana Braley responded, “As a mom in 2025, I've realized raising kids doesn't have to be as expensive as society makes it seem.”

“Raising children has always required commitment, support, and resilience — not consumerism,” Braley wrote. “Big companies sell us the idea that spending more makes us better parents. But the truth is, our instincts and community matter more than any fancy product.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Federal workers are ready to trash those '5 bullets' emails after Musk said he's exiting DOGE","https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-workers-react-musk-retreat-doge-focus-on-tesla-2025-4","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 08:21:00 GMT","

Elon Musk has said he stepping away from DOGE and the West Wing, but there's one thing federal workers really want to know.

""Can we stop sending this weekly email now?"" an employee at the Internal Revenue Service asked.

Business Insider spoke to 17 federal workers after the Tesla CEO said on a Tuesday earnings call that he hopes to devote more time to the company because the ""major work of establishing"" DOGE is complete.

Several federal workers brought up the ""What did you do last week"" email required by Musk's DOGE office since February. Many said they're skeptical that Musk will forfeit his White House influence. Even if he does, some said Musk's legacy will live on in DOGE through cuts to the federal workforce and government budget. Others are simply hopeful they'll have one less weekly email to send.

As a special government employee, Musk is only legally allowed to work for the Trump administration for 130 days a year. Still, the federal workers BI spoke with said they expect him to continue making political headlines.

""My reaction is, 'I'll believe it when I see it,'"" a programmer at the IRS said, adding, ""I believe the richest man in the world has hacked his way into the most powerful government in the world, and there is nobody to stop him from keeping that access, even if he looks 'gone' on paper.""

A former employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that they aren't taking Musk's announcement seriously. An employee at the Office of Personnel Management added that Musk's vow to step back seems like ""PR spin.""

Other federal workers said that even if Musk does leave DOGE, his actions will have a lasting impact on the government and its staff.

""The effect he's had on the federal government can't be as neatly defined as quarterly earnings reports,"" the OPM employee said. Several workers expressed concern over reports that DOGE and Musk have access to sensitive information like internal government databases and Americans' Social Security details.

Some talked about the anxiety that DOGE's federal firing spree has caused in their own lives. A few said they are constantly worried about losing their livelihoods. Federal workers who voted for Donald Trump and support his money-saving goals have previously told BI they felt betrayed by Musk's abrupt mass firings of what DOGE called ""low performers.""

""There is a methodical way to downsize, and I'm all for right-sizing to meet current events,"" a Department of Agriculture employee said. ""The way Musk and his team have handled and are continuing to handle the situation is harmful to federal workers (who are real people with families), harmful to American institutions, and ultimately harmful to the American public.""

A Department of Defense employee hopes that Musk stepping back will give them ""a little relief"" about their job security.

And then there are the possible effects on their day-to-day work. Several federal workers told BI they hope Musk's departure signals the end of his ""five bullets"" email. It's unclear what Musk and his colleagues do with the information or if it has led directly to any employee firings.

""I have to look and research and see what I did — that's 10 minutes that's wasted,"" one Social Security Administration employee said, adding, ""I could be spending my time more efficiently doing other things."" Another IRS employee said they send nearly the same email every week.

Musk said on Tuesday's Tesla call that he will still spend a day or two a week on government matters, ""as long as it is useful"" to the president. When reporters asked Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday about Musk's departure, he said that Musk ""is an incredible guy"" and ""was a tremendous help both in the campaign and what he's done with DOGE."" Neither Musk nor Trump elaborated on Musk's future role in the administration.

The possible DOGE shake-up comes alongside plummeting first-quarter Tesla earnings. The electric-vehicle company's earnings per share and revenue were down 71% and 9% year over year, respectively. Musk said last month that his role in the White House was ""costing me a lot"" and he was running his businesses with ""great difficulty."" With news that he could be retreating from Trumpworld, Tesla's stock was trading up over 5% after hours and jumped again Wednesday.

One federal employee said they aren't surprised Musk is leaning back into his CEO role. They said working in the government is likely ""too much trouble for someone who is trained to see things as engineering problems.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A new AI app that helps you cheat in conversations is slick, a little creepy, and not quite ready for your next meeting","https://www.businessinsider.com/cluely-ai-cheat-job-interviews-columbia-chungin-roy-lee-2025-4","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 07:11:00 GMT","

An Ivy Leaguer just released an AI app that can feed live answers to users, so I decided to put it to the test to see if AI could answer job interview questions as well as I could.

Chungin ""Roy"" Lee — the Columbia University student who went viral for creating an AI tool to ""cheat"" on job interviews — was suspended in March for posting content from a disciplinary hearing, the university said.

His new app, Cluely, helps users by analyzing what's on their screen, listening to audio, and suggesting answers to questions, all without being detectable to others in the conversation. In a LinkedIn post, Lee said Cluely is a ""cheating tool for literally everything.""

Lee said on Monday that the San Francisco-based startup has raised $5.3 million, backed by Abstract Ventures and Susa Ventures.

Speaking to Business Insider on Wednesday, Lee said that about 70,000 users have signed up for Cluely since its launch on Sunday.

""It is pretty crazy. And this is just a lot more than we expected,"" he said.

Lee said the concept of ""cheating"" needs to be rethought in the AI era.

""Using AI is just inevitable and something that we should just all embrace,"" he said.

I put Cluely to the test, and I saw promise — but also huge privacy concerns.

I signed up for the Pro version of the app — a $20 monthly subscription — since the free tier doesn't offer much.  

The interface is slick and minimal, with just a thin bar at the top. With one keyboard shortcut, Cluely scanned my screen. I could also speak to it through my mic.

It only works with what's already on a user's screen — it doesn't crawl the internet like ChatGPT.

But it reads everything, so I kept my Signal group chats closed.

That's what makes it powerful — and also kind of terrifying.

Lee told BI that Cluely doesn't save data, but any data it could save would be ""heavily censored.""

""If there's something that you don't want to be seen, then you shouldn't use the tool, and it shouldn't be up while you're on sensitive information,"" Lee said.

I deleted the app right after writing this story.

Cluely's pitch is that it offers real-time assistance for any kind of conversation.

I let it scan my LinkedIn profile and kept it open while my editor put me through a mock interview with the same questions I answered to land this job.

First up: What is my media consumption like? Could I share what I like to read or watch? What keeps me interested and busy?

The app started ""thinking."" Five seconds later, it gave me a summary of the question, not an answer.

My editor tried again, more succinctly: ""What media outlets do you read?""

This time, Cluely came through:

""I enjoy staying up to date with a mix of international and local news — typically from outlets like the New York Times, BBC, and CNA. I love longform journalism from The Atlantic and Wired, especially on tech and social issues. I also listen to 'The Daily' and 'Planet Money' during my commute.""

Not bad, though I don't listen to podcasts on my way to work.

My editor asked me to talk about a difficult story I've worked on. Ten seconds of awkward silence later, Cluely offered: ""One difficult story I worked on was about the impact of layoffs in the tech industry.""

I never wrote that story.

The second hallucination came when the app said I had a ""working knowledge of Malay."" My editor congratulated me on my surprising — including to me — third language skill. It completely missed the elementary Korean listed on my LinkedIn.

When my editor asked if I had questions for her, Cluely suggested a few basics: What do you enjoy most about working here? What's the team culture like? What does success look like in this role?

Cluely's biggest flaw is speed. A five- to 10-second delay feels like forever in a live interview.

The answers were also too generic, occasionally wrong, and not tailored enough to me.

It did generate decent answers to common questions. When I read them aloud, my editor said the biggest clue that I had help was the delay, not the substance. She also said my real answers were better than Cluely's.

Lee told BI that Cluely is in ""a really raw state.""

""Our servers are super overloaded, so there's a lot of latency,"" he said.

But there have been ""significant performance updates"" since the app went out on Sunday, he added.

""We've upgraded all our servers, we've optimized the algorithms, and right now it should be about three times faster, which makes it much more usable in conversations.""

Lee said hallucinations will ""exist insofar as the base models that we use allow for them.""

""The day that the models get better is the day that our product will get better,"" he added.

There's definitely potential for Cluely — if it gets faster, smarter, and could pull info from beyond just a user's screen, it could become a game-changing AI assistant. If I were hiring, I might think twice about conducting remote interviews because of these sorts of apps.

But between the privacy risks, laggy performance, and random hallucinations, I'm keeping it off my computer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","There's an ultra-rare bullish signal on the verge of flashing in the stock market","https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-bullish-signal-rally-breadth-zweig-2025-4","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:55:00 GMT","

The stock market is about to flash an incredibly rare bullish signal: the Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator.

The signal looks at 10-day trading intervals in the stock market. If it does flash, it would suggest that stocks are about to enter a new bullish phase and that the tariff-induced decline from earlier this month represented ""the"" bottom for risk assets.

The indicator measures overall participation among individual securities in the stock market's rally. It was developed by investor and author of ""Winning on Wall Street, Martin Zweig.

Since 1945, the indicator has only flashed 18 times, with the most recent signal occurring in November 2023.

The indicator is calculated by taking a 10-day moving average of the number of advancing stocks divided by the number of advancing stocks plus the number of declining stocks. 

The calculation derives a percentage, and when it falls below 40% and then surges above 61.5% in 10 days or less, the indicator is triggered.

The indicator's countdown began on April 11, when the ratio jumped above 40%. According to data from StockCharts.com, it has since risen to 61.34% as of Thursday morning.

The 10th day of the countdown clock is Friday, so stocks need to muster a continued rally driven by broad participation to flash the bullish signal.

Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, has been closely following the indicator over the past week.

""Although the computation is a tad confusing, the bottom line is many stocks went from oversold to overbought in a short time frame,"" Detrick told BI. ""This is what you tend to see at the beginning of new bullish phases.""

The Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator has a perfect track record of predicting positive stock market gains in the six and twelve months after it flashes.

According to Detrick, of the 18 times the signal has flashed, the average forward 6- and 12-month returns for the S&P 500 are 15.3% and 24.0%, respectively.

Twenty One, Trumpcoin dinner, KKR empathy, carry on co-investments and quantitative analysis of hockey.

The basic situation is that US public equity markets will pay about $2 for $1 worth of Bitcoin. I don't know why this is, and I am not especially happy about it, but it's true. If you have one Bitcoin, you can sell it on a crypto exchange for about $93,000, or you can sell it on a US stock exchange for about $186,000. Therefore, you should sell Bitcoins on the stock exchange, so people do.

The most famous example is MicroStrategy Inc. (now just Strategy), which has built a perpetual motion machine out of buying $1 worth of Bitcoin, seeing its stock go up by $2, and selling more stock to buy more Bitcoin. Because this keeps working, people keep copying it, and I keep talking about them. Originally, this approach was taken by public companies (MicroStrategy and then some imitators): Those companies already had publicly traded stock, so they could pivot to buying Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) and watch their stocks go up.

A talk with Jameson Lopp, CTO of Casa, on what Bitcoin needs to actually succeed in the long term as money. 

In the beginning of April at the MIT Bitcoin Expo I was able to sit down with Jameson Lopp to discuss the current state of and future of Bitcoin. 

Jameson co-founded Casa, a multisig self-custody service, with Jeremy Welch in 2017 after a long stint as a software engineer at Bitgo, another multisig service based company. He has been involved in the Bitcoin space since 2012 as a software developer and independent researcher. 

Lopp is famously known for a swatting incident in 2017 during the blocksize wars, where someone attempted to have the police storm into his home under the mistaken belief that Jameson was holding hostages. After that incident he went completely off grid, changing his residence and living habits to ensure his name is not available anywhere in public record. 

We discussed, very briefly, address poisoning attacks. After that subject, we had a broad discussion about the current state of Bitcoin development and Bitcoin itself as a protocol and project, including what is needed for its success in the long term.

In a global first, UAE-based Islamic bank ruya launches Shari'ah-compliant cryptocurrency investment services, enabling customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and other virtual assets through its mobile app.

In a landmark development for Islamic finance and digital banking, ruya (رويا), the UAE's digital-first Islamic bank, has become the first Islamic bank globally to offer customers direct access to virtual asset investments, including Bitcoin, through its mobile app, according to an announcement.

The new service is made possible through a strategic partnership with Fuze, a licensed leader in virtual asset infrastructure. Together, ruya and Fuze aim to provide a secure and ethical entry point into the digital economy, with services that are fully Shari'ah-compliant and aligned with the principles of Islamic finance.

“At ruya, we are committed to transforming the financial landscape in the UAE by offering forward-thinking services while staying true to our mission of ethical Islamic banking,” said Christoph Koster, CEO of ruya. “By integrating virtual assets into our investment platform, we aim to empower our customers to participate in the digital economy sustainably and responsibly. We can also assure our customers that the virtual assets we are offering on our ruya investment platform are Shari'ah-compliant, providing much-needed certainty.”

The launch comes at a time of rapid growth in the UAE's virtual asset sector. In the year ending June 2024, the country received more than $30 billion in virtual assets, marking a 42% year-on-year increase, significantly outpacing the regional average of 11.7%, according to the announcement. The move underscores the UAE's emergence as a major hub for digital finance in the MENA region.

“Partnering with ruya is a big step towards making virtual assets a seamless part of everyday banking,” said Mohammed Ali Yusuf (Mo Ali Yusuf), Co-Founder and CEO of Fuze. “Together, we're combining Fuze's cutting-edge infrastructure with ruya's commitment to ethical Islamic banking.”

Unlike other platforms that encourage speculative crypto trading, ruya's offering is embedded within a curated investment framework designed to support long-term financial growth, the company stated in the announcement. It will focus on transparency, fairness, and ethical investing—core tenets of Islamic finance.

To ensure accessibility and informed decision-making, ruya is also offering support through community centers and hybrid call centers, where customers can receive expert guidance on virtual asset investing.

Ethereum breaks key levels but struggles at $1,800. Could growing network activity and increasing long positions spark a move toward $2,000?

As the crypto market recovery pauses, Bitcoin drops below $93,000, while Ethereum continues to struggle below the $1,800 level. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $1,769, showing an intraday pullback of nearly 1.5%.

While Ethereum continues to face resistance, optimistic traders anticipate a post-retest bounce. Could this recovery push the price past the $2,000 mark? Let's find out.

On the 4-hour price chart, Ethereum's trend showcases a bullish breakout from a long-standing supply zone, surpassing the 38.20% Fibonacci level near $1,675.

Following this breakout, Ethereum rallied past the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200 EMA line near $1,755. However, the uptrend failed to maintain momentum above the $1,834 mark, resulting in short-term consolidation and a minor pullback.

This current pullback may be a potential retest of the 200 EMA line and the 50% Fibonacci level. Notably, the recovery has positively influenced the 50 and 100 EMA lines, hinting at a possible bullish crossover.

Furthermore, the bullish recovery has extended the uptrend in the MACD and Signal lines, signaling strong bullish momentum. As a result, technical indicators support the likelihood of a post-retest reversal in Ethereum's price.

Based on the Fibonacci levels, a successful post-retest reversal that breaks above the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement ($1,834) could open the door for Ethereum to reach $2,000. Such upward momentum would also increase the chances of a golden crossover between the 50 and 200 EMA lines—a strong bullish signal.

Conversely, if Ethereum fails to hold above the 50% Fibonacci level, the price could retrace further to test the $1,675 support-turned-resistance zone.

Amid Ethereum's recent bullish recovery, a new analysis by Carmelo Alemán, an analyst at CryptoQuant, highlights a major boost in network activity. He notes a sharp increase in active Ethereum addresses from 306,211 to 336,336 in just 48 hours.

This represents a nearly 10% surge between April 20 and April 22. The analyst also notes overall growth in Ethereum active addresses alongside the broader market recovery.

Carmelo projects a potential expansion in the broader Ethereum ecosystem, which could serve as a launchpad for multiple projects built on Ethereum. As the ecosystem grows, demand for ETH is expected to rise, potentially driving prices higher.

As price action analysis suggests a potential rebound, bullish sentiment in Ethereum's derivatives market continues to grow. According to Coinglass data, long positions in the derivatives market are nearing 55%.

Based on Coinglass's Long-to-Short Ratio chart, long positions now account for 54.98%, driving the ratio to 1.02. This marks a notable increase over the past three hours, up from 46.3%.

With renewed optimism for a breakout rally, derivatives traders are betting big on Ethereum. According to the Ethereum exchange liquidation map, a breakout above $1,800 could lead to significant short liquidations.

The data indicates a cumulative short-liquidation potential of $317.36 million near the $1,809.60 level.

The collection's art was later restored

CloneX/RTFKT/OpenSea and Adobe modified by Blockworks

This is a segment from The Drop newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe.

RTFKT, Nike's abandoned digital brand pronounced “artifact,” lost its CloneX art overnight.

The art for all 19,500 Ethereum NFTs in the collection was replaced with a black background with white text that reads: “This content has been restricted. Using Cloudflare's basic service in this manner is a violation of the Terms of Service. Please visit cfl.re/tos for more.”

That URL redirects to a Cloudflare terms page that states that a more basic Cloudflare plan does not allow clients to stream videos. “We limited your ability to use our services to deliver video bits from our network to your visitors. This is because every second of a typical video requires as much bandwidth as loading a full web page,” the page reads.

“Unfortunately, while most people respect these limitations and understand they exist to ensure high quality of service for all Cloudflare customers, some users attempt to misconfigure our service to stream video in violation of our Terms of Service,” the post continues.

The issue, then, appears to be due to the fact that the CloneX NFT data was not being hosted on an adequate Cloudflare plan. Others, like Yuga Labs blockchain lead 0xQuit, speculated that RTFKT may have forgotten to pay their Cloudflare bill and saw their service cancelled (RTFKT lead Samuel Cardillo told me it has “nothing to do” with an unpaid bill).

Other RTFKT collections — like its NFTs with artist Fewocious, its Animus Eggs, and its Nike Dunk Cryptokicks — still had visible video art live as of Thursday at 10:30am ET white the CloneX art was gone.

The CloneX shakeup appears to have happened overnight, when several X users noticed the issue and flagged it on social media.

“And some of you thought this was the next @cryptopunksnfts since it was abandoned,” Ape Ventures founder Xeer wrote early Thursday morning. Unlike most NFT collections, CryptoPunks art is stored fully onchain on Ethereum.

Because NFTs can use art or visual data that's hosted by a centralized company — like Cloudflare or AWS — they are inherently more mutable and censorable than decentralized data storage options. The tokens will still exist — but the art associated with it can vanish or be altered.

By 11:15 am ET on Thursday, however, some of the CloneX NFT art had reappeared, suggesting the issue with Cloudflare had been resolved (By 12:30pm ET, the art had reappeared). 

So what happened? RTFKT Head of Tech Samuel Cardillo said the CloneX and Animus NFTs are moving to decentralized blockchain storage platform Arweave. Cardillo added that their Cloudflare plan will end at the end of April. The team had been trying to switch their storage infrastructure since December, but the switch took longer “because of internal corpo [sic] process.”

“Somehow this morning Cloudflare decided to move to the Free plan [a] few days before the end of the contract which also triggered that bug in which Cloudflare refuses to stream images and videos,” Cardillo said.

RTFKT shut down operations in December, spurring a slew of over 3,300 CloneX sales in one day as traders gave up hope on the future of the collection.

RTFKT's post about its shutdown at the time didn't offer much of an explanation. It instead claimed the shutdown was “a new chapter” for the company.

“RTFKT isn't ending. It's becoming what it was always meant to be — an artifact of cultural revolution,” the post read.

It's a bitter end for those who lost money on the NFTs as well as those who had longer-term hopes for the December 2021 collection. The CloneX floor price hit an all-time low earlier this month, with NFTs selling for roughly $230 worth of ETH, per NFTPriceFloor data. 

In April 2022, RTFKT CloneX NFTs had a floor price of over $60,000 per NFT. Rarer CloneX NFTs have sold for prices as high as $1.25 million.

Why Have ADA & HBAR Token Plateaued?","https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-analytics-insight/missed-early-openai-dont-miss-its-decentralized-version-unstaked-ico-is-live-why-have-ada-hbar-token-plateaued","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

Every crypto project claims to fix something. But the ones worth watching are specific; they know what they're rebuilding and why the original model no longer works. 

Hedera, for instance, goes after the inefficiencies of institutional finance, offering fast, final settlements for enterprise use. At $0.1677, the HBAR token reflects steady utility, though forecasts point to a drop toward $0.1499 without new adoption.

Cardano prioritizes decentralized governance, embedding decision-making into its protocol. However, the current ADA price prediction flashes mixed signals after the coin fell 5% this week.

Unstaked (UNSD) isn't addressing coordination between users or institutions; it's confronting a far newer imbalance: centralized control over artificial intelligence. Its presale is now officially live, launching at a starting price of just $0.0065.

Hedera isn't trying to reinvent the internet, it's focused on making business transactions faster, safer, and less painful. At $0.1677, HBAR reflects exactly what the network delivers: stable, polished, and built to work behind the scenes. No drama, no hype.

But forecasts don't lie. Without new partnerships or an external push, the token could dip around 11% to $0.1499 by mid-May. That doesn't spell trouble, but it does raise a question. In a space that moves fast, is technical strength enough?

Cardano is built like it's here for the long haul , serious tech, real-world use cases, and a $20.11 billion market cap to show for it. But at $0.6281, down just over 5% this week, the short-term story feels less about momentum and more about waiting around.

The trading volume is up, but the price movement is flat. A clean break above $0.62 could flip that script, but until then, Cardano looks caught between confidence and caution. The 2025 ADA price prediction? Some still believe it could track the growth paths of Ethereum or Bitcoin. But for now, Cardano is doing what it's always done , building slow and aiming steady.

OpenAI proved something the world didn't want to admit until it was too obvious to ignore: Intelligence has value, and whoever owns it, controls the narrative. That control, however, now sits squarely in the hands of centralized giants,closed systems, backroom partnerships, and API pricing that changes without warning. The intelligence is powerful. But it's not “yours.”

Unstaked flips that equation. It offers something OpenAI never will: total ownership. Not just a dashboard , fully autonomous, AI-powered agents that learn, adapt, and deliver value under the command of their deployers. 

These agents work. They scale. They cost next to nothing to run. And the token that powers the entire ecosystem, $UNSD, just entered public presale at $0.0065. That's not a typo. It's the kind of price that rarely survives the early stages of a platform with actual utility and real-world use cases.

Value like this tends not to wait around. It's early, but not forever early. The mechanisms are in place, and adoption is just a matter of time. And each new agent, each deployment, each upgrade creates more demand, without expanding the supply.

This isn't about replacing OpenAI. It's about offering what centralized platforms never could: a system that acts with intelligence and accountability, built on-chain, owned by its users, and still available at a cost most will look back on in disbelief. For anyone watching the top crypto presale market right now, this one checks every box.

Analysts warn that the HBAR token could dip 11% by mid-May without new partnerships. ADA's price prediction is just as uncertain, despite solid use cases; it still lingers at $0.6281, with momentum yet to follow through.

In a market where major tokens are stalling, Unstaked isn't waiting. It's not refining what already works or promising future relevance. It's busy building AI agents that adapt, execute, and generate value under full user control. 

Currently priced at just $0.0065 in presale stage 1, Unstaked is quickly becoming one of the top crypto presale opportunities in the market today, and the current entry point won't be around for long!

A bill is headed to the Pennsylvania state Senate, looking to regulate virtual currencies.

Currently, businesses that transfer money using virtual currencies like crypto coins are not regulated.

This bill would expand existing law on other forms of money to control online currencies.

Rep. Scott Conklin, D-Centre County, sponsored the bill. He released a statement, which said:

""With technology creating new forms of virtual currencies such as cryptocurrency, our laws need to keep pace with those changes to protect Pennsylvanians.

""Consumers deserve to know that the transactions they conduct using digital currencies are as safe and secure as those involving traditional forms of money.

""Under current state law, virtual currency is not subject to the state's Money Transmission Licensing Law, which regulates businesses that transmit money or credit. My bill would expand the law so that it covers virtual currency and requires that it be treated similarly to money transmissions under the act.""

 Decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows, resurgent ETF demand and other bullish factors could push BTC price above the next big hurdle at $95,000. 

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows are at their highest since January 2025.

Inflows to exchanges down to levels last seen in December 2016.

Bitcoin's negative funding rates could set up a short squeeze.

BTC price is above major moving averages, which can now provide support.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price rose to a new range high at $94,700 on April 23, its highest value since March 2.

Several analysts said the next psychological resistance remains at $95,000, and the price might drop to test support levels below.

“The $94K–$95K zone is clearly the resistance to beat,” said Swissblock in an April 24 post on X. 

The onchain data provider asserted that the next logical move for Bitcoin would be a pullback toward the $90,000 zone to gain momentum for a move higher.

Popular Bitcoin analyst AlphaBTC opined that the asset will likely consolidate in the $93,000-$95,000 range “before pushing higher to take liquidity above 100K.”

Several bullish signs suggest that BTC is well-positioned to break above $95,000 in the following days or weeks.

One factor supporting the Bitcoin bull argument is resurgent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

On April 22 and April 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net flow totaling $936 million and $917 million, respectively, as per data from SoSoValue.

As Cointelegraph reported, these inflows have been the highest since January 2025 and more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.

This trend reflects growing confidence among traditional finance players, as observed by market analysts like Jamie Coutts, who noted global liquidity hitting new all-time highs, historically fueling asset price rallies. 

Institutional buying creates sustained upward pressure on Bitcoin's price by absorbing the available supply.

The trend of decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows continues, suggesting a potential reduction in sell pressure. 

The total amount of coins transferred to the exchanges has dropped from a year-to-date high of 97,940 BTC per day on Feb. 25 to 45,000 BTC on April 23, as per data from CryptoQuant. 

This is reinforced by a reduction in the number of addresses depositing Bitcoin to exchanges, which has been “steadily declining since 2022,” according to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. 

He highlights that this metric's 30-day moving average has dropped to 52,000 BTC, a level last seen in December 2016. 

“This trend is bullish in itself,” as it represents a fourfold reduction in coin sales over the last three years, the analyst said, adding:

Bitcoin price has rebounded to levels last seen in early March, but futures trades are not entirely on board yet. 

Bitcoin's perpetual futures funding rates remained negative between April 22 and April 23, despite the price rising by 11% over the same period, data from Glassnode shows.

Negative funding rates imply that shorts are paying longs, reflecting a bearish sentiment that can fuel a short squeeze as prices rise.

In an April 22 post on X, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost highlighted a similar divergence in Bitcoin's price and Binance funding rates. 

“Whereas BTC continues to climb, funding rates on Binance have turned negative, currently sitting at around -0.006 at the time of writing,” Darkfost explained.

He added that this is a rare occurrence, which has historically been followed by significant rallies, like Bitcoin's surge from $28,000 to $73,000 in October 2023, and from $57,000 to $108,000 in September 2024.

If history repeats itself, Bitcoin may rally from the current levels, breaking above the resistance at $95,000 toward $100,000.

On April 22, Bitcoin price rose above a key level: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) currently at $88,690, fueling a marketwide recovery.

The last time the BTC price broke above the 200-day SMA, it experienced a parabolic move, rallying 80% from $66,000 on Oct. 14, 2024, to its previous all-time high of $108,000 on Dec. 17. 

This level should provide significant support as Bitcoin trades above this key trendline. But if it doesn't hold, the following levels to watch will likely be $84,379, the 50-day SMA, and the $80,000 psychological level.

For the bulls, the resistance levels at $95,000 and $100,000 are the primary ones to watch. Rising above that would pave the way for a run toward the Jan. 20 all-time high above $109,000.

Slashing NASA's Programs Will Squander America's Place in Space

The Trump administration's plans to cut NASA's science missions will destroy the U.S. space legacy

For more than half a century planetary exploration and space science have been a hallmark of American achievement and excellence. From Mercury to Pluto and beyond, we have gained enormous understanding about planetary origins and evolution. We have learned about the atmospheric, surface and interior dynamics of other worlds. All those discoveries have carried implications for what's happening here on Earth. In classrooms around the world, exploring new worlds and probing the mysteries of the universe is an emblem of America.

But that may now end; the Trump administration is poised to take the chainsaw to space science, just as it has to almost everything else in the U.S. science portfolio. Trump officials are planning huge, destructive cuts for space science, according to news reports, likely killing all new mission plans for this decade, including the long-sought, all-important Mars Sample Return mission. This flight was meant to return now-waiting samples from the red planet.

China is already leading the way to the moon and Mars with robotic vehiclelike rovers and sample returns and is also likely to do so with human missions. The U.S. human space program, meanwhile, is bogged down with a stumbling Artemis program, built with a convoluted architecture marked so far by failures and delays in nearly every major component. The latest is the repeated failure of SpaceX's Starship, which twice now has exploded in flight. Reminiscent of the 1980s, when we paused planetary exploration after the success of Viking and launch of Voyager 1 and 2, the U.S. has iced new Mars missions, with plans to cancel Mars Sample Return, and redirected our once great lunar capability to small experimental landers built by inexperienced new companies. Beyond specific missions, the loss of space science research capability will be a generational calamity.

So what? Does it matter if the U.S. is No. 2 on other worlds? Space is a pretty distant arena—even more distant if it is the moon, Mars and beyond you are thinking of. Compared with the “America First” emphasis on AI chips, rare earth metals, tariffs and trade wars, promoting Teslas and cutting foreign aid, space is a minor political and economic player. But we are becoming No. 2 in such areas of focus too (see China's advances in DeepSeek AI, BYD electric cars and developing hydropower in Africa). Our failures on Earth are not unrelated to our narrow and shortsighted vision for the moon and Mars, and the broader dismissal of science.

Focusing inward is what China's Ming dynasty did in the 15th century and the Portuguese and Dutch did in the 18th. Our step back from exploration of new worlds is one deep into mediocrity or even obscurity. It's tied together—the Apollo program was not about a race to the moon; it was about a race between geopolitical powers to prove their economic and technological superiority to the world. So too now. Africans will feel the U.S. retreat as we withdraw humanitarian and infrastructure aid. They will also feel the U.S. retreat from science and exploration just as China goes forward with theirs.

I don't think it matters to Africans if it is Chinese or Americans there, engaged and helping them. I also don't think it matters to the moon or Mars whether it is China or the U.S. building things there. But if we accept mediocrity and turn our focus inward, it will matter to us, especially to our children. The isolationist or island mentality expresses to our children and to the world that we have given up on ambition and growth and understanding the universe, that we will be satisfied with being less than we can be.

The planned decimation of American space science, coupled with the total dysfunction in our human space program, squanders the admirable U.S. record and accomplishments. If these budget cuts go through, we will leave collected samples on Mars and forego future exploration. What little money will remain will be given to Boeing's troubled Space Launch System human space flight vehicle and SpaceX's exploding Starship—a vehicle designed for Elon Musk's Mars fantasy, rather than for the needs of the U.S. space program.

There is no doubt we could do more with less. NASA is wasting money racing again to put footprints on the moon, this time to lose. Instead, we could play to our strengths. Imagine a telerobotic lunar base with broad societal and international participation, instead of the two-people-per-year plan to put boots on the moon we now have. We could “commercialize” the moon not with fanciful mining ideas, but with private and public partners operating vehicles, conducting science observations and even playing sports and games. Similarly, we can lead the world into the solar system with virtual exploration opportunities for all. And we can bring home those samples from Mars—possibly with the discovery of extraterrestrial life. This kind of American creativity would cost far less than our current program—but it will not have a chance in a budget-slashing environment where we throw out the babies and bury our heads in the bathwater.

This can only be enabled by government. Private companies will not conduct science and astronomy on the moon (nor send rovers or bring back samples from Mars). Nor will they fly the successors to Hubble and Webb such as the Nancy Grace Roman telescope, which the administration also proposes to cancel.

Space exploration is meant to create a positive future. The legacy of Apollo, and of our robot explorers in the solar system is a real and worthy America first legacy, one that proclaims American leadership based on a peaceful and global aspiration: for the benefit of all humankind. That legacy should not be squandered.

Move over, uranium. Get out of here, water. Thorium and salt are the new MVPs of nuclear power.

Uranium (U) is the poster child for nuclear fission reactors—the most common type of nuclear reactor we have.  Most fission reactors are fueled by the isotope uranium-235 (it even made its way into The Simpsons as the glowing green sludge that spawns mutant fish), but despite its star status in pop culture and nuclear physics, uranium is not the only heavy metal that can release a tremendous amount of power when its nuclei are split.

In the remote expanse of the Gobi desert stands the first thorium (Th) reactor ever built. Last year, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences showed that this two-megawatt reactor could power up and operate without a glitch, and they have now achieved another first—successfully reloading it while it was still running. Thorium-232 (the isotope of thorium that most commonly occurs on its own) is not capable of undergoing fission by itself. By capturing an extra neutron, however, it can morph into protactinium, which decays into U-233. This can be achieved by exposing the thorium to extreme radiation, which bombards it with enough neutrons for the transmutation to happen. Protactinium is then extracted from the reactor's active zone before too many neutrons can be lost. 

It is possible to recycle the U-233 decay into new fuel, or continue fueling the machine with it as is, the latter of which is usually done with molten salt reactors like this new thorium reactor. These reactors are gaining traction again after a decades-long hiatus—almost $1 billion was spent on developing stealth bomber planes with molten salt reactors that used thorium for nuclear power at the dawn of the Cold War era. When the first functional molten salt reactor was developed by scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, it ran at full power from 1965 though 1969 (over 13,000 hours), but the Department of Energy lost interest and no further work was done to advance the technology until the early 2000s.

But that research remained available to the public, which is how China eventually discovered it and used it as a backbone for their own reactor. And, as it turns out, molten salt is still an appealing option. Most nuclear reactors use water as a coolant, but because water is volatile—high pressure needs to be maintained so that it stays in its liquid state. Without that pressure, the water evaporates, and reactor fuel could overheat and suffer a meltdown. Using molten salt prevents radioactive sludge from leaking because the boiling point of salt is too high for it to evaporate at reactor temperatures. In case of overheating, the molten salt circling the reactor will expand and halt the reaction. 

Molten salt reactors can can also use molten salt in the fuel, which makes it prone to freezing in case of a breach (a very good thing). The fuel in those vessels or pipes will spread and cool until it finally freezes in place. China's reactor uses salt both as coolant and in its fuel. 

Thorium is not only more abundant than uranium, but has the upside of not being as easy to weaponize. While the fission of Th-232 produces protinactium, which decays into U-233 and can be used in nuclear weapons, U-233 isn't nearly as explosive as other isotopes (the isotope most commonly used in uranium explosives is U-235). There wouldn't be much of a point in dealing it to create an illicit nuclear bomb.

Though China may currently be the world leader in molten salt reactors, the U.S. is catching up. Nuclear tech company Core Power is planning an enormous floating network of these power plants within the next decade. We'll just have to wait and see where the molten salt take us.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Human Consciousness Is a ‘Controlled Hallucination,' Scientist Says—And AI Can Never Achieve It","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64555175/conscious-ai-singularity/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:47:00 GMT","

Yet, understanding how neural networks work could help us learn more about our own consciousness.

Traipse into the world of artificial intelligence research, and it won't take long to stumble across a concept known as the “singularity.” A loan word from astrophysics describing the heart of a black hole where known physics collapses, the term in the AI sense refers to a future artificial mind surpassing the intelligence of humans, leading to rapid innovation or destruction—depending on who you ask.

Whatever the vision—utopian or dystopian—experts increasingly agree that the singularity will occur sometime this century, with the boldest estimates measured in months, not years. But even if AI does achieve this technical milestone, one neuroscientist says it still won't rival the complexity of the brain, because ultimately AI will still lack consciousness.

“Intelligence is not the same thing as consciousness,” says Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex and longtime advocate of the idea that our biological bodies are a necessary cog in the consciousness machine. “We see this confusion especially … with the Singularity. AI becomes superhuman and that's the moment when the lights come and AI is suddenly aware. Why would that be a threshold? The only plausible reason is you've got some baked-in assumption about consciousness being associated with human-level intelligence.”

For decades, Seth has written, published, and spoken—on both stages and YouTube channels— about the ever-slippery concept of human consciousness. Unlike some theories that see consciousness as a result of neurological computation, Seth's research explores the idea of human consciousness—and consciousness in non-human animals more broadly—as a “controlled hallucination,” a series of predictions our brain makes to aid in our survival. 

In a now-famous TED Talk from 2018 Seth lays out evidence his lab gathered, of how the body can misconstrue visual information, assimilate fake body parts due to external stimulation, and undergo various other hallucinatory behaviors. All of which suggest the brain is actively constructing our conscious experience from the inside out. According to this theory, Seth says humans possess a very important attribute that just may keep consciousness forever out of reach for AI—no matter how advanced various LLMs or machine-learning algorithms become. 

“If consciousness is not computation, then what is it?” Seth says. “One possibility … is that life matters. We are biological systems that are made up of parts like metabolism and autopoiesis [the capacity to reproduce], and these make us very different from any machines that we've yet produced and that might turn out to be necessary for consciousness.”

Seth admits that this idea can fall prey to vitalism, an idea that life is somehow intrinsically imbued with consciousness. Seth's lab at the University of Sussex instead aims to dispel this kind of magical thinking, by investigating the idea of embodied consciousness in the scientific realm. The result is what's known as the “beast machine theory,” which describes the brain as a prediction machine that updates its “controlled hallucination” via the unending stream of sensory information. When this system goes awry, it creates an actual hallucination, which can also explain why the brain falls prey to myriad kinds of illusions—it's simply making the best prediction with the data at hand, but not necessarily the correct one. 

Seth's consciousness theory joins a long list of competing ideas that try to grapple with what makes something conscious, but he stands somewhat apart from other experts. That's because this “controlled hallucination” theory relies on our biological bodies, something AI simply doesn't have. Ultimately, AI forever reaching but never quite grasping consciousness could be a good thing, Seth argues. Because if that metaphorical dog ever caught that existential truck, the consequences would be profound.

It's a “bad idea to build conscious machines,” Seth says. “We'd introduce new possibilities for suffering of a kind we might not even recognize.”

Despite his scientific reservations that AI could ever be conscious, Seth says that understanding neural networks could help us learn more about our own consciousness—after all, it's why he got his Ph.D. in computer science.

“You're not going to make meaningful progress without having a foot in several different camps,” Seth says. “My motivation with AI wasn't to build a multi-billion dollar company, but to build simple neural networks and see what they can do. That's been pretty central to understanding how a collection of neurons could account for aspects of consciousness.”

Seth often compares the field of a consciousness study to other historical scientific breakthroughs, such as discovering the underlying mechanisms of heat, for example. At first we could only describe hotness and coldness without knowing the physical basis for heat. But once that was discovered, suddenly concepts of absolute zero and stellar temperatures, and other more advanced concepts, were suddenly possible. 

Research is now at that point with consciousness, and now we have benchmarks, Seth says. “We're trying to use what we know … some anchor points that we can use to move from a description of how consciousness happens, to an explanation of how it might happen in general. Then, you can generalize and extrapolate.”

So how do we get to that physical basis? Seth says that, broadly speaking, theories of consciousness—including his own—need to be more precise, but other efforts are a step in the right direction. Those efforts include “adversarial collaboration,” where two or more theories are sort of pitted against each other in an effort to improve or disregard them. Continuing advancements in brain imaging and optogenetics (controlling individual cells, or neurons, with light) will also provide ever greater data for probing the biological mechanisms of consciousness. 

Seth's more recent work has also led him to investigate consciousness in biological structures that typically evade our animalistic bias of what can and can't be conscious. Particular among these are collections of stem cells known as brain organoids, which are designed to mimic human brain function. In many ways, Seth sees organoids as a more compelling candidate for investigating consciousness than the world of ever-advancing AI. 

“Even though organoids are not behaviorally very impressive—they don't speak to us, they don't solve complicated problems—maybe they're more similar to us in ways that matter … than language models, that may be more similar to us in ways that don't matter,” Seth says. “It's easier to envisage that, as organoid technology develops, you get closer and closer to the brains that we actually have.”

Artificial intelligence may seem like the method du jour for understanding consciousness, but as the work of Anil Seth shows, the world of biology still has so much more to teach us.

Robotic arms and 3D printing gantries can already be found on construction sites -- albeit mostly as heavy, permanently installed systems on the ground. They quickly reach their limits on rough terrain or at great heights. A team led by researchers from the Laboratory of Sustainability Robotics at Empa and EPFL has therefore investigated how aerial robots could be used as autonomous construction platforms in the future. In the cover story of the current issue of Science Robotics, the researchers show the state of the art and the potential of this upcoming technology. The advantage is obvious: Construction drones can reach places that are inaccessible to conventional machines, be it in the mountains, on rooftops, in disaster areas or even on distant planets. They also do not require a fixed construction site, can be deployed in swarms, and therefore offer a high degree of flexibility and ease of scalability. At the same time, they could shorten transportation routes, reduce material consumption and make construction sites safer.

Repairs and operations in extreme situations

Aerial robots are particularly suitable for disaster relief operations -- for example, in flooded or destroyed regions where conventional vehicles can no longer get through. Aerial robots could transport building materials and autonomously erect emergency shelters. Their use is also promising for repairs in places that are difficult to access. They could autonomously detect and repair cracks on high-rise facades or bridges without scaffolding. ""Existing robotic systems on the ground often weigh several tons, take a long time to set up and have a limited working radius,"" explains Yusuf Furkan Kaya, the lead author of the study, from the Sustainability Robotics Laboratory at Empa and EPFL. ""Construction drones, on the other hand, are light, mobile and flexible -- but so far they only exist at low technology readiness levels. They have yet to be used for industrial purposes.""

In fact, there are already numerous academic prototypes that demonstrate different methods of airborne construction, from the placement of individual building elements and the tensioning of cable structures to the layer-by-layer printing of building materials. At Empa, for example, flying robots have been programmed to work together as a team to print materials layer by layer for the construction or repair of structures.

Interplay of technology, material and design

The potential of drones is disruptive -- they can theoretically fly and build anywhere, if energy supply and material transportation are guaranteed. And they are easily scalable: In the event of a disaster, hundreds of aerial robots could immediately set up temporary infrastructure in remote areas.

At the same time, future construction with drones faces new challenges. According to the researchers, a key hurdle is the interdisciplinary nature of the technology: Aerial Additive Manufacturing (Aerial AM) requires simultaneous progress in three areas: robotics, materials science and architecture. Mirko Kovac, Head of the Laboratory of Sustainability Robotics at Empa and EPFL, describes the interplay as follows: ""A drone may be able to fly precisely, but without lightweight, stable and processable materials, it cannot develop its full potential. And even if both are available, building designs must be adapted to the limited precision of the aerial robots to enable load-bearing structures.""

Complementing existing robots

In addition to this cross-disciplinary coordination, there are other technical hurdles within robotics, such as limited flight time, payload or autonomy. The study therefore presents an autonomy framework in five stages -- from simple flights along a route to full independence, in which aerial robots can analyze the construction environment, detect errors and even adapt the design in real-time. According to Yusuf Furkan Kaya, this is not only a theoretical model but also a clear development plan. ""Our goal is to have aerial robots that understand what material they are building with and in what environment, and intelligently optimize the resulting structure during construction.""

For the time being, Aerial AM remains a complementary solution to existing ground-based robotic systems. Drones' energy consumption is currently eight to ten times higher, and their construction volume is also limited. The researchers, therefore, recommend a combined approach: While conventional systems build the lower areas of a structure, drones take over from a certain height and bring their strengths in flexibility and range to bear there.

Understanding how regime shifts in iceberg calving behavior affect ice shelf stability remains a challenge for numerical models. This is an important question as we consider the fate of the ice shelves that currently buttress the Antarctic Ice Sheet and hold back the bulk of its potential upstream sea-level contribution. Using buried landforms, we demonstrate that ice shelves fringed the former British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) and document their disintegration ~18,000 years ago. The ice shelves produced massive (5–10 s km wide, 50–180 m thick) tabular icebergs until widespread ice shelf break-up shifted the calving regime to smaller bergs; a change that coincided with the collapse of marine-based ice across the central North Sea. We propose that the BIIS reached a climatic threshold around 18 ka which caused massive surface melting of its ice shelves, triggering hydrofracturing of crevasses that ultimately led to their disintegration and likely enhanced ice-retreat rates.

Ice shelves fringe the fast-flowing margins of the modern Antarctic Ice Sheet and provide a buttressing backstress that regulates the rate at which upstream grounded ice flows towards the ocean1,2,3. Observations have highlighted a strong association between ice shelf thinning, sometimes leading to their catastrophic disintegration, and the sustained acceleration and retreat of glaciers in Antarctica3,4,5,6. However, the number of ice shelf disintegration events cataloged within the satellite era remains limited to about 10, e.g., refs. 4,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Consequently, the manner in which ice shelves and iceberg calving may respond to future climatic warming remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in projections of future ice sheet evolution and thus sea-level rise8,14,15,16,17.

Ice shelves are vulnerable to changes in atmospheric and ocean conditions5,12,18,19, losing mass through both melting (thinning) and iceberg calving. Currently, calving accounts for ~45 % of the mass lost from the Antarctic Ice Sheet but with considerable regional variability20,21. Observations and numerical models show that the dominant regime of iceberg calving (i.e., the size, shape and number of icebergs calved), and thus the type of iceberg produced, reflects the dynamics of the parent ice mass and the number of pre-existing fractures in a calving margin cf.22,23. For example, relatively stable ice shelves sporadically produce gigantic tabular icebergs (100 s of meters thick and 10 s to >100 km long) with decades of quiescence between major calving events24,25,26. By contrast, rapidly retreating grounded tidewater glaciers without ice shelves produce smaller and more frequently calved icebergs that are a fraction of parent ice-mass thickness27,28,29. In the well-documented Larsen-B Ice Shelf disintegration event on the eastern Antarctic Peninsula in 2002, abundant surface melting led to hydrofracturing and rapid fragmentation into large numbers of narrow ice blocks that toppled and collided with one another30.

Icebergs produce ploughmarks when their keels contact and move through sediment-covered areas of the seafloor. Ploughmarks are commonly observed in multibeam bathymetric or side-scan sonar images of the modern seafloor31,32,33, and buried examples have been imaged within Quaternary sediments on formerly glaciated continental shelves, including the North Sea, using 3D seismic reflection methods34,35. Morphological analyses of iceberg ploughmarks provide information on iceberg sizes, and therefore calving styles, thus helping to constrain mass-loss mechanisms36,37,38. By far the most abundant ploughmarks are those formed by small, single-keeled icebergs which typically incise narrow V-shaped grooves arranged in curvilinear, chaotic, and criss-crossing patterns as they drift with ocean currents and tides. In contrast, ploughmarks with broad comb-like, parallel morphologies are much rarer and indicate the presence of gigantic tabular icebergs with multiple keels formed by full-thickness calving from floating ice shelves such as those which currently fringe much of the Antarctic Ice Sheet32,39. Consequently, the presence and characteristics of iceberg ploughmarks in the geological record can inform about the geometry (presence or absence of ice shelves), mass-loss behavior, and dynamics of former marine-terminating ice sheets, and, critically, how these change with time if ploughmarks are found in geological units with different ages32.

Recently, Clark et al. 40 presented a new numerical reconstruction of the growth and retreat of the last British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) that used extensive geomorphological observations and chronological data to constrain numerical model simulations of ice sheet flow between 31 and 15 ka. As a result, the BIIS now provides one of the world's best-constrained records of ice sheet deglaciation that can be used to explore how modern ice sheets may decay and, in particular, to aid our understanding of how specific mass-loss processes may evolve in a warming climate. The reconstructions predicted that ice shelves formerly fringed large portions of the BIIS, particularly during the early stages of deglaciation (Fig. 1a). Despite the numerical model used employing relatively simple parameterizations for ocean melt, grounding-line migration and iceberg calving, its predictions are supported by the presence of grounding‐zone wedges (GZWs; submarine glacial landforms associated with ice shelf presence), particularly around the BIIS' western margin41,42,43,44,45. Some of the largest BIIS ice shelves are predicted by models in the North Sea (Fig. 1a), yet definitive geomorphological evidence for ice shelf presence in the form of GZWs remains scarce in this region, e.g., refs. 46,47,48, and sedimentary evidence of potential sub-ice shelf facies requires further investigation47,49. Furthermore, whilst single-keeled iceberg ploughmarks have been imaged extensively in the North Sea geological record dating back to over 2.5 Ma34,35, hitherto there has been no empirical evidence for multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks to confirm the presence of large ice shelves in this region47.

The extent to which ice shelves modulated the retreat of the former BIIS can provide insight into their importance in determining the long-term response of modern ice sheets to climate change when ice shelves are lost. In this study, we decipher the detailed morphology of iceberg ploughmarks preserved beneath the seafloor of the central North Sea using high-resolution 3D (HR3D) seismic methods to infer the size and shape of icebergs calved from the BIIS during the last glacial period and early deglaciation. We provide direct observational evidence for the presence of tabular icebergs in the North Sea during the last glacial period and trace their disappearance in the geological record, thereby confirming ice shelf occurrence around the decaying BIIS as well as the timing of their disintegration.

Inspection of HR3D seismic data in seven different survey areas of the central North Sea reveals an abundance of curvilinear grooves with three distinctive morphologies buried 22–55 m beneath the seafloor in modern-day water depths of 115–148 m (Fig. 2). The majority of the curvilinear grooves are unresolvable using the lower-resolution 3D seismic methods previously used to generate the vast majority of Quaternary reconstructions in this region (Fig. 3). The first class of features consists of V-shaped grooves that are 30–80 m wide, ~2–5 m deep, and are flanked along their length by elongate but low-amplitude densely-spaced ridges up to 2.5 m high (Fig. 2a). The grooves extend for 100s–1000 s of meters and terminate abruptly, sometimes leaving circular pit-like depressions in the palaeo-seafloor. The second class of feature comprises broad, relatively flat-bottomed grooves that exceed 4 km in length, are over 200 m wide, up to 6 m deep and are also flanked by elongate ridges up to 1.5 m high (Fig. 2b). The third feature class consists of multiple low-amplitude densely-spaced grooves aligned in parallel to form a comb-like pattern (Fig. 2c). The individual grooves comprising the larger comb-like arrangements are 0.5–1.6 m deep, ~20–80 m wide and are semi-regularly spaced at distances of ~30–65 m. The total width of the comb-like patterns ranges between 300–2350 m, whilst their overall alignment can abruptly change direction by angles of up to 16° over distances of <200 m (Fig. 2c). These subtle features are commonly overprinted by the narrower V-shaped grooves and cannot be resolved using conventional 3D seismic data alone (Fig. 3).

We interpret the three classes of curvilinear grooves as ploughmarks formed by icebergs impacting the seafloor during drift. The parallel ridges flanking the iceberg ploughmarks are berms formed by the redistribution of sediment as the iceberg keels ploughed the seafloor. The ploughmarks are distinct from other previously described glacial lineations in the region (e.g., mega-scale glacial lineations, flutes, and megaflutes) that were molded on top of subglacial tills and ice-overridden glacimarine sediments that are older than 19.5 ka50,51,52 (buried ~35 m below seafloor; b.s.f.). These other glacial lineations have been interpreted using 3D seismic surveys and borehole constraints to have been produced by the fast flow of grounded ice during the Late Weichselian52. This is because those lineations are straighter, occur over a wider expanse (10 s of kms in width), lack characteristic berms, and do not change direction as abruptly as the iceberg ploughmarks. As many of the iceberg ploughmarks overprint the Late Weichselian glacial lineations52, the age of these ploughmarks can be constrained to the last deglaciation of the BIIS following the retreat of grounded ice from the central North Sea. Some HR3D seismic datasets also contain examples of similarly ploughed surfaces buried deeper than the Late Weichselian lineations, suggesting that the formative process responsible for the ploughmarks has recurred multiple times during the Quaternary as the North Sea was repeatedly glaciated.

Variations in ploughmark morphology reflect the type of iceberg that formed them. Narrow, single V-shaped ploughmarks are characteristic of scours produced by small, individual icebergs calved from a marine terminating ice margin that is probably grounded, e.g., refs. 53,54,55. This morphology of iceberg ploughmark is present in all of the HR3D seismic datasets examined. The second class of ploughmark is broader and has a flatter base ( > 200 m wide) reflecting the imprint of a blocky iceberg with large dimensions or the grounded corner of a tabular berg, e.g., ref. 56. At between 300–2350 m wide, the subtle multi-keeled grooves which comprise the third class of ploughmark are one to two orders of magnitude wider than the other types observed in the HR3D seismic data and are only observed within the deeper waters of the Witch Ground Basin and west of the Norwegian Channel (Fig. 1a). The distinctive parallel groove morphology of these features reflects either ploughing by drifting tabular icebergs with massive dimensions (Fig. 4), e.g., refs. 57,58 or incision by drifting sea ice pressure ridges, e.g., ref. 59. These formative mechanisms can be distinguished simply by considering the palaeo water depths at which the ploughmarks were incised, as the keels of sea ice rarely exceed 20 m deep even where pressure ridging has occurred34,35,59. Palaeo-sea level reconstructions that account for eustasy and isostasy60,61 demonstrate that water depths in the region of the central North Sea where the multi-keeled grooves are buried were between ~50–180 m during the growth and retreat of the last BIIS (31–15 ka). This suggests that large icebergs, rather than thinner sea-ice floes, were responsible for the seafloor scouring. Given both the tendency for the ploughmarks to change direction over short ( < 200 m) distances (e.g., Fig. 5a), and the absence of multi-keeled ploughmarks further south in the basin where water depths would have been too shallow to accommodate large icebergs (Fig. 6)60, we conclude that the grounding of tabular icebergs was the formative mechanism of the multi-keeled grooves observed in the HR3D seismic data (Fig. 5).

Note how the multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks in (d) overprint the megascale glacial lineations (MSGLs), interpreted by Graham et al. 52 to be of Late Weichselian (last glacial) age. Ploughmark locations are displayed in Fig. 6.

Icebergs calved in the Witch Ground Basin would drift eastwards towards the Norwegian Channel before being routed northwards towards the continental shelf edge. The isostatically-corrected bathymetry of the central North Sea at 20 ka is from Bradley et al. 60, with bathymetric depth contours displayed every 25 m. Colored stippled lines represent the modeled ice margins of the last British-Irish (BIIS) and Fennoscandian (FIS) ice sheets at timeslices between 20 ka and 18 ka from Clark et al. 40. NCIS—Norwegian Channel Ice Stream.

As large tabular icebergs require full-thickness calving from ice shelves to form8, the recorded presence of multi-keeled ploughmarks in the central North Sea provides direct empirical evidence of floating ice shelves in this region during the last glacial period (Fig. 1a). The majority of the multi-keeled ploughmarks are located in the Witch Ground Basin over which the eastern flank of the BIIS retreated as it ‘unzipped' from the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) across the central North Sea (Fig. 6)40,62. Iceberg ploughmarks observed in the Norwegian Channel off the west coast of Norway are typically oriented north-south63, implying a northward drift direction towards the shelf break. This pattern of currents would have likely taken icebergs calved from the BIIS in the Witch Ground Basin eastwards towards the Norwegian Channel before they were transported northwards; this proposed drift direction is supported by an observed shift in ploughmark orientation from NW-SE in the Witch Ground Basin towards a more NE-SW orientation in the HR3D datasets situated further to the east (Fig. 6). Conversely, the bathymetric sill between the Norwegian Channel and the southern central North Sea would have prevented large icebergs calved from the FIS with drafts exceeding 110 m from drifting towards the Witch Ground Basin60 (Fig. 6).

At ~50–180 m deep, the inferred keel depths of the tabular icebergs present in the North Sea are analogous in scale to those calved from small fringing ice shelves around modern Antarctica, such as the former Larsen A Ice Shelf, or the extant Brunt Ice Shelf in the NE Weddell Sea Embayment28. These ice shelves are typically of the order of ~104 km2 in area and extend ~40–110 km back to the grounding line. The presence of ice shelves in the North Sea had previously only been tentatively suggested from landform mapping46,47 and numerical model simulations that relied on highly parameterized ocean melt and calving processes, including sub-grid parameterizations of ice shelf movement and grounding-line retreat40. These simulations also did not include tidal effects; however, palaeo-tidal simulations demonstrate that this region had the lowest tidal range of all the northwest European ice stream outlets during deglaciation—conditions which would have favored ice shelf formation and stability64.

The geomorphological imprints of modern iceberg interactions with the seafloor are challenging to observe in action and, as a result, it is difficult to infer iceberg dimensions from the palaeo-record. One of the most informative examples capable of relating iceberg size to ploughmark dimensions exists on the mid-Norwegian margin where a 2 km wide multi-keeled iceberg ploughmark has been associated with a nearby planed-off debris-flow lobe, suggesting that the iceberg responsible for forming the ploughmarks was at least twice as wide as the seafloor imprint it left behind32. In other formerly glaciated regions, multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks are commonly 0.3–5 km wide (Fig. 4)53,57,58,65,66.

Modern tabular icebergs calved from Antarctic ice shelves with thicknesses similar to those inferred to have existed in the North Sea can be larger than 1200 km2 in area and more than 50 km wide, such as iceberg A-74 which calved from the Brunt Ice Shelf in 2021 (1270 km2). On the modern seafloor of the Weddell Sea, multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks up to 1.7 km wide have been observed in contemporary water depths of ~400 m (Fig. 4a)66. Tabular icebergs calved in this region between 1984 and 2001 had an average width of 2.4 km, although much larger tabular bergs, such as the 170 × 25 km A-76 (which calved from the Ronne Ice Shelf in 2021), were also produced sporadically27,67. Given that present-day water depths on Antarctic continental shelves where multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks are observed are typically ~300–800 m68, it is likely that only the largest contemporary icebergs, or potentially even larger icebergs calved from a thicker ice sheet during the last glacial period69, are responsible for forming the multi-keeled ploughmarks in the Weddell Sea given their sparsity in this region and elsewhere around Antarctica36. Furthermore, even the largest multi-keeled ploughmarks observed in Pine Island Trough, West Antarctica, are less than 500 m wide despite the glaciers in this region regularly producing tabular icebergs that are up to 1000 s of km2 in planimetric area and 10s–100 km wide36.

Whilst it is challenging to estimate the original dimensions of icebergs from the seafloor ploughmarks they produce during drift—especially when most contemporary analogs are located in far deeper waters than those present in the North Sea during the last glaciation—a general observation is that multi-keeled ploughmarks tend to be several times smaller than the width of the iceberg which formed them32,36,53,66. Using palaeo-water depths60 to infer the thickness of the North Sea icebergs, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, e.g., ref. 70, and typical freeboard-width ratios of modern Antarctic tabular icebergs67, we estimate that feasible widths of the North Sea tabular icebergs could have ranged from ~500–10,000 m; this range is roughly in agreement with the width of the multi-keeled ploughmarks mapped in the HR3D seismic data. Consequently, given the dimensions of the multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks observed in the central North Sea and those of their ancient and modern counterparts, the largest tabular icebergs calved from the BIIS during the last glacial period were at least 2350 m wide (the widest observed multi-keeled ploughmark), but their true size was probably significantly larger at 5–10 s km in width.

Modern rates of iceberg calving are primarily set by structural and internal stresses within an ice shelf created as ice flows towards the ice margin8,12,23. Increased fracturing or thinning due to substantial changes in ice flow or ocean-induced basal melting can diminish the structural integrity of an ice shelf, potentially resulting in a calving regime transition that may drive rapid changes to terminus position, or make an ice shelf more susceptible to external environmental drivers that could precondition or trigger rapid collapse cf. 8,12. Most rapid disintegration-style events observed to date in the observational era were ultimately triggered by enhanced surface and/or basal melting4,7,9,10,13,71.

The multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks observed in the Witch Ground Basin are situated directly above glacial lineations ( ~ 35 m b.s.f.) formed by the flow of grounded ice just prior to the retreat of the last BIIS from this part of the central North Sea, an event that has been dated to ~20 ka51,52. At shallower burial depths within our data at this location ( ~ 12 m b.s.f.), evidence of multi-keeled iceberg ploughmarks disappears and stratigraphic horizons dated largely to 17–14 ka are instead ploughed by smaller single V-shaped grooves; these in turn are buried by postglacial Holocene muds and silts52,72. This switch in the type of iceberg ploughmark demonstrates that a calving regime shift from broad parallel comb-like to single iceberg ploughmarks occurred sometime between ~19–17 ka, when the sporadic calving of large tabular icebergs ceased and instead switched to the production of many smaller single-keeled icebergs.

In contemporary settings, similar transitions in iceberg production have been associated with ice shelf collapse through the process of repeated iceberg fracture, detachment, and a corresponding acceleration in mass loss for the grounded portions of marine-based ice sheets22. For example, the Larsen B Ice Shelf collapsed at a rate of ~10 km week−1 once the calving of large tabular icebergs ceased and mass was instead removed via the loss of numerous, yet relatively small ( < 250 m wide), pieces of the ice shelf8,71. Once lost, the reduction in buttressing from ice shelves has an almost instantaneous effect on ice flow3,73, resulting in rapid increases in ice flux over the grounding line that can propagate far inland with significant implications for ice sheet stability8. We therefore interpret the regime shift in iceberg production to represent a significant event in the mass loss from the BIIS: the widespread disintegration of its ice shelves in the North Sea between ~19–17 ka. In this broader context, it is notable that there is a coincidence between the timing of disintegration of the BIIS ice shelves and the saddle collapse of the grounded portions of the BIIS and FIS across the North Sea40(Fig. 1a).

An important question, therefore, is whether ice shelf breakup was the main driver of accelerated grounded ice retreat across the North Sea, or was disintegration merely a symptom of enhanced ice sheet mass loss that was already underway when the ice shelves collapsed? Almost all modern ice shelves serve to buttress inland ice8, providing a ‘safety band' which slows the flow of grounded ice towards the ocean1,2. The efficacy of buttressing is significantly reduced, however, when ice shelves are laterally unconfined by the surrounding ice or bedrock14, as is the case for several East Antarctic ice shelves2. The BIIS's ice shelves are modeled to be largest in embayments where the margins of the ice shelves are laterally confined, particularly at 20 ka and 19 ka where grounded ice is pinned around the rim of the Witch Ground Basin (Fig. 6). Accordingly, the former ice shelves fringing the BIIS likely restrained the flow of upstream grounded ice towards several of the BIIS's marine terminating margins. It then follows that any reduction in ice shelf area would reduce buttressing and result in accelerated grounded ice retreat across the relatively smooth low-gradient bed of the central North Sea.

Ice shelves are sensitive to environmental changes in both the atmosphere and the ocean10,74,75. Their destablization can arise via surface thinning through melting, hydrofracture, lake ponding and drainage4,19, or through weakening from beneath via basal melting, undercutting, grounding line retreat, or in response to increased ocean swell18,20,30,76. The thermal limit of extant Antarctic ice shelves has been observed to follow the migration of the –9 °C mean annual air temperature isotherm11 because above this temperature extensive melt ponds form in summer which lead to large scale ice shelf fragmentation and collapse driven by hydrofracturing7. Recently, however, it has been argued that the melt-over-accumulation ratio plays a more important role than annual mean temperature for setting the threshold of Antarctic ice shelf stability77. Although reconstructions of the demise of the BIIS show that retreat initiated at around 22 ka—thousands of years prior to deglacial warming and CO2 rise—changes in ice sheet volume appear to mirror variability in June insolation40. This suggests that the earlier start of deglaciation may have been triggered by orbitally induced increasing levels of summer solar radiation that produced greater surface melting40,78. Accordingly, it is feasible that the magnitude of surface melting reached a threshold between ~19–17 ka, causing the ice shelves fringing the BIIS to undergo widespread hydrofracture and collapse, accelerating ice losses around its marine margins. A shift in surface meltwater presence has also been linked to the rapid deposition of thick grounding-line proximal glacimarine muds that were deposited in the Witch Ground Basin at around this time79. Alternatively, changes to internal ice sheet dynamics, potentially driven by the effects of sea-level rise and/or atmospheric or ocean warming, could also have altered the calving regime through facilitating different rifting patterns and calving frequencies.

Regime transitions in iceberg calving from modern Antarctic ice shelves currently represent some of the largest uncertainties in sea-level rise projections, yet very few examples of complete ice shelf loss have been observed, and humanity is yet to witness the longer-timescale equilibration of an ice sheet to the loss of its ice shelves8. Our observations document that such a regime transition occurred previously in the North Sea, with the style of ice shelf calving shifting from the full thickness calving of tabular icebergs to the rapid calving of numerous smaller ice blocks as the BIIS's ice shelves disintegrated—an event that coincided with the collapse of the BIIS's marine-based sectors. The scarce number of ice shelf collapse events that have been documented in the satellite era suggests that similar transitions in iceberg calving regime are often associated with rapid ice shelf loss4,8.

Such events represent a mere blink of an eye in the long-term lifecycle of an ice sheet and its corresponding sedimentary legacy. Consequently, advances in the resolution and precision of chronological constraints in the North Sea are presently required to decipher whether ice shelf loss triggered the collapse of the marine sectors of the BIIS, or whether disintegration was merely a symptom of wider ice sheet losses that were already underway when its ice shelves collapsed. However, the impacts of such a shift were likely far longer-lasting and more substantial than the duration of the event itself, especially in the case of the relatively flat-bedded areas of the former BIIS. This is because recent work has highlighted how ice shelf thinning, iceberg calving and/or sea-level rise can trigger pulses of very rapid grounding line retreat at rates of at least 2 km yr-1 80,81, and potentially up to 600 m day -1 82, across relatively shallow-gradient ( < 0.1°) beds after ice contact with stabilizing topographic high points is lost. As much of the regional gradient of the isostatically rebounded central North Sea also falls below this threshold60, it is possible that similarly high rates of ice retreat were promoted across the central North Sea as the grounding line unpinned from the rim of the Witch Ground Basin in response to ice shelf disintegration. The North Sea ice shelves documented here may therefore have played a significant role in promoting the stability of the BIIS in response to early deglacial warming. Given that extensive areas of the contemporary Antarctic Ice Sheet are grounded on similarly low or retrograde gradient beds83, further assessment of how the transition in calving regime and subsequent loss of ice shelves documented by our data preconditioned, or even triggered, the demise of the BIIS may provide crucial insights on future sea-level rise trajectories from the Earth's remaining ice sheets.

We examined the morphology of the former North Sea seafloor using high-resolution 3D (HR3D) seismic data, which reveal intricate morphological structures of glacial origin that cannot be resolved using conventional 3D seismic methods84,85,86. Seven HR3D seismic datasets were examined in the central North Sea (Fig. 1a) covering a combined area of ~67 km2. The data were acquired using two 1200 m-long streamers towed 3 m beneath the sea surface with 96 hydrophone groups at 12.5 m spacing with a response that varied by <±0.5 dB over frequencies between 2–500 Hz, a 6.25 m shot interval and a 1-ms sample rate87. The seismic source was two 160-inch3 sleeve airgun clusters with a 20–250 Hz effective frequency band. Data processing included swell noise attenuation, tide correction, multiple suppression, two passes of velocity analysis run at 250 × 250  m intervals, normal moveout correction and bandpass filtering. The final processed datasets consist of time migrated 3D stacks with a 1 ms sample rate, a 6.25 × 6.25 m bin size, a vertical resolution of ~4 m, and a detection limit along individual reflectors of ~0.5 m84,88. Palaeo-seafloor morphology was examined using sequential horizontal timeslices from the HR3D seismic volumes in S&P Global Kingdom software. Each former seafloor was digitized in 3D as an individual seismic horizon. The mapped seismic horizons were converted from two-way travel time (TWT) to depth using a sound velocity of 1850 m s−1 89.

Multibeam bathymetric data from the Weddell Sea were acquired from RV Polarstern with a 15.5 kHz ATLAS Hydrosweep DS3 system during cruise PS96 in 2015–201666,90. Data were gridded at a 25 m resolution, and iceberg ploughmarks on the seafloor were mapped in ArcGIS software.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Use Edits, Instagram's New CapCut Clone for Editing Videos","https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-instagram-edits-capcut-clone/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

In January, Meta announced its stand-alone video editing app for making Reels, simply called Edits. After release delays, users anywhere in the world can now download the app and try it out.

The new video-creation tool is clearly inspired by the success of ByteDance's similar CapCut app for TikTok, with tools dedicated to streamlined editing of vertical clips. Instagram's Reels feed of algorithmically selected clips was launched five years ago, also in direct response to TikTok's expanding influence at the time. Meta has never shied away from its mimetic tendencies; the company tends to adopt the buzzy software features of other apps by building those same features into its platforms. So, Edits, a creator-focused tool that makes it even easier to pump out social videos, is an unsurprising release designed to keep pace with competition.

Are you interested in getting started with Edits from Meta? I've been exploring the app since it dropped earlier this week. Here's what you need to know about Instagram's video-editing tool, how it generates Reels, as well as how Edits differs from CapCut.

The Edits app is now available to download on both Apple and Android phones. After you first open Edits on your phone, you will be required to log into the app using an Instagram account, which is frustrating but not shocking. Again, Meta's purpose for the app is not to spur video creation in the abstract; rather, it's a tool specifically made to help people make content to post on Reels.

You can capture videos up to 10 minutes in length directly in the Edits app.

In the Projects tab, you can see all of your recorded videos, and you can upload videos from your phone's camera roll.

After logging in, you'll see five tabs along the bottom of the app. On the left is the Ideas tab. Here is where you can jot down notes and brainstorm ideas for future Reels, and also watch over your saved videos from Instagram. Next is the Inspiration tab that shows a scrollable feed of videos that use trending audio tracks, plus a button that makes it easy for you to snatch one of those songs and use it in your own video. The middle tab is where all of your in-progress video Projects are located, and this is also the tab where you can upload any clips already stored on your camera roll that you want to turn into Reels. The Recording tab is next along the bottom, where you can shoot videos directly inside of the Edits app. Lastly, on the far right is the Insights tab, which shows engagement data, so you can learn who's watched your past Reels.

The Inspiration tab plays Reels that use trending songs and gives you a quick way to make your own video with a popular song.

The Ideas tab is like a scrapbook for things you want to incorporate into new Reels.

Insights is where you get your stats.

You don't need to have experience with TikTok's CapCut to get the hang of Edits, although those familiar with existing tools for editing vertical videos will immediately recognize most of this user interface: a timeline of clips in the middle with various tools along the bottom. You can adjust the video's sound by adding a music clip through “Audio” or tapping on “Voice” to record a voice-over. Here you can also add text, stickers, and image overlays to your video creation. If you're looking at the timeline of uploaded videos for a project, short-tap on an individual clip in the timeline and move the edges inward to crop its length. Want to try a different clip order? Long-press on a clip and drag it to shuffle everything up.

You can search for songs to use or add songs you've saved on Instagram proper.

Linear editing works much like it does in other video editing apps made for touchscreens.

Done and ready to post? Tap Export in the top right corner to download the video to your phone. The app will present buttons to share it directly to Instagram or Facebook, but really, since you just downloaded the video, you can post it anywhere you'd like.

While the purposes of these two apps are almost identical, there are a few key differences between Meta's Edits apps for Instagram and ByteDance's CapCut app for TikTok. Mainly, Edits is more streamlined and doesn't feel as cluttered—at least for now. There's no subscription option in Edits to unlock extra features, which is the case with CapCut, though Meta could add subscription tiers to Edits in the future. There's also not an overwhelming amount of AI-powered editing tools in Edits, which CapCut definitely has, although those could potentially be added at a later date.

Edits is initially more approachable as an app, but picky creators may find CapCut's additional options for video editing gives them a more fine-tuned level of control over the final product. Also, if you want to edit videos on a computer, rather than sitting on your smartphone all evening, you'll want to stick with CapCut—Edits is only available on mobile devices.

You can clip out specific objects or people in videos and isolate them.

There's an automated captioning feature for videos with speech.

There are multiple languages and styles available for captions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","‘Who Is Doge?' Has Become a Metaphysical Question","https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-mystery-general-services-administration/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:27:21 GMT","

On March 20, Stephen Ehikian, acting administrator of the General Services Administration, was asked a seemingly simple question during an all-hands meeting with staff: Who from the GSA worked for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency? To Ehikian, the answer was far from straightforward. “D-O-G-E?” he asked, according to a video obtained by WIRED and sources with firsthand knowledge of the meeting. “You're talking about DOGE?” Then he clarified: “There is no DOGE team inside of GSA.

“I've never seen a leader lose credibility in real time before,” says a current GSA employee. “It was like the ‘plummeting' sound in a cartoon. We all see the team there. There's an entire section of the building blocked off where they work.”

The GSA, which manages federal office buildings and IT, was an early DOGE target, with Musk-linked individuals swiftly infiltrating the agency after Trump took office. As the team began working out of the GSA headquarters in Washington, DC, the agency ramped up its physical security. A section of the sixth floor, which had previously stood open, was blocked by a guard and a door, which now requires a key card to enter. That is where Ehikian and the DOGE team work, according to current staff members.

In fact, at least a half dozen DOGE affiliates, including Musk's top lieutenant Steve Davis and former Palantir intern Akash Bobba, are currently listed in the GSA employee directory and have GSA email addresses. All are tied directly to the administrator's office, at the highest level of the GSA org chart. Two additional names with ties to Musk-owned companies recently appeared in the directory as well: Dave Malcher, who previously worked at SpaceX, and Raj Jegannathan, VP of information security and internal apps at Tesla. These names, and their association with the GSA, have not been previously reported.

The GSA and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

The ambiguity around who is and is not DOGE starts with the fact that there are in fact two DOGEs: the repurposed US Digital Service, now known as the US DOGE Service, and a temporary organization within the US DOGE Service called, naturally, the US DOGE Service Temporary Organization, which is tasked with carrying out the DOGE agenda. In some cases, DOGE affiliates are hired directly into federal agencies. In other cases, they are detailed to those agencies temporarily.

Since Donald Trump retook the White House in January, people with ties to Elon Musk or his companies have popped up all over the federal government. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer, now leads the Technology Transformation Services. Michael Grimes, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley who helped finance the Twitter deal, is now a senior adviser at the Commerce Department. Even Ehikian, while not a DOGE employee, is married to a former designer at Musk's social media company X and has taken up the mantle of cost-cutting, targeting 50 percent reductions in spend across the GSA. All appear to be carrying out Trump's DOGE agenda, although they do not work for DOGE directly.

The question of who DOGE is has taken on an almost metaphysical quality as the organization's mandate has expanded. According to Trump's January 20 executive order establishing DOGE, every federal agency is required to create a DOGE team of at least four employees. (Ehikan's claim that there is no DOGE team at the GSA may be technically true, but if so, the agency would seem to be in violation of the order.)

Those teams—some members of which are career civil servants and certainly not DOGE employees of any description—were originally tasked with carrying out DOGE's stated mission to make the government more efficient. But subsequent orders, including a March 20 order to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, and data silos, have massively widened the scope of DOGE's work, leading one set of plaintiffs to allege that “‘waste, fraud, and abuse' are not magic words, and they cannot conjure up a need to grant DOGE Team members on-demand access to Americans' most sensitive and personal information,” according to a lawsuit filed by the AFL-CIO and other labor groups.

All of this means that the line between who is working for DOGE and who is enthusiastically doing DOGE is blurry at best.

Take DOGE affiliate and former Tesla employee Riley Sennott, who according to a recent Business Insider report was listed as a “senior adviser” at NASA and also appeared to work for the GSA. Sennott was listed as an “IT specialist” GS-15 employee on the GSA's payroll at the time, WIRED confirmed. Sennott's journalist father, Charles Sennott, published a column later that month in the Columbia Journalism Review explicitly stating that his son works at the GSA—not DOGE. “It is fair to say that Riley's current work is part of a broad effort that the public has come to know as DOGE,” the elder Sennott wrote—but also argued that “the General Services Administration is not the same as Elon Musk's self-proclaimed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.”

A number of other high-profile DOGE team members, including Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, Ethan Shaotran, Nicole Hollander, Jeremy Lewin, Luke Farritor, Kyle Schutt, Nathan Cavanaugh, Justin Aimonetti, and Ashley Boizelle, were listed on the GSA payroll at the time Ehikian made his comments at the March 20 all hands, according to documents viewed by WIRED. (Coristine, Shaotran, Hollander, and Farritor are listed as having salaries of $0, while the others collect from $120,000 to more than $150,000 annually.) Sara Sami, the president of an HR consultancy serving federal agencies, says this doesn't necessarily confirm that they work within the agency, since the GSA processes payroll for other agencies and committees. “They could be classified as DOGE employees, but their pay could be run through the GSA,” she says. GSA employees can also be detailed to other agencies.

Still, GSA employees say they see DOGE affiliates in the office every week. WIRED has confirmed sightings of Coristine, Shaotran, Farritor, Cavanaugh, Gavin Kliger, and Marko Elez over the past few months.

“They're young tech bros walking around together,” says a current GSA employee. “It's obvious who they are,” agrees another.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Real Winners of the Trump Memecoin Feeding Frenzy","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-memecoin-dinner-winners/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:30:11 GMT","

On Wednesday, the team behind the official Donald Trump memecoin sparked a trading frenzy after announcing that the investors who held the largest amount of the crypto coin in the coming weeks would be invited to a gala dinner attended by the US president.

“At this intimate private dinner, hear first-hand president Trump talk about the future of crypto [sic],” reads the listing on the TRUMP coin website. “The most exclusive invitation in the world. Only for the top 220 $TRUMP meme coin holders.” The dinner is set to take place on May 22.

Traders rushed to buy up the TRUMP coin, some trying to bump themselves onto the invite list and others simply hoping to profit, according to analysis by blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Within an hour, its price had surged by almost 60 percent.

However, for the two organizations that own 80 percent of the coin's supply—CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, offshoots of a conglomerate owned by Trump—the market price was a secondary concern. In the immediate term, those firms profit primarily based on how frequently people trade it.

When Trump announced his memecoin in January, the two organizations funneled 10 percent of the total supply into a so-called liquidity pool, the purpose of which is to ensure the asset can be traded freely. In return for supplying liquidity and promising to buy and sell the coin as trades come in—known as market making—the Trump-affilitated organizations command a fee. That fee ranges from 0.1 to 10 percent of each trade depending on the present level of demand. Think of it like surge pricing on a ride-hailing app.

“If you have a coin and you control the market making and the fees generated, what you care about is volume and price movement, not price itself,” says Nathan van der Heyden, head of business development at crypto company Aragon.

Previously, Trump-affilitated entities have reportedly earned tens of millions of dollars in trading fees in connection with the TRUMP coin. In the 24 hours following the dinner announcement, $1.6 million in fees were collected by contributors to the TRUMP liquidity pool on Meteora, the exchange through which the token was originally launched. Most of that money will have accrued to CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight as the largest contributors to the pool, based on previous reports.

On paper, the Trump-affilitated organizations also stand to gain by any appreciation in the price of TRUMP, as they are by far the largest holders. But in practice, they are prevented from selling their stash of coins, partly by a mechanism that limits access to their holdings for a three-year period, and partly by the prospect of a backlash resulting from the inevitable drop in price caused by any large sales.

“The optics of profiting from selling your own coin are terrible, while profiting from the market making is opaque enough to protect your reputation,” says van der Heyden.

Meanwhile, anyone who bought into TRUMP as the price surged on Wednesday risks ending up out of pocket. Jockeying for a seat at the gala dinner is a powerful incentive to buy. Once that goes away the price of the Trump coin is likely to fall, analysts say, even if the possibility of future dinners and other perks for owners of the coin might temper any dropoff.

“Very likely there would be a slump afterwards,” says crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis.

Even as the price of TRUMP rose after the announcement, sophisticated crypto investors with a track record of profitability—so-called smart money traders—sold their stakes in the coin, according to Nansen. “Smart money isn't interested in the TRUMP token, I can tell you that,” says Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at Nansen.

When Trump first announced his memecoin, days before the inauguration, critics accused the incoming president of embarking on a money-grab at the expense of his regular supporters. Others worried that the coin could act as a vector for bribery; by investing large sums into the coin, driving up its price, politically motivated actors could in theory curry favor with the president surreptitiously.

The dinner gambit—an apparent attempt to sell access to the sitting president and manufacture a surge in trading—represents the potential culmination of those fears. The largest holders that have put themselves forward for the dinner are listed in a leaderboard on the TRUMP coin website, but their identities are concealed behind alphanumeric crypto wallet addresses.

The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

“Crypto industry insiders have pretty much fully understood that Trump's understanding of crypto is extremely superficial,” claims van der Heyden. “He only cares because he sees potential personal gains.”

Netflix just introduced a new way to experience subtitles that eliminates the need to read audio cues like “door slams” or “phone rings.” 

Announced on Thursday, Netflix's new dialogue-only subtitles can be enabled by going to “Navigate to Audio” and then “Subtitles.” Users will see an option labeled “English” instead of “English (CC),” indicating that it'll only include spoken words.

This option complements the existing closed captions (CC) that cater to the deaf and hard of hearing community, which include both spoken dialogue and important audio cues such as sound effects and music indicators.

The dialogue-only subtitles, however, offer a streamlined alternative, displaying only dialogue without the additional context. 

This new option is a response to the growing popularity of subtitles. According to Netflix, nearly half of all viewing hours in the U.S. are spent with subtitles turned on. 

Dialogue-only subtitles are now available for the new season of “You” and will soon appear on other new Netflix original titles in every language the streaming service offers.

Facebook will begin lowering the reach of accounts sharing spammy content and making them ineligible for monetization, Meta announced on Thursday. The company is also increasing efforts to remove Facebook accounts that coordinate fake engagement and impersonate others, it says. 

The move comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised a return to “OG Facebook.” The social network's plan to crack down on spammy content could be seen as an attempt to return to Facebook's glory days when users' feeds were filled with authentic content from real people. 

Meta admits that some accounts on its platform try to game the algorithm to increase views or gain unfair monetization advantages, which results in spammy content flooding users' feeds. To remedy this, it's cracking down on accounts that exhibit certain types of spammy behavior.

This type of behavior includes accounts that share content with long captions alongside an excessive number of hashtags. It also includes accounts that post content with captions that are unrelated to the content, such as an image of a dog with a caption about airplane facts.

Meta says that while the intention behind these sorts of posts isn't always malicious, it does lead to spammy content that ends up overshadowing original content from creators.

Facebook will also target spam networks that create hundreds of networks to share the same spammy content, making them ineligible for monetization. 

The crackdown on spammy content comes as AI slop is becoming a serious problem across social media platforms, including Facebook. The company told TechCrunch that its crackdown is not targeting AI slop directly, but notes that accounts engaging in spammy behavior while also sharing that type of content will be impacted. Facebook says it's aware of the concerns around AI slop cluttering users' feeds and says it will address the issue as part of its broader focus on improving users' feeds.

As part of today's announcement, Facebook also said that it will reduce the reach and visibility of comments that it detects as fake engagement. Plus, Facebook will start testing a comments feature that will allow users to signal which comments are irrelevant or don't fit in the context of the conversation. 

In addition, Facebook announced that it's updating its comment management tool to detect and auto-hide comments from people who may be using a fake identity. Creators will also be able to report impersonators in the comments. 

Today's announcement comes a few weeks after Facebook introduced a revamped “Friends” tab that will only showcase updates from friends, without any other recommended content. Both the new Friends tab and the crackdown on spammy content show that Facebook is trying to improve users' feeds and show them content that they actually want to see.

It's not a surprise that Facebook is looking to return to “OG Facebook,” especially since recently uncovered emails from 2022 showed that Zuckerberg was concerned that the social network was losing cultural relevance.

In an ongoing antitrust case, the Federal Trade Commission says that Meta has a monopoly on “personal social networking services” and should have to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.

Throughout the proceedings, there have been several internal messages and plans that have come to light. In one, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered wiping all Facebook users' connections to rekindle their love for the platform. And while this idea didn't come to fruition, it shows the amount of power Zuckerberg wields at the wheel of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

Chess.com reaches a new membership milestone as it nears its 20th birthday.

Chess.com, the online chess platform that was founded in 2005 and launched in 2007, has surpassed 200 million members. Of those 200 million members, 1.5 million are paying users. More than 6 million games of chess are played every day on the platform.

“[Chess has] got this durability to it,” Albert Cheng, the chief growth officer at Chess.com told TechCrunch. “It's been played for over 1,500 years, which is just amazing. And even Chess.com is not a brand new company. It's been around for almost 20 years. It feels really dynamic.”

The company has expanded a lot since its roots as an online forum for IRL chess players to discuss their matches. Chess.com now offers full chess matches against other people or bots, daily games and puzzles, news about the chess world, the ability to stream chess competitions, and more.

Cheng credits the company's continued product innovation as one of the reasons it has seen strong and sustained growth. For example, the company released an AI game review feature in 2021 — yes, there is always an AI angle — that uses AI to summarize how a player did in a game and to flag potential improvements. He added that the majority of new users on Chess.com are beginners, and while the platform is designed for players of all levels, such features can help foster a love for the game for these new members. 

The company has also been able to ride the increased interest in chess over the past few years. Chess, along with many other games, gained a lot of popularity during the pandemic as people looked for online ways to entertain themselves through COVID-19 lockdowns. In response, Chess.com had to bulk up its infrastructure to be able to support the new demand.

Netflix's chess-focused miniseries, “The Queen's Gambit,” further fueled interest when it was released in 2020. Since then, numerous events have sparked new interest in the game. In 2022, the chess world was rocked by a cheating scandal involving five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen. Competitive chess will also be featured in the Esports World Cup for the first time this year.

The game has also gotten increasingly global, Cheng said, with around 85% of new user registrations coming from outside the U.S. The current grand master, Gukesh Dommaraju, hails from India.

Cheng — the former head of product, growth, and monetization at Grammarly and Duolingo — added that he seems to hear of a new “high-profile” chess player every day and cited the recent chess match between F1 racing stars Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc playing online chess against each other.

“I think the sky's the limit here, and the more that we can continue to grow the game by leveraging that organic interest that already exists in these adjacent communities, we'd be foolish not to explore it,” Cheng said. “So I'm really excited by those opportunities.”

AI that understands construction blueprints

Puneet and I (Roop) founded Bild AI to tackle the mess that is blueprint reading, cost estimation, and permit applications in construction. It's a tough technical problem that requires the newest CV and AI approaches, and we're impact-driven to make building more efficient — from multi-family houses and hospitals to data centers and airports. Backed by Khosla Ventures.

Bild AI is an early-stage startup with a ton of really difficult technical challenges to solve. We're building blueprint understanding with a model-garden approach, so there is a lots of ground to break. We raised from the top VCs in the world before demo day and have a customer-obsessed approach to product development.

(Btw, we used to be called Infinity AI and did a Show HN under that name last year: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41467704.)Unlike existing avatar video chat platforms like HeyGen, Tolan, or Apple Memoji filters, we do not require training custom models, rigging a character ahead of time, or having a human drive the avatar. Our tech allows users to create and immediately video-call a custom character by uploading a single image. The character image can be any style - from photorealistic to cartoons, paintings, and more.To achieve this demo, we had to do the following (among other things! but these were the hardest):1. Training a fast DiT model. To make our video generation fast, we had to both design a model that made the right trade-offs between speed and quality, and use standard distillation approaches. We first trained a custom video diffusion transformer (DiT) from scratch that achieves excellent lip and facial expression sync to audio. To further optimize the model for speed, we applied teacher-student distillation. The distilled model achieves 25fps video generation at 256-px resolution. Purpose-built transformer ASICs will eventually allow us to stream our video model at 4k resolution.2. Solving the infinite video problem. Most video DiT models (Sora, Runway, Kling) generate 5-second chunks. They can iteratively extend it by another 5sec by feeding the end of the 1st chunk into the start of the 2nd in an autoregressive manner. Unfortunately the models experience quality degradation after multiple extensions due to accumulation of generation errors. We developed a temporal consistency preservation technique that maintains visual coherence across long sequences. Our technique significantly reduces artifact accumulation and allows us to generate indefinitely-long videos.3. A complex streaming architecture with minimal latency. Enabling an end-to-end avatar zoom call requires several building blocks, including voice transcription, LLM inference, and text-to-speech generation in addition to video generation. We use Deepgram as our AI voice partner. Modal as the end-to-end compute platform. And Daily.co and Pipecat to help build a parallel processing pipeline that orchestrates everything via continuously streaming chunks. Our system achieves end-to-end latency of 3-6 seconds from user input to avatar response. Our target is <2 second latency.More technical details here: https://lemonslice.com/live/technical-report.Current limitations that we want to solve include: (1) enabling whole-body and background motions (we're training a next-gen model for this), (2) reducing delays and improving resolution (purpose-built ASICs will help), (3) training a model on dyadic conversations so that avatars learn to listen naturally, and (4) allowing the character to “see you” and respond to what they see to create a more natural and engaging conversation.We believe that generative video will usher in a new media type centered around interactivity: TV shows, movies, ads, and online courses will stop and talk to us. Our entertainment will be a mixture of passive and active experiences depending on what we're in the mood for.

I am sure they will have open source solutions for fully-generated real-time video within the next year. We also plan to provide an API for our solution at some point.

How does voice work? You mentioned Deepgram. Does it mean you do Speech-to-Text-to-Speech?

The key technical unlock was getting the model to generate a video faster than real-time. This allows us to stream video directly to the user. We do this by recursively generating the video, always using the last few frames of the previous output to condition the next output. We have some tricks to make sure the video stays relatively stable even with recursion.

I do not think they are running in real time though. From the website: ""Personal RTX 4090 generates at speed 2.5 seconds/frame (unoptimized) or 1.5 seconds/frame (teacache)."" That means it would take them 37.5s to generate 1 second of video, which is fast for video but way slower than real time.

I mostly meant the using the previous frames to generate new frames insight that reminded me but lack knowledge on the specifics of the workglad if its useful for your work/research to check out the paperedit: the real-time-ness of it also has to have into equation what HW are you running your model on, obviously easier to make so on a H100 than a 3090, but these memory optimizations really help to make these models usable at all for local stuff, which is a great win i think for overall adoption/further stuff being build upon them a bit like sd-webui from automatic1111 alongside stable diffusion weights models being open sourced was a boom on image gen a couple years back

And yes, exactly. In between each character interaction we need to do speech-to-text, LLM, text-to-speech, and then our video model. All of it happens in a continuously streaming pipeline.

Considering how Carrie Bradshaw doesn't give a damn about technology ecosystems in her later years (she uses a MacBook Pro and dual wields an iPhone and BlackBerry Key2 in the Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That), I'd say there's a good chance she'd rock these Motorola Moto Buds Loop in “Pantone-curated French Oak” with Swarovski crystals.

If not for the bling embedded in each open-ear wireless earbud, she'd probably wear AirPods like every basic bitch walking around Manhattan. She definitely wouldn't be caught wearing the non-Swarovski version of the Moto Buds Loop that come in “Pantone-curated Trekking Green” aka forest green.

I don't blame you if you've never heard of open-ear wireless earbuds. They're kind of a recent trend. Instead of the buds sitting snuggly inside of your ears, pumping sound straight into your ear canal, the Buds Loop clip onto your ears like oversized earrings and gently beam audio into them. They're basically the same style earbuds as the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds. Unsurprisingly, the sound itself is engineered by Bose. Needless to say, there's a lot more audio leakage compared to traditional wireless earbuds. The upside to an open-ear designs is that you can hear your surroundings without needing to turn on any transparency/ambient modes. A klutz like Carrie would appreciate this given her penchant to not pay attention to what's happening in the streets.

The Swarovski special edition is no doubt aimed at fashion-conscious consumers. I wasn't about to get an ear infection trying them out at Motorola's packed media pre-briefing so I can't speak to how they sound. But in case you're not turned off by the shininess and you're curious about tech specs, here's what Motorola has shared. They have 12mm “ironless drivers,” feature spatial sound for multi-directional audio, and battery life is up to 8 hours with a single charge and up to 37 hours with the case. And because you gotta throw in some AI support these days, Motorola says the buds can also do stuff like read you AI-summaries of your notifications, though you do need a compatible Motorola phone with Moto AI built-in.

I asked Motorola for pricing and release date on the Buds Loop (including the Swarovski version), and was told by a PR representative that they'll share that information “closer to availability.” Hopefully the regular models are competitively priced with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, which retail for $300. The Swarovski model—that's gonna cost a pretty penny for sure!

A 9.5x reticle size SiP on a massive substrate.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


You might often think of processors as being relatively small, but TSMC is developing a version of its CoWoS technology that will enable its partners to build multi-chiplet assemblies that will be 9.5-reticle sized (7,885 mm^2) and will rely on 120×150 mm substrates (18,000 mm^2), which is slightly larger than the size of a CD case. TSMC claims these behemoths could offer up to 40 times the performance of a standard processor. 

Virtually all modern high-performance data center-grade processors use multi-chiplet designs, and as demands for performance increase, developers want to integrate even more silicon into their products. 

In an effort to meet demand, TSMC is enhancing its packaging capabilities to support significantly larger chip assemblies for high-performance computing and AI applications. At its North American Technology Symposium, TSMC unveiled its new 3DFabric roadmap, which aims to scale interposer sizes well beyond current limits.



Currently, TSMC CoWoS offers chip packaging solutions that enable interposer sizes of up to 2831 mm^2, which is approximately 3.3 times larger than the company's reticle (photomask) size limit (858 mm^2 per EUV standard, with TSMC using 830 mm^2). This capacity is already utilized by products like AMD's Instinct MI300X accelerators and Nvidia's B200 GPUs, which combine two large logic chiplets for compute with eight stacks of HBM3 or HBM3E memory. But that's not enough for future applications.



Sometimes next year, or a bit later, TSMC plans to introduce the next generation of its CoWoS-L packaging technology, which will support interposers measuring up to 4,719 mm^2, roughly 5.5 times larger than the standard reticle area. The package will accommodate up to 12 stacks of high-bandwidth memory and will require a larger substrate measuring 100×100 mm (10,000 mm^2). The company expects that solutions built on this generation of packaging will deliver more than three and a half times the compute performance of current designs. While this solution may be enough for Nvidia's Rubin GPUs with 12 HBM4 stacks, processors that will offer more compute horsepower will require even more silicon.

Looking further ahead, TSMC intends to scale this packaging approach even more aggressively. The company plans to offer interposers with an area of up to 7,885 mm^2, approximately 9.5 times the photomask limit, mounted on a 120×150 mm substrate (for context, a standard CD jewel case measures approximately 142×125 mm). 

This represents an increase from an 8x-reticle-sized multi-chiplet assembly on a 120×120mm substrate that TSMC presented last year, and this increase likely reflects the requests from the foundry's customers. Such a package is expected to support four 3D stacked systems-on-integrated chips (SoICs, e.g., an N2/A16 die stacked on top of an N3 logic die), twelve HBM4 memory stacks, and additional input/output dies (I/O Die).



However, TSMC has customers who demand extreme performance and are willing to pay for it. For them, TSMC offers its System-on-Wafer (SoW-X) technology, which enables wafer-level integration. For now, only Cerebras and Tesla use wafer-level integration for their WFE and Dojo processors for AI, but TSMC believes there will be customers beyond these two companies with similar requirements.

Without a doubt, 9.5-reticle-sized or wafer-sized processors are hard to build and assemble. But these multi-chiplet solutions require high-current kilowatt-level power delivery, and this is getting harder for server makers and chip developers, so it needs to be addressed at the system level. At its 2025 Technology Symposium, TSMC outlined a power delivery strategy designed to enable efficient and scalable power delivery at kilowatt-class levels.



To address processors with kilowatt-class power requirements, TSMC wants to integrate monolithic power management ICs (PMICs) with TSVs made on TSMC's N16 FinFET technology and on-wafer inductors directly into CoWoS-L packages with RDL interposers, enabling power routing through the substrate itself. This reduces distance between power sources and active dies, lowering parasitic resistance and improving system-wide power integrity.



TSMC claims that its N16-based PMIC can easily handle fine-grained voltage control for dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) at the required current levels, achieving up to five times higher power delivery density compared to conventional approaches. In addition, embedded deep trench capacitors (eDTC/DTC), built directly into the interposer or silicon substrate, provide high-density decoupling (up to 2,500 nF/mm^2) to improve power stability by filtering voltage fluctuations close to the die and ensure reliable operation even under rapid workload changes. This embedded approach enables effective DVS and improved transient response, both of which are critical for managing power efficiency in complex, multi-core, or multi-die designs.

In general, TSMC's power delivery approach reflects a shift toward system-level co-optimization, where power delivery to silicon is treated as an integral part of the silicon, packaging, and system design, not a separate feature of each component.

The move to much larger interposer sizes will have consequences for system design, particularly in terms of packaging form factors. The planned 100×100 mm substrate is close to the physical limits of the OAM 2.0 form factor, which measures 102×165 mm. The subsequent 120×150 mm substrate will exceed these dimensions, likely requiring new standards for module packaging and board layout to accommodate the increased size.

Beyond physical constraints and power consumption, these huge multi-chiplet SiPs generate an enormous amount of heat. To address this, hardware manufacturers are already exploring advanced cooling methods, including direct liquid cooling (a technology already adopted by Nvidia for its GB200/GB300 NVL72 designs) and immersion cooling technologies, to handle the thermal loads associated with multi-kilowatt processors. However, TSMC can't address that problem on the chip or SiP level — at least for now.

The selection of patients, duration of therapy, and combination with other drug categories are key factors in optimizing antibiotic use for acne vulgaris, helping to minimize their contribution to the global issue of antimicrobial resistance. This topic was discussed at The World Congress of Pediatric Dermatology (WCPD) 2025 Annual Meeting, held recently in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Topical and systemic antibiotics are crucial components of acne treatment due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Since acne is the eighth most common disease worldwide, affecting 85% of adolescents, it's no surprise that dermatologists are the primary prescribers of these drugs. In an electronic poll during the session, three quarters of the attending professionals reported prescribing antibiotics for acne.

However, recent studies have shown a concerning rise in resistant strains of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes), a bacterium responsible for acne development. It has also been identified as a pathogenic factor in other nondermatologic diseases, such as sarcoidosis, endophthalmitis, joint prosthesis infections, prostate cancer, and postoperative infections. The use of antibiotics for acne may also disrupt gut microbiota and is linked to Streptococcus pyogenes colonization and resistance in the oropharynx.

“Now is the time to reconsider our approach! Whenever possible, we should select nonantibiotic therapies for acne,” said Patricia Troielli, MD, dermatology expert, advisor to the Acne Committee of the Argentine Society of Dermatology, and former vice president of the Ibero-Latin American College of Dermatology. She acknowledged that many of her colleagues feel nonantibiotic alternatives are less effective.

Troielli advocated for a multimodal approach, combining topical and oral treatments with procedures. She suggested starting with topical retinoids or fixed combinations (benzoyl peroxide plus adapalene, trifarotene, or tazarotene), as well as using moisturizing dermocosmetics, which can improve results when used alongside medical therapy. Other real-world alternatives to antibiotics include isotretinoin, spironolactone (for female patients only), photodynamic therapy, and lasers.

Marimar Sáez-de-Ocariz, MD, pediatric dermatologist at Hospital Ángeles del Pedregal in Mexico City, Mexico, emphasized that “antibiotics remain a valuable treatment option, with strong evidence supporting their effectiveness in inflammatory acne.” She stressed that the key is adhering to proper prescribing practices.

What are the three key factors for optimal use of topical or systemic antibiotic therapy for acne? Sáez-de-Ocariz answered Medscape's Spanish edition:

“Antibiotics should only be prescribed for inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), not for comedones,” Sáez-de-Ocariz emphasized. According to a 2023 network meta-analysis of 204 clinical studies, the most effective treatment for inflammatory lesions is oral isotretinoin, followed by topical antibiotics combined with azelaic acid, oral antibiotics plus retinoids, and benzoyl peroxide combined with topical antibiotics or retinoids.

Topical antibiotics are recommended as first-line treatment for mild to moderate inflammatory acne. She highlighted four scenarios where oral antibiotics should be considered: Moderate to severe inflammatory acne, failure of topical treatments (after 8-12 weeks), acne on extensive areas (such as the face, chest, and back), and the risk of scarring (eg, tendency to form scars or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation).

However, antibiotics should not be prescribed if there is a history of previous treatment failure with the same medication. “A thorough patient history is essential. If a patient has had inflammatory acne treated with antibiotics two or three times, even if it's my first time seeing them, we should consider escalating treatment to isotretinoin or, for female patients, spironolactone or contraceptives,” Sáez de Ocariz explained.

Although studies show that monotherapy with topical and oral antibiotics is as effective as retinoids for inflammatory lesions, “all guidelines recommend using antibiotics in combination with other drugs to mitigate the risk of bacterial resistance,” Sáez-de-Ocariz stressed. For example, topical antibiotics can be combined with benzoyl peroxide or retinoids. The 2024 updated guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology recommend concomitant use of benzoyl peroxide with oral antibiotics as part of best practices to reduce antibiotic resistance and limit the duration of systemic exposure to antibiotics.

However, one practice to avoid is combining topical antibiotics (eg, clindamycin) with systemic antibiotics (eg, doxycycline). “This is inappropriate, and unfortunately, it happens, even within our profession. While it's not common, it does occur,” she noted.

Sáez-de-Ocariz added that systemic antibiotics should generally be prescribed for 3-6 months on the basis of clinical response, though guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology suggest even shorter durations, ie, between 3 and 4 months. The guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, London, England, recommend an initial evaluation after 12 weeks. For oral antibiotics, treatment may continue alongside topical therapy for another 12 weeks when lesions have improved but have not completely resolved. Other guidelines set a strict maximum of 3 months to prevent microbial resistance.

She emphasized the importance of planning and respecting the duration of oral antibiotic treatment, clearly communicating this to patients, and ensuring they comply with the accompanying topical regimen. “It's necessary to tell the patient that the antibiotic treatment is only for the prescribed duration. Sometimes they don't want to stop, or they feel better after using the systemic treatment but neglect the topical retinoid. When they stop the systemic antibiotic, they relapse and blame the discontinuation of the antibiotics,” Sáez-de-Ocariz explained to Medscape's Spanish edition.

Troielli disclosed being a speaker and member of the Acne Advisory Board for Eucerin and Beiersdorf, as well as a speaker and researcher for L'Oréal and La Roche-Posay. Sáez-de-Ocariz declared having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

 April 24, 2025  

Despite increased participation in long-distance running races in the United States, the rate of cardiac arrests among runners remains stable, but survival has improved dramatically, according to the RACER 2 study.

Almost 30 million people who finished a marathon or half-marathon between 2010 and 2023 were identified for the study, conducted by Jonathan Kim, MD, cardiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, and his colleagues. In their RACER 1 study, the team assessed cardiac arrests in roughly 10 million people who finished a marathon from 2000 to 2009.

So with race participation almost tripling over the past two decades, changes in runner demographics, and improved emergency action plans, the team decided it was time to revisit the issue, Kim explained during his presentation of the RACER 2 results at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Session 2025 in Chicago, which were simultaneously published in JAMA.

In both studies, the incidence of cardiac arrest was about the same: Roughly one in 200,000 people. But the fatality rate decreased significantly between RACER 1 and RACER 2, from 71% to just 34%. In RACER 2, the risk for death in men was about one in 100,000. For women, the risk is much lower, at about one in 500,000. Risk was also higher in full marathons than in half-marathons.

Over the years, “the incidence of cardiac arrest has remained relatively stable, apart from a slight unexplained rise after 2020, but despite that, the risk for death has markedly declined, by close to 50%. We believe this is due to continued enhancements in the emergency action plans,” which are focused on immediate access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), said Kim.

In RACER 1, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was the biggest predictor of survival, but just 58% of runners received it. In RACER 2, that had risen to 100%, and race organizers were ensuring access to more AEDs. In RACER 1, the highest risk for a cardiac arrest was at the end of the race, so by the time RACER 2 was conducted, organizers had learned to strategically position more defibrillators near the finish line.

This highlights the importance of preparation and training for race organizers, said Benjamin Levine, MD, sports cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, which is a major take-home message of the recent scientific statement on the care of competitive athletes with cardiac abnormalities, issued jointly by the ACC and the American Heart Association, which both he and Kim worked on.

“All of us in the sports cardiology world want to prevent death, but you can't do it with screening alone,” Levine explained. “If you want to prevent deaths in sports, you've got to have an emergency action plan, you've got to have an AED, and you have to practice with it.”

Over time, there has also been a change in the causes of cardiac arrests, when they were identified. In RACER 1, the most common cause was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whereas in RACER 2, coronary artery disease took the top spot.

The reason for that change is unclear and should be taken with a grain of salt, given that good clinical information was not available for all of the incidents. “Nevertheless, I think the etiology has shifted in recent decades,” said Levine. And although coronary artery disease was the most common cause of death in RACER 2, it is also the cardiac arrest with the highest survival rate.

The risk is there, but incidents remain rare, and there is a lot that runners can do to reduce their own risk.

“For older runners, in particular, it's important to pay attention to symptoms and ensure your risk factors are as much under control as possible,” Levine said. “And discuss it with your doctor if your personal risk is higher.”

Kim and Levine had no disclosures to report.

Ischemic stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide, with narrowing of the carotid artery due to atherosclerosis contributing to up to 30% of all cases. For decades, medical practitioners have primarily relied on the degree of carotid narrowing (stenosis) to assess the risk of stroke and determine the best treatment options. However, mounting evidence suggests that this approach may be insufficient for patients with mild but symptomatic carotid stenosis.

Despite being classified as 'low-risk' due to having less than 50% carotid artery narrowing, a significant number of patients with mild carotid stenosis continue to experience recurrent ischemic events, even when receiving appropriate medical therapy. This implies that factors beyond the degree of stenosis may play a crucial role in determining stroke risk for this patient population.

To address this gap, a team including Lecturer Daina Kashiwazaki and Dr. Satoshi Kuroda from Toyama University, Japan, aimed to tackle this knowledge gap via their 'Mild but Unstable Stenosis of Internal Carotid Artery (MUSIC)' study. This multicenter prospective cohort study, which was published online on February 21, 2025, in the Journal of Neurosurgery, investigated the clinical features, radiological findings, and treatment outcomes of patients with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis.

The researchers enrolled 124 patients who had experienced cerebrovascular or retinal ischemic events ipsilateral (same side) to mild carotid stenosis. While all participants received the best medical therapy (BMT) for their condition, carotid endarterectomy (CEA)-the surgical removal of plaque-or carotid artery stenting (CAS) was performed in 63 patients. Patients were followed up for two years, with the primary endpoint being the occurrence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke.

The findings were quite striking: approximately 81% of patients had radiologically unstable plaque, with 59.5% exhibiting intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). This type of plaque composition was associated with a significantly higher risk of both primary and secondary endpoints, the latter of which included ocular symptoms, any type of stroke, and plaque progression requiring CEA. Additionally, the incidence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke was markedly higher in the group receiving only BMT compared to those who also underwent CEA (15.1% vs. 1.7%). ""The distinctive clinical and radiological features in high-risk patients strongly indicate that plaque composition, namely IPH, but not degree of stenosis, plays a key role in subsequent ischemic events in patients with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis,"" explains Kashiwazaki.

This study challenges current medical guidelines, which typically do not recommend CEA for patients with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis. The results demonstrated that CEA significantly reduced the incidence of both primary and secondary endpoints during the two-year follow-up period, with CEA emerging as a protective factor and IPH as a risk factor for recurrent events. Moreover, it is also particularly noteworthy that approximately half of the study participants had been receiving antithrombotic therapy prior to enrollment but still experienced cerebrovascular or ocular events. This suggests that certain patients with mild carotid stenosis may be resistant to conservative medical therapy alone, calling for more proactive interventions.

Overall, the implications of this study could fundamentally alter how physicians approach stroke prevention. ""In the very near future, the evaluation of plaque composition will be an essential examination to predict the risk of further events and to determine treatment strategies in each patient with symptomatic mild carotid stenosis,"" notes Kashiwazaki. In this way, by shifting focus from stenosis degree to plaque composition, clinicians may be able to better identify high-risk patients who would benefit from surgical intervention. With any luck, this revised approach could potentially reduce stroke incidence and improve outcomes for a previously underrecognized at-risk population.

This research underscores the need for personalized stroke prevention strategies that go beyond measuring stenosis severity alone.

The Biothreats Emergence, Analysis and Communications Network (BEACON) leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) and a network of globally based experts to rapidly collect, analyze, and disseminate information on emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, animals, and the environment. BEACON Director, Dr. Nahid Bhadelia remarks, ""BEACON comes at a time when we need more global collaboration and coordination when new biological threats appear. The platform not only reports new threats but also provides background and reasons for why a threat matters and where it should fall on our ranking of concern.""

BEACON is housed at Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases and operated in partnership with the Hariri Institute for Computing and Data Sciences at Boston University and HealthMap at Boston Children's Hospital. 

The launch of BEACON represents an exciting evolution in the field of infectious disease surveillance. By integrating HealthMap's decades-long experience in real-time epidemic monitoring with BEACON's novel AI-driven architecture, we're creating a uniquely powerful, open-source tool for rapid detection and contextualization of emerging threats.""

Dr. John Brownstein, Chief Innovation Officer at Boston Children's Hospital and a BEACON Co-Director

At its launch, BEACON will be the only open-source global surveillance platform of its kind, linking public health authorities, practitioners, researchers, and the general public, rapidly and transparently sharing data and context about new threats. Like early warning systems for fires and hurricanes, BEACON's job is to analyze and broadcast the rise of new threats. By providing near real time reports of sentinel cases, clusters and outbreaks, BEACON will enable early public health response, empower clinicians tracking recent travel and illnesses in their patients and inform communities of potential new threats. 

""BEACON is the first biothreats reporting system to leverage the power of generative AI to process and analyze outbreak reports,"" says Hariri Institute Director and a BEACON Co-Director Dr. Yannis Paschalidis. He adds, ""BEACON employs our own PandemIQ Llama LLM, specifically adapted and trained to optimize performance for outbreak analysis and report generation.""

BEACON has already received a total of $6 million in funding support, including contributions from the National Science Foundation, the Gates Foundation, additional private donors, and Boston University.

Beyond financial support, BEACON has also established partnerships with high level stakeholders in the public health space including the World Health Organization's Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources initiative, the World Organisation for Animal Health, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, state public health departments, and the CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.

The first clinical trial to test whether adults allergic to peanuts can be desensitized has shown great success with two thirds of the cohort consuming the equivalent of five peanuts without reacting.

The Grown Up Peanut Immunotherapy (GUPI) trial is the first study entirely in adults with severe allergy to test whether daily doses of peanuts taken under strict supervision can be safely tolerated.

The approach, known as oral immunotherapy, has seen success in trials in infants and children worldwide. The findings of the first trial in an exclusive adult cohort has been published today in the journal Allergy by a research team from King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. The study is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit Programme.

Constant fear of life-threatening reactions place a huge burden on people with peanut allergy. The only way to manage a peanut allergy is strict avoidance and treatment of allergic reactions, including with adrenaline. Although peanut immunotherapy is known to be effective in children, this trial provides preliminary evidence that adults can also be desensitised and that this improves quality of life. The average tolerated dose of peanuts increased 100-fold over the course of the trial.""

Professor Stephen Till, Chief Investigator, Professor of Allergy at King's College London

The Phase II trial recruited twenty-one adults between 18 and 40 with a clinical diagnosis of peanut allergy at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. Allergy was confirmed via skin prick test, blood test and then an oral food challenge.

In a clinical setting, participants received the first dose of 0.8mg peanut flour mixed in with food, then 1.5 mg 30 minutes later followed by 3mg a further 30 minutes later.

Participants who tolerated 1.5mg or 3mg of peanut flour continued on a daily dose at home for 2 weeks. This is the equivalent of 0.5-1% of a whole peanut.

Then participants returned at 2-weekly intervals for supervised doses of more peanut protein, increasing from 6mg (around 1/40th of a whole peanut) to 1g (four whole peanuts). If participants could tolerate 50-100mg of peanut protein, participants were switched to eating whole peanuts, peanut butter or peanut products, with the first dose being under supervision of the clinical team.

Once participants achieved a daily dose of 1g they remained on this dose for at least four weeks before undergoing a double‐blind placebo‐controlled food challenge. This involved being given increasing doses of either peanut or placebo (dummy) on separate days under close supervision to test their tolerance. Participants then continued daily dosing for at least three months before exiting the trial as well as the option of continuing post-study.

Results showed that 67% of participants were able to consume at least 1.4g peanut protein – the equivalent of five peanuts – without reacting. Participants of the trial then could consume peanuts every day at home to remain desensitised.

Professor Till said: ""We are very pleased with the results. The efficacy rate is broadly in line with peanut oral immunotherapy trials in children. The next stage of the research will be confirming this in larger trials, and also identifying the group of adult patients who would most likely benefit from oral immunotherapy, and see whether it can lead to long-term tolerance in this age group.""

Lead author specialist Allergy Dietitian Hannah Hunter from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust said: ""Living with peanut allergy is a huge burden due to the need for constant vigilance and the risk of accidental exposures. Everyday situations such as eating in restaurants and social events are anxiety provoking and our patients tell us that the condition also affects travel choices and career options. We found that quality of life significantly improved after oral immunotherapy and fear of food also decreased. Many participants who completed the trial told us that the treatment had been life-changing and they were no longer living in fear.""

Chris, 28, took part in the trial. He was diagnosed with a peanut allergy as a baby and jumped at the chance of taking part in the trial.

He said: ""I'm so proud to have been part of this trial and so happy to say that I used to be allergic to peanuts but thanks to this trial, this is no longer a concern. Me and my family were always anxious that even a trace of peanut could be life-threatening. The trial was an interesting experience because all of my life I had associated the taste and smell of peanuts with fear and death. I started with a small amount of peanut flour with yoghurt and by the end of the trial I could eat four peanuts in one sitting. Now, I have four peanuts every day with my breakfast to maintain my immunity. Before, a tiny mistake could have life-threatening impacts but now I don't have the fear that I might collapse and die from eating a takeaway.""

The couple aims to support the growth of women's soccer, with Lauren also stepping in as an advisor and ambassador for the NWSL club.

Associated Press

Celtics guard Jrue Holiday and his wife Lauren Holiday have invested in the Courage through their Holiday Family Trust.

CARY, N.C. (AP) — Former U.S. women's national team star Lauren Holiday and husband Jrue Holiday of the Boston Celtics have joined the ownership group of the North Carolina Courage in the National Women's Soccer League.

Lauren Holiday was on the U.S. teams that won the 2015 Women's World Cup and gold medals in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.

Jrue Holiday is a two-time NBA champion and two-time All-Star who has also played for the Philadelphia 76ers, the New Orleans Pelicans and the Milwaukee Bucks. He has a pair of Olympic gold medals as well.

The two have invested in the Courage through their Holiday Family Trust, the team announced Wednesday. Lauren Holiday will serve as an advisor and ambassador for the NWSL club.

“This club represents the future of women's soccer — not just in how we play the game, but in how we empower athletes, connect with communities, and build a sustainable future for the sport,” Lauren Holiday said in a statement. “I believe deeply in the mission and vision of the Courage, and I'm excited to contribute in meaningful ways — especially when it comes to player development and overall culture.”

Lauren Holiday retired from soccer in 2016. While pregnant with the couple's first child, she was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor. Shortly after the birth of her daughter, she underwent surgery and Jrue Holiday took a leave of absence to care for her and their child.

The NWSL has an annual award, the Lauren Holiday Impact Award, which honors players for contributions to their local communities.

Jrue Holiday becomes the first 3-time winner of the award, which honors on- and off-court leadership.

Bam Adebayo, Harrison Barnes, CJ McCollum, Chris Boucher and Jrue Holiday are the finalists for 2024-25.

Mauricio Pochettino is under fire from former USMNT and current MLS team San Jose Eartquakes coach Bruce Arena, who questioned if the Argentine is the right man to lead the Stars and Stripes.

U.S. Soccer hired Pochettino back in September to develop a talented U.S. men's national team into a real contender ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Despite getting off to a winning start, the Stars and Stripes under the Argentine have once again failed to impress.

The USMNT suffered a shocking 1–0 defeat to Panama in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and then lost a third-place match to Canada just three days later. The two poor results prompted harsh criticism from USMNT greats Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, and now Arena is joining in the conversation surrounding Pochettino's early leadership. 

""You know if you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach,"" Arena said on an episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan & Tim Howard. 

""And I think when you have coaches that don't know our culture, our environment, our players, it's hard. I'm sure our coach is a very good coach, but coaching international football is different than club football, it's a completely different job.""

Pochettino is not the first non-American to coach the USMNT. German Jurgen Klinsmann was in charge of the Stars and Stripes from 2011 to 2016 and led the team to a second-place finish in a group with Germany, Portugal and Ghana at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. There was also Serbian Bora Milutinović, who got the team to the round of 16 at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. 

Pochettino, though, has no previous experience coaching a national team. The 53-year-old spent his entire career coaching at the club level throughout Europe, most notably at Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain.

""And I think when you're a national team coach, you need to know your environment, you need to know the animals you coach, and we're lacking that,"" Arena continued. ""If you're an American coaching the U.S. team, you know the culture, you know the pride and how important the national team is. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it, especially in our country, because we're so different.""

Arena knows what it takes to coach the USMNT on the biggest stage in soccer. The American previously led the USMNT to the quarterfinals at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team's best performance since 1930. It is clear that he, along with plenty of other critics, are unsatisfied with the current state of the USMNT, especially for a squad often heralded as the country's ""golden generation.""

""You ask me if we lacked pride, I'm watching and I'm shocked. I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada,"" Arena said. ""I don't want to be disrespectful. I want them to do great in the World Cup, there's no question about it. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they got to get going.""

Before the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the USMNT must first compete in the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer, where they will hope to put in a better performance than their disappointing Concacaf Nations League campaign.

The team's main goal, though, remains on the 2026 FIFA World Cup, unfolding on home soil.

While it's no secret that the United States men's national team have been in less than ideal form recently, losing their last two matches to Panama and Canada during Concacaf Nations League play, former USMNT manager Bruce Arena isn't happy with the appointment of coach Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine was appointed in August of 2024 to lead the United States to the 2026 World Cup after Gregg Berhalter crashed out of the Copa America during the group stage, but so far, fortunes haven't changed for the Red, White, and Blue.

On the ""Unfiltered Soccer"" podcast hosted by Tim Howard and Landon Donovan, Arena talked about Pochettino's need to learn the culture while taking over the USMNT.

""You know if you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach,"" Arena said. ""And I think when you have coaches that don't know our culture, our environment, our players, it's hard. I'm sure our coach is a very good coach, but coaching international football is different than club football. It's a completely different job.

""If you ask me if we lack pride, well, I'm watching and I'm shocked. I'm shocked we can't beat Panama and Canada. It was shocking to me.""  

Call it What You Want: A twice weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.

While this is Pochettino's first international role after managing Chelsea in the Premier League, part of why only domestic coaches usually manage international teams is that only eight nations have ever won the World Cup --  Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina, France, Uruguay, England, and Spain. Every other nation is looking to catch up to those sides, and it has been one of the reasons why Argentine managers are more prevalent than ever, given the success of their international sides and club teams managed by them.

""And I think when you're a national team coach, you need to know your environment, you need to know the animals you coach, and we're lacking that. If you're an American coaching the U.S. team, you know the culture,"" Arena continued. ""You know the pride and how important the national team is. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it, especially in our country, because we're so different.""

The players do need to fight for the badge, but both players like Tyler Adams and Pochettino himself have called the team out. Similar concerns came up in the past when Jürgen Klinsmann was bringing in dual-national players, and it was claimed that some of them didn't care about the badge as much as those born in the United States. As soccer has continued to grow in the United States, it has only become more likely to add dual-national players, and they've become some of the most talented players on this roster.

Antonee Robinson, Sergino Dest, Yunus Musah, and Folarin Balogun have all switched allegiances to represent the USMNT and become some of the most critical players on the roster. This has been a rough period for the USMNT, and they've earned some of the criticism coming their way, but it only makes the upcoming Gold Cup more important. This is a team that is expected to win every Concacaf competition in sight, and if they aren't doing that, the criticism will only continue to mount ahead of a critical World Cup on home soil.

La Liga giants Real Madrid have on Thursday announced a heavy injury blow in the club's first-team ranks.

This comes amid confirmation that Eduardo Camavinga suffered a serious setback during Real's most recent outing.

Los Blancos marked their return to action on Wednesday, making the short trip to the Estadio Coliseum for a La Liga meeting with Getafe.

The aforementioned Camavinga was for his part introduced off the bench at the interval, replacing David Alaba.

En route to an eventual 1-0 victory for the visitors on the evening, however, the France international was too forced into a premature departure from proceedings.

After a heavy challenge in the middle of the park, Camavinga could immediately be seen to be in serious pain, hooked by Carlo Ancelotti despite his best efforts to run the problem off.

And a day on, confirmation of the nature of the 22-year-old's injury has been provided.

As per a statement across Real Madrid's website and social media platforms:

‘Following tests carried out today on Eduardo Camavinga by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a complete tear of the tendon in his left abductor muscle. His recovery will be assessed.'

Camavinga medical report.

As confirmed by several reliable sources in the time since, Camavinga is facing up to a spell of several months on the sidelines, ruling him out for the remainder of the current campaign, as well as the upcoming Club World Cup.

Kevin De Bruyne will not extend his stay at Manchester City to play at the Club World Cup this summer. De Bruyne's contract is due to expire at the end of June - midway through the summer tournament.

The Belgian's 10-year stint at the Etihad Stadium is coming to an end, with his exit coming as a surprise to some - including De Bruyne himself. He delivered a pointed assessment of the club chiefs, questioning the decision to let him leave, and doubt is being cast on his Club World Cup involvement.

As revealed by the Daily Star Sport, De Bruyne is reluctant to play and risk an injury which might hamper his chance of finding a new club, and is also unhappy with how his imminent departure was handled. He will be obliged to travel to the US for the start of the tournament in mid-June, with his contract not expiring until the 30th, but is said to hope the club will understand his situation when he holds further talks.

Teams involved in the Club World Cup are permitted to seek special dispensation to continue using players in situations like that faced by De Bruyne. There have also been changes made to Premier League transfer rules, with teams permitted to sign players between June 1-10 before the window opens in earnest later that month.

City manager Pep Guardiola recognised the situation facing De Bruyne is a complex one. He said the decision will need to be made by the 33-year-old after discussions with the club, and no such decision has been made at the time of writing, but if he doesn't play at the Club World Cup then his final City game will be the last game of the Premier League season on May 25 against Fulham.

“I think he has to decide, he has to talk, because now with the World Cup, it's a new contract, legally, you know,"" Guardiola said in early April. “If he can continue playing football in another place, it depends on the risk, playing there for the contracts, or injuries, or the future. So, honestly, I don't know. I think the club has to talk to him, or he has to say what he wants to do.”

City's Club World Cup campaign begins against Moroccan side Wydad on June 18, nearly a month after the final Premier League match of the season. Their group is completed by Al Ain and Juventus, with all three group games scheduled for before the end of June.

""It was Txiki [Begiristain] and Ferran [Soriano] who told me,"" De Bruyne said, referencing the club's outgoing sporting director and current CEO respectively. He said he didn't feel awkward about the pair being nearby as he explained the situation, but did say he felt he can still deliver at the highest level.

""In the end it is what it is,"" he continued. ""You have to accept people taking decisions. I told them also that I still think I had a lot to give. Obviously I know I'm not 25 anymore but I feel like I'm doing my job.

“It came as a bit of a shock. I'm open for anything (including staying in the Premier League). I have to look at the whole picture, sporting, the family, everything together, what makes the most sense for my family.

""I don't know what it is. It depends on when you speak to people about projects and things. I know I can play at a good level. I have to make that decision once I really know more (of the offers).""

Clubs in Europe, Saudi Arabia and the United States are understood to be keen on signing De Bruyne on a free transfer. Inter Miami hold the player's discovery rights if he does choose to move to Major League Soccer, though this doesn't necessarily mean he'll end up with the Florida club.

GREENSBORO, N.C. — Greensboro and UNC-Greensboro will become the home of a Brazilian soccer team over the summer as part of the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup, according to the university.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will run from June 14 to July 13 in 11 cities across the United States, including Charlotte. The tournament will consist of 32 of the top teams from each of the six international confederations — AFC, CAF, Concacaf, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA.

Greensboro will host SE Palmeiras, one of the most popular club teams in Brazil. The city will act as a place for the team to ""spend most of their time during the Group Stage of the Tournament, along with their delegations, media and fans.""

“We have long since owned our Tournament Town title, but this honor puts us at a completely different level,” Greensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan said in a statement. “Greensboro is now officially part of the world's most popular sport. This is not just an economic win  — it elevates our status as a premier host for sporting events at levels we've never experienced.”

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is the official lead-up to the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. FIFA previously announced that Greensboro is also being considered a base camp for that tournament.

“Greensboro has a rich history in youth and amateur soccer over many years,” says Richard Beard, President of the Greensboro Sports Foundation. “Hosting a team for the 2025 Club World Cup adds to our stellar resume hosting major soccer events. The international exposure World Cup Soccer brings to Greensboro is unmatched in any sports event held worldwide.”

Bank of America Stadium will host the following four matches in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup:

In addition to training in Greensboro, SE Palmerias also plans to launch a ""comprehensive community program for the local neighborhood."" Starting on June 6, Greensboro will host free community-focused activities at Smith Soccer Complex ""aimed at introducing the club and its history to local people.""","{'href': 'https://www.wfmynews2.com', 'title': 'wfmynews2.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid managed three crucial points against Getafe on April 23 in the La Liga title race. However, it came with a setback. Midfielder Eduardo Camavinga had to leave the field with an injury near the end of the game, and it's bad news for Carlo Ancelotti.

Camavinga replaced David Alaba at half-time after the Austrian picked up an injury. However, Camavinga could not continue the game as he was seen limping off the field late in the game.

Real Madrid have published a medical report, and he has been diagnosed with a complete tear of the tendon in his left abductor muscle. The Frenchman will undergo further tests, but reports suggest he will be out for the foreseeable.

Journalist Arancha Rodríguez reported that Camavinga will be out for at least three months. This means he will miss the remainder of the season and the FIFA Club World Cup.

🚨 Camavinga's next game will be in mid August, when La Liga 2025/26 will start. @carlitosonda pic.twitter.com/H2ee98Gb7x

The 22-year-old has been used as a left-back in big games, as has Alaba. If Ferland Mendy is not ready against Barcelona, Fran Garcia will play in the Copa del Rey final.

It also means the Frenchman is not an option in midfield for the final La Liga matches. Luckily for Ancelotti, Dani Ceballos has returned, but he still has limited options.

Cameron Norrie saved a match point and battled through illness to beat Spanish youngster Martin Landaluce in the opening round of the Madrid Open.

Norrie has struggled for form over the last year, slipping to 91 in the world, and the former British No 1 had not won an ATP Tour match since Indian Wells in early March.

He was clearly not at his best physically against 19-year-old Landaluce but used his experience to secure a 6-7 (4) 7-5 6-4 victory.

Norrie revealed afterwards he has been struggling with sickness, telling Sky Sports: ""It's terrible timing but at least I have another day tomorrow to rest. Hopefully it will pass pretty quickly.""

An up-and-down match saw Norrie lose five games in a row from 3-0 up in the opening set and then fight back from 3-0 down in the second before Landaluce narrowly missed a big forehand on match point at 4-5.

Norrie took his opportunity to force a deciding set and a wild game from his young opponent at 4-4 proved the difference.

""It's maybe one of my favourite wins,"" said Norrie, who next faces 26th seed Jiri Lehecka. ""I was feeling absolutely terrible, I wasn't sure I was going to play, I had no energy, didn't sleep at all last night.

""I started very low energy, sleeping on the court still. I had to create my own energy. He actually played really well, I know he's a really good player, so I had to fight every point.""

Norrie's section of the draw has opened up because of the withdrawal earlier on Thursday of second seed Carlos Alcaraz, who needed treatment for a leg injury in his Barcelona Open final defeat by Holger Rune on Sunday and has not recovered sufficiently.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



Alcaraz told a press conference: ""I'm really disappointed that I'm not able to play here in Madrid, it's a place that I love playing, in front of my people.

""It was a really difficult situation, really difficult to decide, but it is what it is. You have to hear your body sometimes. I will come back stronger.""

In the women's draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek gained revenge for her shock Miami Open loss to Filipino teenager Alexandra Eala.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



It was another difficult encounter for the Pole, though, with 19-year-old Eala leading by a set and a break before Swiatek fought back to win 4-6 6-4 6-2.

There was a shock loss for Stuttgart champion Jelena Ostapenko, who extended her head-to-head advantage against Swiatek to 6-0 on her way to the title in Germany on Monday.

Ostapenko fell at the first hurdle in the Spanish capital to fellow Latvian Anastasija Sevastova, who is making her second comeback in three years following maternity leave and a serious knee injury.

Carlos Alcaraz is officially out of the Madrid Open.

The Spaniard confirmed on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the tournament due to both the abductor injury that hampered him in the Barcelona Open final, and a separate issue – also believed to be an abductor – in his left leg.

Alcaraz is a two-time Madrid Open champion and reached the quarter-final of the event back in 2024, ultimately losing to eventual champion Andrey Rublev in three sets.

His withdrawal is set to have a significant impact on the ATP Rankings, with both Alexander Zverev and the absent Jannik Sinner in line to benefit from the Spaniard's withdrawal.

Having reached the last eight in 2024, Alcaraz had 200 ranking points to defend heading into 2025.

Now unable to defend those points, the 21-year-old will fall from 8,050 points to 7,850 points once the tournament is over.

Alcaraz is guaranteed to stay as the world No 3, with world No 4 Taylor Fritz only able to hit a maximum of 5,715 points with a hypothetical run to the title.

However, he will now be unable to close the gap to world No 1 Sinner – and could lose further ground in his battle with world No 2 Alexander Zverev.

Having briefly fallen to world No 3 post-Monte Carlo, Zverev returned to world No 2 this week following his triumph in Munich – with Alcaraz unable to lift the title in Barcelona.

Now, the 28-year-old has been handed the chance to build his cushion over Alcaraz with a strong run in Madrid.

Heading into the tournament, Alcaraz was only 35 points off Zverev's haul of 8,085 ranking points.

However, the German already had a slight advantage heading into action inside the Caja Magica, with only 100 points to defend after a fourth-round exit in 2024.

Currently earning just 10 points, Zverev is projected to fall to 7,995 points in the ATP Live Rankings.

However, the German is yet to compete in Madrid and could be primed for a significant surge, potentially leading Alcaraz by over 1,000 points once the tournament is over.

Should top seed Zverev lift the title in Madrid, he would surge to 8,985 ranking points, a hypothetical lead of 1,135 points over the Spaniard.

Though the German would then have to defend 1,000 points as the reigning Italian Open champion, it would give him a significant cushion over Alcaraz in the race to be seeded second at Roland Garros.

Zverev was the Madrid Open champion in 2018 and 2021, meaning a deep run would not come as a surprise in the slightest.

Carlos Alcaraz confirms double injury blow as he makes Madrid decision

What Joao Fonseca had to say about playing against Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros

Sinner's three-month suspension from the ATP Tour has largely been defined by both Alcaraz and Zverev failing to put pressure on his world No 1 ranking.

And, with Alcaraz out of Madrid, he has been handed another significant advantage.

A quarter-finalist in Madrid twelve months ago, Sinner will drop 200 points to 9,730 when the rankings update post-tournament.

However, with Alcaraz also dropping the same number of points, that means the current gap of 1,880 points between the two will remain.

That is of huge significance for Sinner, who has no points to defend at the Italian Open following his 2024 withdrawal and fewer points to defend at Roland Garros than reigning champion Alcaraz.

With the Spaniard also having no Italian Open points to defend, but a staggering 2,000 points at Roland Garros, he cannot overtake Sinner as the world No 1 this clay swing.

And, as Zverev has Rome champion and Roland Garros finalist points to defend, Sinner is mathematically guaranteed to still be world No 1 once the second Grand Slam of 2025 is complete in early June.

Having risen to the top of the ATP Rankings after the French Open in 2024, that ensures that the Italian will have reigned as world No 1 for a whole calendar year.

He will become just the fifth man in ATP Rankings history to reign for 52+ weeks in his first spell as No 1, and just the 10th to spend 52+ consecutive weeks overall.

Carlos Alcaraz will miss the 2025 Madrid Open due to injury and there are also major doubts over his participation in the Italian Open as he is struggling with two different injuries.

The Spaniard picked up an adductor muscle injury during his straight-set Barcelona Open final defeat to Holger Rune on Sunday.

Alcaraz revealed after the match that he first felt the tweak during the second set and he requested a medical timeout for treatment, but re-emerged to finish the encounter.

During the post-match press conference, he admitted that the past few weeks had taken its toll as he had played 10 matches in just over two weeks as his Barcelona performance was preceded by a title run at the Monte Carlo Masters.

The four-time Grand Slam winner underwent tests after the ATP 500 final and had high hopes of competing at this week's ATP Masters event in the Spanish capital.

On Monday he stated: “Physically I feel good. I have undergone tests, and we will see what the results say. I am used to playing with discomfort; hopefully, I can enjoy Madrid.”

But he cancelled training on Wednesday and he confirmed his withdrawal from the Madrid Open during a press conference on Thursday.

Besides struggling with an adductor muscle problem, Alcaraz also revealed he has a hamstring injury.

“During the Barcelona final, I hurt the adductor muscle in my right leg, but I also felt something in the hamstring of my left leg,” he stated.

“We've tried everything to improve, but it hasn't been possible. We've discussed with the team whether I could play safely, but we have to listen to our bodies.”

And while he is hopeful of playing at the Italian Open, which gets underway in early May, he admits it's not a certainty as he would rather focus on being fully fit for the French Open.

“I expect to go back to court and start practising in a couple of weeks. Rome is still a possibility, but for sure I'll be in Paris,” the world No 3 added.

“It's not an easy decision because Madrid is the first tournament I have ever been to as a young kid, it's the most special place for me to play.

“But (prioritising Roland Garros) was a big part of my decision to stop and recover properly.”

Alcaraz was the second seed at the Madrid Open and he was due to face either Zizou Bergs or Yoshihito Nishioka in the second round.

After winning back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023, the two-time champion lost in the quarter-final against Andrey Rublev last year.

Novak Djokovic makes feelings clear on criticism Carlos Alcaraz has faced

ATP Rankings: How many points are Sinner, Zverev, Alcaraz, Djokovic, Rublev dropping in Madrid?

He will drop 200 ranking points once he officially withdraws, meaning he will lose further ground to Alexander Zverev in the battle for second place in the ATP Rankings.

After returning to No 2 after his Monte Carlo title run, Alcaraz dropped back to No 3 on Monday after Zverev won the BMW Open in Munich.

Jannik Sinner remains comfortably clear at No 1 on 9,730 points in the Live Rankings while Zverev is on 7,995 and Alcaraz on 7,860 (before his withdrawal), but the German has the chance to earn more points with a deep run in Madrid this week.


                Novak Djokovic was asked if Carlos Alcaraz is playing tennis to match the game's all-time great and his response will raise eyebrows.

Joao Fonseca made a sparkling return to the Mutua Madrid Open on Thursday when he raced past Denmark's Elmer Moller 6-2, 6-3 to set a second-round clash against 11th seed Tommy Paul.



Playing his first match of the European clay swing and one year on from becoming the youngest match winner in tournament history, the Brazilian seemed more than comfortable in the spotlight of Manolo Santana Stadium, capturing his 10th tour-level win of the season.

“I love playing on clay. I was born on the clay, so I like to play on it, even with altitude. I like to focus on my serves and play aggressive, so feeling good this week,” said the 18-year-old, whose most recent outing was a third-round run in Miami. “Me and my team felt it was a time to rest a little bit, focus, be at home, rest mentally. Then come here to do the clay season. Very happy with this win today.”

Fonseca adopted a deep return position against Moller's first delivery, but stepped up to the baseline on second serves, zeroing in on aggressive returns. The teenager absorbed Moller's booming backhand and redirected the ball with his own firepower, rushing the Dane from the baseline.

The No. 65 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fonseca created 13 break chances, converting four, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Fonseca, who won his maiden tour-level title on the Buenos Aires clay in February, did not face a break point.



Against Paul, Fonseca will aim for his third Top 20 victory this season. He beat World No. 9 Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and No. 20 Ugo Humbert in Miami.



Moller, 21, won last week's Oeiras Challenger before qualifying for the ATP Masters 1000 event.





Fonseca's fellow #NextGenATP teen Martin Landaluce was also in action, but suffered a defeat to Cameron Norrie. The Briton saved a match point on serve in the second set and used that momentum to rally towards a 6-7(4), 7-5, 6-4 victory.

American Marcos Giron won a topsy-turvy clash against 19-year-old countryman Learner Tien 6-1, 1-6, 7-6(4). Tien served for the match at 5-4 in the decider before the 31-year-old mounted a comeback, finishing the two-hour, seven-minute battle.



Lucky loser Gabriel Diallo raced past Zizou Bergs 6-1, 6-2 in just 57 minutes while Chilean Nicolas Jarry ousted German qualifier Daniel Altmaier 6-3, 6-2. Luciano Darderi was a 6-4, 6-4 winner against Quentin Halys. Lorenzo Sonego downed Miomir Kecmanovic 6-4, 7-6(5), improving to 4-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Novak Djokovic is making his return to clay after being eliminated in his opening match in Monte Carlo a fortnight ago. There, the Serb played a catastrophic match against Alejandro Tabilo (6-3, 6-4) and even apologised for his poor performance in a press conference.

In Madrid, a tournament he has won three times (2011, 2016, 2019) and from which he has been absent since 2022, Djokovic isn't necessarily focused on lifting the trophy again. As in recent years, Djokovic – and coach Andy Murray – is aiming for top form at Grand Slams, which next means the French Open in a month's time (25 May – 8 June).

“At the moment, I'm looking for my best level, with a view to Roland-Garros,” he said. “I don't have a lot of expectations in terms of results here, to be honest, but I'm very excited about playing at the Caja Magica again. I feel a lot of positive energy and I hope to use it to play well.”

At the age of 37, Novak Djokovic has seen his greatest rivals retire in turn. In order, Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal have said goodbye to the world of professional tennis. The Serb is still here, ready to pester the new generation and keep the old one alive.

“Obviously when the three of my biggest rivals retired, you know, you can feel there's a shift, not only in terms of the generations of players that are kind of now, all of a sudden, the main focus and attention is on them. But it's just, you know, I guess it takes a little bit of time for people to accept the fact that Roger and Rafa are not playing, and Murray, and I guess one day myself, but I'm still trying to stay there and represent the older guys, the older generation. “

Djokovic is still in search of his 100th title on the Tour, which passed him by in Miami a few weeks ago, when he was beaten by Jakub Mensik in the final. More than anything, he wants to see his sport flourish and attract even more interest.

“That's also one of the reasons why I keep on playing is because I feel like it also helps tennis still thrive on the attention and crowd coming in and watching tournaments and getting interested. If you see the numbers actually of the attendance in the Grand Slams as well and some, like Indian Wells, it's record-breaking crowd in the last few years.”

In his first match at the Caja Magica, Djokovic will take on Matteo Arnaldi, ranked 44th in the world, an opponent he has never faced in his career.

Carlos Alcaraz is confident he will be ready to defend his French Open title next month after pulling out of the Madrid Open because of a hamstring injury sustained last week in Barcelona.

“I don't want to get ahead of myself, I don't want to take anything for granted, but I think we'll be confident for Roland Garros and we're going to try to be in Rome,” said Alcaraz.

After a strong start to the clay court season with his first Monte Carlo title, Alcaraz struggled with a right adductor injury during his defeat by Holger Rune in the Barcelona final on Sunday. Despite being in Madrid this week to promote the release of his new Netflix docuseries, Alcaraz was absent from the practice courts in the first four days of the tournament.

On Thursday, he confirmed his withdrawal, explaining that medical tests after the Barcelona final had further revealed a hamstring injury in his left leg.

“I also noticed an issue in my left leg when I had tests on Tuesday,” said Alcaraz. “I've been waiting, talking with my team, with the doctors, to see if I'd be able to play in good condition and without a job here in Madrid. I've done everything possible, everything in my power to make that happen, but things haven't improved As you all suspected, because I can't train these days for the final in Barcelona, I have to work on my adductor and right leg, but much over the last few days.”

Despite his frustration, Alcaraz believes his hamstring injury is not as severe as the right arm injury that forced him to withdraw during the Madrid Open last season and affected him up until the French Open last year.

“I'm not really worried about it,” he said. “I believe it's going to take one week, one week and a half, two weeks maximum, but I won't have doubts about coming back and moving 100% again.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Christian Horner has doubled down on his comments over Max Verstappen's Formula 1 future, insisting that the reigning four-time World Champion's focus “is here” at Red Bull Racing.

Verstappen headed into the recent Saudi Arabian Grand Prix fielding questions on his plans beyond 2025, following comments from Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko that he had “great concern” about the Dutchman's future with the operation.

Those came amid a rollercoaster start to the season for Red Bull, who have experienced the high of winning in Japan and the low of scrapping for a handful of points in Bahrain – rivals McLaren stepping forward to top both championship tables.

Verstappen has represented Red Bull Racing for almost 10 years

During the pre-weekend drivers' press conference, Verstappen brushed journalists' enquiries to one side, while Horner described it as “an awful lot of noise” and stated that “Max has made it very clear he's part of the team and we're all in it together”.

After another eventful weekend at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, where Verstappen brilliantly charged to pole position before losing out to Oscar Piastri on race day via a dramatic Turn 1 scrap, Horner was pushed for the latest on his driver's future.

Asked in his post-race media session about that “noise” rumbling on, the Red Bull team boss responded: “You said there's been a lot of noise… the noise has been out there and not in here.

The Dutchman sits third in the standings after the opening five rounds

“Max has been working very hard with the team. He's stated once again that his focus is here. He's working incredibly hard, together collectively with the rest of the team, and we're a team. We win together and we lose together – that's the way we operate.

“Our focus is on sorting the car out, [and] we've had a decent Saturday and Sunday here.”

Verstappen sits third in the Drivers' Championship heading to Round 6 of 24 in Miami, two points down on Lando Norris, and a further 10 adrift of Piastri, while Red Bull are also third in the Teams' Standings, 99 points away from leaders McLaren.

Five friends find themselves stuck in a time-loop nightmare in this offering based on the PlayStation game and penned by Blair Butler and Gary Dauberman.


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


	The premise of Until Dawn, David F. Sandberg's horror flick inspired by the video game of the same name, is promising despite its familiarity: A group of friends happen upon an abandoned residence in the middle of the woods and find themselves hunted by fatal forces of both the physical and supernatural variety. The stakes of this feature are also expectedly high: To avoid death, this crew of recognizable archetypes must outmaneuver their adversaries. And there's even a twist that fans of the PlayStation game will immediately clock. This should be a recipe for success, if a minor one, but Until Dawn doesn't really capitalize on these elements and, as a result, is erratically frightening and vaguely dissatisfying.

	Written by Blair Butler and Gary Dauberman (Annabelle, Salem's Lot), Until Dawn is the latest offering in a cinematic landscape littered with game-inspired movies. Just earlier this month Warner Bros. released A Minecraft Movie, which has, in a handful of weekends, reaped more than $700 million globally. And while Until Dawn doesn't have the same cultural popularity as the Swedish world-building game, it does have a dedicated fan base who were converted by the original game, which included voice work from Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek.

The Bottom Line

	
	More safe than scary.
	



Release date: Friday, April 25Cast: Ella Rubin, Michael Cimino, Odessa A'zion, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Maia Mitchell, Peter StormareDirector: David F. SandbergScreenwriters: Gary Dauberman, Blair Butler

									Rated R,
								1 hour 43 minutes			






	Butler and Dauberman retain the haunted mood of the survival game, which was released in 2015. But instead of tailoring the existing backstory for screen audiences, they conjure up an entirely new one premised on five friends, played by a charming set of newcomers, on a “healing” road trip through the countryside. Until Dawn still experiments with the psychological elements of fear — a big part of the original game — but in the wake of films like Smile, the conclusions feel more safe than scary. 


	It's been a year since Clover (Ella Rubin) suffered the dual loss of her mother, who passed away, and her sister, Melanie (Maia Mitchell), who disappeared soon after their mother died. In a misguided attempt to help her move through grief, Clover's friends decide to take a trip retracing Melanie's final steps. When we meet these characters, they have stopped at a rural gas station for snacks and a seance. The group includes Clover's chronically worried ex-boyfriend Max (Michael Cimino); their occult-obsessed pal Megan (Ji-young Yoo, excellent); emotionally avoidant Nina (Odessa A'zion); and Nina's new boyfriend Abe (Belmont Cameli), who can't let a moment pass without telling people that he majored in psychology. 

	











	Early scenes efficiently outline the interpersonal dynamics of the gang and build some emotional investment in their friendship. These young adults are all a little messed up, but their relationships with each other keep them anchored. That's why they are traversing the middle of nowhere with Clover, who's been despondent and, we gather, psychologically fragile since last year. 


	The action kicks off when the crew pulls up to an abandoned visitor center in Glore Valley, a fictional locale not far from the gas station. They find chilling clues during their brief snooping: Abe comes across a billboard filled with photos of missing people, including Melanie; Nina discovers a visitor log with the names of those individuals, written multiple times in increasingly scraggly script; Megan gets a bad vibe from the place, as if the spirits are trying to tell her something; and Clover swears she hears Melanie calling her from the strangely foggy wooded area. 


	Sandberg effectively calibrates the silences in these moments — letting entire sequences play out with little sound expect a creaking floorboard, a heavy breath or the turn of the page — to ratchet up the tension. When the slasher eventually appears, stealing the group's car before murdering them with a humorous bluntness, there is also a real atmosphere of dread.


	But the best parts of Until Dawn are merely blips in a film whose entire schtick gets stale fast. After the mysterious slasher, in the style of Michael Myers, kills Clover, Max, Megan, Nina and Abe, all five of them come back to life. They realize they are in a twisted game in which they are revived after dying, forced to relive the evening. The only way to escape is to survive through the night and stay alive until sunrise. With this knowledge, the friends set off to investigate this place and the strange psychologist (Peter Stormare) they encounter along the way. 

	











	Each night presents a new way of dying (stabbings, exploding limbs, axes to the head), as Sandberg borrows from slasher movies, psychological horror, monster flicks and more. While the attempt at genre homage is admirable, Until Dawn seems trapped by the tonal demands of these shifts. Sometimes the film is funny and other times it seems to aim for seriousness, leading to a confusing everything-but-the-kitchen-sink result.


	Most of Sandberg's film ends up going through the perfunctory motions of classic horror, piquing interest occasionally with a progression of impressive kills and a sharp use of practical effects. Jennifer Spence's ace production design imbues this abandoned mine town with an appropriate spookiness and, working with cinematographer Maxime Alexandre, Sandberg stages some effectively nightmarish scenes. But even those can't cover for the gaping plot holes and uneven performances that inspire more confusion about the movie's intended impact. 


	The closer these young adults get to figuring out the mystery behind their time-looped captivity, the more Until Dawn relies on visual shortcuts — at one point a character realizes they have been trapped for 13 nights even though audiences only experience four or five nights of death — to wrap things up and leans into pat pop psychology to plump itself with meaning. How fascinating that a part of the marketing for this muddled film involved viewers repeatedly watching it for 12 hours in hopes of winning a cash prize. It's difficult to imagine a universe in which that experience would feel worth it.

The former tight end denies the assault accusation and will return to TV in time for the NFL's preseason.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Shannon Sharpe is “electing to step aside temporarily” from ESPN, he said on Thursday.


	“My statement is found here and this is the truth,” Sharpe, formerly an NFL star and now a prominent media figure, wrote and posted to social media. “The relationship in question was 100 percent consensual.”




	“At this juncture I am electing to step aside temporarily from my ESPN duties,” his statement continued. “I will be devoting this time to my family, and responding and dealing with these false and disruptive allegations set against me.”

	Sharpe said he plans to return to ESPN in time for the NFL's preseason.

	“I sincerely appreciate the overwhelming and ongoing support I have received from my family, fans, friends and colleagues,” Sharpe's statement concluded.


	“This is a serious situation, and we agree with Shannon's decision to step away,” an ESPN spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter.


	Sharpe is being sued for sexual assault by a woman who says he raped her twice in two months in her Las Vegas home last year.


	In a lawsuit filed on Sunday in Nevada state court, the Jane Doe is seeking $50 million. The lawsuit brings a claim for sexual battery, as well as one for intentional infliction of emotional distress for Sharpe's alleged verbal abuse.


	Sharpe “violently sexually assaulted and anally raped Plaintiff two different times in Las Vegas, Nevada, blatantly ignoring her requests for him to stop,” the complaint states. “He did it again in January.”


	In a statement posted on X attributed to his lawyer Lanny Davis, Sharpe named his accuser and cited text messages that he says prove that the relationship was consensual. He called the woman's suit “an egregious attempt at blackmail.”


	Sharpe and the woman met in 2023 at a Los Angeles gym, according to the complaint. They soon entered into a relationship, which included consensual sex, the lawsuit says. The sex later turned violent, it alleges. The woman says Sharpe confronted the woman, demanded she take him to her house and, once there, he forced her to perform oral sex before penetrating her.


	Three months later in January, Sharpe allegedly assaulted her a second time, the lawsuit alleges. He “grabbed her—pulling her around and positioning her to perform oral sex, which lasted for roughly two minutes,” the complaint states. “Then, Sharpe repositioned her and roughly forced himself inside her.”

	











	Sharpe has also been sued in New York state court by an ex-girlfriend, who alleges he forced her to perform oral sex.


	Last year, Sharpe inked a multiyear deal with ESPN that expanded his role on First Take, now the network's top show. See Sharpe's Thursday statement here:

The global powerhouse will be honored as Woman of the Year at the 2025 Latin Women In Music gala. 


													By
												

	Griselda Flores


Senior Editor, Latin


Selena Gomez sings and dances to the beat of her own drum in the award-winning musical thriller Emilia Pérez, starring as Jessi Del Monte, a rebellious woman on a journey of radical transformation. Her compelling performance, both raw and refreshing, unlocked a new side of the 32-year-old star on the big screen. And that's just one of her latest career milestones. In an industry that often aims to box you into categories, Gomez is a shapeshifter, constantly redefining what it means to be a global powerhouse today. In the last 12 months, Gomez, who has meticulously crafted a blueprint for her multi-hyphenate standing, garnered a Golden Globe best supporting actress nomination for Emilia Pérez; won a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in Only Murders in the Building; the LP I Said I Love You First, which she released in March with fiancé Benny Blanco, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart, becoming Gomez's fourth leader on the chart; and through her Rare Impact Fund, Gomez continues to work to increase access to mental health for young people.  

	











	Now, on April 24, she will be honored at Billboard and Telemundo's annual Latin Women in Music gala with the Woman of the Year award. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I think anytime as women we show up and support each other, it truly is so beautiful and important,” Gomez tells Billboard. “I will say being honored at Latin Women in Music is incredibly special to me though. My Mexican heritage is something that has influenced me my entire life and it's not lost on me how representation matters. Throughout the years I've been doing this, some of the most supportive women in the entertainment business I have met have been other Latin women. I love the bond we all have.”  


	Named after fellow Texan, the legendary Selena Quintanilla, Gomez — whose paternal grandparents are Mexican — catapulted to fame as a child actor in Barney & Friends at 10 years old and subsequently starred on the Disney Channel show Wizards of Waverly Place as the ultra-cool and spunky teenage wizard Alex Russo. But it's perhaps her career as a recording artist that solidified her pop icon status boasting of 42 entries on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, and seven top 10 LPs on the Billboard 200, including three leaders on that tally. While she has mainly recorded in English, Gomez has always stayed close to her roots, and recording in Spanish felt almost inevitable.  

	











	Her first big splash in Latin music came in 2019, thanks to a feature on DJ Snake's “Taki Taki,” alongside hitmakers Ozuna and Cardi B. The track debuted at No. 1 on the Hot Latin Songs chart in 2018, ruling for 13 weeks. Since then, Gomez has achieved three additional top 10 hits on the ranking, among them “Baila Conmigo,” her collaboration with Rauw Alejandro, which peaked at No. 4 on Hot Latin Songs in 2021 and topped the Latin Airplay chart for a week. That collab is part of her first-ever Spanish-language project: Revelación. It debuted at No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart, making history as the first album by a female artist to achieve the feat since Shakira's El Dorado. 


	“I never really focus on stats and charts, but when I hear something like that, all I can feel is pride. Shakira is an icon and someone I've always looked up to and I love her so much,” says Gomez. “Making a Spanish album was something I had wanted to do for a long time. Over the years, I'd release a Spanish version of one of the songs off an album but having an all-Spanish project was something that meant a lot to me. I worked hard on making sure I paid homage to my Latin roots, through the music as well as the aesthetics of all the visuals.”   


	Navigating a bicultural identity, especially one that has a double standard (you should assimilate and learn English but also be fluent in Spanish), is one that even Selena Quintanilla faced in her early days. Then, Quintanilla had to learn to speak and sing in Spanish to be accepted in Mexico.  


	Gomez recently faced similar scrutiny when critics questioned her Spanish-speaking skills on Emilia Pérez, even though she plays the role of an American who lives in Mexico and who is not meant to be fluent in the role. Gomez — who alongside her co-stars Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofía Gascón and Adriana Paz won best actress award for the ensemble cast at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival — says Emilia Pérez is a film she'll “hold dear forever.” 

	











	“I pushed myself into uncomfortable spaces which as an actress are the most rewarding. It was a magical time and working with [director] Jacques [Audiard] was one of my best experiences,” she says. “I am taking my time to find the right role and director to work with next because I want it to be a challenge and unexpected.”


	Gomez's Latin heritage is constantly present in her work. She plays Mabel Mora in Hulu's Only Murders in the Building. And in I Said I Love You First, she includes “Ojos Tristes” with The Marías, a reimagination of Jeanette's 1981 classic ballad “El Muchacho De Los Ojos Tristes.” The track entered the top five of the Hot Latin Songs chart (dated April 5).  


	“Benny and I went and saw The Marías in concert last summer. I was mesmerized by them and knew I wanted to have them on our album,” Gomez shares. “ 'El Muchacho De Los Ojos Tristes' to me is one of those cross generational songs that brings people together no matter how old you are. You either knew as an adult or something your mother or abuela listened to so it conjures up nostalgic memories. I loved seeing all the posts about the song and the feeling it reminds people of. I might have teared up a few times. I am very proud of this song.”  


	Gomez is equally proud of her work in activism as a leading voice in advocating for mental health and social justice for underrepresented communities. In 2019, she executive produced Living Undocumented, a Netflix docuseries that poignantly tackled the immigration crisis in the U.S. She has also transformed the youth mental health landscape by mobilizing over $20 million in funds with philanthropic partners across five continents.    

	











	“At the end of the day I believe it matters to be vocal about issues that matter to you, whether you are famous or not. It's not for the faint of heart, because you are putting yourself out there and trust me there will be a lot of opinions that come at you for even having the nerve to say anything at all,” Gomez says. “I remember when I decided to be open about my own personal mental health, it was scary to be that vulnerable and I didn't ever want anyone to think I am a victim. I thought [that] by sharing my own story I could help others, and I will take any negative opinions that come with that because I see the bigger picture of how the conversations have changed around mental health.” 


	Eight years after being named Billboard's Woman of the Year, Gomez's influence in music and beyond is even more tangible today, a testament to her impact and legacy. Her advice for the new generation of artists?  


	“Blocking out the noise and being true to yourself,” she says. “The noise can be overwhelming, and I am not saying it's easy but by doing that and not compromising who you are, it goes a long way.”  


The third annual Billboard Latin Women in Music special will air live at 9 p.m. ET / 8 p.m. CT on Thursday, April 24 exclusively on Telemundo, Universo, Peacock and the Telemundo app and throughout Latin America and the Caribbean on Telemundo Internacional.

The US had three collecting societies — then four, and now six. Some clubs and radio stations seem to think that's too many. And, perhaps, that any are too many.


													By
												

	Robert Levine



The PRO business is booming! But could it become a victim of its own success? 


	For the 75 years after the 1939 founding of BMI, the U.S. had three organizations that collected public performance royalties for songs on behalf of composers and publishers: ASCAP, SESAC and BMI. And for much of that time — from the 1950s, when ASCAP and BMI expanded into all genres, to 1993, when a group of investors purchased SESAC — the competition might best be described as gentlemanly. ASCAP and BMI became the Coke and Pepsi of PROs, licensing similar rights, for different songs, to similar bars, restaurants, concert venues and television and radio stations. The privately owned SESAC was less aggressive than it is now.   


	Some licensees want to set the clock back to that simpler time. They may have inspired members of Congress to ask the Copyright Office to look into the subject, which resulted in a Notice of Inquiry and then a flood of comments. (Billboard has a guide here.) To understand why, and what this means, it helps to realize how much U.S. performance rights licensing has changed in the last decade.  


	In 2013, Irving Azoff, ever the disruptor, founded GMR, which like SESAC — owned by the investment group Blackstone since 2017 — signs big songwriters with big advances. Unlike ASCAP and BMI, which are more constrained by antitrust consent decrees and allow all songwriters to join, GMR and SESAC are free to cherry-pick from the most popular. (All four have big writers; GMR and SESAC just don't have small ones.) With fewer writers, they are thought to bring in more money per performance of a song. They are also thought to be wildly profitable: A recent deal for a stake in GMR valued the company at $3.3 billion. Any business that good attracts competition, and two new PROs have emerged over the last five years: AllTrack, founded by former SESAC board member Hayden Bower; and the Florida-based PRO Music Rights.  




			Trending on Billboard		







	Things got complicated. Venues that had once received three bills for their use of music were suddenly getting five or six. Most knew they needed rights from what we might call the big four — and let's pause for a moment to consider just how weird it is that the U.S. now has more established PROs than major labels — but some weren't sure if they needed the rights controlled by AllTrack and PRO Music Rights. Costs went up — with the possibility of future increases — and let's not kid ourselves that this is the real issue here.


	Both the Notice of Inquiry and the responses to it are fascinating because, as several executives pointed out to me, this isn't an issue that the Copyright Office — or even government regulation in general — seems especially well-suited to solve. The Copyright Office administers and consults on intellectual property law, and licensees presumably see the NOI as an opening move in a push for legislation that could constrain PROs — or even empower a government body to set royalty rates, as one does for mechanical rights. That would be a disaster for publishers and songwriters, which get their only negotiating power from performing rights. And licensees have much more lobbying power than the music business, simply because every Congressional district has bars and restaurants, while the music business is relatively concentrated in a few cities.  


	What, exactly, is the problem here? Look at the NOI, which sets out two very different issues: “The number of PROs in the United States has expanded in recent years, potentially undermining licensing efficiencies” and “PROs do not all disclose comprehensive information concerning the works that are covered by their licenses, and their royalty distribution practices and policies.” The only thing these issues have in common is that neither of them is really a matter for copyright law.  


	The idea that there are too many PROs is odd because for years the issue was that ASCAP and BMI had too much market power — hence the antitrust consent decrees. In legal terms, this is known as trying to have it both ways. Competition is a good thing, as long as it's fair. If it's not, that's a matter for competition law — which traditionally champions competition! — not copyright.  


	One of the real issues behind the NOI is that it can be hard to tell which PRO controls what rights. This can be complicated, though, and the issues often have less to do with concealing information than with presenting it in an accessible way. AllTrack, which is focused on the independent market, allows potential licensees to search a database of songs to which it controls rights, but that requires looking up specific compositions. The site displays far more prominently some of the artists who play songs to which AllTrack owns at least some rights, including Billy Ray Cyrus, Elle King and No Doubt. In smaller type, underneath, it says that “The artists above are examples, but not an all inclusive list, of performers of AllTrack music” — and in most, but not all, cases it doesn't control rights to all these artists' songs, let alone their rights as songwriters. Billboard readers understand this, but it might drive the average bar owner to drink. 


	PRO Music Rights is even more controversial. It seems to focus on serving smaller songwriters in the so-called long tail, and it says it controls rights to more than 2 million works, including songs performed by A$AP Rocky, Wiz Khalifa and others. It is unclear how popular many of those songs are, though, and both the ASCAP and BMI responses to the NOI challenge its business practices more directly than those of AllTrack. In its filing, ASCAP says that in 2018 it discovered millions of songs registered by PRO Music Rights “that were apparently either computer-generated sounds or merely random titles” and BMI's response points out that Spotify in a court filing accused PRO Music Rights founder Jake Noch of flooding its platform with AI music, although the case in question subsequently settled. (PRO Music Rights filed its own response to the NOI that accuses the established PROs of engaging in “anti-competitive practices.”) 


	The other side of transparency is that it's not always clear how some PROs distribute some of the money they collect. But it seems hard to believe that licensees really worry about this — most just want to pay less — and that issue is really between PROs and creators and publishers. (Alas, Billboard advertisers seldom ask about the compensation of the publication's witty and dashing “Follow the Money” columnist.) The best way to address this — maybe the only way to address it in a lasting way — could be a competitive market. Big songwriters who think that the big PROs don't serve them well can sign with SESAC or GMR, although not all of them do. Why shouldn't smaller ones have more options as well? 


	Like every other issue in the music business, this is ultimately about money — rightsholders want to charge more and licensees want to pay less. That's business. And it seems best to keep it as business, without getting the government involved.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Willa Holland (Arrow) and Paul Sparks (House of Cards) will lead The Mortuary Assistant, a feature adaptation of the bestselling horror video game created by Brian Clarke, which is currently in production in Missouri.


	Hailing from Epic Pictures and its specialty horror label Dread, The Mortuary Assistant centers on Rebecca Owens, a recent mortuary science graduate who takes a night shift job at River Fields Mortuary. Initially, the job seems straightforward — embalming bodies, completing paperwork, and keeping things tidy. But once Rebecca starts working the night shift, things take a dark turn.

	











	Holland plays Rebecca, the young woman confronting terrifying supernatural forces, with Sparks as Raymond Delver, Rebecca's mysterious mortician boss, who appears to be a mentor, but also a potential threat. Directed by Jeremiah Kipp, the film is billed as a new chapter in the story that will expand on the game's world and mythology, delving deeper into the lore of the demonic entities plaguing River Fields.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Tracee Beebe and Brian Clarke adapted the screenplay. Patrick Ewald's Epic Pictures is producing via its horror outfit, Dread, alongside Cole Payne's Traverse Media. The production is financed by Epic Pictures and the UK-based Creativity Capital. Published in April 2023, The Mortuary Assistant was released originally on the Steam platform for PCs, though its now also available on Xbox, Playstation, and the Nintendo Switch. 


	In a statement to Deadline, director Kipp said in part that both he and the game's creator, Clarke, “respond to character-driven storytelling within a disturbing horror space. Because his influences have been largely cinematic, the whole process has organically felt like an expansion of his unique gameplay. We've captured the atmosphere of singular dread that players responded to so powerfully – this movie will be scary as hell.”


	For Clarke, “Seeing the mortuary assistant evolve over the years from a small prototype to a full feature film is beyond anything I could have imagined as a solo developer. Jeremiah Kipp is an insanely skilled director, and it has been one of the highlights of my life working with him. Jeremiah and the entire team at Epic Pictures have done an amazing job capturing the spirit of the game while adding their own unique cinematic flair. It is an honor to see Willa and Paul bring these characters to life along with the rest of the film crew. I feel extremely fortunate and can't wait for fans to see The Mortuary Assistant expand into new territory.”

	











The Mortuary Assistant's Holland is best known for her starring role as Thea Queen, aka Speedy, in seven seasons of The CW's Arrow. First gaining recognition for a role on hit series The O.C., her other TV credits include Gossip Girl, The Flash, and Based on a True Story. Feature credits include A Summer in Genoa, Legion, Rod Lurie's Straw Dogs, and The Dirty South. She is is repped by Paradigm and 3 Arts Entertainment.


	An Emmy nominee, Sparks is known for turns on series like House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire, as well as films like Mud, Midnight Special, and The Bikeriders. He's recently been seen starring in the Apple series Physical and is part of the cast of Prime Video's thriller limited series The Better Sister, which premieres on May 29. He's repped by Gersh and Circle Management + Production.


	Kipp has previously directed the Shudder Original Slapface — winner of the Audience Award at Cinequest — along with sci-fi horror pic Black Wake, Don't Pick Up starring Keith David, Draw Up & Stare starring Michael O'Keefe and Melissa Leo, and other titles.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Donald Trump went after Fox News on Thursday after its latest poll showed him 11 points underwater in job approval.


	Despite the presence of a friendly slate of opinion hosts on Fox News, the president has lashed out over its polls, which are done under the direction of the Democratic firm Beacon Research and the Republican firm Shaw & Company.


	The poll results showed that 44% approved of Trump's job performance, and 55% disapproved. It's in line with a series of other survey results in recent days, as the president nears the 100-day mark. 


	Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Rupert Murdoch has told me for years that he is going to get rid of his FoxNews, Trump Hating, Fake Pollster, but he has never done so. This ‘pollster' has gotten me, and MAGA, wrong for years. Also, and while he's at it, he should start making changes at the China Loving Wall Street Journal. It sucks!!!”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	A Fox News spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.


	The Journal, owned by the Murdochs' News Corp., has run editorials critical of Trump, particularly when it comes to tariffs. Its news side also has produced a number of hard-hitting stories about the early months of Trump's administration.


	Trump did reveal that he was planning to meet with The Atlantic‘s editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was mistakenly added to the Signal group chat of top Trump national security officials in March. After the White House attacked Goldberg and claimed that what was shared in the chat was not classified, he published the text messages, showing that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted attack plans on the Houthi rebels in Yemen.


	Trump wrote, “Later today I will be meeting with, of all people, Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor of The Atlantic, and the person responsible for many fictional stories about me, including the made-up HOAX on ‘Suckers and Losers' and, SignalGate, something he was somewhat more ‘successful' with. Jeffrey is bringing with him Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker, not exactly pro-Trump writers, either, to put it mildly! The story they are writing, they have told my representatives, will be entitled, ‘The Most Consequential President of this Century.' I am doing this interview out of curiosity, and as a competition with myself, just to see if it's possible for The Atlantic to be ‘truthful.' Are they capable of writing a fair story on ‘TRUMP'? The way I look at it, what can be so bad – I WON!”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, Blumhouse Television has acquired rights to Marisha Pessl's No. 1 national bestseller Darkly to turn into a TV series, which will be executive produced by Jamie Lee Curtis through her company Comet Pictures' first-look deal with the independent studio.


	Executive producing alongside Comet's Curtis are Jason Blum and Chris Dickie for Blumhouse Television and Pessl. Search for a writer to adapt the psychological YA thriller novel.


Darkly was published on November 26, 2024 by Penguin Random House. In it, Arcadia “Dia” Gannon has been obsessed with Louisiana Veda, the game designer whose obsessive creations and company, Darkly, have gained a cultlike following. Dia is shocked when she's chosen for a highly coveted internship, along with six other teenagers from around the world. Why her? Dia has never won anything in her life.

	











	Darkly, once a game-making empire renowned for its ingenious and utterly terrifying toys and games, now lies dormant after Veda's mysterious death. The remaining games are priced like rare works of art, with some fetching millions of dollars at auction.




			Watch on Deadline		







	As Dia and her fellow interns delve into the heart of Darkly, they discover hidden symbols, buried clues and a web of intrigue. Who are these other teens, and what secrets do they keep? Why were any of them really chosen? The answers lie within the twisted labyrinth of Darkly.


	At Blumhouse TV, the project will be shepherded by the division's incoming president Melissa Aouate who starts later this month.


	Curtis' deal with Blumhouse already has yielded two series executive produced by her: The Sticky, starring Margo Martindale, and the upcoming Scarpetta, in which Curtis also stars opposite Nicole Kidman, both for Prime Video. Curtis is repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.


	Pessl won the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize for her debut novel, Special Topics In Calamity Physics. Her books — primarily in the suspense and mystery genres —  also include Night Film and Neverworld Wake. They have been translated into more than 30 languages. Pessl is repped by CAA.

Although most Hallmark Channel duos live happily ever after, one three-year relationship is about to bite the dust. On April 22, 2025, Vulture's Josef Adalian reported via social media that Hallmark Media will end its partnership with Peacock on May 1. 

Adalian tweeted, “If you've been streaming Hallmark shows and movies via Peacock, heads up: As of May 1, Peacock and Hallmark will be ending their content sharing arrangement. Shows like THE WAY HOME will be leaving, and new movies will not stream next-day. Live feeds gone, too.”

The partnership with Peacock started in 2022, long before Hallmark expanded and rebranded Hallmark Movies Now, launching Hallmark+ in September 2024. With that becoming the one place Hallmark fans will be able to stream all of their favorite movies and series, the company is offering big discounts to new subscribers for a limited time.

An inside source told TVLine that the three-year deal between Hallmark and Peacock was a “successful partnership,” it no longer makes sense given the robust content available via Hallmark+. 

Adalian echoed that sentiment on Bluesky, writing that “it was a very fruitful arrangement. Peacock got a ton of great content; Hallmark got access to cord-cutters. But Hallmark is all in on Hallmark+ now. Peacock likely didn't want to keep paying for content that was on a competitor”

During its first months, Hallmark+ not only expanded its movie library with hundreds of Hallmark classics but also premiered multiple exclusive movies — including “The Groomsmen” trilogy — and new series like “The Chicken Sisters” and a slate of unscripted shows, including Jonathan Bennett's “Finding Mr. Christmas.”

In early April, the network announced a slight shift in strategy, bringing most new content — including an ever-expanding lineup of reality shows — over to Hallmark Channel, with each new movie and series available to stream on Hallmark+ the day after its premiere. That has replaced the need for Peacock to do the same. 

There are still ways to stream live Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Mystery programming for those who have subscriptions to services like Hulu + Live TV, YouTubeTV, Sling, or Pluto TV, according to Good Housekeeping. 

With the partnership between Hallmark Channel and Peacock due to end on May 1, the network is offering 50% off deals to new Hallmark+ annual subscribers, according to a Reddit thread of fans who've been posting their discount finds online. 

Multiple people had success using the code APRIL50 while registering, said to expire on April 30. The coupon code brings the annual subscription rate down from $79.99 to $39.99. One user said they also found two other online codes — MOMHUB50, good through May 11, and MDPROMO, good through May 15. 

New subscribers using a coupon code still get a seven-day free trial as part of their sign-up. The discount does not apply to the monthly $7.99 rate for Hallmark+, only for year-long subscriptions.

Before heading to Ontario to film the fourth season of “The Way Home,” cast members Chyler Leigh, Andie MacDowell, Sadie Laflamme-Snow and Evan Williams reunited for a special screening of their Hallmark Channel series' third season on April 22, 2025. 

Hosted by Hallmark Media at the private Hollywood club and luxury hotel The Aster, it was a party with a purpose. Known among Hollywood insiders as a “For Your Consideration (FYC)” event, Hallmark is one of many networks hosting screenings for Emmy voters, hoping they'll consider “The Way Home” as they nominate shows, casts, and crews for the 2025 Emmy Awards. 

Attendees at “The Way Home” FYC event were treated to a screening, panel discussion, treat bags, and an array of food from sliders to gorgeous charcuterie boards piled with meats, cheeses, and fruits. 

Beverages included custom drinks based on the show, including a “Landry Lemonade Stand” with Desert Rose, Sunset and Topanga Canyon flavors. They also offered a specialty cocktail called “The Pond Hopper,” in honor of the show's time-travel pond, made with lavender gin, elderflower and tonic. 

The cast joined “The Way Home” showrunners Heather Conkie and Alexandra Clarke, as well as series co-creator and executive producer Marly Reed, for a panel discussion moderated by Variety's Emily Longeretta.  

Whether the screening and party swayed Emmy voters remains to be seen; nominees for the 2025 Emmys will be announced on July 15, per Entertainment Weekly. 

A post shared by Justin Nunez (@justinnunezstudio)

As photos from the party began popping up online, fans swooned and expressed how much they already miss watching the Landry family since the third season wrapped up on Hallmark Channel in late March. 

One tweeted, “The way these pics made me instantly emo because I miss my them sm! #thewayhome” and another tweeted, “The most talented and most gorgeous cast in existence #TheWayHome”

Jordan Doww, who joined the cast in season three, couldn't get over a shot posted by photographer Justin Nunez at the event, writing multiple comments under the Instagram post, including writing, “i actually can't handle this.”

Doww shared the photo on X, tweeting, “i cannot handle this photo. hottest tv family of ALL time. give them their flowers 👏 #fyc#thewayhome”

“There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”

This famous line from Shakespeare's “Hamlet” rings particularly apt now that Chloé Zhao‘s “Hamnet” has been slated for an awards-friendly November release. This adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's own award-winning historical novel stars Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley as William Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes. Focus Features has set a limited theatrical release for the Elizabethan-era drama on November 27, followed by a nationwide expansion on December 12.

In addition to landing within the window for an awards season play, the film also seems to be setting itself up as an “adult option” for moviegoers during the holiday season. It hits select theaters the same time as “Zootopia 2” and expands right as “Avatar: Fire & Ash” and “Spongebob: Search for Square Pants” begin their rollouts. It also marks a return for Zhao to independent filmmaking after helming Marvel's “Eternals” in 2021. She'd previously broken through with indie films “The Rider” and “Nomadland,” the latter of which earned her Best Picture and Best Director at the 2021 Academy Awards.

Based on O'Farrell's 2020 novel of the same name, “Hamnet” tells the story of William and Agnes Shakespeare as they grieve the death of their 11-year-old son. The love that rose from this devastation is what went on to inspire one of the Bard's most famous tragedies, “Hamlet.” Joining Mescal and Buckley in the cast are Joe Alwyn, Emily Watson, and Jacobi Jupe as Hamnet Shakespeare.

Mescal and Buckley were both recently on hand in Las Vegas for CinemaCon 2025, but for different projects entirely. As part of Sony's presentation, Mescal was brought out for the cast reveal of Sam Mendes' four-film biopic series on “The Beatles,” in which he will be playing Paul McCartney. He was joined by Joseph Quinn (George Harrison), Harris Dickinson (John Lennon), and Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr). Mendes also serves as an executive producer on “Hamnet” alongside Steven Spielberg. Meanwhile, Buckley attended the Warner Brothers presentation as part of the team for the upcoming Frankenstein-inspired musical “The Bride.” Though initially slated for 2025, the film was recently moved to 2026.

The upcoming awards season is getting a slight tweak via the Golden Globes.

The organization announced in tandem with CBS that its 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards will air Sunday, January 11, 2026 (8:00-11:00 PM, live ET/5:00-8:00 PM, live PT) on the CBS Television Network.

Often described as the first major award show of the season, the Golden Globes are usually scheduled for the first weekend in January as a kickoff to awards campaigning in the new year. With the move forward by one week, the awards ceremony is opening the door to more awards events being pushed back a tiny bit, especially since the 2026 Oscars are scheduled for March 15 — a whole two weeks later on the calendar compared to the 2025 Oscars date.

One could argue the date of the Golden Globes moving offers a bit of a reprieve for the talent having to traverse a long awards season, allowing everyone involved to possibly extend their holiday break (this is a process that starts at the beginning of September, after all.)

The Golden Globes, which refers to itself as “Hollywood's Party of the Year,” will once again be hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser after her first go around brought in a ratings bump for the telecast. The event makes the effort to be the largest awards show in the world to celebrate the best of both film and television. Dick Clark Productions will once again plan, host and produce the annual Golden Globes, which has been viewed in more than 185 countries and territories worldwide.  

The Golden Globes 2026 will also have a streaming option in the U.S., with Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers specifically having access to stream live via the live feed of their local CBS affiliate on the service, as well as on demand. Paramount+ Essential subscribers will not have the option to stream live but will have access to the telecast on-demand the day after the special airs.

The Golden Globes 2026 nominations are already set to be announced on Monday, December 8, 2025. A full timeline for the awards will be announced soon.

“Étoile,” the new series from Emmy-winning hat fanatic Amy Sherman-Palladino and her Emmy-winning hat-positive hubby Daniel Palladino, isn't easy to appreciate. Given the obscure French title (which translates to “star” and typically refers to the lead dancer in a ballet company) as well as the rarefied air of its subject matter (professional ballet and its hoity-toity benefactors), perhaps the Amazon Prime Video “comedy's” impermeability should have been expected.

But for those of us who have enjoyed past efforts from the showrunner (and her partner), it's just strange. 

 










After all, the distinct, celebrated voice behind “Gilmore Girls” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” has long relayed her stories via rat-a-tat dialogue that — so long as they're not intimidated by rapid chatter — can coax viewers into bemused submission. Select words and phrases are batted back and forth like a ping-pong ball between Olympic athletes. In between, arguments are made and relationships are built, but the sometimes laborious work of exposition and table-setting can become effervescent when delivered at Sherman-Palladino's melodic meter. Add in charming performances, sparkling locales, and a relatable story (not to mention an ample helping of quippy cultural references) and giving in is often as easy as clicking play.

“Étoile” still sports its creator's trademark talking, but it's less amplified and more scattered. Worse yet, it's in service of a confounding story both too big and too small to connect with, as well as characters that are enormously, fruitlessly difficult — difficult to each other, difficult to invest in, and difficult to see clearly until it's far too late to care. 

Splitting its time between New York City and Paris, “Étoile” starts with its two central ballet companies in the same place, sharing a night of fun before a day of business. Jack McMillan (Luke Kirby) is the executive director of the Metropolitan Ballet Theater at New York's Lincoln Center. The grandson of the benefactor whose maiden name christens the auditorium itself (The Fish Theater, which spawns a stream of awful fish puns as long as a whale), Jack was born into ballet and defends dance with every fiber of his being. He props up his talented staff when they refuse to comply with basic, bureaucratic HR requests; he takes abbreviated, life-affirming breaks throughout his busy day to watch young amateurs and seasoned professionals practice their moves; he goes home at night, six sheets to the wind, and turns on old dance movies (Mikhail Baryshnikov in “White Nights”) or watches archival recordings of performances from the family theater.

 










His Parisian counterpart is Geneviève Lavigne (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the interim director of l'Opera Francais and Le Ballet National. She, too, loves the art-form, enjoying a night on the dance floor at a New York nightclub almost as much as she seems to savor the ensuing argument over who would win in a fight between ballet legends: renowned Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky or modern American dancer Misty Copeland. But unlike Jack, whose lineage doubles as job security, Geneviève is fighting tooth and nail to drop the “interim” tag from her title, and so far, it's a losing battle. Her overseers (led by a hostile Minister of Culture) aren't too happy with her ideas for the future, including the gambit that brought her across the Atlantic to meet with Jack.

Geneviève wants to arrange a trade: the best and brightest of her Parisian ballet company for the same from Jack's New York contingent. She sees a marketing opportunity in the showy exchange of stars, which should attract significant press coverage and could even be bolstered by a supporting reality show. But more than that, Geneviève sees a need. Audiences just aren't turning out for ballet like they used to, and the waning support is evident in unoccupied theater seats, dried-up donations, and a slow-down in government funding. COVID only exacerbated these problems, with established dancers falling out of shape or being forced to seek out more sustainable careers, and up-and-coming étoiles left with nowhere to go for training or inspiration.

 










So why not jump-start the cultural conversation around ballet with a big, year-long, transatlantic showcase? Well, that's where “Étoile” starts to lose its footing. To fund Geneviève's idea, she's arranged for cash from an abominable source: Crispin Shamblee (Simon Callow), a fellow dance devotee with a limitless checkbook and zero morals. A chemical weapons manufacturer who sells his wares to “God know who,” “Crispy” (as he prefers to be called) is presented as a necessary evil. “He's not my friend,” Geneviève says. “He's my purse.”

But Jack won't leave it at that — not at first, anyway. “Don't let the ‘oh, I'm so cute, I'm so cuddly' demeanor fool you,” Jack says. “That man delivered the eulogy at Rush Limbaugh's funeral!” And yet, “Étoile” seems perfectly happy being fooled. Despite suffering indignity after indignity, Jack acquiesces to the charming villain, as does the show around him. Crispy pops in, time and again, as comic relief. He calls from his private jet dressed like Snoopy, complete with red scarf and old-timey goggles. He shows up for ballet practice in '80s era workout tights, cracking jokes in between high kicks. He's repeatedly described as the worst of humanity yet consistently treated like a cartoon cutie pie.

“Étoile” never reckons with the disconnect, and similar discrepancies between what's said and what's shown surface elsewhere. Jack's nonsensical romantic life only exists by narrative insistence, always on the back burner yet still always cold. Geneviève is, by any measure, terrible at her job — she shows up to a press conference without reading up on the crisis she knows she'll be asked about, and she stubbornly makes herself the center of attention even when doing so does her no favors — yet we're told (much too late anyway) she's actually quite good. And the dancers. My goodness, I haven't even introduced the dancers.

 










Mishi (Taïs Vinolo) is a young French star who's been living and thriving in New York for the past two years. When she's forced to go back home — a triumphant return, as framed by her mother, the Minister of Culture — she struggles to fit in… for eight hours. Tobias (Gideon Glick, who was also in the writers' room) suffers from similar stagnation. He's the eccentric genius, a choreographer who designs brilliant ballets but can't hold a conversation for more than a few sentences. Upon arriving in Paris, he tells the entire company they need to adjust to his internal clock, set to Eastern Standard Time. He complains the French shops don't have his toothpaste and the French apartments have the wrong kind of rats. (Don't ask.) Glick's performance is buoyant and goofy; one of the few comedic constants (in addition to Crispy) in what Amazon insists is best described as a comedy. But his arc is predictable and too slow to develop.

Then there's Cheyenne (Lou de Laâge). Widely considered the best ballet dancer in the world, her acquisition is seen as an unprecedented coup for the Metropolitan, and she doesn't disappoint. Cheyenne refuses to budge on even the smallest of issues, respects no opinion but her own, and recoils from any off-stage responsibilities whatsoever, but she's an incredible performer, and the masses flock to see her trip the light fantastic. She shies away from being too stereotypical by abhorring extravagance. She hates her Upper West Side hotel because it's too posh, and she walks everywhere as a ride-or-die environmentalist. By her own admission, Cheyenne would rather be out saving the whales than prancing across a stage. In the premiere, she's asked, “You love to dance, don't you, Cheyenne?” “No,” she says. “But it's who I am, so there is no choice.”

 










De Laâge channels Cheyenne's diva energy with an inflexible ferocity that slowly gives way to sudden vulnerability. It's one of the few progressive performances in the series and one of the few to offer the audience a reward for their continued attention. But such benefits can be tough to notice. Multiple episodes are bloated and jumbled at over an hour. (The finale is an interminable 74 minutes.) The pacing is impossible to grasp, and the episodic structure is too slapped together. “Étoile” is a struggle to sit through, and that goes double for the uninspired depiction of the dancing itself.

So many shots are content to replicate what an audience would see from their seats, occasionally moving closer as if the onlooker brought a pair of binoculars, but rarely providing views that could only be captured by a camera. Static frames keep the the lovely choreography and talented dancers centered, but force them to do all the work. Long takes serve the same function, stressing the performers without helping to accentuate their unique skillset. Why not glide alongside the dancers? Why not draw us into their world? Why not show us their perspective, rather than more of our own?

So little interest is shown in the physical and mental demands of professional dancers, it's no wonder the closest we come to feeling like we understand what they're going through is during the closing credits, when a montage of actual behind-the-scenes footage includes a few moments of tricky costuming and time-consuming stretches.

 










“Étoile” never lets us in. Despite its budget and resources (much of the New York story takes place in and around Lincoln Center), the series feels like it's told by ballet patrons, for ballet patrons — people who like watching pretty people glide across a stage, but lack the curiosity to ask why or how they do it, let alone share the answers with an audience without access to The Met. When you can't hear the melody, it's awfully hard to dance.

“Étoile” premieres Thursday, April 24 on Amazon Prime Video. All eight episodes will be released at once.

On Tuesday night, I found myself standing on a trash can in Washington Square Park, surrounded by a critical mass of the NYU student body. Other spectators had climbed trees or lamp posts, and before the scheduled event could begin, park rangers and cops arrived to break up the crowd. Lorde, our resident “prettier Jesus,” commands an audience like few of her peers. “Since I was 17, I gave you everything,” she sings on “What Was That”—her first original single in four years—further tussling with the messianic complex of young stardom she so thoroughly lambasted on 2021's Solar Power. While that album's aughts-informed folk-pop swerved away from the spotlight, it appears Lorde has since decided to give the people exactly what they want, and what they want, unsurprisingly, is Melodrama part two.

“What Was That” is the sound of a decade passing in the blink of an eye, a first gasp for air after coming up from a dive in the pool. Lorde's always had a knack for sifting through the fleeting passions of youth, even in their midst, and her writing is as evocative and rich as ever. But with so much of the action necessarily taking place in the past tense—we kissed for hours, I remember saying, I gave you everything—“What Was That” misses out on a sense of revelation, and it's undercut at every turn by Jim-E Stack and Dan Nigro's bloodless production. Recall “Green Light”'s galloping pianos, how “Perfect Places” popped like fireworks or maybe gunshots, or the way the razor-edged synths on “Hard Feelings/Loveless” sheared through the mix, instead of limply squeaking by as they do here. Drugs have often been Lorde's narrative device of choice; “Pure Heroine is alcohol, Melodrama is MDMA, and Solar Power is cannabis,” she told Vogue in 2021. One only wishes “What Was That” did justice to molly-wide pupils or the memory of the “best cigarette of my life.” Then again, the high's never as good the second time around.

“Want it, you want it, you want it, you want it/But you'll never get ahead of it,” fantasy of a broken heart announce sweetly at the outset of “Passion Clouds,” the opening song on Chaos Practitioner. The line resurfaces two songs later on “Have a Nice Time Life!,” suggesting that it might be something like a motto for the duo of Al Nardo and Bailey Wollowitz: Zapping across decades' worth of brightly colored, hi-def pop tropes as though flicking through channels with the cable remote, fantasy of a broken heart seem to be racing to keep pace with the speed of their ideas.

Nardo and Wollowitz, supporting players with Water From Your Eyes and This Is Lorelei who first played together in Sloppy Jane, assembled Chaos Practitioner from recordings made at home and brief blasts of creativity on tour. Stitching the pieces together with the assistance of Water From Your Eyes' Nate Amos, the duo distills the genre-hopping art pop of last October's Feats of Engineering into a dense, restless EP that packs six songs into just 19 minutes.

The whiplash pace of Chaos Practitioner is less a visceral sensation than a head trip. fantasy of a broken heart fill every corner of the margins with busy doodles: springy drum programming, processed vocals, strange time signatures, throwback electronics. Nervous overdubs and compulsive countermelodies undercut their fondness for sumptuous soft rock, creating a woozy sway that's heightened rhythms that skitter around the beat without settling into a groove for long.

That velocity can be invigorating. “Passion Clouds” gallops out of the gate with a cheerful, insistent pulse—part motorik, part indie pop—before a zig-zagging rhythm threatens to overwhelm the melody of the chorus. The duo pulls off a similar misdirection on “Victory Path,” submerging the song's hooks in thick, dissonant layers of lysergic vocoder. They succumb to soft rock on the country-inflected “Road Song,” which sounds like a 4K version of some of Jim O'Rourke's experiments in classic rock and pop, but even here, they seem determined to avoid anything approaching a straight path. Despite their tuneful inclinations, fantasy of a broken heart are unable to resist the pull of gleeful cacophony; an impish sense of humor runs through their colorful arrangements even when the sentiment—as on “We Confront the Demon in Mysterious Ways,” a song about toxic relationships—runs much darker.

Sometimes, fantasy of a broken heart appear so intent upon subverting established pop forms that they seem to lack the patience to write a song that ebbs and flows of its own accord. That's not the case with “We Confront the Demon in Mysterious Ways,” which retains the spirited energy that drives the EP but eases into a more linear, relaxed groove and draws it out for nearly five minutes—the longest song here by a considerable margin. It feels like a coda to the frenetic explosion of sounds that has preceded it, a satisfying conclusion to an EP that contains more ideas than many records three times its length. After darting from peak to peak across the previous five songs, fantasy of a broken heart finally find the time to slow down and take in the view.

	On Wednesday evening, shortly after Ayo Edebiri made her entrance through the remarkably heavy doors of Everybody's Live With John Mulaney (a feat even fellow guest Conan O'Brien struggled with on the same episode), she got comfortable and opened an envelope containing a review of the show she wrote for Letterboxd. Since 2018, the Bear star has reviewed movies on the movie-journaling social network, many of which have gone viral.


	Fortuitously for Mulaney, she seemed to like his freewheeling talk show, comparing watching it to crack, y'know, in a good way. “OK, so we all know crack is bad,” she began. “Yes, we can all agree that crack is something bad. But consider this: Crack gave us funk music. Crack gave us Tyrone Biggums. Crack gave us Whitney Houston saying, ‘First of all, let's get one thing straight. Crack is cheap.'” She then went on to do an impression of the late singer telling Diane Sawyer that “crack is wack” in 2002.

ayo edebiri's @letterboxd review of Everybody's Live with John Mulaney


	“The spirit of crack, one could argue, has also given us this show,” she continued. “John Mulaney, sober and a father, is basically spiritually on crack. To be clear, I think this is a good thing. This man shows up dressed up like a Pentecostal deacon's son headed to the 2018 NBA draft, only to end up a fifth-round reject. And yet he puts out some of the sharpest comedy happening right now.” She went on to praise the show's writers, praising how the show “indulges in volleying between keen, deeply specific observational comedy and playful surrealism. … You can't put your finger on which way it will go or why.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In summary, she describes Mulaney as “a gift to comedy,” adding, “he is also maybe probably insane, but I think this is good.” And, in case you were worried, she stated, “And I think crack is bad.”


	And while that seemed like the end of her panegyric, she flipped the card and turned her attention to Mulaney's sidekick on the series, veteran loudmouthed character actor Richard Kind, whom she said she loves. “I want to adopt him and take him to a diner not too far from the courthouse and split an ice cream sundae and celebrate our new family with him.”

	She gave the series four stars and a heart. Considering how Mulaney, Kind, and O'Brien were in stitches throughout the whole speech, they approve of her assessment. “It's the nicest thing I've ever been given,” Mulaney said.

Horror legend Tony Todd left behind a handful of upcoming projects when he passed away last year, including Final Destination Bloodlines and The Raven. Another one of Todd's final projects is titled The Bunker, and The Hollywood Reporter has debuted the trailer today.

Directed by Brian Hanson and written by Charles L. Bunce and Brian Hanson, this sci-fi horror film explores isolation, paranoia, and survival under pressure. Watch the trailer below.

Electric Entertainment has acquired North American rights. Stay tuned for a release date.

In The Bunker…

“Earth faces an unprecedented threat as mysterious alien ships appear in the sky. Dr. Michelle Riley (Chelsea Edmundson), a micropathogen specialist, is sealed in an underground bunker, tasked with developing a biological weapon to combat the extraterrestrial invaders.”

Tony Todd stars alongside Tobin Bell and Chad Michael Collins.

Director Douglas Schulze (The Dark Below, Hellmaster, Mimesis) took inspiration from horror classics including The Thing, Alien, and The Exorcist for his new movie Thorns, but it's pretty clear that the biggest inspiration on the film was Hellraiser. In fact, Thorns looks like something of a lost Hellraiser sequel, right down to Doug Bradley starring in the film.

Thorns is said to be “ripe with physical makeup effects and plenty of gore,” and you can watch the trailer below for a taste. It was debuted exclusively over on Dread Central earlier today.

Dread also reveals that Thorns will be coming to VOD on May 6 from Vantage Media.

In Thorns, “An ex-priest working for NASA is sent to investigate a remote observatory that went silent after receiving a mysterious radio signal from deep space. Upon arrival, he discovers the signal has opened a portal unleashing a thorned monster. The former priest must now summon his lost faith to stop the signal from jumpstarting the end of the world.”

Douglas Schulze previews, “At its core, Thorns is an homage to 80's era monster movies, from our use of practical effects to a synth fueled music score and lots of easter eggs. Hellraiser, The Thing, Alien are all great films with even greater practical makeup effects. For me the best horror cinema steers away from the computer realm when pursuing all things visceral.”

“Thorns is meant as a visceral experience,” the director adds.

Tony Timpone served as co-producer of the upcoming horror movie.

Meta laid off employees on Thursday in its Reality Labs division, which encompasses various virtual and augmented reality projects. The cuts impact employees within Oculus Studios, which develops apps and games for Meta's Quest headsets.

Meta did not specify how many people were impacted by the layoffs but said that the cuts impacted people working on Quest products, including Supernatural, a VR exercise app. Meta acquired Within, the company that makes Supernatural, in 2023.

“Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” Meta told TechCrunch in a statement. “These changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today.”

Reality Labs has been a massive cost for Meta, losing almost $5 billion in the last quarter of 2024 while generating about $1 billion in sales. Meta has reported billions of dollars in operating losses on Reality Labs each year since rebranding from Facebook and emphasizing its commitment to the “metaverse.”

These layoffs come in advance of Meta's first-quarter earnings report next week, when the company may face scrutiny for the mounting costs of Reality Labs.

Meta told TechCrunch that laid off employees will have the opportunity to apply for other jobs at the company.

For Supernatural users, the layoffs mean that the app will produce fewer new workouts per week. However, each individual workout will be available at a wider variety of skill levels, instead of just one difficulty level per workout. The app also said in a Facebook post that the coaches who run the app's workouts will not be impacted by the layoffs.

When you hear stories of UFO's they aren't usually from the Ozarks. St. Louis, Kansas City, Columbia? Those are regular places for Missouri UFO sightings and they have larger population bases to up the percentage of potential eyeballs on a UFO, and the increased level of air traffic in those areas. But, none of those places are Missouri's UFO capital.

Piedmont, MO. in Wayne County is the UFO capital of Missouri based on a heavy UFO season there in 1973. Yes over 50 years ago. Between February and April that year there were more than 500 UFO incidents reported in Piedmont. About half of the people living there then saw something. That's wild.

The sightings didn't end then, they just don't occur with the frequency that they did in 1973. Or, maybe everyone just got so used to them that in Piedmont, it's just another thing? When the Piedmont stories started getting out in the early seventies, people were drawn to the small Ozark town in southern Missouri. Not just lookie-loo's though, the FBI, CIA and the military all sent officials to investigate.

In 2025 Piedmont is gearing up for the third annual UFO fest this weekend. Will the UFOs return for the event that they stirred originally? Go find out.

NY leaders react","https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/24/wisconsin-senator-revives-911-conspiracy-mike-lawler-first-responders-react/83246408007/","Thu, 24 Apr 2025 19:25:15 GMT","

Advocates for 9/11 health programs blasted U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson's call for yet another congressional probe into the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Instead of reviving long-debunked conspiracy theories, advocates said, the Wisconsin Republican should join the fight to secure healthcare for the first responders and residents poisoned by the toxic swirl that enveloped lower Manhattan.

""If he wants to have hearings on 9/11, (Johnson) could have them examine the cuts to World Trade Center Health Program by the Trump administration that are happening today and the impact these cuts will have on 9/11 responders and survivors suffering from the attacks, rather than fringe topics from decades ago,"" said Benjamin Chevat, executive director Citizens for Extension of the James Zadroga Act, Inc.

The World Trade Center Health Program provides medical monitoring and treatment for some 140,000 9/11 responders and survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. WTCHP participants reside in all 50 states.

""My guess is there's an awful lot being covered up, in terms of what the American government knows about 9/11,"" Johnson said in an April 21 interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson. ""With this administration, I think President Trump should have some interest, being a New Yorker himself.""

Another GOP New Yorker, though, questioned Johnson's call.

""Respectfully, Senator Johnson should stop peddling conspiracy theories about the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history and one that forever altered the lives of so many of my fellow New Yorkers,"" said U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican whose 17th District includes Rockland and Putnam counties and parts of Westchester and Dutchess, areas that lost many residents in the attacks.

""Crap like this dishonors and disrespects the innocent lives lost, our brave first responders, and all families and survivors who still carry the pain of 9/11 each and every day,"" U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler posted on X.

John Feal, a longtime advocate for 9/11 first responders, on CNN called the idea for new hearings pathetic: ""Ron Johnson's a silly man.""

The World Trade Center Health Program and the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund have faced funding shortfalls practically since they launched in 2011. First responders have repeatedly made trips to D.C. to walk the halls of Congress to lobby for funding.

A plan to fix cyclical funding shortfalls was included last year's end-of-year budget deal. But in December 2024, then-President-elect Donald Trump pushed GOP leaders in Congress to scrap spending items, including 9/11 health program commitments.

Congressional members have introduced the 9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act of 2025 to revive the funding fix; 9/11 responders, including Feal, plan to go back to D.C. Tuesday, April 28, to advocate for its passage. Democrats and Republicans in both chambers across New York are co-sponsors; Johnson is not.

Meanwhile, WTCHP jobs have twice been on the chopping block this year.

In February, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, slashed jobs at WTCHP; the Trump administration restored them amid backlash.

In April, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced sweeping cuts to CDC and NIOSH, which includes the WTCHP.

While key staff were again restored amid backlash, advocates have said they are concerned cuts throughout the HHS will impact 9/11 healthcare.

Johnson in the April 21 interview raised a long debunked theory that Building 7 within the World Trade Center complex had been taken down by planted explosives. The building wasn't hit by a plane, like the Twin Towers, and collapsed hours after the initial attacks.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology determined that debris from the destruction of the Twin Towers started fires on floors of Building 7. The sprinkler system failed, and heat from the flames meant a structural column failed, ultimately causing the building to fall.

Johnson called the institute, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, corrupt.

Congress also held hearings in 2021 — two decades after Sept. 11 — where intelligence and security officials gave insight into the attacks and intelligence failures before 9/11.

Johnson has the power to push for such an investigation; he chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, part of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs in the Senate.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Network, reached out to Johnson's office for additional details. A spokeswoman said a potential hearing would depend on what information or documentation Johnson's office obtains.","{'href': 'https://www.lohud.com', 'title': 'Lohud'}","other"

Fittingly for devoted followers of Donald Trump, Pete Hegseth and Jennifer Rauchet wed at one of the president's golf clubs.

The president himself attended the nuptials at the Trump National Golf Club in Colts Neck, New Jersey, in August 2019.

Other guests included Mr Hegseth's Fox colleague Sean Hannity and his now fiancée Ainsley Earhardt, another luminary of conservative broadcasting.

Appropriately, the happy couple both wore “Make Marriage Great Again” baseball caps.

Ms Rauchet – who is believed to be in her early 40s – is the defence secretary's third wife and, between them, they are raising a “blended family” of seven children.

They each have three children from previous relationships.

The couple has been almost inseparable since they met at Fox News, where Ms Rauchet worked as an executive producer. A journalism graduate of Towson University, Maryland, she joined the station in 2006.

At the time, the then Fox & Friends host was still married to his second wife, Samantha Deering.

Deering and Mr Hegseth got together after both working for lobbying group Vets for Freedom in Washington DC.

Deering filed for divorce from Mr Hegseth after he fathered a child with Ms Rauchet in 2017, the same year he started working full-time at the network as a host, after previously making a number of guest appearances.

According to reports, Ms Rauchet was also married at the time.

She was moved from Mr Hegseth's show Fox & Friends to Watters' World after the pair disclosed their relationship, according to Vanity Fair.

According to Vanity Fair, there was gossip that she helped Mr Hegseth get more airtime than other contributors.

Claims that she was involved in Tucker Carlson's departure from Fox were angrily denied by Mr Hegseth on X in April 2023.

“The fakest news I've ever seen,” he wrote. My amazing wife @JennyHegseth had absolutely nothing to do with anything. Not one iota. Like everybody else, we love Tucker.”

In turn, Ms Rauchet rallied to her husband's defence when he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at the 2017 California Federation of Republican Women biennial conference, where she was one of the organisers.

It was an allegation Mr Hegseth angrily denied, although he reached a confidentiality agreement with the woman.

“They won't stop with Pete. It's not him they're after. It's your values. We won't back down,” she wrote on Instagram in December last year, as she voiced loyalty to the man she describes as “her rock”.

When the allegation resurfaced during Mr Hegseth's confirmation process, team Trump were apparently “blindsided”. At the time Steven Cheung, Mr Trump's communications director issued a statement insisting “President Trump is nominating high-calibre and extremely qualified candidates” adding the team were “looking forward” to his confirmation as secretary of defence.

A lawyer for Mr Hegseth said: “This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.” Sources close to Mr Hegseth suggested the allegation had resurfaced as a result of Republican establishment figures attempting to sabotage his appointment.

Then, further allegations about Trump's defence pick were made public. In a furious email, sent around the time of Mr Hegseth's second divorce, his own mother, Penelope, called him an “abuser of women” and accused him of “lying, cheating, sleeping around and using women for his own power and ego”.

Penelope Hegseth told the New York Times – which had published the correspondence – that she had written the email at a turbulent time in the family's private life and insisted her son was “a good father and husband”.

Other reports emerged about an alleged drinking problem, with former colleagues at Fox claiming Mr Hegseth often smelt of alcohol before going on air.

Nevertheless, Mr Hegseth was confirmed. Ms Rauchet is said to have attended every meeting her husband had with senators as he sought their backing for his nomination to the Pentagon.

Posting a series of pictures from Mr Hegseth's swearing in ceremony to Instagram, Ms Rauchet captioned the post: “An overwhelming heartfelt THANK YOU to all who have supported us.

“Our family, friends, warriors and prayer warriors. I'm so proud of my husband and — like you — am excited to see all that's to come for our nation under this president and his well chosen leaders. It's a new chapter and God is the author — he writes the most beautiful stories.”

The pair lavish praise on each other on the social media site, with Mr Hegseth referring to her as “my rock” and “cowboy Barbi[e]” – she calls him “my favourite soul,” “the king of my heart” and her “everything”.

Mr Hegseth is so rarely seen without Ms Rauchet that she has earned the nickname “Yoko Ono” from Pentagon staff, according to MailOnline.

“I'm sure she's worried about his infidelity and drinking, but she's also involved in the shaping of his public image.

“She's like his parole officer and PR agent all at once,” a source told the website.

Ms Rauchet's frequent appearances at the Pentagon have drawn criticism, particularly after the Wall Street Journal reported she had accompanied the defence secretary to sensitive meetings, including one with his British opposite number, John Healey.

Partners of senior officials can be given low-level security clearance, whether this was the case with Ms Rauchet remains unclear.

CNN reported that she had also submitted paperwork to try to obtain security clearance. A Pentagon spokesman said they would not comment on an individual's clearance.

Her presence at a meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels reportedly raised eyebrows among other attendees, but it is not known what was discussed in her presence.

Ms Rauchet's presence in a Signal group chat, alongside Hegseth's brother – who also works at the Pentagon – and his personal lawyer, in which war plans were discussed prompted further ire. The revelation came just a month after it was revealed Mr Hegseth had shared the same plans in a separate Signal chat, this time containing The Atlantic's Editor in Chief.

Kingsley Wilson, a Pentagon spokesman, insisted Ms Rauchet had “never attended a meeting where sensitive information or classified information was discussed”.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump administration directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the National Education Association and the American Civil Liberties Union, which accused the Republican administration of giving “unconstitutionally vague” guidance and violating teachers' First Amendment rights. 

A second judge on Thursday postponed the effective date of some U.S. Education Department anti-DEI guidance, ruling in a separate case filed by the American Federation of Teachers in Maryland.

In February, the department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. Earlier this month, it ordered states to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.”

The directives do not carry the force of law but threaten to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools were warned that continuing such practices “in violation of federal law” could lead to U.S. Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts.

U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty in New Hampshire said the April letter does not make clear what the department believes a DEI program entails or when it believes such programs cross the line into violating civil rights law. “The Letter does not even define what a ‘DEI program' is,” McCafferty wrote.




The judge also said there is reason to believe the department's actions amount to a violation of teachers' free speech rights.

“A professor runs afoul of the 2025 Letter if she expresses the view in her teaching that structural racism exists in America, but does not do so if she denies structural racism's existence. That is textbook viewpoint discrimination,” McCafferty wrote.

An Education Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

States were given until the end of Thursday to submit certification of their schools' compliance, but some have indicated they would not comply with the order. Education officials in some Democratic-led states have said the administration is overstepping its authority and that there is nothing illegal about DEI.

The Feb. 14 memo from the department, formally known as a “Dear Colleague” letter, said schools have promoted DEI efforts at the expense of white and Asian American students. It dramatically expands the interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the use of race in college admissions to all aspects of education, including, hiring, promotion, scholarships, housing, graduation ceremonies and campus life.

In the ruling in Maryland, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher postponed that memo. She found it was improperly issued and forces teachers to choose between “being injured through suppressing their speech or through facing enforcement for exercising their constitutional rights.”

“The court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history and knowledge itself,” Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT, said in a statement.

The lawsuits argue that the guidance limits academic freedom and is so vague it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed.

The April directive asked states to collect the certification form from local school districts and also sign it on behalf of the state, giving assurance that schools are in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

President Donald Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon, has warned of potential funding cuts if states do not return the form by Friday.

In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there's no discrimination that's happening in any of the schools,” she said.

Schools and states are already required to give assurances to that effect in separate paperwork, but the new form adds language on DEI, warning that using diversity programs to discriminate can bring funding cuts, fines and other penalties.

The form threatens schools' access to Title I, the largest source of federal revenue for K-12 education and a lifeline for schools in low-income areas. ___

In this article

Meta has laid off employees in its Reality Labs division that is tasked with developing virtual reality, augmented reality and related wearable devices.

The cuts affected an unspecified number of employees working in the division's Oculus Studios unit, which develops VR and AR games and content for Meta's Quest VR headsets, a company spokesperson told CNBC.

""Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,"" the spokesperson said. ""These changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today.""

Employees working on the Supernatural VR workout app were impacted, the spokesperson said.

""We're deeply saddened to share that these changes have resulted in the loss of some of our incredibly talented team members,"" the company said in a statement posted to the Supernatural official Facebook group. ""Their contributions have been instrumental in shaping our journey and yours, and their absence will be deeply felt.""

The cuts to Reality Labs come after Meta in February laid off 5% of its overall workforce that it deemed to be its lowest performers.

Meta's Reality Labs division logged an operating loss of $4.97 billion while scoring $1.1 billion in sales during the fourth quarter, the company said in January.

The social media company reports earnings on Wednesday.

The Verge reported the layoffs earlier on Thursday.

 Bitcoiner Prince Filip expects a BTC “omega candle” due to Bitcoin's economic properties, but warns that the price may be suppressed by market participants. 

Bitcoin's price trajectory may be suppressed ahead of its upcoming “omega candle” rally, according to Prince Filip Karađorđević, the hereditary prince of Serbia and Yugoslavia.

In an April 24 interview with Simply Bitcoin, Filip said some market participants may be limiting Bitcoin (BTC) price action.

“People are able to control the market to some extent,” he said. “Maybe that's what acted on the 2021 market that suppressed its price from jumping high up. We could get that again in 2025, but there will be one point where [Bitcoin price] will run away.”

Filip added that Bitcoin remains a fundamentally deflationary asset and said its value is “always going to rise over time.”

He referenced the concept of the “omega candle,” made popular by Bitcoin advocate and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow. The theory predicts Bitcoin's growth trajectory will explode after it hits the $100,000 mark.

“You'll start to go up by 10,000 a day or drop by 10,000 a day. And this is the God candle. After that, we'll start to see omega candles, which are 100,000 increments daily,” said Mow in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph in November 2024.

Factors contributing to Bitcoin's growth include the growing distrust in the traditional financial system, according to Mow.

Bitcoin price saw an over 9% recovery over the past week as the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) accumulated over $2.2 billion worth of Bitcoin in the three days leading up to April 23, Farside Investors' data shows.

The price action is in line “with our Bitcoin relative strength expectations with respect to equities and the dollar,” analysts from Bitfinex exchange told Cointelegraph, adding:

Bitcoin may continue to see more upside if “equities continue higher during earnings week,” but the “still-elevated macro uncertainty could limit broad-based upside,” the analysts added.

Stock and cryptocurrency investors are also concerned about a potential recession in the US. JPMorgan estimates a 60% probability for a recession in 2025, citing US President Donald Trump's 145% tariffs on China as a “material threat to growth” that increases the odds of an economic downturn.

Ethereum is now testing critical resistance after a sharp rally that has caught the attention of analysts and traders alike. Following days of strong upward momentum, ETH has reclaimed the $1,800 mark, recovering over 18% of its value since Tuesday. This impressive rebound signals renewed confidence in the asset amid ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets.

According to top analyst Gert Van Lagen, Ethereum could be on the verge of a historic breakout. In a recent technical analysis shared on X, Van Lagen pointed to a massive 4-year inverse Head and Shoulders pattern forming on Ethereum's 1-week chart—a classic bullish reversal signal. With both shoulders now confirmed, the chart formation is targeting a long-term price objective around the $20,000 level.

This development comes as Ethereum continues to strengthen its on-chain fundamentals and recaptures investor attention. While resistance levels ahead remain challenging, the breakout above $1,800, combined with the bullish long-term setup, has positioned Ethereum as one of the most promising assets in the current cryptocurrency landscape. If market sentiment continues to shift in favor of crypto assets, ETH could be entering a powerful expansion phase with $2,000 and beyond within reach.

Ethereum Gears Up For A Rally Forming A Long-Term Reversal Pattern

Ethereum is currently trading 57% below its multi-year high of $4,100, and many investors feel like a full recovery is still far off. However, growing optimism is surfacing across the market as crypto assets begin to regain momentum despite heightened macroeconomic tensions and a deepening trade war between the United States and China. With equities under pressure, Ethereum and other leading cryptocurrencies appear to be carving out independent trajectories—something analysts view as a strong bullish sign.

According to top analyst Van Lagen, Ethereum could be on the verge of a major breakout. In his recent technical analysis, Van Lagen highlights a massive 4-year inverse Head and Shoulders pattern developing on the ETH weekly chart. This classic reversal formation suggests a long-term bullish structure is in play. If confirmed, Van Lagen believes the pattern could send ETH to an ambitious $20,000 target in the next market cycle.

One key factor in Van Lagen's analysis is the recent shakeout of retail traders. He points to the formation of the Right Shoulder as a moment of capitulation, suggesting that many short-term holders exited their positions, clearing the way for a stronger, more sustained move upward.

ETH Price Tests Support After Key Reclaim

Ethereum is currently trading at $1,740 after successfully reclaiming both the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA, key technical indicators that are now being tested as short-term support. This reclaim is a positive signal for bulls, suggesting that momentum is building after a strong bounce from recent lows. However, the next critical step is to push above the psychological and technical barrier at $2,000.

A decisive break and daily close above the $2,000 mark would confirm a trend reversal and likely open the door for a stronger recovery rally. This level has acted as resistance multiple times over the past months, making it a significant benchmark for traders. Bulls must defend the $1,740 zone to maintain the current structure and build the case for continued upward movement.

On the flip side, if Ethereum fails to reclaim $2,000 and loses the $1,700 support zone, further downside pressure could push ETH back into consolidation territory. Such a move would signal hesitation in the market and potentially delay any meaningful breakout in the short term. For now, holding the reclaimed moving averages is essential as Ethereum attempts to solidify a base for its next move.

Carnivorous ‘Bone Collector' Caterpillars Wear Corpses as Camouflage

Nicknamed the “bone collector,” this newly confirmed caterpillar in Hawaii secretly scrounges off a spider landlord by covering itself with dead insect body parts

Caterpillars nicknamed the ""bone collector"" create protective shelling out of dead insect bones and body parts.

Caterpillars are known for their fuzzy exterior and sometimes weird behavior. Some vibrate aggressively to scare predators; others create their own antifreeze to survive the cold. But a newly identified member of the offbeat caterpillar club might be the weirdest of all. Nicknamed the “bone collector,” it builds a disguise from insect cadavers it scrounges from a spiderweb, covering its body with these spider-meal leftovers—and occasionally engaging in cannibalism.

It took researchers almost 17 years to convince themselves that this behavior was not some kind of anomaly among a couple of individuals. After meticulous observations and fieldwork, they finally confirmed that bone collector caterpillars, with all their macabre eccentricity, are the larvae of a new species that is native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The finding was published on Thursday in Science.

“I just couldn't believe it. The first couple of times you find that, you think it's got to be a one-off—it's got to be a mistake,” says the study's lead author Daniel Rubinoff, an entomologist at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. “I've been looking at it for over a decade, and it still blows my mind.”

So how exactly did these caterpillars take on this hardcore habit? The answer is probably evolutionary, Rubinoff says. Bone collector caterpillars grow up to be moths, like most caterpillars do, but these moths tend to lay their eggs in a spiderweb's nooks and crannies. A newly hatched caterpillar then collects bones to “camouflage itself from the spider landlord,” Rubinoff says. “The only chance they have of making a living in this situation is to decorate or die; they live for fashion.”

Setting aside the threat of becoming spider food, for a bone collector caterpillar, a web is actually a great place to snack on the arachnid's leftovers, such as a beetle's wings or a fly's soft tissue. The web is thus an “unexploited niche” of food and protection from other predators, Rubinoff says. Harder bits get added to its protective casing.

These bone collectors are not quite parasitic, nor are they considered symbiotic with spiders. They're more like a scavenger in the way they pick from meals that a spider might have otherwise finished. Plus, Rubinoff notes, they're cannibalistic. “That just gives you a sense of how they go after food—and recognize that there's food inside things that maybe don't look like food,” he says.

And these critters are far from the only strange, funky caterpillars roaming Hawaii. The bone collector belongs to a native genus of moths called Hyposmocoma, whose larvae are commonly referred to as Hawaiian fancy case caterpillars. They have lived in these islands for millions of years, says Akito Kawahara, who is director of the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at the Florida Museum and was not involved in the new work. “They've adapted to the environment because the conditions of Hawaii are very different from other places around the world,” he explains.

Some of these adaptations have resulted in “bizarre morphology and life history,” says Cornell University entomologist Patrick M. O'Grady, who was also not involved in the study. Several Hyposmocoma species are known to be carnivorous. Others are aquatic and live under Hawaii's streams.

“Insects do everything,” Kawahara adds. “They're amazing. In some ways, I was not surprised [by the bone collectors] because I know insects do some really crazy things.”

For Rubinoff, who has studied insects for more than two decades, species like the bone collector are a constant reminder of “how little we know about insect diversity—even in places [where] we should know it pretty well” such as Hawaii, which is comparatively easy to access. “We're finding stuff that we didn't even imagine was out there,” he adds. “It wasn't something that was even on our radar. But it shows how interesting evolution can be. It really is—I don't want to say magic—but it's incredible.”

Iga Swiatek avoided another stunning loss to Alexandra Eala at a WTA 1000 event with a three-set comeback in the second round of the Mutua Madrid Open on Thursday, with the No. 2 seed and defending champion rallying from a set and a break deficit to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.The first hour of the match looked like a carbon-copy of Eala's 6-2, 7-5 upset of Swiatek in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open last month, in which the former junior US Open champion announced her arrival at tour level. Swiatek racked up 25 unforced errors in the first set, and lost serve four times en route to trailing Eala 6-4, 3-2. But the world No. 2, defending 4000 ranking points in the coming weeks after winning Madrid, Rome and Roland Garros last year, cleaned up her tennis and found her way through a pulsating comeback in two hours and 15 minutes.""It wasn't easy to get into the rhythm and feel the right timing, so I'm happy that I was just patient,"" Swiatek confessed post-match after making 57 unforced errors. She finished with 40 winners, 29 of which came in sets two and three. At one stage early in the second set, Eala had won two-thirds of her points off of Swiatek's mistakes.In her post-match press conference, which came after 30 minutes on the practice court, Swiatek admitted that despite being 13-2 in Madrid in her career entering the match, she struggled to adapt to the conditions.

""It's never so easy to adjust to the altitude here, and the first practices I played here was much colder,"" Swiatek said. ""Yesterday it was hotter, but we only had like one hour to do stuff, so it wasn't exactly the same feelings as I had on the match.""The balls were for sure flying a little bit out of control from my racquet, so I got the tension a little bit higher in the second set, and then it was better. But still, yeah, like when you're not starting well it sometimes takes a little bit more time to find your game, but then I did so I'm glad.""She also admitted that the surface aided her as she worked her way into the match.""Yesterday [the media] asked me how different the game is going to be, and for sure, like, on clay I feel like I have a little bit more advantage sometimes in the situations, where Alexandra could, you know, take more advantage on faster hard courts,"" she said.

Swiatek escaped her earliest loss at any WTA 1000 event, on any surface, in nearly four years with the three-set win, her first in a deciding set since she topped Linda Noskova from a set behind in the third round of the Qatar Total Open in February. She last lost in the second round at the 2021 Cincinnati Open.Swiatek will face Noskova again in her next match in Madrid, seeking to beat the Czech for a fourth straight time since losing to her in the third round of the 2024 Australian Open.
