                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before heading to Ontario to film the fourth season of “The Way Home,” cast members Chyler Leigh, Andie MacDowell, Sadie Laflamme-Snow and Evan Williams reunited for a special screening of their Hallmark Channel series' third season on April 22, 2025. Hosted by Hallmark Media at the private Hollywood club and luxury hotel The Aster, it was a party with a purpose. Known among Hollywood insiders as a “For Your Consideration (FYC)” event, Hallmark is one of many networks hosting screenings for Emmy voters, hoping they'll consider “The Way Home” as they nominate shows, casts, and crews for the 2025 Emmy Awards. Attendees at “The Way Home” FYC event were treated to a screening, panel discussion, treat bags, and an array of food from sliders to gorgeous charcuterie boards piled with meats, cheeses, and fruits. Beverages included custom drinks based on the show, including a “Landry Lemonade Stand” with Desert Rose, Sunset and Topanga Canyon flavors. They also offered a specialty cocktail called “The Pond Hopper,” in honor of the show's time-travel pond, made with lavender gin, elderflower and tonic. The cast joined “The Way Home” showrunners Heather Conkie and Alexandra Clarke, as well as series co-creator and executive producer Marly Reed, for a panel discussion moderated by Variety's Emily Longeretta. Whether the screening and party swayed Emmy voters remains to be seen; nominees for the 2025 Emmys will be announced on July 15, per Entertainment Weekly. One tweeted, “The way these pics made me instantly emo because I miss my them sm! Jordan Doww, who joined the cast in season three, couldn't get over a shot posted by photographer Justin Nunez at the event, writing multiple comments under the Instagram post, including writing, “i actually can't handle this.”</p>

This adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's own award-winning historical novel stars Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley as William Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes. It hits select theaters the same time as “Zootopia 2” and expands right as “Avatar: Fire & Ash” and “Spongebob: Search for Square Pants” begin their rollouts. It also marks a return for Zhao to independent filmmaking after helming Marvel's “Eternals” in 2021.

As part of Sony's presentation, Mescal was brought out for the cast reveal of Sam Mendes' four-film biopic series on “The Beatles,” in which he will be playing Paul McCartney. He was joined by Joseph Quinn (George Harrison), Harris Dickinson (John Lennon), and Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr). Mendes also serves as an executive producer on “Hamnet” alongside Steven Spielberg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, Blumhouse Television has acquired rights to Marisha Pessl's No. 1 national bestseller Darkly to turn into a TV series, which will be executive produced by Jamie Lee Curtis through her company Comet Pictures' first-look deal with the independent studio. Search for a writer to adapt the psychological YA thriller novel. Darkly was published on November 26, 2024 by Penguin Random House. In it, Arcadia “Dia” Gannon has been obsessed with Louisiana Veda, the game designer whose obsessive creations and company, Darkly, have gained a cultlike following. Dia is shocked when she's chosen for a highly coveted internship, along with six other teenagers from around the world. Dia has never won anything in her life. Darkly, once a game-making empire renowned for its ingenious and utterly terrifying toys and games, now lies dormant after Veda's mysterious death. As Dia and her fellow interns delve into the heart of Darkly, they discover hidden symbols, buried clues and a web of intrigue. Who are these other teens, and what secrets do they keep? At Blumhouse TV, the project will be shepherded by the division's incoming president Melissa Aouate who starts later this month. Curtis' deal with Blumhouse already has yielded two series executive produced by her: The Sticky, starring Margo Martindale, and the upcoming Scarpetta, in which Curtis also stars opposite Nicole Kidman, both for Prime Video. Curtis is repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. Pessl won the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize for her debut novel, Special Topics In Calamity Physics.

Given the obscure French title (which translates to “star” and typically refers to the lead dancer in a ballet company) as well as the rarefied air of its subject matter (professional ballet and its hoity-toity benefactors), perhaps the Amazon Prime Video “comedy's” impermeability should have been expected. But for those of us who have enjoyed past efforts from the showrunner (and her partner), it's just strange. After all, the distinct, celebrated voice behind “Gilmore Girls” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” has long relayed her stories via rat-a-tat dialogue that — so long as they're not intimidated by rapid chatter — can coax viewers into bemused submission. In between, arguments are made and relationships are built, but the sometimes laborious work of exposition and table-setting can become effervescent when delivered at Sherman-Palladino's melodic meter. Add in charming performances, sparkling locales, and a relatable story (not to mention an ample helping of quippy cultural references) and giving in is often as easy as clicking play. Related Stories Golden Globes 2026 Set for Slightly Later Date Than Usual ‘Havoc' Review: Tom Hardy Shoots His Way to Redemption in Explosive Netflix Crime Saga from ‘The Raid' Director Gareth Evans “Étoile” still sports its creator's trademark talking, but it's less amplified and more scattered. Splitting its time between New York City and Paris, “Étoile” starts with its two central ballet companies in the same place, sharing a night of fun before a day of business. He props up his talented staff when they refuse to comply with basic, bureaucratic HR requests; he takes abbreviated, life-affirming breaks throughout his busy day to watch young amateurs and seasoned professionals practice their moves; he goes home at night, six sheets to the wind, and turns on old dance movies (Mikhail Baryshnikov in “White Nights”) or watches archival recordings of performances from the family theater. His Parisian counterpart is Geneviève Lavigne (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the interim director of l'Opera Francais and Le Ballet National. She, too, loves the art-form, enjoying a night on the dance floor at a New York nightclub almost as much as she seems to savor the ensuing argument over who would win in a fight between ballet legends: renowned Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky or modern American dancer Misty Copeland. But unlike Jack, whose lineage doubles as job security, Geneviève is fighting tooth and nail to drop the “interim” tag from her title, and so far, it's a losing battle. Her overseers (led by a hostile Minister of Culture) aren't too happy with her ideas for the future, including the gambit that brought her across the Atlantic to meet with Jack. Geneviève wants to arrange a trade: the best and brightest of her Parisian ballet company for the same from Jack's New York contingent. She sees a marketing opportunity in the showy exchange of stars, which should attract significant press coverage and could even be bolstered by a supporting reality show. But more than that, Geneviève sees a need. Audiences just aren't turning out for ballet like they used to, and the waning support is evident in unoccupied theater seats, dried-up donations, and a slow-down in government funding. COVID only exacerbated these problems, with established dancers falling out of shape or being forced to seek out more sustainable careers, and up-and-coming étoiles left with nowhere to go for training or inspiration. So why not jump-start the cultural conversation around ballet with a big, year-long, transatlantic showcase? Well, that's where “Étoile” starts to lose its footing. To fund Geneviève's idea, she's arranged for cash from an abominable source: Crispin Shamblee (Simon Callow), a fellow dance devotee with a limitless checkbook and zero morals. A chemical weapons manufacturer who sells his wares to “God know who,” “Crispy” (as he prefers to be called) is presented as a necessary evil. “That man delivered the eulogy at Rush Limbaugh's funeral!” And yet, “Étoile” seems perfectly happy being fooled. Crispy pops in, time and again, as comic relief. He calls from his private jet dressed like Snoopy, complete with red scarf and old-timey goggles. He's repeatedly described as the worst of humanity yet consistently treated like a cartoon cutie pie. My goodness, I haven't even introduced the dancers. Mishi (Taïs Vinolo) is a young French star who's been living and thriving in New York for the past two years. When she's forced to go back home — a triumphant return, as framed by her mother, the Minister of Culture — she struggles to fit in… for eight hours. Tobias (Gideon Glick, who was also in the writers' room) suffers from similar stagnation. Glick's performance is buoyant and goofy; one of the few comedic constants (in addition to Crispy) in what Amazon insists is best described as a comedy. But his arc is predictable and too slow to develop. Cheyenne refuses to budge on even the smallest of issues, respects no opinion but her own, and recoils from any off-stage responsibilities whatsoever, but she's an incredible performer, and the masses flock to see her trip the light fantastic. She shies away from being too stereotypical by abhorring extravagance. By her own admission, Cheyenne would rather be out saving the whales than prancing across a stage. “But it's who I am, so there is no choice.” De Laâge channels Cheyenne's diva energy with an inflexible ferocity that slowly gives way to sudden vulnerability. But such benefits can be tough to notice. Multiple episodes are bloated and jumbled at over an hour. So many shots are content to replicate what an audience would see from their seats, occasionally moving closer as if the onlooker brought a pair of binoculars, but rarely providing views that could only be captured by a camera. Why not show us their perspective, rather than more of our own? So little interest is shown in the physical and mental demands of professional dancers, it's no wonder the closest we come to feeling like we understand what they're going through is during the closing credits, when a montage of actual behind-the-scenes footage includes a few moments of tricky costuming and time-consuming stretches. Despite its budget and resources (much of the New York story takes place in and around Lincoln Center), the series feels like it's told by ballet patrons, for ballet patrons — people who like watching pretty people glide across a stage, but lack the curiosity to ask why or how they do it, let alone share the answers with an audience without access to The Met. When you can't hear the melody, it's awfully hard to dance. “Étoile” premieres Thursday, April 24 on Amazon Prime Video. All eight episodes will be released at once.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five friends find themselves stuck in a time-loop nightmare in this offering based on the PlayStation game and penned by Blair Butler and Gary Dauberman. The stakes of this feature are also expectedly high: To avoid death, this crew of recognizable archetypes must outmaneuver their adversaries. And there's even a twist that fans of the PlayStation game will immediately clock. 'Until Dawn' Video Game Adaptation Adds Maia Mitchell, Belmont Cameli and Peter Stormare (Exclusive) Written by Blair Butler and Gary Dauberman (Annabelle, Salem's Lot), Until Dawn is the latest offering in a cinematic landscape littered with game-inspired movies. And while Until Dawn doesn't have the same cultural popularity as the Swedish world-building game, it does have a dedicated fan base who were converted by the original game, which included voice work from Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek. Release date: Friday, April 25Cast: Ella Rubin, Michael Cimino, Odessa A'zion, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Maia Mitchell, Peter StormareDirector: David F. SandbergScreenwriters: Gary Dauberman, Blair Butler But instead of tailoring the existing backstory for screen audiences, they conjure up an entirely new one premised on five friends, played by a charming set of newcomers, on a “healing” road trip through the countryside. It's been a year since Clover (Ella Rubin) suffered the dual loss of her mother, who passed away, and her sister, Melanie (Maia Mitchell), who disappeared soon after their mother died. In a misguided attempt to help her move through grief, Clover's friends decide to take a trip retracing Melanie's final steps. The group includes Clover's chronically worried ex-boyfriend Max (Michael Cimino); their occult-obsessed pal Megan (Ji-young Yoo, excellent); emotionally avoidant Nina (Odessa A'zion); and Nina's new boyfriend Abe (Belmont Cameli), who can't let a moment pass without telling people that he majored in psychology. These young adults are all a little messed up, but their relationships with each other keep them anchored. That's why they are traversing the middle of nowhere with Clover, who's been despondent and, we gather, psychologically fragile since last year. They find chilling clues during their brief snooping: Abe comes across a billboard filled with photos of missing people, including Melanie; Nina discovers a visitor log with the names of those individuals, written multiple times in increasingly scraggly script; Megan gets a bad vibe from the place, as if the spirits are trying to tell her something; and Clover swears she hears Melanie calling her from the strangely foggy wooded area. When the slasher eventually appears, stealing the group's car before murdering them with a humorous bluntness, there is also a real atmosphere of dread. But the best parts of Until Dawn are merely blips in a film whose entire schtick gets stale fast. After the mysterious slasher, in the style of Michael Myers, kills Clover, Max, Megan, Nina and Abe, all five of them come back to life. Each night presents a new way of dying (stabbings, exploding limbs, axes to the head), as Sandberg borrows from slasher movies, psychological horror, monster flicks and more. Jennifer Spence's ace production design imbues this abandoned mine town with an appropriate spookiness and, working with cinematographer Maxime Alexandre, Sandberg stages some effectively nightmarish scenes. But even those can't cover for the gaping plot holes and uneven performances that inspire more confusion about the movie's intended impact. The closer these young adults get to figuring out the mystery behind their time-looped captivity, the more Until Dawn relies on visual shortcuts — at one point a character realizes they have been trapped for 13 nights even though audiences only experience four or five nights of death — to wrap things up and leans into pat pop psychology to plump itself with meaning. How fascinating that a part of the marketing for this muddled film involved viewers repeatedly watching it for 12 hours in hopes of winning a cash prize.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said. In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen. “I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.” In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began. Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion. “I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com. “Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.” The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.” PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. Am I correct?” Dorit responded that she was wrong. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.” Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. You can only take the high road for so long.” “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Selena Gomez sings and dances to the beat of her own drum in the award-winning musical thriller Emilia Pérez, starring as Jessi Del Monte, a rebellious woman on a journey of radical transformation. And that's just one of her latest career milestones. In an industry that often aims to box you into categories, Gomez is a shapeshifter, constantly redefining what it means to be a global powerhouse today. In the last 12 months, Gomez, who has meticulously crafted a blueprint for her multi-hyphenate standing, garnered a Golden Globe best supporting actress nomination for Emilia Pérez; won a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in Only Murders in the Building; the LP I Said I Love You First, which she released in March with fiancé Benny Blanco, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart, becoming Gomez's fourth leader on the chart; and through her Rare Impact Fund, Gomez continues to work to increase access to mental health for young people. Now, on April 24, she will be honored at Billboard and Telemundo's annual Latin Women in Music gala with the Woman of the Year award. “I think anytime as women we show up and support each other, it truly is so beautiful and important,” Gomez tells Billboard. “I will say being honored at Latin Women in Music is incredibly special to me though. My Mexican heritage is something that has influenced me my entire life and it's not lost on me how representation matters. Named after fellow Texan, the legendary Selena Quintanilla, Gomez — whose paternal grandparents are Mexican — catapulted to fame as a child actor in Barney & Friends at 10 years old and subsequently starred on the Disney Channel show Wizards of Waverly Place as the ultra-cool and spunky teenage wizard Alex Russo. But it's perhaps her career as a recording artist that solidified her pop icon status boasting of 42 entries on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, and seven top 10 LPs on the Billboard 200, including three leaders on that tally. While she has mainly recorded in English, Gomez has always stayed close to her roots, and recording in Spanish felt almost inevitable. Her first big splash in Latin music came in 2019, thanks to a feature on DJ Snake's “Taki Taki,” alongside hitmakers Ozuna and Cardi B. 1 on the Hot Latin Songs chart in 2018, ruling for 13 weeks. Since then, Gomez has achieved three additional top 10 hits on the ranking, among them “Baila Conmigo,” her collaboration with Rauw Alejandro, which peaked at No. That collab is part of her first-ever Spanish-language project: Revelación. Over the years, I'd release a Spanish version of one of the songs off an album but having an all-Spanish project was something that meant a lot to me. Navigating a bicultural identity, especially one that has a double standard (you should assimilate and learn English but also be fluent in Spanish), is one that even Selena Quintanilla faced in her early days. Gomez recently faced similar scrutiny when critics questioned her Spanish-speaking skills on Emilia Pérez, even though she plays the role of an American who lives in Mexico and who is not meant to be fluent in the role. Gomez — who alongside her co-stars Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofía Gascón and Adriana Paz won best actress award for the ensemble cast at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival — says Emilia Pérez is a film she'll “hold dear forever.” “I pushed myself into uncomfortable spaces which as an actress are the most rewarding. Gomez's Latin heritage is constantly present in her work. “ 'El Muchacho De Los Ojos Tristes' to me is one of those cross generational songs that brings people together no matter how old you are. You either knew as an adult or something your mother or abuela listened to so it conjures up nostalgic memories. Gomez is equally proud of her work in activism as a leading voice in advocating for mental health and social justice for underrepresented communities. In 2019, she executive produced Living Undocumented, a Netflix docuseries that poignantly tackled the immigration crisis in the U.S. She has also transformed the youth mental health landscape by mobilizing over $20 million in funds with philanthropic partners across five continents. “At the end of the day I believe it matters to be vocal about issues that matter to you, whether you are famous or not. It's not for the faint of heart, because you are putting yourself out there and trust me there will be a lot of opinions that come at you for even having the nerve to say anything at all,” Gomez says. Eight years after being named Billboard's Woman of the Year, Gomez's influence in music and beyond is even more tangible today, a testament to her impact and legacy. “Blocking out the noise and being true to yourself,” she says. “The noise can be overwhelming, and I am not saying it's easy but by doing that and not compromising who you are, it goes a long way.” The third annual Billboard Latin Women in Music special will air live at 9 p.m. Read Billboard's Latin Women In Music 2025 executive list here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Firmly established as an icon to British youth, the Londoner discusses his upcoming fourth album, masculinity in the wake of Netflix's Adolescence and his huge Glastonbury slot. The shift in Loyle Carner's persona in recent times is exemplified by the opening songs on his two most recent LPs. On “Hate,” the scorching opener to 2022's hugo, the south Londoner starts by offering to “let me tell you about what I hate.” He rages against racial profiling, the limited opportunities for young Black men, the pitfalls of his own success and his relationship with his father, concluding: “I fear the color of my skin.” The opening track — as yet unannounced — is built around a skittish drum beat and soft guitars, and sees Carner, a father of two, singing amid the hum of domesticity. The 30-year-old arrives in London on a break from filming a TV project in Scotland, excited about an upcoming holiday with his girlfriend and two children. (due June 20) is about healing, unconditional love and this new phase of his life; recent double A-side “all i need” and “in my mind” both showcase a sense of serenity and contentment with his lot. throughout was quite healthy,” he says in a quiet corner of Shoreditch Studios. Now he's just grateful for the joy these songs give him. For the past decade, attention has closely followed Carner (born Ben Coyle-Larner) on his journey to becoming a British youth icon. His debut live performance was supporting MF Doom at a show in Dublin, and by age 17, he was on tour with hip-hop don Nas. Debut LP Yesterday's Gone (2017) was a love letter to the rap that supported him following the death of his stepfather and earned him a nomination for the prestigious Mercury Prize; his sophomore record, Not Waving, But Drowning (2019), spawned a number of streaming hits, including the jazz-tinged “Ottolenghi.” Throughout his career, he has used his platform to campaign for better awareness of ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), something that he lives with, and the benefits of cooking to help manage those symptoms. His singular voice is a crucial one for Gen Z at a time when British male stars are lacking, and his live shows attract a wide cross-section of U.K. youth culture. Across the record, he ruminated on his mixed-race heritage (Carner's mother is white; his biological father is Guyanese) and his place in British society, enlisting esteemed poet John Agard for a spoken word meditation on “Georgetown,” produced by Madlib. On “Blood on My Nikes,” Carner contemplates the knife crime epidemic among young men — both as victims and perpetrators — in the capital. It's a socially conscious record, but not overwhelmingly bleak, either; he knows when to pair light with shade in order to document the human experience. For many years, the pair were estranged, with Carner describing him as “present at times and not present at other times.” hugo was written and recorded as Carner became a father himself, reflecting on the cycle of resentment and anguish, and how to rebuild a parental relationship. hugo became his highest-charting and best-selling album yet, landing at No. 3 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart and earning him another Mercury Prize nomination. The Guardian called it a “beautiful, blistering masterpiece.” He reimagined the album with an orchestra for a one-off show at London's Royal Albert Hall, headlined Wembley Arena and then hosted an even bigger performance at London's All Points East Festival in August 2024. The 35,000-capacity gig cemented his place at British music's top table, with a supporting cast of OutKast's André 3000 and, to come full circle, Nas. In June, he'll headline Glastonbury's The Other Stage, putting him on a par with Charli xcx and The Prodigy. “I still have people messaging me saying, ‘Yo, I just heard that album for the first time yesterday, and it made me want to go and connect with my mum, or grandad,' or whoever. More in tune with his love for alternative and indie music, his hip-hop stylings make way for inspiration by Irish rockers Fontaines D.C., cult star Mk.gee, Big Thief, Idles and more. The band he assembled for hugo's live shows followed him into the studio to bring new textures to his compositions. I just make music, and people like to put me in that box,” he says. “I loved the anonymity of being in a band. I wanted to be around when the magic is happening and to not just be sent a beat after all the fun parts had already happened. Carner's pen is still mighty, but in a different way. On 2019's “Still,” which he described as his “favourite-ever song” during its performance at the Royal Albert Hall, he speaks about his insecurities with a disarming honesty. The rhyming couplets on hugo's “Nobody Knows (Ladas Road)” and “Homerton” show remarkable dexterity. It's a skill he learned from his poet heroes like Agard and the late, great Benjamin Zephaniah, the man Carner was named after. As his family has grown, Carner's techniques and influences have changed. 's artwork features a snap of Carner and his son, with colorful scrawls and additions only a child can make with such purpose. Words could not contain the emotions Carner feels toward him, so the songs became looser, less literal but still emotionally resonant, and with a greater focus on capturing his son's “melodic” personality in his songwriting structures. On one album highlight, Carner speaks of the transition of becoming a father and notes that he's “falling asleep in a chair I used to write in.” Later, he speaks directly to his son, saying, “You give me hope in humankind.” He has learned to embrace sonic imperfections and to capture a feeling, letting broad brushstrokes stand proudly. There's a childlike wonder to the rawness of these songs; from snatches of phrases to choruses that linger in your head long after music has ended. “That's what I love about my son's paintings. It might even be just one line across the page, but the simplicity of how he works and moves on. Carner used the opportunity to embrace his role as a producer-curator. “He never says, ‘Dad you're way out of tune,' even if I know that I am.” Here, Carner's voice has an intimate quality, like he's caught singing under his breath without a thought as to who might hear it. It's that kind of bravery to me that is a reflection of what it was like to be a man. This living, breathing, feeling, flawed, emotional person that is willing to turn over heavy stones and be accountable for failing.” The forthcoming LP encouraged him to embrace his softer side and the personality traits that Carner wished he had experienced with his biological father. “Me and my dad are cool now, but he wasn't really around when I was young,” he says. It was time to take a different approach. Carner has long been an advocate for a more healthy relationship with masculinity, having worked with suicide prevention charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably). He gave a passionate speech at Reading & Leeds Festival in August 2023 decrying the “toxic masculine bulls–t” that plagued his childhood. His records and shows have helped unlock certain conversations, but the issue remains prescient. Netflix's streaming hit Adolescence, which examines the fallout from a misogynistic murder by a 13-year-old boy, has sparked new discussions around the manosphere and its pervasive influence. Carner saw the intensity of the show — which uses one-shot takes — up close on-set; he's close friends with actor-creator Stephen Graham and director Philip Barantini. The topics at hand need urgent attention, Carner says. “That's a huge thing for me, and also for me to be in the presence of someone who is growing up to be a woman. The aforementioned Zephaniah features on hopefully !, a full-circle moment for Carner, given his profound influence on his life and as a male role model. “He articulates something that my brain has always wanted to say about masculinity,” Carner says. And nobody knows how to deal with it.” “He's saying what I'm saying about having pent-up rage and emotion; I'd rather use my pen to express it that way in a palatable and safe way.” Zephaniah's work, Carner says, taught him how to be a man who feels secure in himself. “His work shows the joy of not taking life so seriously and realizing that it's fine to be a bit lighter or softer, and know that it doesn't discredit my legacy or my story to be silly and to let go.” Later this year, Carner will head on a mammoth U.K. and Ireland tour that takes in residencies at some of the nation's most historic venues, like London's Brixton Academy and Manchester, England's Victoria Warehouse. Recent headliners on the coveted Other Stage include Megan Thee Stallion and Lana Del Rey — comfortably putting him in the big leagues alongside international superstars. When the slot is mentioned, he's speechless for a moment. “It feels like an amazing, monumental part of my career,” Carner eventually says. It's just one page in this new chapter. In March, it was announced that Carner would star in an acting role for BBC's upcoming crime drama Mint, directed by Charlotte Regan (Scrapper) alongside Emma Laird (28 Years Later) and Sam Riley (Control). The new disciplines that have come with being on-set have inspired him to write and direct his own upcoming project. There are many strings to Carner's bow as a complex, charismatic cultural figure. to come out and for his children to hear the snapshot of this moment, about this family, and about the man their dad was when they were little. “I haven't even thought about it, actually.
