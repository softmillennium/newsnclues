Apple Park's spaceship campus.

Apple Inc. will remove its secret robotics unit from the command of its artificial intelligence chief, the latest shake-up in response to the company's AI struggles.

Apple plans to relocate the robotics team from John Giannandrea's AI organization to the hardware division later this month, according to people with knowledge of the move. That will place it under Senior Vice President John Ternus, who oversees hardware engineering, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change isn't public. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta has laid off employees in its Reality Labs division that is tasked with developing virtual reality, augmented reality and related wearable devices. The cuts affected an unspecified number of employees working in the division's Oculus Studios unit, which develops VR and AR games and content for Meta's Quest VR headsets, a company spokesperson told CNBC. "Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size," the spokesperson said. "These changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today." "We're deeply saddened to share that these changes have resulted in the loss of some of our incredibly talented team members," the company said in a statement posted to the Supernatural official Facebook group. "Their contributions have been instrumental in shaping our journey and yours, and their absence will be deeply felt." The cuts to Reality Labs come after Meta in February laid off 5% of its overall workforce that it deemed to be its lowest performers. Meta's Reality Labs division logged an operating loss of $4.97 billion while scoring $1.1 billion in sales during the fourth quarter, the company said in January. The social media company reports earnings on Wednesday. WATCH: Mark Zuckerberg takes witness stand on first day of antitrust trial. We want to hear from you.

Bill Hwang's Archegos Collapse:

Nomura Holdings head office in Tokyo.

Nomura Holdings Inc. is weighing a return to offering cash prime-brokerage services in the US and Europe, businesses it largely exited just four years ago following the implosion of Archegos Capital Management.

As part of the push, Nomura hired Matias Bercun, a 17-year veteran of Barclays Plc, to run the prime brokerage business globally, according to people familiar with the matter. Nomura officials have already held discussions with regulators in Japan about its latest plans, the people said, asking not to be named discussing non-public information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The stock market is about to flash an incredibly rare bullish signal: the Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator. If it does flash, it would suggest that stocks are about to enter a new bullish phase and that the tariff-induced decline from earlier this month represented "the" bottom for risk assets. It was developed by investor and author of "Winning on Wall Street, Martin Zweig. Since 1945, the indicator has only flashed 18 times, with the most recent signal occurring in November 2023. The calculation derives a percentage, and when it falls below 40% and then surges above 61.5% in 10 days or less, the indicator is triggered. The 10th day of the countdown clock is Friday, so stocks need to muster a continued rally driven by broad participation to flash the bullish signal. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, has been closely following the indicator over the past week. "Although the computation is a tad confusing, the bottom line is many stocks went from oversold to overbought in a short time frame," Detrick told BI. "This is what you tend to see at the beginning of new bullish phases." The Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator has a perfect track record of predicting positive stock market gains in the six and twelve months after it flashes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The uncertainty around trade tariffs is complex but a period of uncertainty also provides Europe with an opportunity to assert itself as an economic and geopolitical superpower, the governor of the Bank of Latvia told CNBC Thursday. "With all this uncertainty and vulnerability, this is also the time of opportunities for Europe," said Mārtiņš Kazāks, who is also a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank. "It's a time for Europe to grasp all the aspects of being an economic superpower and becoming a really fully-fledged political and geopolitical superpower, and this requires doing all the decisions that in the past, were not carried out fully," after the global financial crisis, he said. The central bank chief cited a capital markets union, fiscal union and a single market in services as examples of further integration that were needed. "This requires political will, political guts to make those decisions, and to strengthen the European economy and assert its place in a global world," Kazāks told CNBC's Carolin Roth on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank spring meetings in Washington this week. When asked what tariffs mean for the ECB, which implemented a 25-basis-point interest rate cut at its April meeting, Kazāks said decisions would be taken "from meeting-to-meeting because of this very poor visibility." "The uncertainty is very hard," he noted, adding that "it's certainly a very vulnerable situation for the global economy." Kazāks said financial markets should be monitored very carefully for any dramatic shifts in sentiment. "So far it seems to be relatively orderly ... but if one looks at the spillovers to Europe, the financial markets are working more or less fine, we haven't seen spreads exploding or anything like that," he said. Although the initial duties announced in early April by U.S President Donald Trump, as well as the EU's retaliatory countermeasures, were paused for 90 days until July, there are concerns over the wider impact on regional and global economic growth once that period ends. The IMF earlier this week forecast that U.S. gross domestic product would expand 1.8% in 2025, down 0.9 percentage points from its January forecast. The fund also cut its global growth forecast to 2.8% this year, down 0.5 percentage points from its previous estimate. The fund predicted a slight decline in the euro zone, forecasting that euro area GDP will hit 0.8% in 2025, before picking up modestly to 1.2% in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said Thursday she thinks policymakers need to be patient rather than preemptive in assessing how tariffs will impact inflation and growth. In her first broadcast interview since taking the reins at the central bank district in August 2024, Hammack noted the high level of uncertainty now and did not commit to a specific course of action regarding interest rate policy. I think this is a time when we want to make sure we're moving in the right direction, than moving too quickly in the wrong direction," she told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "So I would rather take our time to make sure we're looking at the data, the hard data ... which are actually really good." Hammack's remarks come at a sensitive time for the Federal Reserve, which has been left to assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on both inflation and employment. Several central bank officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have said the duties pose threats to both sides of the Fed's "dual mandate," posing another challenge on how to calibrate monetary policy. Hammack also voiced concerns over how the Fed might balance those priorities. "It could be that we have the two sides of our mandate and conflict, which is the most challenging for monetary policy," she said. "If it's higher inflation, lower employment, that's where things get really complicated." Markets strongly expect the Fed will stand pat on interest rates when it meets May 6-7, then resume cutting rates in June with the likelihood of a total three or four reductions by the end of the year, according to CME Group data. "If we have convincing data by June, then I think you'll see the committee move if we know which way to move at that point," Hammack said. However, uncertainty over tariff policy and how the Fed might react has contributed to substantial market volatility in recent months, with stocks struggling, Treasury yields rising and the U.S. dollar falling. A former Goldman Sachs executive, Hammack said she is sensitive to market movements but only in how they affect broader economic conditions. "Our job is not to focus on what the markets are doing. Hammack noted that the "hard" economic data such as unemployment and inflation is still relatively good, while "soft" data such as surveys shows elevated levels of concern. "It's creating issues for them in terms of planning, in terms of thinking about where they're going to go, and so some of them have put pauses on whether they're going to make bigger investments, whether they're going to invest in new facilities, new capital plans, and then they're thinking about their hiring plans."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A quiet revolution is reshaping the business model of software-as-a-service. The SaaS industry is shifting from monthly "per seat" licenses to embrace usage-based, pay-as-you-go pricing. This isn't just a pricing experiment; it may be an economic necessity for some companies as they adjust to the cost of running AI-powered software services. If you've been reading my stories, you'll know I warned that the generative AI revolution would bring major pricing changes to some internet businesses. Back in January 2024, I wrote that it costs a lot to build AI models, and noted that Big Tech companies were looking for new sources of revenue growth, such as subscriptions. Now, there's a new breed of "reasoning" AI model that's really expensive to run. They loop through steps, check their work, and do it all again — a process called inference-time compute. As enterprises integrate AI into core workflows, building agents, copilots, and other complex decision tools, each query becomes more compute-hungry. And when millions of users are involved, those costs scale fast. The result: Software companies may struggle to keep charging flat monthly fees if AI usage and compute costs spike and become wildly uneven across their customer bases. This has been a clean, predictable model that worked well when marginal usage costs were near zero. With inference compute costs high and rising, flat pricing becomes a potential financial liability. "Elevated compute costs for AI agents may drive a higher cost of revenue compared to traditional SaaS offerings, forcing companies to rethink their cost-management strategies," consulting firm AlixPartners, wrote in a recent study about AI threats to software companies. Instead of charging per user, companies are beginning to charge based on activity, whether that's tokens consumed, queries run, automations executed, or models accessed. Sam Altman floated an idea like this for OpenAI last month. "It's better aligned with customer success," Vercel CFO Marten Abrahamsen told me in an interview. Younger companies like Bolt.new, Vercel, and Replit are at the forefront. Bolt.new, a low-code platform powered by AI agents, saw a major inflection in revenue growth after shifting from per-seat pricing to usage-based tiers. Its plans now scale with tokens consumed, from casual hobbyists to full-time power users. Meanwhile, Braze and Monday.com have introduced hybrid pricing models, mixing base seat licenses with pay-per-use AI credits. For Monday.com, many seat-based customers get 500 AI credits to use each month. ServiceNow, one of the SaaS players, has added usage-based pricing, but only as a small add-on to an otherwise predictable, seat-based offering. CEO Bill McDermott told me the company spent years building a cheap, fast, and secure AI platform with help from Nvidia. He also noted that many of the big AI models out there, such as Meta's Llama and Google's Gemini, have become a lot cheaper to tap into lately. Still, ServiceNow weaved in usage-based pricing to protect itself in rare situations when customers are extremely active and use a huge amount of tokens that the company has to process. He stressed that customers can still rip through thousands of business processes before they hit this usage-based pricing tier. "We think it's the perfect goldilocks model, offering predictability, innovation, and thousands of free use cases." Barclays analysts argued recently that usage-based software companies, such as JFrog and Braze, should command premium valuations, especially as seat-based vendors face potential slower revenue growth from AI features that don't scale with user count. "We are hearing more concerns from investors that the ongoing prevalence of AI agents could lead to lower incremental revenue contributions from seat growth for SaaS vendors," the analysts wrote in a note to investors recently. This shift could lead to more volatility in quarterly revenue, but stronger long-term alignment with product value delivered, the analysts explained. The downside is that these are variable costs for customers. Instead of knowing exactly how much a service costs every month, your costs might rise unexpectedly if you get a lot of traffic, or your employees go nuts for new AI tools, for instance. There's a similar problem facing the companies providing these new AI-powered software services. That lumpy revenue is less attractive to investors, compared to the reliable monthly seat-based sales often generated by traditional SaaS providers. He says costs could easily get out of control if you use the tool heavily, or go down a design rabbit hole and keep tweaking something over and over. Anything that messes with this situation could be a concern, especially for end users. "A pricing model that's not predictive for the company and the consumer cannot stand," Slater told me in an interview. Expect to see more companies introduce token credits, pay-per-query pricing, or hybrid models in 2025, not just because it's more efficient, but because it may be the only way to stay afloat as AI adoption accelerates. Now, this could all change again if generative AI compute costs fall over time. That's happened in previous computing eras, and some experts see this happening again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has said he stepping away from DOGE and the West Wing, but there's one thing federal workers really want to know. Business Insider spoke to 17 federal workers after the Tesla CEO said on a Tuesday earnings call that he hopes to devote more time to the company because the "major work of establishing" DOGE is complete. Several federal workers brought up the "What did you do last week" email required by Musk's DOGE office since February. Many said they're skeptical that Musk will forfeit his White House influence. Even if he does, some said Musk's legacy will live on in DOGE through cuts to the federal workforce and government budget. Others are simply hopeful they'll have one less weekly email to send. Still, the federal workers BI spoke with said they expect him to continue making political headlines. A former employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that they aren't taking Musk's announcement seriously. An employee at the Office of Personnel Management added that Musk's vow to step back seems like "PR spin." Other federal workers said that even if Musk does leave DOGE, his actions will have a lasting impact on the government and its staff. Several workers expressed concern over reports that DOGE and Musk have access to sensitive information like internal government databases and Americans' Social Security details. Some talked about the anxiety that DOGE's federal firing spree has caused in their own lives. A few said they are constantly worried about losing their livelihoods. Federal workers who voted for Donald Trump and support his money-saving goals have previously told BI they felt betrayed by Musk's abrupt mass firings of what DOGE called "low performers." "There is a methodical way to downsize, and I'm all for right-sizing to meet current events," a Department of Agriculture employee said. And then there are the possible effects on their day-to-day work. Several federal workers told BI they hope Musk's departure signals the end of his "five bullets" email. Another IRS employee said they send nearly the same email every week. Musk said on Tuesday's Tesla call that he will still spend a day or two a week on government matters, "as long as it is useful" to the president. When reporters asked Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday about Musk's departure, he said that Musk "is an incredible guy" and "was a tremendous help both in the campaign and what he's done with DOGE." The possible DOGE shake-up comes alongside plummeting first-quarter Tesla earnings. Musk said last month that his role in the White House was "costing me a lot" and he was running his businesses with "great difficulty." With news that he could be retreating from Trumpworld, Tesla's stock was trading up over 5% after hours and jumped again Wednesday. One federal employee said they aren't surprised Musk is leaning back into his CEO role.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jay Leno, 74, says caring for his wife, Mavis, after she received her dementia diagnosis is just part of what love is all about. During an appearance on today's episode of "In Depth with Graham Bensinger," the former late-night host spoke about the challenges he faced being a caregiver to his wife. Or will I be like a sleazy guy if something happens to my wife, I'm out banging the cashier at the mini-mart?'" I enjoy the time with my wife. Only now, he has to help her with daily tasks. They don't have any children together. Leno was granted conservatorship over his wife's estate in 2024, according to court documents. "Well, that's the challenge, isn't it? When you have to feed someone and change them and carry them to the bathroom and do all that kind of stuff every day," Leno said. At the end of the day, he said, it's part of his commitment to her and their marriage vows. "At some point in my life, I'm going to be called upon to defend myself. I think that's really what defines a marriage. I mean, that's really what love is. I'm glad I didn't run off with some woman half my age or any of that silly nonsense. I would rather be with her than doing something else," Leno said. Leno isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about the experience of being a caregiver to a loved one. In a 2019 opinion piece for USA Today, Rob Lowe reflected on the experience of stepping up with his brothers to care for their mother after she learned she had stage 4 breast cancer. "I often felt overwhelmed, and that was even with all the support I had from my brothers and colleagues," Lowe wrote. Emma Heming Willis has also been open about her journey caring for her husband, Bruce Willis, after he received a frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in 2023. And, turning my pain into purpose," Heming Willis said in a 2023 Instagram Live. As the population ages, more and more people will probably need help with tasks at some point in their lifetime. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of caregivers in the US increased from 43.5 million in 2015 to about 53 million in 2020. A representative for Leno didn't immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chungin "Roy" Lee — the Columbia University student who went viral for creating an AI tool to "cheat" on job interviews — was suspended in March for posting content from a disciplinary hearing, the university said. Lee said on Monday that the San Francisco-based startup has raised $5.3 million, backed by Abstract Ventures and Susa Ventures. Speaking to Business Insider on Wednesday, Lee said that about 70,000 users have signed up for Cluely since its launch on Sunday. And this is just a lot more than we expected," he said. With one keyboard shortcut, Cluely scanned my screen. I could also speak to it through my mic. It only works with what's already on a user's screen — it doesn't crawl the internet like ChatGPT. But it reads everything, so I kept my Signal group chats closed. That's what makes it powerful — and also kind of terrifying. Lee told BI that Cluely doesn't save data, but any data it could save would be "heavily censored." "If there's something that you don't want to be seen, then you shouldn't use the tool, and it shouldn't be up while you're on sensitive information," Lee said. I deleted the app right after writing this story. Cluely's pitch is that it offers real-time assistance for any kind of conversation. I let it scan my LinkedIn profile and kept it open while my editor put me through a mock interview with the same questions I answered to land this job. First up: What is my media consumption like? Five seconds later, it gave me a summary of the question, not an answer. My editor tried again, more succinctly: "What media outlets do you read?" "I enjoy staying up to date with a mix of international and local news — typically from outlets like the New York Times, BBC, and CNA. I also listen to 'The Daily' and 'Planet Money' during my commute." My editor asked me to talk about a difficult story I've worked on. Ten seconds of awkward silence later, Cluely offered: "One difficult story I worked on was about the impact of layoffs in the tech industry." It completely missed the elementary Korean listed on my LinkedIn. When my editor asked if I had questions for her, Cluely suggested a few basics: What do you enjoy most about working here? What does success look like in this role? The answers were also too generic, occasionally wrong, and not tailored enough to me. It did generate decent answers to common questions. She also said my real answers were better than Cluely's. Lee told BI that Cluely is in "a really raw state." "Our servers are super overloaded, so there's a lot of latency," he said. But there have been "significant performance updates" since the app went out on Sunday, he added. "We've upgraded all our servers, we've optimized the algorithms, and right now it should be about three times faster, which makes it much more usable in conversations." Lee said hallucinations will "exist insofar as the base models that we use allow for them." There's definitely potential for Cluely — if it gets faster, smarter, and could pull info from beyond just a user's screen, it could become a game-changing AI assistant. If I were hiring, I might think twice about conducting remote interviews because of these sorts of apps. But between the privacy risks, laggy performance, and random hallucinations, I'm keeping it off my computer.</p>
