                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Allegation against Rinaldo Nazzaro, founder of the Base, could shed new meaning on group's efforts inside Ukraine Alleged former members of an international neo-Nazi terrorist organization are claiming its Russia-based and American leader is a Kremlin spy, according to online records reviewed by the Guardian. The allegation that Rinaldo Nazzaro, a former Pentagon contractor and founder of the Base, listed as a designated terrorist organization all over the world, is an alleged Russian intelligence asset could bring new meaning to his group's latest effort: sabotage and assassination missions inside Ukraine to weaken the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “[Nazzaro] presented himself as an army veteran who has been to Afghanistan, however during gun ranges he mentioned how he's never touched a shotgun in his life,” wrote the members. “Things started becoming really SUS when a few members could see him texting on the phone in Russian, in a fluent/at least a good level as he was writing fast and seemingly naturally, all of that alone led to the belief that [Nazzaro] might be a Russian federal asset, and at that time it was already obvious that he was flying to Russia back and forth.” For example, when a number of Base members were first being arrested, they noted he quickly, “gets into a plane to Russia”. During the height of the Base's activities, it came to light that Nazzaro had worked in a top secret capacity as a drone targeting analyst for American special forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there were no records of him being in ground combat. “How does The Base have money for so [many] bots and rewards for actions?” wrote a user affiliated with the website on Telegram. Nazzaro has increasingly leaned on Russian digital infrastructure to operate his global organization. Posts calling for attacks on Ukraine first appeared on the Base's VK account, which is hosted in Russia and run by Nazzaro. Nazzaro, however, has repeatedly maintained that he is not affiliated with any spy agencies, even making an uncanny appearance on Kremlin state television in 2020, telling a reporter that he “never had any contact with any Russian security services”, something the ex-members also reference.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I don't feel safe when the government posts my address,” Jennifer Vasquez Sura said in an interview. Jennifer Vasquez Sura, Abrego Garcia's wife, expressed grave fears over her family's safety in an interview with The Washington Post this week. The attention her family has received due to her husband's case is worrying, she said — especially after DHS shared details about the family's whereabouts to millions of social media users. That order expired after one month, when Vasquez Sura declined to renew it. She had filed the request for the order due to her experience with domestic violence in past relationships, she said — and DHS using that record to attack Abrego Garcia's character was out of line. “That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. DHS shared the record on its X account in an attempt to justify Abrego Garcia's deportation. “I don't feel safe when the government posts my address, the house where my family lives, for everyone to see, especially when this case has gone viral and people have all sorts of opinions,” Vasquez Sura said. The administration, which admitted earlier this year that Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported, has sought to justify continuing his incarceration in El Salvador by baselessly claiming that he is a member of a violent gang, a characterization his family has vehemently denied. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's unprecedented tariffs, particularly on China, and recent attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell caused alarm among some of his top advisers and America's biggest CEOs, who warned of financial chaos and store shelves that could go bare, people familiar with the conversations said. Trump backed down Tuesday from his threats to try to remove Powell from the job, telling reporters in the Oval Office: “I have no intention of firing him.” A day after markets boomed on comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that Trump would seek to de-escalate the trade war with China, US markets gained again on Wednesday. Top administration officials were also relieved by Trump's Oval Office statement on Powell, the people familiar with the matter said. The Dow surged nearly 1,200 points in the morning before pulling back: Stocks came off their highest levels after Bessent cautioned that it could take considerable time to rebalance trade between the United States and China. The comments, previously reported by Bloomberg News and CNBC, underscore how obstacles remain even as investors are eager for trade agreements and CEOs seek clarity on tariffs. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday said on Fox News there will be “no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China.” “The president has made it clear China needs to make a deal with the United States of America, and we are optimistic that will happen,” Leavitt said. “And when that continues, it will be up to the president what the tariff rate on China will be.” Trump on Wednesday told reporters that his administration will get a “fair deal” with China on trade, adding more broadly that negotiations with countries “are going very well.” When Trump was asked in an impromptu gaggle outside the White House if he was talking to China actively, he responded: “Actively. US Treasury bonds initially rallied Wednesday before giving back those gains in a stark reversal. The benchmark 10-year yield fellow below 4.3% in the morning before rising back up to almost 4.39%, just below where it had settled Tuesday. Trump's notable shift in tone toward Powell and China came a day after he met privately in the Oval Office with chief executives of four major US retail companies who conveyed concerns about rising economic fallout from Trump's tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created for financial markets. Related article Trump can't make up his mind about why he's doing tariffs Trump's tariffs have placed significant pressure on the retail sector. The business leaders warned that store shelves across America could “soon be empty,” two people familiar with the meeting said, as they presented a dire economic picture that could come into sharper view within weeks. For weeks, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior advisers have been fielding alarming calls from business leaders about the fallout from Trump's tariff policies and his ongoing threats to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Bessent, who has emerged as one of the leading Cabinet officials whose words have calmed financial markets, played a key role in arranging the meeting of CEOs, officials said, as part of an effort to show Trump how serious the economic challenges facing the administration have become. Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart who has developed a cordial relationship with Trump through meetings at Mar-a-Lago and several mutual friends, bluntly told Trump that the trade war with China had already started to disrupt the supply chain, officials said, and would only intensify by summer. Many Trump advisers did not ultimately believe the president would attempt to fire Powell, given the warnings he'd been receiving from his economic team — including Bessent — stretching back several months. And Trump had seemed to absorb the notes of caution. Related article Trump says he has ‘no intention of firing' Fed Chair Powell, days after saying his ‘termination cannot come fast enough' Trump has argued that the Fed should cut rates soon to speed up the economy, perhaps as a way to counteract the significant economic drag that his massive tariffs are expected to create. But Powell has said repeatedly the Fed will only make a decision to raise or lower rates after careful consideration and would not rush a decision or issue an emergency rate cut before the rate-setting committee's next scheduled meeting in May. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued Trump's line of attack Tuesday in a press briefing, in which she defended the president for criticizing the Fed. There is no evidence the independent Fed is taking a political stance, and Powell has vehemently and repeatedly denied suggestions that the Fed plays politics when making its monetary policy decisions. Trump's top economic adviser Kevin Hassett also told reporters the White House was studying whether Trump could fire Powell, and said a potential “new legal analysis” might ease market concerns. That represented a break from Hassett's prior comments in support of the central bank's independence. Leavitt said Tuesday that Hassett had recently changed his mind on the Fed after Powell insisted the central bank wouldn't rush a decision to cut rates. “I also spoke to Kevin Hassett about the Fed as well and he has called into question the Fed's independence and whether they are actually doing things out of the best interest of the economy or are they doing it for partisan reasons,” she said. But White House officials had long determined that firing Powell would spark legal challenges and market tumult. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>State lawmakers across the US have introduced at least 240 anti-China proposals this year, aiming to ensure public funds do not buy Chinese technology or even T-shirts, coffee mugs and key chains for tourists. They are also targeting sister-city relationships between US and Chinese communities. The push started well before US President Donald Trump imposed 145 percent tariffs on China, but his posture is encouraging state officials, particularly fellow Republicans. Anti-China proposals have been introduced this year in at least 41 states, but mostly in Republican-controlled legislatures, an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural showed. Trump's rhetoric encouraged the push since his first term, said Kyle Jaros, an associate professor of global affairs at the University of Notre Dame who writes about China's relationships with US states. “The first Trump administration had a very different message than the preceding [Barack] Obama administration about state and local engagement with China,” Jaros said. Playing a “patriotism card” against China resonates with US voters, said David Adkins, a former Kansas legislator who is CEO of the nonpartisan Council on State Governments. John David Minnich, a modern China academic and assistant professor at the London School of Economics, attributed states' measures largely to “targeted, strategic lobbying,” not popular pressure. Critics see China as more anti-US and authoritarian under Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), and US officials say China has a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem to collect overseas intelligence. Some state officials also began seeing China as a concrete threat when a Chinese balloon flew over the US in 2023, said Sara Newland, an associate professor of government at Smith College who conducts research with Jaros. “There is this idea that a Chinese investment is actually going to result in the Chinese government spying on individual people or threatening food security in a particular area,” she said. Kansas House of Representatives Majority Leader Chris Croft, a retired US Army colonel, said that countering China is a “joint effort” for states and the US government. He championed a law greatly limiting property ownership within 160km of a military installation in Kansas by firms and people tied to foreign adversaries — China, but also Cuba, Iran and North Korea. “All of us have a part to play,” he said. Further limiting foreign property ownership remains popular, with at least 46 proposals in 24 states, but critics liken imposing restrictions to selling snow shovels to Miami residents. Chinese interests' share was about 112,100 hectares, or two-hundredths of 1 percent. Minnich said that if Trump's tariffs get China to reset relations with the US, that would undercut what states have done, but if Trump seeks “sustained decoupling,” state measures would likely have minimal effects on China in the short term, compared with Trump's policies. Venezuela's prosecutor's office slammed the call by El Salvador's leader, accusing him of crimes against humanity                                        Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Sunday proposed carrying out a prisoner swap with Venezuela, suggesting he would exchange Venezuelan deportees from the US his government has kept imprisoned for what he called “political prisoners” in Venezuela. In a post on X, directed at Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Bukele listed off a number of family members of high-level opposition figures in Venezuela, journalists and activists detained during the South American government's electoral crackdown last year. “The only reason they are imprisoned is for having opposed you and your electoral fraud,” he wrote to Maduro. The move follows a pledge by Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong (黃循財), who took office last year and assumed the PAP leadership, to “bring in new blood, new ideas and new energy” to steer the country of 6 million people. Increasing numbers of foreign men are flocking to the area after seeing videos on social media.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's attacks on the press have already begun, with the president filing a number of baseless lawsuits against organizations like ABC and CBS, including a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS over how the network edited an interview with Kamala Harris last year on 60 Minutes. “I didn't want to be an activist, but when it's a battle for facts, journalism is activism,” warns Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa, whose new site Rappler faced attacks from former president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Environmental groups are outraged that the world's biggest meatpacking company, JBS, which has long been linked to Amazon's deforestation, has received approval from US authorities to list on the New York Stock Exchange. The Brazil-based company's shares elsewhere hit a record high on Tuesday when news broke of the SEC ruling on the contentious application, which has been tussled over for several years, and is a joint listing with Amsterdam. Last week, JBS filed a report to the SEC saying it would hold a general shareholders meeting about the listing on approximately 23 May, and that the first day of trading of its shares in New York could be as early as 12 June. Almost half of its revenue now comes from the United States, where it sells household brands including Pilgrim's, Moy Park, Seara and Primo. But it has alarmed conservation groups, who fear JBS will use the extra financial resources to expand its market and environmental footprint. JBS has been linked to deforestation on multiple occasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit last year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. A bipartisan group of 15 US senators had urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS's application for a share listing. “Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,” they wrote in an open letter. JBS has told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions of that investigation which it said were drawn from “a limited sample of 30 farmers”, saying it was irresponsible to disregard that JBS has “over 40,000 registered suppliers”. The company has also had to pay fines or make plea bargains in several high-profile corruption cases in Brazil and the United States. A recent Federal Election Commission filing revealed JBS subsidiary Pilgrim's made the largest single donation of $5m to Trump's inaugural committee for his second term. The approval of JBS's IPO shows this is no longer the independent SEC that has upheld honest practices on American markets for nearly a century.” This decision is a disaster for both people and the planet,” said Alexandria Reid of Global Witness, an environmental justice organization. Greenpeace UK said JBS's plans for global expansion threaten to tip the planet further towards climate chaos. “JBS built its meat empire on a history of corruption, broken promises and environmental destruction, including emissions that would make even fossil fuel companies raise an eyebrow,” campaigner Daniela Montalto, said. “This listing will benefit only the billionaire Batista brothers who sit at the helm of JBS, while ordinary people pick up the tab for climate chaos and environmental destruction that industrial agriculture is driving.” “JBS will continue to partner with farmers, NGOs, universities, customers, and other stakeholders to identify ways to reduce agricultural emissions, combat global food insecurity, and enhance the sustainability of food systems. Agriculture has an essential role to play in the climate change solution, and companies like JBS can and should help lead collective action.” The company repeated its comment on the investigation published by the Guardian last week about deforestation, saying that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks”.</p>

Kristy Denette, a spokeswoman for the SIU, said in a statement, “There in no threat to the public.” After officers located the man, he produced a firearm.

This year, not surprisingly, the one thing on everyone's mind was tariffs. “There's ore in old mines and in the ground that we couldn't process historically but that we can now. Once we look past the speculation and buzzwords, there's a lot that we can do to make it beneficial for local communities. However, they also offer an opportunity to reassess our economic practices. Ige Olusegun Omoniyi, Mary A Ogbe, Obadiah Simon Nkom and Olajide Olushola B., delegates from Nigeria. “Before Nigeria's independence, its GDP was sustained by mining. Mining has seen a comeback in the past four or five years—nickel, lithium, gold, copper, lead, zinc and more. Eduan Pieterse, country manager, VBKOM Mining Consultants Canada (Toronto) Any development projects happening on Treaty 9 territory—like the Ring of Fire—will need to be done in consultation with, and in collaboration with, the Matawa First Nations tribal council.” Miners need stability, not a whirlwind of flip-flopping economic conditions.” “If you don't have social buy-in in Peru, they will shut down your project. Caring about the locals isn't just a nice-to-have anymore. You don't get a mine built without meaningful community support.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the government declined to provide details, she ordered officials to file daily updates with the court on its efforts. “For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders,” she wrote in an order. The government then filed a motion to stay that ruling. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia filed a sealed response to the motion. Xinis referenced both sealed filings while entering the pause. An immigration judge concluded that evidence showed he was a member of the MS-13 gang. A different immigration judge ordered Garcia deported but also issued a withholding of removal, which prevented the U.S. government from deporting him to his home country. Garcia continued living in the United States until he was taken into custody by immigration agents on March 12. They have more recently said the deportation was allowed because MS-13 was designated a terrorist group by President Donald Trump. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia say he should not have been deported to El Salvador and that he should be brought back to the United States to be with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and children.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces have liberated approximately 16 square kilometers of territory near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in recent weeks, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi said on April 17. There has been a notable slowdown in Russia's offensive operations after months of steady territorial gains across eastern Ukraine. According to battlefield monitoring group DeepState, Russian troops have captured just 133 square kilometers in March, the lowest monthly total since June 2024. The recently recaptured territory by Ukrainian troops includes areas near the settlements of Udachne, Kotlyne, and Shevchenko, according to Syrskyi. According to Syrskyi, Ukrainian forces are halting around 30 Russian assaults daily in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, inflicting significant losses on Russian troops. During his visit, Syrskyi met with commanders at front-line command posts and reviewed operational plans with Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, commander of the operational-tactical group. He said that on-site problems related to logistics, ammunition supply, and combat organization were being addressed. Despite continued Russian efforts to push Ukrainian troops out of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and reach the administrative borders of these regions, Syrskyi said those objectives remain unfulfilled. "We continue our defensive operation, carry out counteroffensive actions, and are achieving certain successes," Syrskyi said. Moscow does not fully control any of the four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson – that it illegally claimed to annex in 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO is strengthening its presence near Russia's western borders and expanding military infrastructure, effectively forming a "strike fist," Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu told TASS in an interview. "In the past year, the military forces of NATO countries deployed near Russia's western borders have increased nearly 2.5 times," Shoigu stated. "These operational capabilities were openly tested during drills held in 2023-2024," Shoigu noted. The Baltic States are utilizing Western funds to construct defense lines and establish NATO military bases within their territories. In addition to US Abrams tanks, Poland is actively acquiring South Korean armored vehicles and making plans to obtain 180 K2 Black Panther tanks by 2026. Shoigu emphasized that these developments clearly point to whom this "strike fist" is being directed against. NATO countries are also modernizing their air defense systems. "Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands are upgrading their fleets of combat aircraft, purchasing American F-35 fighters, while Romania and Bulgaria are acquiring F-16 tactical fighters," Shoigu explained. Meanwhile, on the eastern flank, preparations are underway to expand the NATO airfield network to support increased aviation activity. "The explanation is straightforward: these politicians fear losing financial subsidies from NATO and European funds and to secure further support they indulge in excessive Russophobia," he remarked. "Otherwise, they would need to focus on resolving internal economic and social issues, which they are currently unable to address." He underscored that NATO's combined military expenditures far surpass Russia's, being more than 14 times greater. "This proposal received mixed reactions within the alliance. Estonia also intends to reach a 5% defense spending target.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. A team of Polish and Ukrainian researchers on April 24 began exhuming Polish victims of the World War II-era Volyn massacres in what is today western Ukraine, the Polish media reported. Forensic experts, archeologists, and geneticists began their work at 9 a.m. local time at the site of the destroyed Puzhnyky (Puzniki in Polish) village in Ternopil Oblast. This is the first such exhumation since 2017, when Ukraine imposed a moratorium in response to the destruction of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland. The Volyn massacres, which peaked in 1943-1944, took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. UPA fighters are believed to have killed between 50 and 120 Poles in Puzhnyky overnight on Feb. 13, 1945. The settlement no longer exists, and the area has been overgrown with vegetation, but close to 80 victims may remain buried here. He also said that the work is complicated by Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, and warned against possible Russian disinformation operations. In recent months, the Polish and Ukrainian governments have made efforts to resolve the issue of the Volyn exhumations, with Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk announcing a "breakthrough" in January. Multiple Polish government and opposition officials have said that Warsaw would block Ukraine's entry into the EU and NATO unless the matter is resolved.</p>

Appropriately, the happy couple both wore “Make Marriage Great Again” baseball caps. Ms Rauchet – who is believed to be in her early 40s – is the defence secretary's third wife and, between them, they are raising a “blended family” of seven children. The couple has been almost inseparable since they met at Fox News, where Ms Rauchet worked as an executive producer. A journalism graduate of Towson University, Maryland, she joined the station in 2006. Deering filed for divorce from Mr Hegseth after he fathered a child with Ms Rauchet in 2017, the same year he started working full-time at the network as a host, after previously making a number of guest appearances. According to reports, Ms Rauchet was also married at the time. She was moved from Mr Hegseth's show Fox & Friends to Watters' World after the pair disclosed their relationship, according to Vanity Fair. According to Vanity Fair, there was gossip that she helped Mr Hegseth get more airtime than other contributors. My amazing wife @JennyHegseth had absolutely nothing to do with anything. It was an allegation Mr Hegseth angrily denied, although he reached a confidentiality agreement with the woman. When the allegation resurfaced during Mr Hegseth's confirmation process, team Trump were apparently “blindsided”. At the time Steven Cheung, Mr Trump's communications director issued a statement insisting “President Trump is nominating high-calibre and extremely qualified candidates” adding the team were “looking forward” to his confirmation as secretary of defence. A lawyer for Mr Hegseth said: “This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.” Sources close to Mr Hegseth suggested the allegation had resurfaced as a result of Republican establishment figures attempting to sabotage his appointment. Then, further allegations about Trump's defence pick were made public. In a furious email, sent around the time of Mr Hegseth's second divorce, his own mother, Penelope, called him an “abuser of women” and accused him of “lying, cheating, sleeping around and using women for his own power and ego”. Other reports emerged about an alleged drinking problem, with former colleagues at Fox claiming Mr Hegseth often smelt of alcohol before going on air. Ms Rauchet is said to have attended every meeting her husband had with senators as he sought their backing for his nomination to the Pentagon. Posting a series of pictures from Mr Hegseth's swearing in ceremony to Instagram, Ms Rauchet captioned the post: “An overwhelming heartfelt THANK YOU to all who have supported us. I'm so proud of my husband and — like you — am excited to see all that's to come for our nation under this president and his well chosen leaders. The pair lavish praise on each other on the social media site, with Mr Hegseth referring to her as “my rock” and “cowboy Barbi[e]” – she calls him “my favourite soul,” “the king of my heart” and her “everything”. Mr Hegseth is so rarely seen without Ms Rauchet that she has earned the nickname “Yoko Ono” from Pentagon staff, according to MailOnline. “She's like his parole officer and PR agent all at once,” a source told the website. Partners of senior officials can be given low-level security clearance, whether this was the case with Ms Rauchet remains unclear. A Pentagon spokesman said they would not comment on an individual's clearance. Her presence at a meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels reportedly raised eyebrows among other attendees, but it is not known what was discussed in her presence. Ms Rauchet's presence in a Signal group chat, alongside Hegseth's brother – who also works at the Pentagon – and his personal lawyer, in which war plans were discussed prompted further ire. Kingsley Wilson, a Pentagon spokesman, insisted Ms Rauchet had “never attended a meeting where sensitive information or classified information was discussed”.</p>

MOSCOW, April 24. /TASS/. Moscow maintains the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of the West's aggression, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu said in an interview with TASS.

"In November 2024, revisions were introduced to the Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence, according to which Russia reserves the right to use nuclear arms in the event of aggression against it or the Republic of Belarus, including with the use of conventional weapons," he noted. According to Shoigu, Russia is "carefully monitoring Europe's military preparations."

"In accordance with Russia's National Security Strategy, in the event of foreign countries carrying out hostile actions representing a threat to Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, our country considers it legitimate to take appropriate symmetric and asymmetric measures necessary to thwart such actions and prevent them from repeating," he reiterated.

According to the official, nuclear deterrence "is being carried out with regard to countries and military coalitions that consider Russia a potential enemy and possess weapons of mass destruction or conventional armed forces with substantial military capabilities."

Additionally, such actions also involve countries who provide their territory and resources for preparing and carrying out aggression against Russia.

"The goals of ensuring the integrity of Russia and Belarus' unified defensive space and joint implementation of events on strategic deterrence were enshrined in the Security Concept of the Union State and the Treaty on security guarantees between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus approved in December 2024, which were developed with direct participation of security councils of both countries," Shoigu concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.” The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social. Any move to recognize Russia's control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy and could upset the widely held post-World War Two consensus that international borders should not be changed by force. Russian missiles struck Ukraine's capital city Kyiv and the country's second largest city Kharkiv hours after Trump's post, Ukrainian authorities said, with at least nine people killed and some 70 wounded in the latest attacks. Trump's comments came after a meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine had been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he wouldn't attend. Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues,” though a US official and two European diplomats familiar with the matter said the top US diplomat didn't go because the administration did not feel that they were at a decisive point in the ongoing talks and Rubio didn't feel attending would be the best use of his time. “It was better to let talks play out than create the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent,” said one of the European diplomats. “Emotions have run high today,” Zelensky said on X Wednesday after the talks. In what seemed to be an indirect response to Trump's criticism of Zelensky being unwilling to recognize Russian control of Crimea, Zelensky vowed Kyiv would abide by its constitution: “Ukraine will always act in accordance with its Constitution and we are absolutely sure that our partners - in particular the USA - will act in line with its strong decisions.” Britain's Foreign Office had confirmed earlier on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.

Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire. After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, a US official said. The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.” The war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching. Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv. However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022. On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.
