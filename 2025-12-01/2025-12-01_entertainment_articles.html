Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, currently in the United States to support the awards campaign and theatrical release for his “It Was Just an Accident,” has received a prison sentence in absentia. Per Jahani, who sent a dispatch to journalists, “On Monday, December 1, 2025, attorney Mustafa Nili wrote on his social media X: Branch 26 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran has sentenced Mr. Jafar Panahi in absentia to one year in prison and a two-year ban on leaving the country, as well as a ban on membership in political and social groups or factions, for propaganda activities against the regime. We will take the necessary legal steps to appeal this ruling.” Related Stories Jim Belushi Calls His ‘Chronology of Water' Director Kristen Stewart a ‘Shaman' Kristen Stewart Charted Her Own Course to Her Directorial Debut ‘The Chronology of Water' He just completed, for the first time, a U.S. tour, visiting cities including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and Chicago. He is next slated to attend the Marrakech Film Festival. Panahi, who won the Palme d'Or this year for French Oscar contender “It Was Just an Accident,” was sentenced to six years' prison time in 2010 and has had various legal issues in Iran ever since. The circumstances of his imprisonment and confinement inspired the making of “It Was Just an Accident,” which centers on an Azerbaijani auto mechanic who believes he has found his former torturer. Like all of Panahi's recent films, it was made illegally without a permit in Iran. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers. Ahead, Jim Belushi tells IndieWire about the many qualities that set our Maverick Award winner, “The Chronology of Water” writer/director Kristen Stewart, apart from the crowd.As told to Anne Thompson. The following has been edited and condensed for clarity. Related Stories Kristen Stewart Charted Her Own Course to Her Directorial Debut ‘The Chronology of Water' ‘Marty Supreme' Review: Timothée Chalamet's Legendary Performance Anchors an Exhilarating  American Epic About the True Cost of Greatness I got a call from my agent. They said, “We want to send the script over. You have an offer to play Ken Kesey, and Kristen Stewart wrote it and directed it.” “I don't need to read it. '” I read it, and was quite intimidated by the complexity and the beauty of this woman's story. And then I read the book [by Lidia Yuknavitch]. There's a whole category of Academy Awards for screenplay adaptation that I hope someone pays attention to, because [Kristen] did an unbelievable adaptation of this book. I always approach working with women as, “This girl is my sister, and I love my sister.” All my life, I've always known how to be loving to my sister, to make her feel strong and good. All those traits that my sister taught me, I take on with other actresses or producers. I look at Kristen as my younger sister. And within five minutes of talking to her: “This girl is way older than she is.” When she looked me in the eye, she looked right through my pupils and right into me. When I got on the set, I went to the producer and said, “She wrote this. How locked in is she to the words?” The producer said, “She's pretty locked in.” Because I studied this character for three months. I saw everything that Ken Kesey said, in lectures, in interviews, and he was quite an amazing man, quite articulate. And he had a huge sense of humanity, but there were some gems of things that he'd said. And once I did it, her eyes opened up, and [she] gave me a little wave, like, “Go ahead, go ahead.” I started ripping out all kinds of dialogue that came out of Ken Kesey's mouth. And she was: “Oh my god, I got chills, Jim.” She made me feel so knowledgeable about my character, and I just flew with it. It took her eight years to get this movie made: talk about fearless pursuit. I couldn't even pretend to be tired after watching her all day. It's like, “I can't be tired. The main line for me in the movie has actually changed me since I've shot it: “No one is big enough to hold what happens to us.” I have forgiven everybody who didn't understand me in my life because of that line. Nobody's big enough to hold that … For the lead character [Lidia, played by Imogen Poots], it's in her hands to write it. “Maybe someone will be able to hold what happened to you.” Kristen was able to hold what happened to me in my life, and understand it in order to bring it out in my performance, and for that, I feel like I was in the presence of a shaman. I don't know where she got this experience in her life to have such depth. I don't believe in reincarnation, but she must have reincarnated six or seven times, because she shocked me with how smart, articulate, and knowledgeable she is. When Kristen walked on a set, you could feel around her for a good six to eight feet, this presence, this power. If she stopped and started talking to you, it was like you were in this dome of something special. She would just stare and watch me, and she made me feel so good about everything I did. The material itself is so complicated an exploration of grief, the acting out of unresolved grief and trauma. Finally, you see someone who gets the depth of death. How does this 35-year-old girl carry solid knowledge of deep concepts, and capture it in that film in such a creative way? I worked with Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, Woody Allen, David Lynch, Roman Polanski. I have a standing offer with her that whenever she needs her car washed, I will be there with a bucket, brush, soap, and water. I will do anything for this girl. I'd work with my little sister any day. She's a fearless artist, fearless in her pursuit of authenticity, and she is unafraid to challenge the boundaries of storytelling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The young man with the Coke-bottle glasses and pockmarked face and ferret-like frame may be one of eight million stories in the naked city known as Manhattan circa 1952. But Mauser refuses to be just another schlemiel working at a shoestore. Mauser has got a genuine shot at the title. If only this perpetual fuck-up wasn't also his own worst enemy. You'd have something close to Marty Supreme, Josh Safdie‘s manic character study that doubles as a cracked American success story. Mauser may be loosely — and we do mean loosely — based on five-time world champ Marty Reisman, but he has a lot more in common with the filmmaker's usual gallery of hustlers, rogues, crooks, and schnooks. Whether solo (see: his 2008 debut The Pleasure of Being Robbed) or in tandem with his brother Benny (Daddy Long Legs, Good Time, Uncut Gems), Safdie specializes in giving sad sacks a sympathetic spotlight while keeping things raw, rough, and paced like a Rube Goldberg machine of chaos. The character he's dreamed up with co-writer, co-editor, and longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein may be his most accessible, charismatic loser to date. It helps, of course, that Safdie has lots of supreme talent in his corner: cinematographer Darius Khondji (Seven), production designer Jack Fisk (Days of Heaven, There Will Be Blood), costume designer Miyako Bellizzi, composer Daniel “Oneohtrix Point Never” Lopatin. They're below-the-line legends, the lot of them. (Les Paul and Mary Ford, meet Tears for Fears!) Per usual, the writer-director mixes in non-professionals who look like they've stepped straight out of a Weegee portfolio with a supporting cast you'd swear was assembled via Mad Libs. Seriously, name another ensemble that boasts Fran Drescher, Tyler, the Creator, Penn Jillette, cult filmmaker Abel Ferrara, NBA hall of famer George Gervin, and Shark Tank‘s Kevin O'Leary? There's one person who's truly channeling Safdie's grindset obsessions, however, and arguably stands head and slim shoulders above the rest. You wouldn't think a motormouth jerk who's really the Michael Jordan of ping-pong would be a bespoke role for the star, yet the role fits him like a customized backless jumpsuit. Of course this nebbish with the rat mustache will talk his way into both the Ritz and the pants of a faded movie star (Gwyneth Paltrow, reminding you how good she was before Goop became her full-time gig), the ultimate seduction by chutzpah. Of course he'll win over journalists with proto-edgelord pull quotes — “I'm gonna do to Klutsky what Auschwitz couldn't!” he exclaims, regarding a Hungarian rival; it's OK though, Mauser says, because he's also Jewish and “Hitler's worst nightmare” — and piss off the powers that be. Of course he'll get his married neighbor (I Love LA‘s Odessa A'zion) knocked up, then co-opt her into his schemes. Of course he'll bilk Long Island rubes out of their dough with a fellow table tennis ace (Tyler) and turn a hotel disaster involving a gangster (Ferrara) and an M.I.A. Everybody else is simply waiting to get stung. Fellow Unit Member Says Alleged D.C. Shooter Felt Abandoned by CIA Millie Bobby Brown Says She and David Harbour Have a ‘Great Relationship' Amid Bullying Rumors ‘Eternity' Asks: Who Is the Love of Your Afterlife? Timothée Chalamet Suggests Raining Ping-Pong Balls on Camp Flog Gnaw to Promote ‘Marty Supreme' Tyler, the Creator Postpones Camp Flog Gnaw As L.A. Chalamet doesn't just lean in to Marty's less-than-stellar qualities; he turns them into pluses, pitching them as part of the DNA that will allow Mauser to eventually stage something akin to a comeback. It's the sort of performance that feels like early Pacino or Dustin Hoffman, all twitches and vibrations and seeming like he's in a constant state of motion even when standing still. In other words, Marty Supreme is a testament to the Men Who Would Be King, both the fictional and nonfictional ones. Josh Safdie would likely cop to identifying with Mauser not wisely but too well; game usually does tend to recognize game. To say that Marty Supreme is autobiographical would be pushing it. But the way the director lends his high-anxiety style of filmmaking to this highly caffeinated Horatio Alger narrative is extremely simpatico. You have to be a hustler to make movies like this in the age of AI and IP, even ones with genuine movie stars in them. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Death of a Salesman will return to Broadway this spring starring Nathan Lane and Laurie Metcalf. The play is set for a 14-week run at the Winter Garden Theatre, a larger theater for plays with 1,600 seats and recent home to Clooney's Goodnight, and Good Luck, starting March 6, ahead of an April 9 opening. Metcalf currently stars in Rudin's Little Bear Ridge Road, directed by Mantello, which is running at the Booth Theatre on Broadway until Feb. 15. Tom Stoppard, Cerebral Storyteller for Stage and Screen, Dies at 88 Broadway Box Office: 'Harry Potter' Hits Highest Gross Yet With Tom Felton The Arthur Miller play first premiered on Broadway in 1949 and was recently revived during the 2022-2023 season, starring Wendell Pierce and Sharon D. Clarke. “In 1995 while rehearsing a Terrence McNally play with Joe, he turned to me one afternoon out of the blue and quietly said, ‘Someday you and I are going to do Death of a Salesman.' And true to his word, 30 years later, that day has come. It's a privilege to do what is arguably the greatest drama of the twentieth century, and like all great plays it always seems to speak to us anew each time we see it,” Nathan Lane said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Dylan Efron is ready to beat Survivor legend “Boston” Rob Mariano at, well, literally everything. The reality TV stars, who first met on Peacock's The Traitors, are teaming up for a new YouTube series Everything's a Competition. Throughout the series, the friendly rivals will go head-to-head in a series of unpredictable challenges from blindfolded golf to sword fighting to pottery and much, much more. From grueling physical tasks to hilarious creative tests, nothing is off limits. YouTube TV Strikes Carriage Deal With TelevisaUnivision, Ending Two-Month Blackout As someone who's always loved strategy and competition, when we met on Traitors we became quick friends,” Efron said in a statement. Can't wait for people to see what happens when we're together.” Added Mariano: “Dylan is one of the guys that can just do it all, but that doesn't mean I can't still give him a run for his money. After The Traitors, we came up with the idea for Everything's a Competition because that kid loves to show off his skills, and I love to put him in his place. We've had a great time coming up with these episodes and fighting it out to see who comes out on top.” Mariano, a Traitor, emerged as one of the season's best personalities. On Everything's a Competition, the pair have brought their chemistry and their thrill of rivalry to every activity under the sun. Episodes will be centered around a task ranging from lawn bowling to a bromance date night of sip and paint. “At YouTube, we want to empower creators to innovate, take risks, and deliver truly engaging original content directly to their communities,” Kim Larson, Head of Creators at YouTube, said in a statement of her own. We are thrilled to see Dylan and Rob harness their unique chemistry and competitive spirit to build a high-quality, completely original series for their fans.“ Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Radiohead have postponed two dates of their ongoing European tour while Thom Yorke recovers from an “extreme throat infection.” The performances, originally scheduled for tonight (December 1) and tomorrow at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen, Denmark, will now take place on December 15 and 16. Two additional shows at the same venue are set to go on as planned this Thursday (December 5) and Friday (December 6). “We are devastated to have to postpone these two shows at such short notice but Thom has been diagnosed with an extreme throat infection which has made it impossible for him to sing,” Radiohead wrote in a statement on Instagram. “We have been so blown away by the audience reactions on these dates and are loving being back on stage again; needless to say, we feel terrible that we have been forced to postpone these shows.” Radiohead kicked off their first run of shows since 2018 last month. In August, they surprise-released their second official live album, Hail to the Thief (Live Recordings 2003-2009). That same month, Radiohead scored their fourth-ever hit on Billboard's Hot 100 chart with “Let Down,” an album track from 1997's OK Computer. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rihanna is throwing it back to her maternity era. This Thanksgiving weekend, the Barbadian singer and businesswoman is showing what she's thankful for with a photo from this past summer when she was visibly pregnant with the latest addition to her family. In September, the “Umbrella” singer gave birth to her third child with her partner A$AP Rocky — daughter Rocki Irish Mayers — a few months later, she's taking the opportunity to reminisce about her summer looks. Though now a common practice, Rihanna was one of the first major celebrities in recent memory to embrace her pregnancy frame. Beginning with her first pregnancy in 2022, Rihanna's maternity style has been truly remarkable. Throughout all three pregnancies, the global superstar routinely bared her growing bump in public instead of hiding behind oversized clothing or strategically placed accessories. From skin-tight looks to open-front layers, sheer tops and bejeweled belly chains, Rihanna's bump-centric ensembles get better every time. !” she wrote, along with a note of support for Jeffrey Bostic, Barbados' second president. Rihanna also donned a long belly chain that drew attention to her growing baby bump. It wasn't long after the photo was taken that Rocki entered the world on Sept. 13, 2025, making this newly released pregnancy photo an extra special moment in Rihanna's pregnancy style journey.</p>

McEntire quickly interrupted Guthrie, interjecting, “Now, wait a minute.” “Before everybody has a conniption fit at home, we're just engaged,” she corrected her. Guthrie apologized for accidentally referring to Linn as her husband. “My family will go, ‘Wait, you didn't tell us?! “Me, not so much on the rehearsal part, so he really makes sure that I know my lines, that I'm ready to go when we have a tape day.” McEntire, 70, also said that she and Linn, 69, have had “a blast” collaborating on the series together.

McEntire confirmed that they got engaged in December 2024, but they were waiting to share the exciting news due to the devastating LA wildfires.

Just like their engagement announcement, the couple's wedding is going to be very “low-key.” “A Reba, Rex wedding is going to be very different.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Tuc Watkins (The Mummy), Daria Berenato (former WWE star Sonya Deville), Thomas Dekker (Heroes) and Brenna D'Amico (Descendants) are set to star in horror-comedy Zombois from writer-director Garrett Abdo. Due to enter production in Atlanta this month, the feature centers on a group of college seniors on break in the North Georgia Mountains who discover a guarded secret and a contagion that turns their getaway into a brutal battle for survival. Rounding out the cast are Adam Huss (Power) and Aaron Goldenberg. Glendon Palmer will produce alongside Abdo, Brian Yuran and Michael Buttiglieri. Osvaldo Silvera will serve as director of photography and Jeremy O'Keefe is casting. This marks Abdo's second feature film after Exit Interviews which also starred Watkins, Huss and Dekker. Writer-director Abdo is the managing partner of the Atlanta Comedy Theater, which has helped launched a number of U.S. stand-ups.“My last film, Exit Interviews, was deeply dramatic emotional therapy so I wanted to follow it up with something totally on the opposite end of the spectrum – something fun and outrageous, so gay zombies felt like it fit the mold,” explained Abdo.Added Watkins: “Sexy, scary, and laugh-out-loud funny, Zombois is going to be one hell of a ride. I can't wait to be a part of it.”Watkins is repped by Greene Talent and Karen Forman Management. Berenato is repped by Luber Roklin Entertainment and AGMB.

In a social media statement, the band revealed that Thom Yorke is currently undergoing treatment after being diagnosed with “an extreme throat infection which has made it impossible for him to sing.” “We're hopeful Thom will recover in time to play the final two Copenhagen shows on Dec 4th and 5th.” “We have been so blown away by the audience reactions on these dates and are loving being back on stage again,” the statement continues.

At the moment, Radiohead have not announced any performances for 2026. “After a seven-year pause, it felt really good to play the songs again and reconnect with a musical identity that has become lodged deep inside all five of us. It also made us want to play some shows together, so we hope you can make it to one of the upcoming dates.</p>

Since 1992, when the claims first came to light (they were later investigated and dismissed by New York Social Services), Allen has found himself ostracized by certain corners of Hollywood and his image worsened by the #MeToo movement. Paul Mescal Reveals His Favorite Cinematic Experience of the Year (and Tells Director: "Call Me!") In a recent interview with The Telegraph about her directorial debut, the June Squibb-starring Eleanor the Great, Johansson — who has worked with Allen on three of his films: Match Point (2005), Scoop (2006) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) — was asked about going to bat for Allen in that THR piece and how she handled the “inevitable online furore.” She was asked: What were the consequences? “I guess it's hard to know,” she responded. “You never know what the domino effect is, exactly. I don't mean that you should silence yourself. But many actors who have worked with him, including Michael Caine, Timothée Chalamet and Greta Gerwig, have publicly expressed regret about doing so. In recent years, he has struggled to secure U.S. distribution for his films. A rep for Johansson did not immediately respond to comment on her more recent statements. Also in The Telegraph piece, Johansson opens up about a financial backer of Eleanor the Great pulling out at the last minute due to Squibb's character, a Jewish woman, falsely claiming to be a Holocaust survivor. “It was really shocking, and I was so disappointed.” An “emergency ring-round” soon brought Sony Pictures Classics on board as distributors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brian Austin Green competed on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 30. He placed 13th in the competition alongside professional dance partner Sharna Burgess, but what happened after was better than winning the Mirrorball Trophy: he and Burgess became a couple. In a November interview on Michael Rosenbaum's “Inside of You” podcast, Green spoke about dancing and his personal loss of two loved ones and dear friends. “She used to dance with me and my friends in my dressing room when we had time off, which we had a lot of. She was just an incredible heart,” Green said of Doherty. He also referred to her as “loyal” and “an amazing human being.” Doherty died in 2024 after a long and brave battle with cancer. Another one of Green's friends and former co-stars, Luke Perry, died in 2019. Luke had a stroke,” Green said of the difference between Doherty and Perry's death, the latter of which came as a massive shock to fans and loved ones. Green spoke about Perry's passing, calling it “a really tough one,” and said they had spent time together not long before. “I had seen Luke not even a week before then. He was the same exact person that I've known,” Green said. “And all of a sudden I got a call and it was like, ‘Hey, he's in the hospital. And then two days later, ‘Yeah, he didn't make it.' Doherty had bravely and publicly battled cancer, and Green reflected on how she had Stage Four breast cancer, and he had been aware of her health struggles, “for a long time.” He continued, “It wasn't in the front of my mind, but there was always that thing in the back of my mind of appreciate all of these moments because you don't know how many more you're going to get. So yeah, just enjoy all of this time that's left.” “Everytime Brian Austin Green pops up in front of me, Im like, ‘Yup, still have that crush on him!' “​​The only reason why I started watching BH 90201 is because of Brian and Shannon,” another fan shared. I love that you two are having a conversation about kindness, and it happened so naturally,” and “I went to high school with Brian.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Schumer is stepping out again, debuting a more sculpted and slimmer look. The comedian, 44, returned to Instagram with a new photo that showcased her trimmer silhouette and renewed commitment to feeling healthy. Weeks after wiping her feed and debuting a striking look at her toned figure, she continues to share the progress she has been working toward. The sleeveless design features soft bows and delicate ruffle details, creating a look that feels both playful and polished. The post also included a sweet moment with her son, whose quick cameo added warmth and humor to the snapshot. “Trying to go to the party but someone won't go to bed @gitabass takin pics and painting me with @tousledbyjae dress by @maisonvalentino thanks @luxury_checkins skin as always by @georgialouisesk,” she wrote. Schumer's post quickly drew praise from friends and fellow celebrities. !” Brittany Snow chimed in with “Oh heyyyy,” and Krystyna Hutchinson added, “Hot d—m.” Actor Cheyenne Jackson also took notice, telling her, “You're glowing.” The outpouring of love comes after Schumer made headlines for wiping her older Instagram posts and sharing a photo in a red strapless mini dress. “Deleted my old pics for no reason!” she wrote at the time. “Hey media outlets, I didn't delete my old photos because they were pre-me losing weight,” she wrote in a later caption. I no longer have Cushing syndrome, so my face went back to normal. I am grateful to be strong and healthy, especially for my son. But your Instagram is not your identity, it's a curation of what you want the world to see, and I feel great, strong and beautiful, and it's been fun sharing that,” she wrote. Schumer stressed that her recent changes were never about following a scripted weight loss plan. But my focus has been on health,” she said. She closed her message with encouragement for anyone facing their own challenges. “Wishing you strength and self-love on whatever path you're on, as long as it's kind and respectful to all people. Her honesty resonated widely, drawing praise from fans and celebrities who applauded her focus on wellbeing, kindness, and body positivity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aerosmith joins an elite club with new top 10s in each decade from the 1970s-2020s, thanks to the act's new YUNGBLUD collab One More Time. As Aerosmith and YUNGBLUD's collaborative album One More Time debuts at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 (dated Dec. 6), Aerosmith becomes the second group — and fifth act overall — with a newly-charting top 10 in each of the last six decades (1970s through 2020s). One More Time also marks the first top 10 for YUNGBLUD (after four earlier charting titles) and the 10th top 10 for Aerosmith. The latter was last in the top 10 with its last full-length studio album, 2012's Music From Another Dimension!, which debuted and peaked at No. Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Aerosmith notched its first top 10 on the Billboard 200 in 1976 (and only top 10 of the ‘70s) with Rocks (peaking at No. 5-peaking Pump), three in the ‘90s (Get a Grip, No. 1), three in the 2000s (Just Push Play, No. 5), one in the ‘10s (Music From Another Dimension!, No. Among all acts, there are just five with a new top 10 in each decade in that span: Aerosmith, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and James Taylor. The five-track One More Time was preceded by its first single, “My Only Angel,” which debuted at No. 1 on Hot Hard Rock Songs in October and climbs 7-6 (a new peak) on the most recently published Mainstream Rock Airplay chart (dated Dec. 6). “My Only Angel” is the first top 10 for Aerosmith on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart since 2004's “Baby, Please Don't Go” reached No. 7, and the band's highest-charting hit since “Jaded” spent five weeks at No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
