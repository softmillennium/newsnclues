                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He was a Latin American president accused of colluding with some of the region's most ruthless narco bosses to flood the United States with cocaine. But it is actually a portrait – painted by US prosecutors, no less – of the former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who Trump last week pledged to pardon, despite the fact that Hernández was sentenced last year to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”. Trump's astonishing intervention in favour of Hernández, who is known by his initials JOH, has baffled many observers, with one Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent calling the move “lunacy”. Why had Trump spent recent weeks blowing up alleged narco boats in the Caribbean – with negligible impact on flow of drugs to the US – and at the same time decided to let a big time trafficker convicted of smuggling far larger quantities of drugs off the hook? “He is giving a pardon to Juan Orlando Hernández and then going after Nicolás Maduro … It's all hypocritical.” Contrary to Trump's claim that Hernández, 57, had been the victim of a “Biden set up”, Vigil said there was overwhelming evidence that the Central American politician was “a big fish in the narco world”. Not only had Hernández helped turn Honduras into a major transit point for South American cocaine heading to the US, but Vigil said he had also transformed it into a cocaine producing hub which was now home to coca plantations and makeshift labs for processing coca leaves. “When you take a look at Pablo Escobar and [Joaquín] ‘El Chapo' Guzmán, they were big drug traffickers – but they were never presidents of a country,” Vigil added. “So if Donald Trump is giving this guy a pardon, why is he not giving [the also incarcerated Mexican cartel boss] Chapo Guzmán a pardon? El ​Chapo Guzmán is less of a figure in the drug world than Juan Orlando Hernández was.” “It's crazy … it really undermines his hard-line ‘war on drugs' position,” Grillo said, wondering if Trump might rethink his move given the outcry. US prosecutors alleged that even before taking power Hernández had started conspiring with Latin American narco bosses who have long used the Central American country as a trampoline to smuggle drugs into the US. Jurors agreed and, in July 2024, Hernández was sentenced to more than four decades in prison “for cocaine importation and related weapons offenses”. Among his crimes was accepting $1m from El Chapo “to support Juan Orlando Hernández's presidential campaign”. Vigil believed Hernández was responsible for helping move billions of dollars worth of cocaine into the US – far more than the fast boats Trump's “kinetic strikes” have destroyed in the Caribbean and Pacific since September. “He's killed approximately 80 people, destroyed approximately 20 boats, and he has not provided any concrete evidence that they were carrying drugs,” said Vigil, who believed many of those killed on the fast boats were impoverished fishers who, in some cases, might have earned $200-a-month for transporting drugs. “Maduro is not a saint,” said Vigil, noting how he and several allies were indicted for trafficking cocaine in the US in 2020. Orlando Pérez, a Latin America expert from the University of North Texas at Dallas, said Trump's double standards on which drug smuggling presidents to pursue revealed there was no consistent strategy to fight the region's drug traffickers. “It's all ad hoc and based on political considerations,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The popularity of telehealth to circumvent state bans has made it a top target for abortion opponents. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. House Bill 7 represents abortion opponents' most ambitious effort to halt telehealth abortions, which have helped patients get around strict bans in Texas and other states after Roe v. Wade was overturned. The law, which goes into effect December 4, creates civil penalties for health care providers who make abortion medications available in Texas, allowing any private citizen to sue medical providers for a minimum penalty of $100,000. The bill's backers have said it would also allow suits against drug manufacturers. It would not enable suits against the people who get abortions. Though other states have passed legislation targeting abortion medications — classifying them as a controlled substance, for instance — the Texas law is novel in its approach to targeting the people who distribute them and its reliance on civil suits. Medical providers say the law won't stop them from providing abortions to people in Texas. Three major telehealth practices confirmed that they intend to keep prescribing and mailing abortion medications to patients in Texas, citing other states' laws that would shield them from Texas-based suits. Elisa Wells, the director of Plan C, which lists abortion options for people across the country, said she has not heard from any providers about plans to stop offering telehealth abortions to Texans. “If anything, the implementation of this law makes people more determined to help folks in Texas access abortion pills,” Wells said. GenBioPro, which manufactures a generic version of the drug, also declined to comment. Those private suits could accelerate a clash between state abortion laws that is widely expected to be resolved by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court. Those laws say that state governments will not comply with extraterritorial efforts to punish health care providers for offering services legal in the state where they reside — including abortions. Almost half of all states have some form of shield law, though only eight explicitly protect providers no matter where a patient is located. Under those laws, medical professionals living in states where abortion is legal have continued to mail medications patients can use to end their pregnancies from home — a method that is well-studied and effective with rare complications. The method's popularity has made telehealth a top target for abortion opponents. No state has effectively halted the provision of telehealth abortions into states with bans, but HB 7's implementation introduces a new tool for anti-abortion activists to leverage. “We are building partnerships, we are educating our friends and other Texans about what the law is and what would be needed — and putting a team in place for if we actually need to bring one of these lawsuits at the end of the year,” said John Seago, head of the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, who played a leading role in shepherding HB 7. That has involved meeting with abortion opponents across the state, including those who run anti-abortion centers, organizations that resemble medical clinics but instead deter people from terminating their pregnancies. Many also market services such as “post-abortion counseling.” Those offerings can put them in touch with people who have used telehealth for an abortion, and who could be sources for potential suits — especially given the dearth of dedicated reproductive health facilities in the state. Anti-abortion centers were a key source of support for HB 7. “These contacts have the potential to come into contact with someone who had ordered these pills, or these pills were given to them, and they would have firsthand experience of how the pills got into Texas,” Seago said. Already, health professionals mailing abortion pills to Texans have been sued. The state Attorney General Ken Paxton has brought a case against Margaret Carpenter, a physician in New York, for mailing abortion pills to the state. Jonathan Mitchell, a prominent lawyer who has helped craft many of the state's anti-abortion laws, has brought wrongful death lawsuits — typically used to sue someone for a death caused by negligence or recklessness — against multiple telehealth providers, arguing an abortion is the death of a person. Mitchell has indicated in court documents that he intends to amend at least one civil case — a wrongful death brought against California-based Dr. Remy Coeytaux — after the law takes effect. He did not respond to a request for an interview. Health care providers are watching that case closely, with some saying it could provide key insight into whether and how the new law could affect their risk. “That will give us some information about what this is going to look like and how that moves through the courts,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who founded the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project, a major telehealth practice. That reality, coupled with the rise of blue state laws to protect health care providers, has left many who offer telehealth skeptical that the new Texas law will immediately reach them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An official confirmed nearly a dozen deaths, including a mother and her child, in Artibonite region over the weekend Heavily armed gangs attacked Haiti's central region over the weekend, killing men, women and children as they set fire to homes and forced survivors to flee into the darkness. Police made emergency calls for backup, asserting that 50% of the Artibonite region had fallen under gang control after the large-scale attacks targeting towns including Bercy and Pont-Sondé. “The gangs are still in Pont-Sondé,” he said, noting that no additional police had arrived. Many survivors fled to the coastal town of Saint-Marc, where hundreds of angry people on Monday demanded that the government take action against gangs who have repeatedly attacked Haiti's central region. Charlesma Jean Marcos, a political activist, said the gang announced last week that they were going to invade the area, and that they alerted authorities to no avail. “A lot of people are going to be hungry,” he warned. More than half of Haiti's population is already experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, with gangs blocking main roads and the ongoing violence displacing a record 1.4 million people. The attacks in central Haiti began late Friday and late Saturday, with gang members broadcasting them live on social media. “I heard heavy shooting, so much shooting,” said one man who said he was stuck inside his house all weekend. “Why don't they send any drones to Artibonite? They don't want to destroy this gang.” Gran Grif is considered one of Haiti's cruelest gangs. Also sanctioned was Prophane Victor, a former legislator that the UN accused of arming young men in the Artibonite region. The UN has said killings have risen dramatically in Haiti's Artibonite and Centre departments this year, with 1,303 victims reported from January to August, compared with 419 during the same period in 2024. “These assaults underscore the capacity of gangs to consolidate control across a corridor from the Centre to the Artibonite amid limited law enforcement presence and logistical constraints,” a recent UN report stated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airbus is inspecting panels on its bestselling A320 passenger jets after quality control problems surfaced, days after it reported that it was scrambling to fix a separate software problem affecting about 6,000 of the popular planes. The European plane maker said Monday that it “identified a supplier quality issue affecting a limited number” of metal panels on the single-aisle A320 aircraft. “The source of the issue has been identified, contained and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements,” Airbus said in a brief statement. The company said it's taking a conservative approach and inspecting all planes that could potentially be affected by the problem, “knowing that only a portion of them will need further action to be taken.” Airbus sources parts and components from thousands of outside suppliers. Airbus had said earlier Monday that most of its fleet of 6,000 A320 passenger jets have received an update to fix a software glitch that could have affected flight controls. Airlines race to fix Airbus jets as U.S. reports little disruption The problem is suspected of contributing to a sudden drop in altitude of a JetBlue plane from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey on Oct. 30, that injured at least 15 passengers, some of them transported to hospitals for medical care. More than 500 U.S.-registered aircraft were impacted, including jets flown by American Airlines and Delta. Japan's All Nippon Airways, Air India and Germany's Lufthansa were also affected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hong Kong officials have announced that legislative elections scheduled for Dec. 7 will go ahead as planned, even as anger grows over the devastating Wang Fuk Court fire, which killed at least 151 people and injured dozens more. Regardless of public sentiment, there is no risk the government might lose power in Sunday's polls. Since a crackdown that followed pro-democracy protests in 2019, the former British colony's already semi-democratic system has only become less representative, with voters choosing just 22 per cent of the seats being contested – and even that small portion from a list of “patriots” approved by a government committee. Police and anti-corruption investigators have arrested 13 people in connection with the Wang Fuk Court fire, which officials have said spread so quickly in part owing to substandard materials used for renovations. “These people caused multiple deaths for petty gains,” Hong Kong Chief Secretary Eric Chan said. Canadians with roots in Hong Kong devastated after deadly apartment fire Some have accused officials of seeking to blame construction materials – particularly bamboo scaffolding, an icon of Hong Kong's development – rather than oversight or regulation failures. Over the weekend, a former district councillor, Kenneth Cheung, and a student organizer, Miles Kwan, were both detained by national security police, according to local media. In a statement, Hong Kong's Office for Safeguarding National Security warned that “anti-China elements and those with ulterior motives remain restless and seek opportunities to cause trouble.” By revamping elections to be “patriots only,” the authorities have removed a potential release valve for public anger. They have also lost a vital source of accountability and responsiveness, particularly at the local level, where fully elected district councils have been replaced by largely appointed bodies run by government bureaucrats and “care teams” akin to mainland China's red-armband-wearing neighbourhood watch organizations. In the past, district councillors and elected members of Hong Kong's legislature were easily accessible, often giving their WhatsApp numbers to their constituents and sending out newsletters detailing the work they were doing. There is little danger that a mass protest movement could emerge like the one in 2019. Hong Kong's civil society has been decimated in the years since, while national security police remain on high alert. In an editorial Monday, the state-backed newspaper Wen Wei Po warned that “the national security law hangs like a sharp blade overhead, ready at any moment to be unsheathed to eliminate those who disrupt Hong Kong's society.” Nor can it credibly claim mass voter turnout when there isn't any (unlike, say, Iraq's Saddam Hussein or Rwanda's Paul Kagame). Local authorities have been reduced to increasingly desperate get-out-the-vote campaigns, plastering billboards, public transport, fire engines, government buildings and taxis with posters reminding people to “join the election together, we create the future.” More likely, however, Hong Kongers will demonstrate their disapproval of this system the only way left to them: by not taking part. Facing mounting questions about whether the Wang Fuk Court fire could have been avoided, officials may fear Sunday's turnout will be even lower.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Resignation of Zelensky's top aide may push Kiev to reconsider its approach to dialogue, and Kazakhstan protests against Ukraine's attack on the oil pipeline infrastructure. Meanwhile, US leader Donald Trump steps up his pressure campaign on Venezuela. These stories topped Monday's newspaper headlines across Russia. The scandalous high-profile resignation of Andrey Yermak, the head of Vladimir Zelensky's office, opens the way for a more pragmatic path in negotiations for Ukraine, Russian foreign ministry's ambassador at large, Rodion Miroshnik, told Izvestia. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and the US leader's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Ukrainian negotiators led by Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary, instead of Yermak. The Florida meeting should become a step toward coordinating positions ahead of a potential meeting between Zelensky and US President Donald Trump. Later on Monday, Zelensky will arrive in Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. "Since a corruption scandal broke in Kiev, support for Zelensky has largely lost its significance for Washington, while Kiev seems to have found itself in the most critical position since February 2022, now that problems on the front line have been aggravated with political issues domestically and external pressure from its key partner," an analyst at the Higher School of Economics, Tigran Meloyan, told Izvestia. However, the Ukrainian leadership could as well reject any peace agreement, Bogdan Bezpalko, a member of the Russian Presidential Council for Interethnic Relations, noted. "Like any other Ukrainian politician who could potentially sign a peace accord, Zelensky risks being accused of making concessions and may therefore try and avoid this responsibility," the expert told Izvestia. As a result, Outside Pier 2 near Novorossiysk was severely damaged, and using it is not yet feasible, the CPC reported. Also, during the attack, the Ukrainian Navy's drones hit two Gambian-flagged tankers heading for loading to Novorossiysk, Reuters reported, citing a Ukrainian Security Council official. Ukraine is deliberately seeking to disrupt the negotiation process as it also sends a signal to the United States about its reluctance to compromise in potential peace talks with Russia, something that US President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for previously, Pavel Koshkin, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies, told Vedomosti. "If the oil loading pause [at the CPC] lasts more than a week, storage tanks will fill up very quickly, and Kazakhstan will have to reduce oil production. Oil producers will not be able to pay taxes as usual. While this report has not been confirmed yet, there are signs that the "war of nerves" between the United States and Venezuela may soon reach its climax: Trump called for the airspace over and around the Latin American country to be considered completely closed, while Venezuela stepped up its crackdown on opposition leaders who could replace Maduro. On Saturday, Trump took to his Truth Social media platform to declare the airspace above Venezuela should be considered closed. "To all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY," he posted. Nor is Venezuela going to accept the US rules about a no-fly zone. "The Bolivarian government warns that Venezuela will not implement orders or obey threats or interference from any other foreign country," Venezuela's top diplomat, Yvan Gil Pinto, said in a statement on Telegram. According to PROVEA, a Venezuelan human rights network, in October, as many as 54 people were detained, many of whom have ties to Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado. "I think this is purely a media campaign that has nothing to do with reality. And Maria Corina Machado may be behind it. Maduro would need a pretext to begin repressions. The United States has stepped up its pressure on Turkey over Russian oil and gas purchases, the Russian Embassy in Ankara told Izvestia. Washington is increasingly pushing its allies to reduce or even cancel their energy cooperation with Moscow. While, against this backdrop, the share of Russian oil in exports to Turkey has reportedly declined, experts argue that in reality oil purchases have continued unabated. For the Turkish leadership, energy imports from Russia are not a question of whether they like or dislike Russia, but rather a question of whether they will gain from cooperation or not, economist Vasily Koltashov, director of the Institute of New Society, explained to Izvestia. "Turks have traditionally sought to win, or continue cooperation, as Ankara is governed by an administration that does not rely on the West, and this is why it has not halted trade with Russia," he said. A reduction in Russian energy imports, if any, will likely be more nominal than real, Koltashov emphasized. According to him, the West has exerted a similar pressure on many Asian markets as regards anti-Russian sanctions: while Indian oil refineries have already announced a cessation of Russian oil purchases, this announcement actually has not corresponded to reality. Russian grain exports to Turkey may be promising, Yury Mavashev, an Orientalist and lecturer at the Department of World Politics and World Economy at the RANEPA Institute of Management, told Izvestia. According to his estimates, as the republic may face a severe drought in 2026, it may double Russian grain imports to 7.3 million metric tons. Koltashov agrees that Turkey is facing a difficult economic situation. Should Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan succumb to Western pressure, things inside the country "will get even worse" for him, the expert concluded. Global silver prices have reached a new all-time high, rising above $56 per troy ounce, as the precious metal has almost doubled in price since early 2025. Over the past few days, silver has outperformed other precious metals, with spot market prices for gold and palladium rising by 4% to 5% and platinum going up by 10%. Nikita Bredikhin, leading investment analyst at Go Invest, explained to Kommersant that during the 43-day US federal government shutdown more than $619 billion in funds was borrowed, creating market liquidity shortages. Against that backdrop, market expectations regarding the US federal funds rates increased as investors now expect the Fed to transition from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE). Sergey Suverov, investment strategist at Aricapital Asset Management, explained that a rate cut could push the dollar index and Treasury yields lower, increasing the appeal of investments in stocks and precious metals. Moreover, rising geopolitical tensions, including expectations of a military conflict between the United States and Venezuela, may trigger a rise in safe-haven assets.

RIYADH, December 1. /TASS/. Russia has proposed cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said.

"We propose jointly implementing projects in the area of artificial intelligence application in healthcare, education, geoanalytics (Sber - TASS), introduction and localization of solutions in the field of cybersecurity (Cyberus Foundation, Rostelecom)," he said.

Partnership in the area of digital technologies is also relevant considering their application in construction and urban development, Novak added. "We have a good example of it: the interaction between Moscow and Riyadh," he said.

Russia and Saudi Arabia already have experience of mutually beneficial cooperation in the field of digital technologies for smart cities, physical and cybersecurity, and electronic services, the official noted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four men have been arrested over their alleged involvement in an “international satanic child sex abuse material ring,” according to Australian Police, who say they're still working to identify the victims. Jayne Doherty, commander of the New South Wales sex crimes squad, said the four men allegedly shared “abhorrent” content with an international network depicting children from infants to 12 years old – as well as animals. “Police will allege in court that this international group were engaging in conversations and the sharing of material which depicted child abuse and the torture of children involving symbols and rituals linked to Satanism and the occult,” Doherty said Monday. “Thousands of videos” were found on electronic devices seized during several simultaneous raids on properties in Sydney last week, Doherty said. Video released by NSW Police showed the arrest of a 26-year-old man in the inner-city suburb of Waterloo, whom police alleged to have played a “leading role” in the group. Officers can be seen using a battering ram to enter the apartment and are heard shouting “police” before taking a man dressed in zebra-print shorts and T-shirt into custody. The investigation was carried out by the NSW sex crimes squad as part of Strike Force Constantine, an operation established in April that investigates the online distribution of child sexual abuse involving ritualistic or satanic themes. In November, police were made aware a group of men in Sydney, who were allegedly part of a larger international pedophile syndicate. They were “communicating with each other and… also sharing explicit child abuse material across that international group,” Doherty alleged. “We've not identified an actual child, but the images are of real children,” she said. The 26-year-old was charged with several offenses, including making available child abuse material and possession of child abuse material. He was also charged with disseminating and possessing bestiality material, police said. Three men, aged 46, 42 and 39, were arrested in the coastal suburb of Malabar in connection with the same child abuse network. They face several charges relating to the possession or distribution of child abuse material. All four men, who have not been named by police, were refused bail and will appear in court in January next year. The abuse was “particularly devastating in that they used symbols and rituals around it in the discussions that they were having about abusing children,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. NATO is weighing a shift toward a more assertive response to Russia's cyber operations, sabotage, and airspace violations, the alliance's top military official told the Financial Times (FT). Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, who chairs NATO's Military Committee, said the alliance is reassessing how it confronts hybrid threats that have intensified across Europe. He also suggested that a "pre-emptive strike" could, in some circumstances, be viewed as "defensive action," while noting that such an approach is "further away from our normal way of thinking and behavior." European countries have faced a string of hybrid incidents in recent years — including cyberattacks, suspected Russian-linked sabotage, and repeated cases of underwater infrastructure being damaged in the Baltic Sea. While some NATO members, particularly in Eastern Europe, have pressed for a tougher posture, Dragone said any change requires careful consideration of legal and jurisdictional limits. "Being more aggressive compared with the aggressivity of our counterpart could be an option. Dragone highlighted NATO's Baltic Sentry mission as an example of successful deterrence. The operation deploys allied ships, aircraft, and naval drones to monitor critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea following multiple cable-cutting incidents in 2023 and 2024. "From the beginning of Baltic Sentry, nothing has happened. Finland's Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen acknowledged to the FT that this effectively gives Russian vessels carte blanche in such waters. She added that becoming more assertive is under review but cautioned that allies "shouldn't be hysterical" and should "trust" existing response frameworks. Dragone said the central challenge for NATO is determining how to prevent future hybrid attacks. "How deterrence is achieved — through retaliation, through pre-emptive strike — this is something we have to analyse deeply because there could be in the future even more pressure on this," he said.

She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. The visit follows talks between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Florida, as Kyiv seeks to negotiate better conditions in the Washington-backed 28-point peace deal. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff held another meeting with Ukrainian negotiator and top security official Rustem Umerov in Florida, a White House official told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 1. Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claims that railway infrastructure was damaged in Russia's Novosibirsk and Bryansk regions on Nov. 20 and Nov. 28, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. On the morning of Monday, December 1, a Russian ballistic missile struck the city of Dnipro, killing four people and injuring 22, according to local authorities. Yevhenii Ivanov, 41, and Oleksandr Kononov, 39, are suspected of sabotaging the Warsaw-Lublin railway line in mid-November before fleeing to Belarus. Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, who chairs NATO's Military Committee, told the Financial Times that the alliance is reassessing how it confronts hybrid threats that have intensified across Europe. Lithuanian authorities extended the latest airspace restrictions until 5 a.m. local time on Dec. 1. Independent journalism is never easy, and it's even harder in wartime.

Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD has issued another major recall, its second in just a few weeks, amid growing scrutiny over the safety of its battery systems. The company said on Thursday it would recall 88,981 Qin Plus DM-i plug-in hybrid sedans due to potential battery defects.

China's State Administration for Market Regulation announced the recall on Friday, saying the affected vehicles may experience limited battery output due to inconsistencies in the manufacturing process of the power-battery pack. In extreme cases, the cars may be unable to operate in pure-electric mode, posing a safety risk.

The recall covers two production batches: 52,890 vehicles manufactured between Sept. 26, 2021, and Sept. 23, 2023, and another 36,091 produced between Jan. 7, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2022.

In mid-October, the automaker informed the State Administration for Market Regulation of its largest-ever recall, more than 115,000 Tang and Yuan Pro models produced from 2015 to 2022, over design flaws and battery-related safety risks.

The latest recall underscores the challenges facing BYD as it seeks to expand rapidly into global markets while defending its safety record and business practices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro made his first public appearance in days on Sunday, putting to an end speculation within the country that he had fled amid escalating tensions with the US. Maduro, who usually appears on Venezuelan television multiple times a week, had not been seen in public since Wednesday – when he posted a video of himself driving around Caracas on his Telegram channel – leading to intense speculation as to his whereabouts. On Sunday, he appeared at an annual specialty-coffee awards event in eastern Caracas. In images that were broadcast online, the president sat before a crowd and handed out medals to coffee producers showcasing their top products. “I don't want to comment on that – the answer is yes,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked whether the call had taken place. “I wouldn't say it went well or badly. Maduro and senior members of his government have not commented on the phone call with Trump. On Sunday, Jorge Rodríguez, who heads Venezuela's National Assembly, declined to discuss the conversation, saying it was not the purpose of his press conference – which instead focused on announcing an inquiry into recent US maritime strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that have killed more than 80 people. In recent days, the US president has increased the pressure on Maduro by warning that strikes on land against drug trafficking networks could be coming “very soon” and telling airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace. However, speaking on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump told reporters his warning about Venezuelan airspace was not a signal that an airstrike is imminent. “Don't read anything into it,” the president said, adding he made the airspace warning “because we consider Venezuela to be not a very friendly country.” CNN exclusive: Colombian president says oil is ‘at the heart of' US pressure campaign on Venezuela Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil Pinto posted the letter to OPEC on Telegram, alongside a vow that Venezuela would “remain firm in defending its natural energy resources.” We will continue to be free and sovereign!” Pinto wrote. Previously, the US State Department has pushed back against such claims. “There's no declared war (between the US and Venezuela), therefore this cannot be classified as anything but murder,” Rodriguez, the National Assembly president, told a press conference Sunday. CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment. This is the first time Caracas has said openly that some of its citizens have been killed by the US strikes, which have been going on since September. President Trump warns Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed. The investigation, he said, would look into reports that the US military carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. According to a statement from the Office of the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, Venezuelans facing government repression are routinely denied a fair trial. More than 50 Venezuelans have been detained in the month of October alone for political reasons, human rights groups told CNN. The Venezuelan government has denied allegations of human rights abuse.</p>

Detectives were still working to identify a possible motive. “If you have any information as to this individual, reach out immediately. If you are this individual, turn yourself in immediately,” San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas said during a news conference.
