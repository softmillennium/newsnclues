Why has Trump blown up alleged narco boats in the Caribbean and at the same time decided to let a big time trafficker off the hook?

Deadly airstrikes and a military buildup: how the US pressure campaign against Venezuela has unfolded in the Caribbean

He was a Latin American president accused of colluding with some of the region's most ruthless narco bosses to flood the United States with cocaine.

“[Let's] stuff the drugs right up the noses of the gringos,” the double-dealing politician once allegedly bragged as he lined his pockets with millions of dollars in bribes and turned his country into what many called a narco-state.

The description might sound like a sketch of Venezuela's authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, who Donald Trump's administration has accused of being a “narco-terrorist” kingpin and is trying to topple with a $50m bounty and a huge display of military might off the South American country's Caribbean coast.

But it is actually a portrait – painted by US prosecutors, no less – of the former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who Trump last week pledged to pardon, despite the fact that Hernández was sentenced last year to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”.

“The people of Honduras really thought he was set up and it was a terrible thing,” Trump told reporters on Sunday. “He was the president of the country and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country … and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.”

Trump's astonishing intervention in favour of Hernández, who is known by his initials JOH, has baffled many observers, with one Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent calling the move “lunacy”.

Why would the US president use his “war on drugs” as a justification for overthrowing Maduro – despite what many see as flimsy evidence that the Venezuelan leader really is a narco boss – while simultaneously offering a Get Out of Jail Free card to a man already found guilty of such crimes in a Manhattan federal court?

Why had Trump spent recent weeks blowing up alleged narco boats in the Caribbean – with negligible impact on flow of drugs to the US – and at the same time decided to let a big time trafficker convicted of smuggling far larger quantities of drugs off the hook?

“It just shows that the entire counter-drug effort of Donald Trump is a charade – it's based on lies, it's based on hypocrisy,” said Mike Vigil, the former DEA chief for international operations. “He is giving a pardon to Juan Orlando Hernández and then going after Nicolás Maduro … It's all hypocritical.”

Contrary to Trump's claim that Hernández, 57, had been the victim of a “Biden set up”, Vigil said there was overwhelming evidence that the Central American politician was “a big fish in the narco world”. Not only had Hernández helped turn Honduras into a major transit point for South American cocaine heading to the US, but Vigil said he had also transformed it into a cocaine producing hub which was now home to coca plantations and makeshift labs for processing coca leaves.

“When you take a look at Pablo Escobar and [Joaquín] ‘El Chapo' Guzmán, they were big drug traffickers – but they were never presidents of a country,” Vigil added.

“So if Donald Trump is giving this guy a pardon, why is he not giving [the also incarcerated Mexican cartel boss] Chapo Guzmán a pardon? El ​Chapo Guzmán is less of a figure in the drug world than Juan Orlando Hernández was.”

Ioan Grillo, the author of a trio of books on Latin America's narco underworld, was also puzzled by Trump's “jaw-dropping” offer. “It's crazy … it really undermines his hard-line ‘war on drugs' position,” Grillo said, wondering if Trump might rethink his move given the outcry.

US prosecutors alleged that even before taking power Hernández had started conspiring with Latin American narco bosses who have long used the Central American country as a trampoline to smuggle drugs into the US. Jurors agreed and, in July 2024, Hernández was sentenced to more than four decades in prison “for cocaine importation and related weapons offenses”. His younger brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, was sentenced to life in prison in 2021. Among his crimes was accepting $1m from El Chapo “to support Juan Orlando Hernández's presidential campaign”.

Vigil believed Hernández was responsible for helping move billions of dollars worth of cocaine into the US – far more than the fast boats Trump's “kinetic strikes” have destroyed in the Caribbean and Pacific since September.

“He's killed approximately 80 people, destroyed approximately 20 boats, and he has not provided any concrete evidence that they were carrying drugs,” said Vigil, who believed many of those killed on the fast boats were impoverished fishers who, in some cases, might have earned $200-a-month for transporting drugs.

Meanwhile, despite Trump's claims that Maduro is the leader of a narco organization called the “Cartel of the Suns”, many experts doubt such a group even exists.

“Maduro is not a saint,” said Vigil, noting how he and several allies were indicted for trafficking cocaine in the US in 2020. “[But] they're not a cartel, they don't have an infrastructure,” he added, calling such allegations a “nonsense”.

Orlando Pérez, a Latin America expert from the University of North Texas at Dallas, said Trump's double standards on which drug smuggling presidents to pursue revealed there was no consistent strategy to fight the region's drug traffickers. “It's all ad hoc and based on political considerations,” he said.

“One [Hernández] is a right-wing supporter of the US – and the other [Maduro] is not,” Pérez added. “It is ideological. It is political. It is self-interested in terms of advancing an ideological agenda – and it has nothing to do with effective anti-drug policies.”

Texas' massive new abortion law taking effect this week could escalate the national fight over mailing abortion pills.

House Bill 7 represents abortion opponents' most ambitious effort to halt telehealth abortions, which have helped patients get around strict bans in Texas and other states after Roe v. Wade was overturned. The law, which goes into effect December 4, creates civil penalties for health care providers who make abortion medications available in Texas, allowing any private citizen to sue medical providers for a minimum penalty of $100,000. The bill's backers have said it would also allow suits against drug manufacturers. It would not enable suits against the people who get abortions.

Though other states have passed legislation targeting abortion medications — classifying them as a controlled substance, for instance — the Texas law is novel in its approach to targeting the people who distribute them and its reliance on civil suits.

Medical providers say the law won't stop them from providing abortions to people in Texas. Three major telehealth practices confirmed that they intend to keep prescribing and mailing abortion medications to patients in Texas, citing other states' laws that would shield them from Texas-based suits. Elisa Wells, the director of Plan C, which lists abortion options for people across the country, said she has not heard from any providers about plans to stop offering telehealth abortions to Texans. 

“If anything, the implementation of this law makes people more determined to help folks in Texas access abortion pills,” Wells said.

Pharmaceutical companies have not clarified how they will respond. Danco, one of the principal manufacturers of the abortion medication mifepristone, declined to comment. GenBioPro, which manufactures a generic version of the drug, also declined to comment.

However, anti-abortion activists who championed the law say they plan to launch civil lawsuits against health care providers who continue to mail medications to Texas. Those private suits could accelerate a clash between state abortion laws that is widely expected to be resolved by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court.

At issue is the conflict between individual state abortion restrictions and shield laws in other states that protect abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions. Those laws say that state governments will not comply with extraterritorial efforts to punish health care providers for offering services legal in the state where they reside — including abortions. Almost half of all states have some form of shield law, though only eight explicitly protect providers no matter where a patient is located.

Under those laws, medical professionals living in states where abortion is legal have continued to mail medications patients can use to end their pregnancies from home — a method that is well-studied and effective with rare complications. Research suggests that 1 in 4 abortions are now done through telehealth, with about half of those in states with bans or restrictions. 

The method's popularity has made telehealth a top target for abortion opponents. No state has effectively halted the provision of telehealth abortions into states with bans, but HB 7's implementation introduces a new tool for anti-abortion activists to leverage.

“We are building partnerships, we are educating our friends and other Texans about what the law is and what would be needed — and putting a team in place for if we actually need to bring one of these lawsuits at the end of the year,” said John Seago, head of the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, who played a leading role in shepherding HB 7. 

That has involved meeting with abortion opponents across the state, including those who run anti-abortion centers, organizations that resemble medical clinics but instead deter people from terminating their pregnancies. Many also market services such as “post-abortion counseling.” Those offerings can put them in touch with people who have used telehealth for an abortion, and who could be sources for potential suits — especially given the dearth of dedicated reproductive health facilities in the state. Anti-abortion centers were a key source of support for HB 7.

“These contacts have the potential to come into contact with someone who had ordered these pills, or these pills were given to them, and they would have firsthand experience of how the pills got into Texas,” Seago said. “Those are the types of individuals we need to partner with to bring these lawsuits most effectively. We are definitely building that network out.”

Already, health professionals mailing abortion pills to Texans have been sued. The state Attorney General Ken Paxton has brought a case against Margaret Carpenter, a physician in New York, for mailing abortion pills to the state. (In New York, state officials have cited the shield law in declining to enforce a Texas court's ruling that fined Carpenter $113,000.) Jonathan Mitchell, a prominent lawyer who has helped craft many of the state's anti-abortion laws, has brought wrongful death lawsuits — typically used to sue someone for a death caused by negligence or recklessness — against multiple telehealth providers, arguing an abortion is the death of a person. Those cases are still making their way through court.

The new law could strengthen Texas' case against telehealth. Mitchell has indicated in court documents that he intends to amend at least one civil case — a wrongful death brought against California-based Dr. Remy Coeytaux — after the law takes effect. He did not respond to a request for an interview.

Health care providers are watching that case closely, with some saying it could provide key insight into whether and how the new law could affect their risk. 

“That will give us some information about what this is going to look like and how that moves through the courts,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who founded the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project, a major telehealth practice. “And again, it's going to be an opportunity for us to see shield laws in action.”

HB 7 closely resembles a 2021 Texas law that effectively outlawed abortions after six weeks of pregnancies — the majority of abortions — months before the fall of Roe v. Wade. That law pioneered the use of private civil suits to stop the provision of most abortions.

Though the law halted abortion providers from operating in the state, there were no successful lawsuits against health care providers. That reality, coupled with the rise of blue state laws to protect health care providers, has left many who offer telehealth skeptical that the new Texas law will immediately reach them. 

“We are confident this is exactly what the Massachusetts shield law is meant to protect us from: civil penalties related to providing legally protected reproductive health care, which is what we're doing,” Foster said. “I'm not naive that there could easily be suits, and that means our lawyers will have to be involved in handling that. There's energy involved in ignoring something. But we're not changing anything about our practice and not anticipating any changes to our practice in regard to HB 7.”

An official confirmed nearly a dozen deaths, including a mother and her child, in Artibonite region over the weekend

Heavily armed gangs attacked Haiti's central region over the weekend, killing men, women and children as they set fire to homes and forced survivors to flee into the darkness.

Police made emergency calls for backup, asserting that 50% of the Artibonite region had fallen under gang control after the large-scale attacks targeting towns including Bercy and Pont-Sondé.

“The population cannot live, cannot work, cannot move,” one of Haiti's police unions, SPNH-17, said Sunday on X. “Losing the country's 2 largest departments – West and Artibonite – is the greatest security failure in modern Haitian history.”

The bulk of Haiti's police force and the Kenyan officers leading a UN-backed mission to help repel gangs are in the capital, Port-au-Prince, which itself is largely held by gangs.

Guerby Simeus, a Pont-Sondé official, said on Monday that he had confirmed nearly a dozen deaths, including a mother and her child and a local government employee.

“The gangs are still in Pont-Sondé,” he said, noting that no additional police had arrived.

Many survivors fled to the coastal town of Saint-Marc, where hundreds of angry people on Monday demanded that the government take action against gangs who have repeatedly attacked Haiti's central region.

“Give me the guns! I'm going to fight the gangs!” said Réné Charles, who survived the attack. “We've got to stand up and fight!”

The crowd tried to break into the mayor's office with one unidentified man telling the Associated Press that they weren't going to rely on the government any longer: “We're going to take justice into our own hands!”

Charlesma Jean Marcos, a political activist, said the gang announced last week that they were going to invade the area, and that they alerted authorities to no avail.

“For now, the only people really fighting (the gang) is the self-defense group,” he said. “A country cannot run like this.”

Marcos urged all the survivors sleeping on the street and in public parks to instead sleep inside police stations and government offices until the government can take back Artibonite.

“A lot of people are going to be hungry,” he warned. “We can support you today, we can support you tomorrow, but we won't be able to support you forever.”

More than half of Haiti's population is already experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, with gangs blocking main roads and the ongoing violence displacing a record 1.4 million people.

The attacks in central Haiti began late Friday and late Saturday, with gang members broadcasting them live on social media.

The attacks were blamed on the Gran Grif gang, which operates in the area and was responsible for an attack on Pont-Sondé in October 2024 that killed at least 100 people, one of the biggest massacres in Haiti's recent history.

“I heard heavy shooting, so much shooting,” said one man who said he was stuck inside his house all weekend. “Why don't they send any drones to Artibonite? They just use the drones in Port-au-Prince. I feel this gang is special. They don't want to destroy this gang.”

A spokesperson for Haiti's national police did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Gran Grif is considered one of Haiti's cruelest gangs. Its leader, Luckson Elan, recently was sanctioned by the UN security council and the US government. Also sanctioned was Prophane Victor, a former legislator that the UN accused of arming young men in the Artibonite region.

The UN has said killings have risen dramatically in Haiti's Artibonite and Centre departments this year, with 1,303 victims reported from January to August, compared with 419 during the same period in 2024.

“These assaults underscore the capacity of gangs to consolidate control across a corridor from the Centre to the Artibonite amid limited law enforcement presence and logistical constraints,” a recent UN report stated.

Leaked assessment based on confidential accounts from 24 FBI sources describes organization as a ‘rudderless ship'

US politics live – latest updates

The FBI director, Kash Patel, is “in over his head” and leading a “chronically under-performing” agency paralyzed by fear and plummeting morale, according to a scathing 115-page report compiled by a national alliance of retired and active-duty FBI special agents and analysts.

The leaked assessment, obtained by the New York Post and prepared for both congressional Senate and House judiciary committees, is based on confidential accounts from 24 FBI sources.

They accuse Patel of lacking the experience to lead the FBI and that managers will not take initiative without explicit direction for fear of being fired. Patel's first six months have produced a “troubling picture” of an organization described by insiders as a “rudderless ship”, with two sources independently characterizing the director as being “in over his head”. One stated he “lacks the requisite knowledge or deep understanding of all the FBI's unique and complex investigative and intelligence programs”.

One key accusation is that the FBI has become “internally paralyzed by fear”. Managers are “afraid of losing their jobs”, and “waiting on directions from the FBI director” rather than taking initiative, according to multiple sources.

That paralysis stems partly from before his nomination, when Patel publicly accused the FBI of being part of a “deep state” conspiracy against Trump and called for its radical overhaul. He advocated for shutting down the FBI's Washington headquarters and dispersing employees across the country, and accused the bureau of political weaponization during investigations into Trump.

The assessment comes amid ongoing controversies surrounding Patel's tenure. Before his February 2025 confirmation, nearly 60 civil rights organizations urged the Senate to reject his nomination because of his lack of experience, foreign ties and misleading statements. Since taking office, he has faced criticism for refusing to release Jeffrey Epstein files and for prematurely announcing an arrest in the Kirk investigation that had to be retracted.

Patel, who served as a House intelligence committee staffer and later held roles in the Trump administration's first term – including as deputy director of national intelligence – is also the author of pro-Trump children's books including The Plot Against the King. After Trump lost the 2020 election, Patel became a fixture on rightwing media before Trump won again and catapulted him to lead the FBI.

He has also faced scrutiny over allegations he assigned Swat personnel to protect his girlfriend and used government aircraft for personal travel.

According to the assessment, on 11 September, the day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, Patel arrived in Provo, Utah, but refused to leave the FBI jet without an appropriate raid jacket. A described “highly respected” source in the report explained that agents working the Kirk investigation had to stop their work to find a medium-sized jacket for Patel. When a female agent's jacket was delivered, Patel complained about missing Velcro patches on the sleeves and refused to disembark until Swat team members removed patches from their own uniforms and attached them to the borrowed jacket.

The same source confirmed media reports that Patel “yelled” at the special agent-in-charge and directed “an expletive-laden tirade” over “perceived blunders” in the case. Dan Bongino, the deputy director, later telephoned to apologize, “saying that never should have happened”.

Both Patel and Bongino face criticism for what multiple sources describe as an excessive focus on social media. FBI employees reported hearing more about the bureau's mission from leadership's social media posts than through official internal channels.

Bongino, who lacks traditional FBI experience and was granted a Patel-authorized waiver exempting him from standard polygraph screening, is described by one source as “something of a clown”.

In one incident, Patel became upset after learning that FBI personnel at Quantico had discussed his request to be issued an FBI firearm. When details leaked, he ordered polygraph examinations for everyone involved to identify who had criticized him. One respected FBI leader in the assessment called the order “needlessly punitive”.

Not all feedback was negative. Multiple sources welcomed Patel's rollback of diversity and equity initiatives and praised immigration enforcement operations. Some reported improved prosecutorial support compared to the previous administration. However, while some sources supported firing senior executives deemed responsible for past politicization, they argued reforms “have not gone deep enough”.

The report also notes concerns from countries closely partnered with the United States. Sources in the report indicated that law enforcement and intelligence agencies from allied countries fear the Trump administration “may cause long-term damage to international cooperation”.

The anonymous authors, who requested confidentiality to protect their positions, told the Post their assessment “was never intended to be a hit piece” but acknowledged that “the anecdotal reporting from FBI personnel skewed 80/20 negative”. They concluded by advising Patel and Bongino to heed the criticism.

The White House recently denied media reports that Trump plans to fire Patel. The congressional judiciary committees named in the report will be receiving a copy of the assessment this week.

Michael Bohacek, an Indiana state senator, says US president's ‘choices of words have consequences'

US politics live – latest updates

A Republican Indiana lawmaker whose child has Down syndrome has promised to oppose efforts to redraw the state's congressional map to favor his party after Donald Trump aimed a slur for people with intellectual disabilities at a political opponent.

Michael Bohacek, a member of Indiana's state senate, wrote Friday on Facebook that he has been “an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities” since one of his daughters was born with Down. Referring to how the president used an ableist slur to insult Tim Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor, a day earlier, Bohacek's post added, “His choices of words have consequences.”

“I will be voting NO on redistricting, perhaps he can use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.”

Bohacek's opposition to Trump comes after the latter's administration has applied pressure on Republican lawmakers in Indiana to redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts. The goal would be to gain Republicans more US House seats as their party tries to retain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.

Indiana legislators are scheduled to weigh such a partisan redistricting measure later in December. But leaders of the state's senate have cautioned that there is not enough support in the legislative chamber to enact a congressional redistricting plan.

Trump in mid-November called for there to be primary election challenges mounted for any Republican state senator in Indiana who “votes against this important redistricting, potentially having an impact on America itself”.

“They … should DO THEIR JOB, AND DO IT NOW!” Trump's Truth Social post said. “If not, let's get them out of office.”

Bohacek pledged to defy Trump's wishes after a separate Truth post from the president. In that one, written after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC, Trump said he would “permanently pause” all immigration from “third world countries”, invoking Minnesota's Somali community while insulting Walz as “seriously retarded”.

Many Facebook users who replied to Bohacek's post thanked him for taking a stand against Trump, though some lamented that it took something hitting so close to home for him to oppose the president.

“You should care about people even when it hasn't affected you and your immediate family,” read one typical reply. “I'm glad at least you do understand it now. And thank you for your current stance.”

Bohacek has served in Indiana's senate since November 2016, when Trump won his first presidency.

Indiana is one of several states where the US's two major political parties are grappling with whether to embark on partisan redistricting.

Meanwhile, in August, Texas approved new congressional maps meant to help Republicans add as many as five seats in the 2026 midterms. California in November responded by passing a redistricting measure meant to allow Democrats to gain the same number of seats.

Habba disqualified from serving as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, appeals court says

Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Alina Habba, whom his administration has maneuvered to keep in place as New Jersey top federal prosecutor, is disqualified from serving in the role, an appeals court said Monday.

A panel of judges from the third US circuit court of appeals sitting in Philadelphia sided with a lower court judge's ruling after hearing oral arguments at which Habba herself was present on 20 October.

“It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place. Its efforts to elevate its preferred candidate for US attorney for the district of New Jersey, Alina Habba, to the role of acting US attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced – yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the US attorney's Office deserve some clarity and stability,” the court wrote in a 32-page opinion.

It concluded: “We will affirm the district court's disqualification order.”

The ruling comes amid the push by Trump's Republican administration to keep Habba as the acting US attorney for New Jersey, a powerful post charged with enforcing federal criminal and civil law. It also comes after the judges questioned the government's moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after that hearing in a statement posted to X that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied a chance for a Senate hearing.

Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the US attorney's office in New Jersey, Habba's personal staffer and the justice department.

Habba is hardly the only Trump administration prosecutor whose appointment has been challenged by defense lawyers.

Last week, a federal judge dismissed criminal cases against former FBI director James Comey and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, after concluding that the hastily installed prosecutor who filed the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed to the position of interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. The justice department has said it intends to appeal the rulings.

The judges on the panel were two appointed by Republican president George W Bush, D Brooks Smith and D Michael Fisher – as well as one named by Democratic president Barack Obama, Luis Felipe Restrepo.

A lower court judge said in August that Habba's appointment was done with a “novel series of legal and personnel moves” – and that she was not lawfully serving as US attorney for New Jersey.

That order said her actions since July could be invalidated, but he stayed the order pending appeal.

The government argued Habba is validly serving in the role under a federal statute allowing the first assistant attorney, a post she was appointed to by the Trump administration.

A similar dynamic is playing out in Nevada, where a federal judge disqualified the Trump administration's pick to be US attorney there.

The Habba case comes after several people charged with federal crimes in New Jersey challenged the legality of Habba's tenure. They sought to block the charges, arguing she didn't have the authority to prosecute their cases after her 120-day term as interim US attorney expired.

Habba was Trump's attorney in criminal and civil proceedings before he was elected to a second term. She served as a White House adviser briefly before Trump named her as a federal prosecutor in March.

Shortly after her appointment, she said in an interview with a right-wing influence that she hoped to help “turn New Jersey red”, a rare overt political expression from a prosecutor.

She then brought a trespassing charge, eventually dropped, against Democratic Newark mayor Ras Baraka stemming from his visit to a federal immigration detention center.

Habba later charged Democratic US House member LaMonica McIver with assault stemming from the same incident, a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress other than for corruption. McIver denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. The case is pending.

Questions about whether Habba would continue in the job arose in July when her temporary appointment was ending and it became clear New Jersey's two Democratic US senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, would not back her appointment.

Earlier this year as her appointment was expiring, federal judges in New Jersey exercised their power under the law to replace Habba with a career prosecutor who had served as her second-in-command.

Bondi then fired the prosecutor installed by the judges and renamed Habba as acting US attorney. The justice department said the judges acted prematurely and said Trump had the authority to appoint his preferred candidate to enforce federal laws in the state.

Brann's ruling said the president's appointments are still subject to the time limits and power-sharing rules laid out in federal law.

Airbus is inspecting panels on its bestselling A320 passenger jets after quality control problems surfaced, days after it reported that it was scrambling to fix a separate software problem affecting about 6,000 of the popular planes.

The European plane maker said Monday that it “identified a supplier quality issue affecting a limited number” of metal panels on the single-aisle A320 aircraft.

“The source of the issue has been identified, contained and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements,” Airbus said in a brief statement.

The company said it's taking a conservative approach and inspecting all planes that could potentially be affected by the problem, “knowing that only a portion of them will need further action to be taken.”

Airbus sources parts and components from thousands of outside suppliers.

The announcement, coming hours after it said that the software glitch had been mostly resolved with an update, sent the company's shares skidding.

Airbus had said earlier Monday that most of its fleet of 6,000 A320 passenger jets have received an update to fix a software glitch that could have affected flight controls.

Airlines race to fix Airbus jets as U.S. reports little disruption

Travelers had faced minor disruptions heading into the weekend as airlines around the world scrambled to push the software updates out to the widely used commercial jetliner. Airbus warned of the problem Friday with U.S. millions of passengers in transit for the Thanksgiving holiday, the busiest travel time in the United States.

The European planemaker said in its update that the “vast majority” of the short-haul passenger jets in service “have now received the necessary modifications.”

“We are working with our airline customers to support the modification of less than 100 remaining aircraft to ensure they can be returned to service,” Toulouse, France-based Airbus said.

“Airbus apologises for any challenges and delays caused to passengers and airlines by this event,” it said.

Airbus said it discovered that “intense solar radiation” could corrupt data that's critical to the functioning of flight controls.

The problem is suspected of contributing to a sudden drop in altitude of a JetBlue plane from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey on Oct. 30, that injured at least 15 passengers, some of them transported to hospitals for medical care.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency required airlines to address the issue with the software update. More than 500 U.S.-registered aircraft were impacted, including jets flown by American Airlines and Delta.

Japan's All Nippon Airways, Air India and Germany's Lufthansa were also affected. The Airbus A320 family of single-aisle aircraft is the primary competitor to Boeing's 737.

Hong Kong officials have announced that legislative elections scheduled for Dec. 7 will go ahead as planned, even as anger grows over the devastating Wang Fuk Court fire, which killed at least 151 people and injured dozens more. 

Regardless of public sentiment, there is no risk the government might lose power in Sunday's polls. Since a crackdown that followed pro-democracy protests in 2019, the former British colony's already semi-democratic system has only become less representative, with voters choosing just 22 per cent of the seats being contested – and even that small portion from a list of “patriots” approved by a government committee. 

But the timing of the election is awkward nonetheless, because it highlights the degree to which Hong Kongers have little say in how they are governed, just as serious questions are being raised about government oversight and responsiveness. 

The death toll in Hong Kong's deadly housing complex fire rose on Sunday to at least 146, drawing large crowds to turn up and pay tribute to the victims, amid warnings from Beijing that it would use a national security law to crack down on any "anti-China" protest in the wake of the blaze.

Police and anti-corruption investigators have arrested 13 people in connection with the Wang Fuk Court fire, which officials have said spread so quickly in part owing to substandard materials used for renovations. On Monday, the government said seven samples of mesh netting used to cover scaffolding on the buildings did not meet fire standards. 

“These people caused multiple deaths for petty gains,” Hong Kong Chief Secretary Eric Chan said.

The swift police response has been well-received, and money and help have also poured into Hong Kong from mainland China. The local government has offered generous support and benefits to victims of the fire. 

But as the shock of the disaster has faded, there is growing anger over how such a fire could happen in the first place and the government's apparent unwillingness to set up an independent inquiry like the one that followed the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in Britain. Some have accused officials of seeking to blame construction materials – particularly bamboo scaffolding, an icon of Hong Kong's development – rather than oversight or regulation failures. 

Already, there are signs the government is concerned about how the public response to the fire – so far characterized by massive, volunteer efforts to help the victims – could morph into a wider movement, just as minor demonstrations in 2014 and 2019 exploded into months-long pro-democracy protests. 

Over the weekend, a former district councillor, Kenneth Cheung, and a student organizer, Miles Kwan, were both detained by national security police, according to local media. Mr. Cheung had posted online about the fire, while Mr. Kwan circulated a petition listing “four demands” for the government, an apparent echo of the “five demands, not one less” slogan of the 2019 protests. 

In a statement, Hong Kong's Office for Safeguarding National Security warned that “anti-China elements and those with ulterior motives remain restless and seek opportunities to cause trouble.” 

It accused unspecified actors of having “maliciously attacked” the government's response to the fire and “incited social division and confrontation.” 

“They are exploiting people's pain and defying public opinion, attempting to use victims' grief to achieve their political ambitions, plunging Hong Kong back into the chaos of the ‘anti-extradition bill' protests, and bringing back the darkest moments of ‘black-clad violence,'” the statement added, referring to the 2019 unrest. 

The dilemma the government faces is one of its own making. By revamping elections to be “patriots only,” the authorities have removed a potential release valve for public anger. They have also lost a vital source of accountability and responsiveness, particularly at the local level, where fully elected district councils have been replaced by largely appointed bodies run by government bureaucrats and “care teams” akin to mainland China's red-armband-wearing neighbourhood watch organizations. 

In the past, district councillors and elected members of Hong Kong's legislature were easily accessible, often giving their WhatsApp numbers to their constituents and sending out newsletters detailing the work they were doing. Many former councillors have been involved in the Wang Fuk Court fire response, organizing on the ground and online. 

By comparison, representatives of the new system feel to many like extensions of the government, equally distant and unaccountable. 

There is little danger that a mass protest movement could emerge like the one in 2019. Hong Kong's civil society has been decimated in the years since, while national security police remain on high alert. In an editorial Monday, the state-backed newspaper Wen Wei Po warned that “the national security law hangs like a sharp blade overhead, ready at any moment to be unsheathed to eliminate those who disrupt Hong Kong's society.” 

Even before the Wang Fuk Court disaster, the authorities appeared nervous about Sunday's election. Beijing has imposed upon Hong Kong a system in which only its favoured candidates can win, but it cannot force people to participate. Nor can it credibly claim mass voter turnout when there isn't any (unlike, say, Iraq's Saddam Hussein or Rwanda's Paul Kagame). Local authorities have been reduced to increasingly desperate get-out-the-vote campaigns, plastering billboards, public transport, fire engines, government buildings and taxis with posters reminding people to “join the election together, we create the future.” 

More likely, however, Hong Kongers will demonstrate their disapproval of this system the only way left to them: by not taking part. Previous legislative polls, the first under the new system, saw record-low turnout. Facing mounting questions about whether the Wang Fuk Court fire could have been avoided, officials may fear Sunday's turnout will be even lower.

Highschool students celebrate winning a leadership challenge during the QLEAD conference at Queens University in Kingston, Ont., on Nov. 15.Shay Conroy/The Globe and Mail

Jordan Fortis sat in the conference room of a waterfront hotel in Kingston, Ont., pondering the question displayed on a large screen at the far end of the space: Are you a world-class deal-maker? 

The other 150 or so conference attendees were no doubt also mulling it over. 

Mr. Fortis might have had a slight advantage over most of them, however. After all, earlier in the day he was part of a team from Scotiabank that successfully brokered a deal for Google to buy Spotify for nearly US$50-billion. 

Never mind that this deal was completely fictional, part of a workshop introduction to the world of finance. And never mind that conference attendees were all students in Grades 11 and 12.

When the handshake deal was made, the applause in the room was thunderous.

Not every high-school student wants to spend four days at a university taking workshops on finance, marketing and accounting, participating in stock-market simulations and working on case competitions. But these are hardly your typical teenagers.

“It's basically 150 of the most ambitious kids you'll ever meet,” Ryan Li, a conference attendee told me on day three of the Queen's Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Development Conference earlier this month at the university's Smith School of Business in Kingston. 

“It's an experience. Like a vibe that you just have to get by being here. I've been around. I've done a lot of the business conferences. There's nothing like QLEAD,” he said. 

Many business schools at universities across the country will run some version of this type of conference throughout the year. They are an opportunity for eager high-school students to explore their interests in business and, for many of them, a chance to gain an advantage over peers who will also be applying to these programs. 

Competition among students to gain admission to the country's top business schools is now fiercer than ever thanks in large part to the influence of social media, said Matthew Pizzuti, an associate director of recruitment at the Ivey Business School at Western University.

Applications to the business school have increased by nearly 90 per cent over the past two years, leading to a similar increase in the five-day leadership program for high-school students the university runs in the summer, Mr. Pizzuti said.

“Not only have they been exposed to business through social media and this boom of entrepreneurship across different social channels that hooks them into business, many of them are also coming to the realization that all of their peers are in the same boat. They're seeking different opportunities to stand out,” he said.

At Queen's, applications to the commerce program have increased by more than 10 per cent since 2023, with nearly 10,000 people applying for just 580 spots. 

Mr. Fortis was attending this year's conference in the hopes that it would be a stepping stone to gaining admission to the business school.

Although many young men his age have been drawn to finance through an interest in cryptocurrency, Mr. Fortis envisions a career in logistics and operations in the food industry.

“There's businesses everywhere, and food is one that will never become obsolete. People are always going to be eating,” he said.

Samiya Manji, a Grade 11 student from Toronto, attended the conference to learn more about areas of business that she could pursue as a career. 

“I learned a lot about consulting in the case competition, and also in one of the workshops, I did consulting,” she said.

Scott Muxlow, a Grade 12 student from Aurora, a community north of Toronto, was enjoying his second year at the conference, especially the stock-market simulation on the first night, where participants had to guess if the value of a stock would rise or fall based on changing factors such as meetings with investors or pitches that bombed. 

“It's a good way to kind of kick off the mood and gets everyone going,” Mr. Muxlow said. 

Last summer, he ran the swimming business that his siblings had started. 

“I've kind of always been business and money-oriented,” he said. After attending the Queen's conference last year, he started a finance club at his high school.

One reason he enjoys the conference so much, he said, is because he is surrounded by so many other students his age who share his passion. 

“Everyone here wants to be here, and everyone's in the same boat too,” he said. “We just want to meet each other and help each other grow.”

Alex Chinman, a commerce student who helps run the conference, says the timing of it is designed to help high-school students interested in the business program become more familiar with it.

“It's right in the thick of university application season,” he said. 

Mr. Fortis said the conference solidified his determination to study business at the university.

“Nowadays, kids like me, we all connect on social media, through all these different mediums of communication,” he said. But they are so rarely, if ever, given the opportunity to actually play a role in so many of the areas of life that they're exposed to online, he said.

“What drew me to my passion for business is being able to actually step into these environments firsthand and actually make an impact.”

MOSCOW, December 1. /TASS/. Resignation of Zelensky's top aide may push Kiev to reconsider its approach to dialogue, and Kazakhstan protests against Ukraine's attack on the oil pipeline infrastructure. Meanwhile, US leader Donald Trump steps up his pressure campaign on Venezuela. These stories topped Monday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

The scandalous high-profile resignation of Andrey Yermak, the head of Vladimir Zelensky's office, opens the way for a more pragmatic path in negotiations for Ukraine, Russian foreign ministry's ambassador at large, Rodion Miroshnik, told Izvestia. As the conflict unfolds, he added, conditions inevitably worsen for Kiev and prospects for negotiations will depend on whether the Ukrainian side is ready to prioritize a stop to the bloodshed.

Against the backdrop of the political crisis, the Kiev regime has notably increased its diplomatic activity globally. On Sunday, a Ukrainian delegation visited Washington for consultations on resolving the conflict. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and the US leader's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Ukrainian negotiators led by Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary, instead of Yermak. The Florida meeting should become a step toward coordinating positions ahead of a potential meeting between Zelensky and US President Donald Trump. The date of the meeting remains undecided.

Later on Monday, Zelensky will arrive in Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. Meanwhile, Witkoff is preparing to travel to Moscow. The upcoming meetings are expected to focus on positions regarding the most controversial issues of the negotiation process.

"Since a corruption scandal broke in Kiev, support for Zelensky has largely lost its significance for Washington, while Kiev seems to have found itself in the most critical position since February 2022, now that problems on the front line have been aggravated with political issues domestically and external pressure from its key partner," an analyst at the Higher School of Economics, Tigran Meloyan, told Izvestia. And Witkoff's upcoming visit to Moscow, he argued, is yet another proof that, despite the imposition of US sanctions on the Russian oil sector, Russia remains committed to dialogue with the United States as a continuation of the Anchorage summit.

While a peace plan for Ukraine, drafted by the United States, that should put an end to hostilities and help the transition to finding a political solution, offers a rare window of opportunity to stabilize the situation, it is Kiev that has demonstrated the most reluctance to compromise without which the likelihood of ending the conflict seems improbable.

However, the Ukrainian leadership could as well reject any peace agreement, Bogdan Bezpalko, a member of the Russian Presidential Council for Interethnic Relations, noted. "Like any other Ukrainian politician who could potentially sign a peace accord, Zelensky risks being accused of making concessions and may therefore try and avoid this responsibility," the expert told Izvestia.

 

The attack on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure off the Russian seaport of Novorossiysk on Saturday night may harm bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and Astana expects Kiev to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from taking place in the future, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

In response, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry noted in a statement that the strikes by the Ukrainian military on the CPC infrastructure did not target Kazakhstan, but rather sought to "weaken the military-industrial potential" of Russia in order to deprive it of means to continue hostilities.

The Ukrainians used drones and uncrewed speedboats in the attack. As a result, Outside Pier 2 near Novorossiysk was severely damaged, and using it is not yet feasible, the CPC reported.

Also, during the attack, the Ukrainian Navy's drones hit two Gambian-flagged tankers heading for loading to Novorossiysk, Reuters reported, citing a Ukrainian Security Council official.

Ukraine is deliberately seeking to disrupt the negotiation process as it also sends a signal to the United States about its reluctance to compromise in potential peace talks with Russia, something that US President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for previously, Pavel Koshkin, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies, told Vedomosti. According to him, Kiev does not even try to conceal its role in the attack, therefore Ukraine is also trying to use that to undermine Washington's peace initiatives.

In the wake of the Ukrainian attack on the CPC infrastructure, Washington may as well increase its pressure on Kiev, as the consortium involves US companies, too, Koshkin surmised. "This is not guaranteed though, as the White House has been struggling to pursue its policy on the Ukrainian track, mostly amid strong pressure from the opposition inside the country," the expert continued.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan cannot fully reroute its CPC oil to other pipelines, Igor Yushkov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, maintained, as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline does not have enough tankers, capacity or oil terminals for Kazakh oil shipments, even as the latter pipeline is currently underutilized and could potentially accept additional oil, the expert continued. "If the oil loading pause [at the CPC] lasts more than a week, storage tanks will fill up very quickly, and Kazakhstan will have to reduce oil production. Oil producers will not be able to pay taxes as usual. As a result, the cost of oil shipments across the Black Sea could increase," he warned.

 

US President Donald Trump warned his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, that the United States may launch an invasion of the Bolivarian republic unless the Venezuelan leader leaves power willingly by December 18, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported. While this report has not been confirmed yet, there are signs that the "war of nerves" between the United States and Venezuela may soon reach its climax: Trump called for the airspace over and around the Latin American country to be considered completely closed, while Venezuela stepped up its crackdown on opposition leaders who could replace Maduro.

On Saturday, Trump took to his Truth Social media platform to declare the airspace above Venezuela should be considered closed. "To all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY," he posted. According to the WSJ, a short while prior to that, Trump held a phone call with Maduro in which the US leader rejected the proposal to hold a one-on-one and the Venezuelan leader declined to step down. Nor is Venezuela going to accept the US rules about a no-fly zone.

"The Bolivarian government warns that Venezuela will not implement orders or obey threats or interference from any other foreign country," Venezuela's top diplomat, Yvan Gil Pinto, said in a statement on Telegram.

Trump's remarks came alongside US media reports alleging that the Maduro administration has increased its pressure against the opposition. According to PROVEA, a Venezuelan human rights network, in October, as many as 54 people were detained, many of whom have ties to Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado.

According to Viktor Kheifets, director of the Ibero-American Studies Center at St. Petersburg State University, reports about the clampdown on the opposition may serve as a pretext for US military invasion. "I think this is purely a media campaign that has nothing to do with reality. And Maria Corina Machado may be behind it. Maduro would need a pretext to begin repressions. And I cannot see any for the time being," the expert commented to Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

 

The United States has stepped up its pressure on Turkey over Russian oil and gas purchases, the Russian Embassy in Ankara told Izvestia. Washington is increasingly pushing its allies to reduce or even cancel their energy cooperation with Moscow. Meanwhile, Russia accounts for 47% of the republic's oil imports, while Russian natural gas meets about 50% of its needs. While, against this backdrop, the share of Russian oil in exports to Turkey has reportedly declined, experts argue that in reality oil purchases have continued unabated.

For the Turkish leadership, energy imports from Russia are not a question of whether they like or dislike Russia, but rather a question of whether they will gain from cooperation or not, economist Vasily Koltashov, director of the Institute of New Society, explained to Izvestia. "Turks have traditionally sought to win, or continue cooperation, as Ankara is governed by an administration that does not rely on the West, and this is why it has not halted trade with Russia," he said.

A reduction in Russian energy imports, if any, will likely be more nominal than real, Koltashov emphasized. According to him, the West has exerted a similar pressure on many Asian markets as regards anti-Russian sanctions: while Indian oil refineries have already announced a cessation of Russian oil purchases, this announcement actually has not corresponded to reality.

Russian grain exports to Turkey may be promising, Yury Mavashev, an Orientalist and lecturer at the Department of World Politics and World Economy at the RANEPA Institute of Management, told Izvestia. According to his estimates, as the republic may face a severe drought in 2026, it may double Russian grain imports to 7.3 million metric tons.

Koltashov agrees that Turkey is facing a difficult economic situation. Should Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan succumb to Western pressure, things inside the country "will get even worse" for him, the expert concluded.

 

Global silver prices have reached a new all-time high, rising above $56 per troy ounce, as the precious metal has almost doubled in price since early 2025. Other precious metals too, saw a rise, albeit a more modest one. The prices were mostly driven by expectations of further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, including now that the US shutdown has concluded.

Besides, a supply shortage remains on the silver market amid high demand for the metal, mostly from investors.

Over the past few days, silver has outperformed other precious metals, with spot market prices for gold and palladium rising by 4% to 5% and platinum going up by 10%. Since the start of 2025, gold and palladium have risen by 60%, and platinum has gained 85%.

Nikita Bredikhin, leading investment analyst at Go Invest, explained to Kommersant that during the 43-day US federal government shutdown more than $619 billion in funds was borrowed, creating market liquidity shortages. Against that backdrop, market expectations regarding the US federal funds rates increased as investors now expect the Fed to transition from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE).

Sergey Suverov, investment strategist at Aricapital Asset Management, explained that a rate cut could push the dollar index and Treasury yields lower, increasing the appeal of investments in stocks and precious metals. Moreover, rising geopolitical tensions, including expectations of a military conflict between the United States and Venezuela, may trigger a rise in safe-haven assets.

RIYADH, December 1. /TASS/. Russia has proposed cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said.

"We propose jointly implementing projects in the area of artificial intelligence application in healthcare, education, geoanalytics (Sber - TASS), introduction and localization of solutions in the field of cybersecurity (Cyberus Foundation, Rostelecom)," he said.

Partnership in the area of digital technologies is also relevant considering their application in construction and urban development, Novak added. "We have a good example of it: the interaction between Moscow and Riyadh," he said.

Russia and Saudi Arabia already have experience of mutually beneficial cooperation in the field of digital technologies for smart cities, physical and cybersecurity, and electronic services, the official noted.

The Nataraj family in the Saskatoon airport prior to boarding a December, 2024 flight. Nataraj and his family recently cancelled a portion of a coming trip because of the size of his daughter Georgia's powerchair, despite flying with the airline previously.Supplied

A weight restriction for mobility aids is causing tension and stress for some WestJet customers, who face yet another barrier to free movement. 

A policy on the airline's website limits wheelchairs and scooters to 300 pounds for the majority of its aircraft. For many users of powerchairs − electric, motorized, wheelchairs that are often heavier − the restriction means they're not able to fly with their preferred mobility tools. 

Richard Nataraj and his family recently cancelled a portion of a coming trip because of the size of his daughter's powerchair. 

According to Mr. Nataraj, no airplanes flying out of the family's home airport in Saskatoon are able to accommodate the mobility device under WestJet's current weight requirements, despite the fact Mr. Nataraj and his daughter, Georgia, had flown with the chair as recently as April, 2025. 

“Part of the most frustrating thing about this is that we know [the chair] fits. And we know the flights that we've taken for years out of Saskatoon have been from the same aircraft,” Mr. Nataraj said. “I think when you are preventing a certain group of people from accessing something that by law is meant to be fully accessible, that is the definition of discrimination.” 

Challenges of fixing WestJet aircraft after hard landing in St. Maarten coming to light

When reached for comment, WestJet spokesperson Jen Booth told The Globe and Mail the weight limits for assistive devices are listed on the airline's website in compliance with regulations and aren't new. Individual cases would need to be reviewed based on their circumstances, she stated.

For Mr. Nataraj's daughter, travelling without her chair is not a suitable option. In addition to the added stress of using an alternative mobility device, the powerchair supports many important day-to-day functions, as well as aiding her digestion and helping to support her bones through putting pressure on her body. The family said WestJet told them that the decision to deny transporting the chair was due to safety issues.

“I think by preventing Georgia from flying on this flight solely because of the weight of her wheelchair, it would be similar to preventing an individual from getting on this flight solely because of the weight of their own body,” Mr. Nataraj said. “When you look at it like that, it's clear that you're really blocking someone from using something that they should have access to.”

Earlier this month, Manitoba resident and former MP Steven Fletcher penned a Substack post about his recent experience with the airline refusing to transport his wheelchair because of weight restrictions. 

“A single sentence from a corporate policy manual now determines whether I can travel in my own country,” he wrote on the website. According to Mr. Fletcher, he had flown with his chair dozens of times without incident. 

“They wouldn't accept the chair and that's not consistent with my history [with the airline] for the last 30 years. It's never been a problem,” Mr. Fletcher said during a phone interview with The Globe. 

After his wheelchair was denied, Mr. Fletcher filed a complaint with the Canadian Transport Agency. Recapping WestJet's filings to the regulator, Mr. Fletcher says the company's decision was based on an engineering analysis conducted in partnership with the aircraft manufacturer, meant to ensure mobility aids did not jeopardize the aircraft's airworthiness.

“They had come to the conclusion that the airworthiness of the aircraft was somehow compromised. From a common sense perspective that doesn't make any sense because airlines all over the world fly these power wheelchairs,” he said.

WestJet's Ms. Booth stated that the airline's policies comply with Canada's Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations. 

“Specific to section 56 of these regulations, we have published on our website information about the maximum weight and dimensions of mobility aids that each make and model of our aircraft is capable of transporting. This information has been published since 2020 and our weight limits are not new.”

Ms. Booth stated that WestJet's annual accessibility progress report in 2024 noted some of its maximums increased and none were reduced. In regard to mobility device and powerchair users who are no longer able to use routes they previously travelled without issue, the situations would need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

“With respect to guests who may have previously travelled with WestJet with mobility aids exceeding the established weight limits, a review of each case would be needed to understand the specific circumstances. For example, this could happen when we receive incorrect weight information or information is missing, such as during an online booking where guests don't speak to a WestJet agent.”

While WestJet states its policies are not new, some customers have found that enforcement of the weight limits is. For his part, Mr. Fletcher hopes WestJet is able to resolve the issue. 

“I'd like to see WestJet succeed, and Canadians with disabilities succeed,” he said. “It's bothersome when WestJet has acted in this way without justification.”

            Four men have been arrested over their alleged involvement in an “international satanic child sex abuse material ring,” according to Australian Police, who say they're still working to identify the victims.
    


            Det. Supt. Jayne Doherty, commander of the New South Wales sex crimes squad, said the four men allegedly shared “abhorrent” content with an international network depicting children from infants to 12 years old – as well as animals.
    


            “Police will allege in court that this international group were engaging in conversations and the sharing of material which depicted child abuse and the torture of children involving symbols and rituals linked to Satanism and the occult,” Doherty said Monday.
    


            “Thousands of videos” were found on electronic devices seized during several simultaneous raids on properties in Sydney last week, Doherty said.
    


            “Amongst these deplorable images were also a number of videos depicting the sexual abuse of animals,” she added.
    


            Video released by NSW Police showed the arrest of a 26-year-old man in the inner-city suburb of Waterloo, whom police alleged to have played a “leading role” in the group.
    


            Officers can be seen using a battering ram to enter the apartment and are heard shouting “police” before taking a man dressed in zebra-print shorts and T-shirt into custody.
    


            The investigation was carried out by the NSW sex crimes squad as part of Strike Force Constantine, an operation established in April that investigates the online distribution of child sexual abuse involving ritualistic or satanic themes.
    


            In November, police were made aware a group of men in Sydney, who were allegedly part of a larger international pedophile syndicate.
    


            They were “communicating with each other and… also sharing explicit child abuse material across that international group,” Doherty alleged.
    


            Police could not confirm the identities of the children involved or which country the material was created in.
    


            “We've not identified an actual child, but the images are of real children,” she said.
    


            Police executed six search warrants across Sydney last week and arrested four men, according to a police statement.
    


            The 26-year-old was charged with several offenses, including making available child abuse material and possession of child abuse material. He was also charged with disseminating and possessing bestiality material, police said.
    


            Three men, aged 46, 42 and 39, were arrested in the coastal suburb of Malabar in connection with the same child abuse network. They face several charges relating to the possession or distribution of child abuse material.
    


            All four men, who have not been named by police, were refused bail and will appear in court in January next year.
    


            Police are combing through “thousands of files” to investigate other alleged members of the group suspected of sharing images on encrypted international platforms.
    


            The abuse was “particularly devastating in that they used symbols and rituals around it in the discussions that they were having about abusing children,” she said.
    


            “It had a very ritualistic overview.”

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

NATO is weighing a shift toward a more assertive response to Russia's cyber operations, sabotage, and airspace violations, the alliance's top military official told the Financial Times (FT). Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, who chairs NATO's Military Committee, said the alliance is reassessing how it confronts hybrid threats that have intensified across Europe.

"We are studying everything … On cyber, we are kind of reactive. Being more aggressive or being proactive instead of reactive is something that we are thinking about," Dragone told the FT. He also suggested that a "pre-emptive strike" could, in some circumstances, be viewed as "defensive action," while noting that such an approach is "further away from our normal way of thinking and behavior."

European countries have faced a string of hybrid incidents in recent years — including cyberattacks, suspected Russian-linked sabotage, and repeated cases of underwater infrastructure being damaged in the Baltic Sea. 

While some NATO members, particularly in Eastern Europe, have pressed for a tougher posture, Dragone said any change requires careful consideration of legal and jurisdictional limits. "Being more aggressive compared with the aggressivity of our counterpart could be an option. [The issues are] legal framework, jurisdictional framework, who is going to do this?" he said.

Dragone highlighted NATO's Baltic Sentry mission as an example of successful deterrence. 

The operation deploys allied ships, aircraft, and naval drones to monitor critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea following multiple cable-cutting incidents in 2023 and 2024. "From the beginning of Baltic Sentry, nothing has happened. So this means that this deterrence is working," he told the FT.

Concerns remain, however, after a Finnish court dismissed a case involving the Eagle S — a Russian-linked vessel suspected of damaging several underwater electricity and data cables — because the incident occurred in international waters. 

Finland's Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen acknowledged to the FT that this effectively gives Russian vessels carte blanche in such waters. She added that becoming more assertive is under review but cautioned that allies "shouldn't be hysterical" and should "trust" existing response frameworks.

Dragone said the central challenge for NATO is determining how to prevent future hybrid attacks. "How deterrence is achieved — through retaliation, through pre-emptive strike — this is something we have to analyse deeply because there could be in the future even more pressure on this," he said.

Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD has issued another major recall, its second in just a few weeks, amid growing scrutiny over the safety of its battery systems. The company said on Thursday it would recall 88,981 Qin Plus DM-i plug-in hybrid sedans due to potential battery defects.

China's State Administration for Market Regulation announced the recall on Friday, saying the affected vehicles may experience limited battery output due to inconsistencies in the manufacturing process of the power-battery pack. In extreme cases, the cars may be unable to operate in pure-electric mode, posing a safety risk.

The recall covers two production batches: 52,890 vehicles manufactured between Sept. 26, 2021, and Sept. 23, 2023, and another 36,091 produced between Jan. 7, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2022.

In mid-October, the automaker informed the State Administration for Market Regulation of its largest-ever recall, more than 115,000 Tang and Yuan Pro models produced from 2015 to 2022, over design flaws and battery-related safety risks.

The latest recall underscores the challenges facing BYD as it seeks to expand rapidly into global markets while defending its safety record and business practices.

            Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro made his first public appearance in days on Sunday, putting to an end speculation within the country that he had fled amid escalating tensions with the US.
    


            Maduro, who usually appears on Venezuelan television multiple times a week, had not been seen in public since Wednesday – when he posted a video of himself driving around Caracas on his Telegram channel – leading to intense speculation as to his whereabouts.
    


            On Sunday, he appeared at an annual specialty-coffee awards event in eastern Caracas.
    


            In images that were broadcast online, the president sat before a crowd and handed out medals to coffee producers showcasing their top products. He sipped various coffees while delivering brief remarks – none of which openly addressed the current crisis in the country.
    


            At the end of the event, he chanted that Venezuela is “indestructible, untouchable, unbeatable” while speaking about the nation's economy.
    


            The remarks appeared to be a nod to the tensions with the US, which has sent more than a dozen warships and deployed roughly 15,000 troops to the region as part of what it says is an effort to combat drug trafficking – but Caracas believes is an attempt to force Maduro from office.
    


            Maduro's appearance at the coffee awards event came just moments after US President Donald Trump confirmed he had spoken with the Venezuelan leader on the phone.
    


            “I don't want to comment on that – the answer is yes,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked whether the call had taken place. “I wouldn't say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.”
    


            The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Trump and Maduro spoke by phone earlier this month.
    


            Maduro and senior members of his government have not commented on the phone call with Trump.
    


            On Sunday, Jorge Rodríguez, who heads Venezuela's National Assembly, declined to discuss the conversation, saying it was not the purpose of his press conference – which instead focused on announcing an inquiry into recent US maritime strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that have killed more than 80 people.
    


            In recent days, the US president has increased the pressure on Maduro by warning that strikes on land against drug trafficking networks could be coming “very soon” and telling airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace.
    


            However, speaking on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump told reporters his warning about Venezuelan airspace was not a signal that an airstrike is imminent.
    


            “Don't read anything into it,” the president said, adding he made the airspace warning “because we consider Venezuela to be not a very friendly country.”
    


            Meanwhile, in what appeared to be a further ratcheting up of tensions, Maduro wrote to OPEC accusing the US of seeking to seize Venezuela's oil reserves through force, while the president of Venezuela's National Assembly accused the US of “murder” regarding recent military strikes on alleged drug boats.
    


            In a letter to the secretary general of OPEC, Haitham Al Ghais, dated November 30, Maduro accused the US of making “constant and repeating express threats” toward his country, in a move that he said “seriously endangers the stability of Venezuelan oil production and the international market.”
    


            Venezuela's oil reserves are thought to be among the largest in the world.
    


CNN exclusive: Colombian president says oil is ‘at the heart of' US pressure campaign on Venezuela



            Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil Pinto posted the letter to OPEC on Telegram, alongside a vow that Venezuela would “remain firm in defending its natural energy resources.”
    


            “Nothing will stop us. We will continue to be free and sovereign!” Pinto wrote.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the letter.
    


            Previously, the US State Department has pushed back against such claims. Responding to a CNN exclusive in which Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Trump's interests in Venezuela were about oil, rather than drug trafficking, it said the administration remains “firm in its counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and its commitment to protecting Americans from the Maduro regime's deadly poison.”
    


            Earlier Sunday, Venezuela accused the US of “murder,” after publicly acknowledging for the first time that some of its citizens were among those killed by the US strikes on alleged drug boats.
    


            “There's no declared war (between the US and Venezuela), therefore this cannot be classified as anything but murder,” Rodriguez, the National Assembly president, told a press conference Sunday.
    


            “Every human being has the right to due process; no human being can be killed in a brutal manner,” he said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.
    


            This is the first time Caracas has said openly that some of its citizens have been killed by the US strikes, which have been going on since September.
    


            Rodriguez, a key figure of Maduro's government, said that he had met with the families of those killed and that the Venezuelan parliament would convene on Monday to “create a special commission to investigate the serious events that led to the murder of Venezuelans in the Caribbean.”
    


President Trump warns Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed. What does it mean?



            The investigation, he said, would look into reports that the US military carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board.
    


            When asked by CNN's Stefano Pozzebon how many Venezuelans had been killed in the strikes, Rodriguez did not provide a number, saying only, “tomorrow we begin the investigation, once we know, we will share that information.”
    


            The Maduro government has also been accused of extrajudicial killings and violation of human rights in the past. According to a statement from the Office of the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, Venezuelans facing government repression are routinely denied a fair trial.
    


            More than 50 Venezuelans have been detained in the month of October alone for political reasons, human rights groups told CNN.
    


            The Venezuelan government has denied allegations of human rights abuse.

Three children and an adult were killed at a mass shooting at a child's birthday party in California on Saturday.

A further 11 people were shot after a shooter opened fire inside a banquet hall where more than 100 people had gathered for a birthday party, according to the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office.

The four victims killed were aged eight, nine, 14 and 21. The shooter opened fire just before 6pm local time in Stockton, a city of 320,000 about 40 miles south of Sacramento.

Local officials said the suspected shooter has not been caught and pleaded with the public for help. Detectives were still working to identify a possible motive.

“If you have any information as to this individual, reach out immediately. If you are this individual, turn yourself in immediately,” San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas said during a news conference.

The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office initially said that “approximately 14 individuals were struck by gunfire, and four victims have been confirmed deceased”, although this figure was later updated to 15. “This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited,” the sheriff's office wrote in a post on X. “Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.”

Christina Fugazi, the mayor of Stockton, said “heaven is a little bigger” as she paid tribute to the victims of the shooting.“This is Thanksgiving weekend. This is when families come together to celebrate, share memories, give each other love. Unfortunately tonight, heaven is a little bigger with the children and adults who did not make it,” Ms Fugazi said during a press conference on Saturday night.“What happened tonight, again, unacceptable. Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.”

Ms Fugazi said she had spoken on the phone with Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, and that he had offered additional support to city officials and law enforcement.Mr Newsom's office said he had been briefed on the “horrific” shooting and was monitoring the situation.

“Today, local authorities confirmed the victims of the Stockton shooting were just 8, 9, 14, and 21 years old – and that the attack was likely targeted. Our hearts break for their families and the entire Stockton community,” Mr Newsom wrote on X on Sunday.Jason Lee, the vice mayor of Stockton, said the outbreak of violence “shakes me deeply”.“Violence touched my life as a young person, and seeing our own children, parents and neighbours go through this shakes me deeply. Stockton is my home. These are our families. This is our community,” Mr Lee said.Josh Harder, the Democratic congressman for Stockton, said he was “devastated” by news of the shooting and was “praying for the victims and their families”.

Live Updates


• Meeting on Venezuela: ﻿The White House confirmed President Donald Trump will hold a meeting today with his national security team to discuss Venezuela as his administration intensifies its pressure campaign on the country.
    


• Concerns over boat strikes: The White House defended an admiral who it said ordered a follow-up strike that killed survivors on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, saying he was acting  “well within his authority.” Lawmakers from both parties have voiced concerns over the second strike's legality.
    


            • US officials head to Russia: Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and special envoy Steve Witkoff are traveling to Moscow on Monday, a White House official and a US official told CNN, following high-level US-Ukraine talks this weekend. Witkoff is due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.
    


            • Asylum decision pause: Trump said the pause on all decisions on asylum applications has “no time limit” amid his escalating anti-immigration crackdown after last week's shooting of National Guard members.
    


            Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth spoke with lawmakers who expressed concerns over the weekend over a follow-up strike that killed survivors on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, the White House said today.
    


                    “The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
                





            Leavitt did not specify which members of Congress the secretary spoke to.
    


            Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are questioning the legality of the administration's follow-up strike on September 2.
    


            “There have also been 13 bipartisan briefings to Congress on the Venezuelan strikes. There have been a number of document reviews for members of Congress to review the classified DOJ Office of Legal Counsel opinion and other related documents,” Leavitt said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday defended President Donald Trump's promised pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, arguing that his US drug-trafficking conviction was a result of Biden-era “over-prosecution.”
    


            Trump “was opposed to the values of the previous administration, and they charged him because he was president of Honduras,” she said, adding that the president decided to pardon Hernández after hearing concerns raised by his supporters.
    


            Leavitt also dismissed questions over whether pardoning a convicted drug trafficker undercut the administration's justification for its lethal strikes on boats in the Caribbean that officials have alleged are bringing drugs into the US.
    


                    “President Trump has been quite clear in his defense of the United States homeland, to stop these illegal narcotics from coming to our borders, whether that's by land or by sea,” Leavitt said. “He's also made it quite clear that he wants to correct the wrongs of the weaponized Justice Department under the previous administration.”
                





            Hernández is serving a 45-year federal prison sentence for drug-trafficking offenses.
    


            The White House said Monday that Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley, commander of the US Special Operations Command, was responsible for ordering a second, targeted strike on an alleged drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after the first strike did not kill everyone aboard.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Bradley, who she said was “well within his authority” to order the second strike, which CNN has reported killed the remaining crew on board. The strike has generated questions on both sides of the political aisle about whether the administration was acting within the bounds of the law, with some Democrats calling it an apparent war crime.
    


                    “On September 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Adm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,” Leavitt said.
                





            She added that President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war.”
    


            Pressed on the legal justification for the strike, Leavitt said it was “conducted in self-defense to protect Americans” and was carried out “in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.”
    


            Trump told reporters Sunday evening that he personally would not have wanted a second strike and seemed to cast doubt on the idea Hegseth had ordered it.
    


            “No. 1, I don't know that that happened, and Pete said he did not want them — he didn't even know what people were talking about,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “So, we'll look into it, but no, I wouldn't have wanted that, not a second strike.”
    


            The US military has conducted 20 known strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and amassed significant military forces in the region as the president weighs next steps in Venezuela. Top Trump officials, including Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, will meet with the president later Monday evening.
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday will host his ninth Cabinet meeting since taking office, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today.
    


            Following the Cabinet meeting, the president will make an Oval Office announcement on his plan to create “Trump accounts” for families with young children.
    


            Trump's schedule for the week also includes a meeting with the presidents of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday. That evening, the president and the first lady Melania Trump will attend the lighting of the National Christmas Tree on the White House Ellipse.
    


            On Friday, Trump will attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, where FIFA will announce the groups and matchups for the opening stage of the quadrennial tournament.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN that Democrats are still discussing what exactly to include in a bill to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, after Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised them a vote on the issue this month in exchange for reopening the government.
    


            Schumer would not confirm whether they are going to push for a clean, two-year extension, which is highly unlikely to pass the Senate.
    


                    “I've talked to every member of my caucus over the weekend. We are united in extending the ACA, because if we don't, it does such damage to people, and we're going to discuss it in our caucus tomorrow, but we're totally united,” he said.
                





            The White House said Monday that the “monster responsible” for shooting two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week will face the “most severe punishment possible.”
    


            “Sarah and Andrew are heroes, and we will never forget their sacrifice. That means ensuring the monster responsible for this atrocity is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and faces the most severe punishment possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday.
    


            Leavitt also sought to place blame on former President Joe Biden's administration in the wake of the shooting, claiming that the suspect was not sufficiently vetted before entering the US.
    


            The press secretary also said the administration intends to “finish carrying out” President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation.
    


            “In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” Leavitt said.
    


            President Donald Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office, and Trump invited Netanyahu to a meeting at the White House “in the near future.”
    


            An Israeli source briefed on the content of the call said Trump and Netanyahu discussed “regional issues,” focusing on recent developments in Gaza, but also touching upon Syria, Lebanon and Iran.
    


            The source also said that Netanyahu's recent pardon request came up during the call.
    


                    “The two leaders emphasized in their conversation the importance and commitment to dismantling Hamas's weapons and disarming the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding peace agreements,” Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
                





            Netanyahu formally requested a pardon from Israeli President Isaac Herzog in his long-running corruption trial on Sunday, following up on a November letter from Trump, who sent Herzog a letter requesting his pardon.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that territorial issues are the most difficult in the current negotiations over ending the war with Russia.
    


            During a news conference in Paris on Monday, Zelensky said Kyiv's priorities in the negotiations were “first and foremost, protection and security guarantees, guarantees of Ukraine's independence and the preservation of our sovereignty.”
    


                    “Frankly, the territorial issue is the most difficult,” he said.
                





Remember: Under the original US proposal released last month, Ukraine would have to give up parts of the Donetsk region that have been illegally annexed but not occupied by Russia. The plan proposed that the “entirety” of Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized as “de-facto Russian.”
    


            Zelensky said money and reconstruction, “without the presence of European partners, are not easy to accept, because the money is in Europe.”
    


            The original version of the US plan proposed that $100 billion in frozen Russian assets, most of which are held in Europe, would be used to rebuild Ukraine. The US would receive 50% of the profits and Europe would also invest $100 billion, according to the US blueprint.
    


            “We are working to ensure that there will be no third Russian invasion and that there will be no breach of the agreements on ending the war,” Zelensky said, adding that he hoped to hold talks with US President Donald Trump after the visit to Russia of Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.
    


            The United States and the United Kingdom announced today an agreement in principle that would raise the prices the UK pays for new medicines in exchange for a reprieve on tariffs paid by US importers for UK-made pharmaceuticals.
    


            The deal is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reduce drug costs in the US by bringing them in line with other developed countries' lower prices.
    


            Under the terms of the deal, the UK will increase the net price the National Health Service pays for new drugs by 25% and guarantee that the higher prices are not reduced by concessions or other rebates. The deal includes additional investments by UK drug companies in the US, though no details were released.
    


            In exchange, the US will exempt pharmaceutical imports from the UK from tariffs for the duration of the Trump administration – a provision lauded by the UK government. It noted it is the only country to secure a 0% rate, “protecting UK-based manufacturing and cementing our place as a world leader for life sciences investment,” according to a statement from the British government.
    


            The two nations announced earlier this year that they intended to negotiate preferential treatment on drugs and pharmaceutical ingredients imports from the UK to the US.
    


            The UK exported £6.6 billion (more than $8 billion) worth of medicinal and pharmaceutical products to the United States in 2024, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which applauded the agreement.
    


            Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, is traveling with special envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow, according to a White House official.
    


            CNN had previously reported that Witkoff was set to travel to Moscow Monday, a day after he, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met a high-level Ukrainian delegation in Florida.
    


            Rubio said after that meeting that progress had been made toward ending the war between Russia and Ukraine but there was more work to be done. Witkoff was expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to hold a meeting at the White House later today about next steps on Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter.
    


Catch up below on where things stand between both countries: 



            • US military buildup: The meeting, which is expected to take place at 5 p.m. ET in the Oval Office, comes as the United States has increased pressure on Venezuela with strikes on drug vessels and a military asset buildup in the Caribbean. The US military has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops in the region as part of what the Pentagon has branded “Operation Southern Spear.” The president also said last week that the US would be stopping Venezuelan drug trafficking by land, in addition to sea, “very soon.”
    


            • Broad directive to avoid Venezuelan airspace: Over the weekend, the president issued a broad directive on social media, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace. He told reporters Sunday, however, not to read into the announcement.
    


            • Call with Maduro: Trump also confirmed he had spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the phone, but didn't address what was discussed. The administration last week formally designated Maduro and allies of his government as members of a foreign terrorist organization, a move officials argue will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela.
    


            • Concerns from lawmakers: Lawmakers continue to question the legality of the US strikes on alleged drug boats in the region, which have killed more than 80 people. The legality of the strikes has been questioned as the US is not officially in a war with Venezuela. CNN reported last week citing sources familiar with the matter that the US carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle voiced serious concerns over the strike with some suggesting it could be a “war crime.”
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that he has spoken with the leaders of the UK and France along with US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff – ahead of Witkoff's meetings in Moscow.
    


                    “Together with French President @EmmanuelMacron and with the participation of UK Prime Minister @Keir_Starmer, we just spoke with the head of Ukrainian delegation Rustem Umerov and US President's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff following the Ukraine-U.S. delegations' meeting in Florida,” Zelensky said on X Monday.
                





            “It was an important briefing, and we agreed to discuss more details in person,” he added.
    


            Witkoff is due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.
    


            Ordering a second strike to kill survivors on an alleged drug boat would be a “stone-cold war crime,” Sen. Angus King of Maine told CNN on Monday, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers continues to raise questions about how the Defense Department is carrying out its operations in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean.
    


                    “The law is clear,” King, an independent, told CNN's Kate Bolduan. “If the facts are, as have been alleged, that there was a second strike specifically to kill the survivors in the water — that's a stone-cold war crime. It's also murder.”
                





            King, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, added: “So the real question is, who gave which orders? When were they given? And that's what we're going to get to the bottom of in the Congress.”
    


Some more context: Sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN that the military carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended how his department has conducted itself.
    


            King said he anticipated “interviews of people up and down the chain of command.”
    


            President Donald Trump will hold a meeting at the White House this evening about next steps on Venezuela, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, as the administration intensifies its pressure campaign on the country.
    


            Key members of Trump's cabinet and national security team, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend, as well as White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.
    


            The meeting, which is expected to take place at 5 p.m. ET in the Oval Office, comes as the US has increased pressure on Venezuela with strikes on drug vessels and a US military asset buildup in the Caribbean.
    


            Over the weekend, Trump also issued a broad directive on social media, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace.
    


            The Trump administration had a busy weekend, with a focus on two major foreign conflicts.
    


            Top US and Ukrainian officials met in Florida yesterday amid a diplomatic push to end Russia's war in Ukraine. President Donald Trump expressed optimism after the high-level meeting, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio said “progress was made.”
    


            Meanwhile, Trump said he had a phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro amid his pressure campaign against the country, which the administration says is aimed at disrupting illegal drug flows.
    


            Trump did not delve into the specifics of the call, while Maduro chanted that Venezuela is “indestructible, untouchable, unbeatable” during a public appearance yesterday, in what appeared to be a nod to the tensions with the US.
    


            At home, Trump is escalating his anti-immigration crackdown after the suspect in last week's shooting of National Guard members was identified as an Afghan national. He said a pause on all asylum decisions announced in the shooting's aftermath could be indefinite.

Nearly two weeks after a decorated Virginia high school coach mysteriously disappeared amid a child pornography investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service has announced it is offering a reward of up to $5,000 for any information leading to his arrest. 

Federal authorities are warning Travis L. Turner, 46, "may be armed" while urging anyone who may come in contact with him to exercise caution after he was last seen walking into a wooded area behind his Appalachia home while carrying a firearm on Nov. 20, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. 

Last week, authorities obtained 10 warrants to charge Turner with five counts of possession of child pornography and five counts of using a computer to solicit a minor. 

Turner was first reported missing as officers with the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation's Wytheville Field Office were en route to his Appalachia home to speak with him about the investigation on Nov. 21, according to authorities. Officials had visited Turner's home one-day prior, and were returning only to speak with him and not make any arrests, police said.

"VSP is still searching for Turner with the assistance of the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service," VSP spokesperson Robin Lawson said in statement to Fox News Digital.

The USMS announced the reward on Monday. Turner was last seen walking into a "heavily wooded and mountainous area" on Nov. 20, Adrian Collins, an attorney for the coach's family, said in a statement obtained by WCYB. 

"The last known contact the family had with Travis occurred on or about Thursday, Nov. 20, after he left his residence to walk in the woods with a firearm," the statement reads, clarifying that no warrants for his arrest had been made prior to his disappearance.

When Turner failed to return home later that evening, his wife reportedly notified local law enforcement of her husband's disappearance. However, authorities told her that she had to wait 24 hours to file a missing-person report, which she submitted the next day, according to the statement.

In addition to authorities using K-9 units, drones and foot patrols to locate Turner, his family has reportedly launched their own search for the missing coach and are fully cooperating with authorities, according to the attorney's statement. 

The update comes on the heels of Turner's wife, Leslie Caudill Turner – who shares three children with the coach – deleting her social media profiles over the weekend, according to The New York Post.

She previously used the accounts to celebrate the decorated football coach's undefeated season – along with sharing photos of family and friends, along with countless images of her children on the sports fields.

The deletion follows Turner's staff profile page being removed from Union High School's website shortly after the investigation was announced, ABC 7 reported. 

In a previous statement, a spokesperson for Wise County Public Schools confirmed that a staff member employed by the district had been placed on administrative leave pending review of an external allegation. Days later, the district released an updated statement to acknowledge that charges have since been filed against the staff member in question, but failed to identify Turner by name. 

"The individual remains on leave and is not permitted on school property or to have contact with students," Superintendent Mike Goforth said. "The division will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as this process moves forward. Because this is an active legal matter involving personnel, the division cannot comment further."

Turner's family attorney, the VSP and USMS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Turner was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt, sweatpants and glasses, according to Virginia's missing person database. Tips can be reported to 911, Virginia State Police or the USMS tip line at 1-877-WANTED2 or online usmarshals.gov/tips.

Jurors hear opening statements in the murder trial of Brian Walshe, who has been charged with killing his wife in 2023.

The murder trial of a convicted Massachusetts fraudster accused of killing his wife after learning of an affair kicked off Monday, with prosecutors delivering an opening statement that began shortly before 10 a.m.

In a surprise move during jury selection last month, Brian Walshe, 50, pleaded guilty to lesser charges of misleading a police investigation and improper conveyance of a human body.

He is still facing a first-degree murder charge that could land him in prison for life with no chance of parole if convicted.

He is accused of killing and dismembering his 39-year-old wife, Ana Walshe, whose remains have not been found.

Defense attorney Larry Tipton told jurors in his opening statement that Walshe "nudged" his wife in bed and discovered she was dead.

"Now he was panicking and he doesn't understand what has happened and what is happening," Tipton said. "It didn't make any sense to him. It didn't make sense that somebody he had just been with, and enjoyed New Year's Eve with into New Year's Day, would suddenly be dead."

Tipton said evidence would show a "sudden, unexplained death" and that such a thing "happens." He denied the prosecution's allegation that his client was aware of Ana's suspected affair with a friend from Washington, D.C., where she commuted to work.

"Brian Walshe is not a killer," he concluded.

She was last seen on New Year's Day in 2023, and prosecutors allege her husband dismembered her in their Cohasset, Massachusetts, home before hiding her remains. She was reported missing days later by her boss.

However, prosecutors allege that police recovered evidence from a dumpster near Walshe's mother's house, including a rug from the family home, clothing and a COVID vaccination card belonging to the victim, a hatchet, a hacksaw and red and brown stained towels.

Prosecutors have laid out two potential motives in the case. The first is that Walshe allegedly discovered an affair between his wife and another man, whose name he is accused of searching on Google six times. The second is that he allegedly believed being the sole caretaker of their children would help him avoid prison in connection with a federal art fraud case.

And he was the beneficiary of her $2.7 million life insurance policy.

Investigators say they found digital evidence showing Walshe allegedly searched Google more than a dozen times for instructions on how to dispose of human remains. Then they say they found video of him at Home Depot, buying mops, goggles and a knife.

The trial before a jury of nine women and seven men is expected to last two to four weeks.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The federal antitrust trial against NASCAR opened Monday with the star power of Michael Jordan on hand as a jury of nine was seated to hear allegations that the stock car series is a monopolistic bully that leaves its teams no option but to comply with rules and financing they don't agree with.

The retired NBA Hall of Famer is the co-owner of the 23XI Racing team at the top Cup Series level. 23XI and Front Row Motorsports sued the series last year rather than sign extension agreements on new charters, which are franchise-type designations that serve as the framework for the revenue stream between NASCAR and the teams.

Six men and three women were seated for a trial expected to last two weeks before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell, who asked for opening statements to be completed later Monday. 

Jordan's presence in the courtroom gallery near fellow co-owner and NASCAR star driver Denny Hamlin was a factor: Among those dismissed from serving on the jury was a man who said he can't be impartial because “I like Mike” and another who said he had Michael Jordan posters on his walls growing up. A third dismissed juror pointed and winked at Jordan as he left the courtroom while a juror said they were a North Carolina fan but noted the football team at Jordan's alma mater “aren't doing too well right now” to which the retired star shook his head and laughed.

NASCAR executives in the courtroom included chairman Jim France and vice chair Lisa France Kennedy, two scions of the family that founded NASCAR in 1948 and still owns it.

The stakes are huge: The charters are at the heart of NASCAR's business model — they guarantee a car a spot in the field each race week as well as a percentage of the purse — and the disputes over how they work have dominated the series of late. 




23XI and Front Row were the only two teams out of 15 to refuse to sign extensions on new charter agreements last fall. The teams wanted multiple concessions, and when they didn't get them, they went to court. The case has churned through hearings and arguments for more than a year despite calls from other NASCAR teams to settle. Bell even helped mediate a failed two-day summit in October. 

A NASCAR victory would likely put 23XI, Front Row and their six combined cars out of business. Their charters — now being held by NASCAR — would likely be sold. The last charter went for $45 million, and NASCAR has indicated there is interest from potential buyers including private equity firms.

A win for the teams would lead to monetary damages and the potential demolition of NASCAR as it is run today. The judge has the power to unravel a monopoly, and nothing is off the table, from ordering a sale of NASCAR to the dismantling of the charter system.

All 15 teams had been fighting for more favorable terms in the charter agreements over more than two years of negotiations, and the final terms fell short of what they wanted.

The antitrust allegations have exposed salacious personal communications, NASCAR's finances and a deep contempt between some of the top executives in the sport and its participants.

Hamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 winner who less than a month ago had the Cup Series championship slip through his fingers, warned this weekend that the gloves will be off during the trial.

“Our fans have been brainwashed with (NASCAR's) talking points for decades,” Hamlin wrote on social media. “Lies are over starting Monday morning. It's time for the truth. It's time for change.”

NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps has said that the series has tried hard to settle the case.

The charter system was introduced in 2016 and is NASCAR's version of the franchise model used by most other professional sports leagues. Being chartered guarantees that car a spot in the 40-car field for all 38 races, as well as a defined payout from the weekly purse.

Even with the charters, the teams have argued that the revenue model is not viable. The teams wanted the charters to become permanent (they are renewable and revocable), a larger percentage of revenues and a voice in governance.

23XI and Front Row also argue NASCAR holds too strong of a hold on all aspects of the racing series and allege a monopoly based on exclusivity clauses, ownership of most of the race tracks on the Cup Series schedule, and its control of the rules and regulations.

NASCAR says it has not violated antitrust law because it has done nothing to restrain trade beyond normal business practices.

NASCAR has argued that payouts in the 2025 charter agreement increased and prove the series is not anticompetitive. NASCAR has also cited the option for cars to enter races as “open teams” and try to make the field in one of four nonchartered spots on qualifying speed. 23XI and Front Row have been open teams, and while their combined six cars made every race, it cost both organizations millions of dollars in purse money.

The pretrial discovery process revealed NASCAR made more than $100 million in 2024.

The discovery phase has been brutal for both sides with the exposure of unseemly personal communications. 

Phelps was among leadership who in a discussion with other NASCAR executives called Hall of Fame team owner Richard Childress a “dinosaur,” an “idiot” and a “stupid redneck.” The discussion also included a reference that Childress “owes his entire fortune to NASCAR” and needed “to be taken out back and flogged.”

Another NASCAR executive alleged that fans of the sport can't read, and multiple series leaders admonished Hall of Fame driver Tony Stewart's summer short-track series, SRX, and threatened to have it the killed because NASCAR drivers were participating.

On the other side, the president of 23XI was found to have said France had to die in order to receive favorable charter terms, Hamlin admitted his dislike for the France family, one of Jordan's advisers said Hamlin wasn't a good businessman and Jordan joked that he loses more money in a casino than he pays one of his drivers.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified from serving as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor despite his administration's maneuvers to keep her in the role, an appeals court said Monday. 

A panel of judges from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in Philadelphia sided with a lower-court judge's ruling after hearing oral arguments at which Habba was present on Oct. 20. 

“It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place. Its efforts to elevate its preferred candidate for U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina Habba, to the role of Acting U.S. Attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced — yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney's Office deserve some clarity and stability,” the court wrote in a 32-page opinion. 

It concluded: “We will affirm the District Court's disqualification order.”

The ruling comes amid the push by Trump's Republican administration to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a powerful post charged with enforcing federal criminal and civil law. It also comes after the judges questioned the government's moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after that hearing in a statement posted to X that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied a chance for a Senate hearing.




The White House had no immediate comment on Habba and referred questions to the Justice Department. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, Habba's personal staffer and the Justice Department.

The decision affirmed Habba is serving unlawfully, attorneys for the appellees said in an emailed statement. 

“We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate,” said attorneys Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen in the statement. 

Habba is hardly the only Trump administration prosecutor whose appointment has been challenged by defense lawyers.

Last week, a federal judge dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after concluding that the hastily installed prosecutor who filed the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed to the position of interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Justice Department has said it intends to appeal the rulings.

The judges on the panel were two appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, D. Brooks Smith and D. Michael Fisher, as well as one named by Democratic President Barack Obama, Luis Felipe Restrepo. 

A lower-court judge, Matthew Brann, said in August that Habba's appointment was done with a “novel series of legal and personnel moves” and that she was unlawfully serving as U.S attorney for New Jersey. 

That order said Habba's actions since July could be invalidated, but the judge stayed the order pending appeal.

The government argued Habba is validly serving in the role under a federal statute allowing the first assistant attorney, a post she was appointed to by the Trump administration. 

A similar dynamic is playing out in Nevada, where a federal judge disqualified the Trump administration's pick to be U.S. attorney there. 

The Habba case comes after several people charged with federal crimes in New Jersey challenged the legality of her tenure. They sought to block the charges, arguing she didn't have the authority to prosecute their cases after her 120-day term as interim U.S. attorney expired.

Habba was Trump's attorney in criminal and civil proceedings before he was elected to a second term. She served as a White House adviser briefly before Trump named her as a federal prosecutor in March.

Shortly after her appointment, she said in an interview that she hoped to help “turn New Jersey red,” a rare overt political expression from a prosecutor.

She then brought a trespassing charge, eventually dropped, against Democratic Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka stemming from his visit to a federal immigration detention center. 

Habba later charged Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assault stemming from the same incident, a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress other than for corruption. McIver denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. The case is pending. 

Questions about whether Habba would continue in the job arose in July when her temporary appointment was ending and it became clear New Jersey's two Democratic U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, would not back her appointment. 

Earlier this year as Habba's appointment was expiring, federal judges in New Jersey exercised their power under the law to replace her with a career prosecutor who had served as her second-in-command.

Attorney General Pam Bondi then fired the prosecutor installed by the judges and renamed Habba as acting U.S. attorney. The Justice Department said the judges acted prematurely and said Trump had the authority to appoint his preferred candidate to enforce federal laws in the state.

Brann's ruling said the president's appointments are still subject to the time limits and power-sharing rules laid out in federal law.

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that Alina Habba unlawfully served as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, adding fresh legal turmoil to President Donald Trump's efforts to keep loyalists installed in U.S. attorney positions after two high-profile cases fell apart last week over similar appointment problems.

A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit upheld a lower court's finding that Habba, a Trump ally and former personal attorney to the president, was never validly in office. The ruling comes days after a judge dismissed the criminal cases in Virginia against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, citing defects in the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, Trump's temporary U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.

The new setback in New Jersey underscores how Trump's broader strategy to bypass Senate confirmation in blue states is starting to buckle under judicial scrutiny. The administration can now seek review from the full 3rd Circuit or elevate the case directly to the Supreme Court.

The 3rd Circuit panel heard arguments on Habba's appointment in October and questioned the legality of the steps Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi took to reinstall her after her initial 120-day tenure expired. The panel, composed of two George W. Bush appointees and one Obama appointee, appeared skeptical of Justice Department lawyer Henry Whitaker's claim that Bondi had authority to fill the vacancy after Trump fired the court-appointed successor.

JUDGE THROWS OUT JAMES COMEY AND LETITIA JAMES INDICTMENTS AFTER RULING LINDSEY HALLIGAN UNLAWFULLY APPOINTED

Whitaker insisted the administration was relying on “overlapping mechanisms” provided by Congress and that the DOJ had been “scrupulously careful” to follow them. One judge rejected that narrative, saying the sequence of events that led to Habba's appointment looked like “a complete circumvention” of the Constitution's appointments clause.

Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell, who also defended James in her criminal case, represented the two sets of routine defendants who challenged Habba's authority, arguing she could not prosecute them because she was never lawfully in office.

Habba's case has been the most advanced test of Trump's approach to U.S. attorney appointments, but similar challenges are now overtaking other key prosecutions. In addition to Halligan's collapse in Virginia, Trump-installed U.S. attorney Bill Essayli in California faces his own litigation challenging the validity of his appointment.

Habba had no path to Senate confirmation, as New Jersey's Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, refused to return blue slips.

HABBA'S US ATTORNEY APPOINTMENT FACES UPHILL BATTLE

The blue slip custom, reaffirmed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), effectively gives home-state senators veto power over U.S. attorney nominations. Trump has intensified his criticism of the practice, recently firing former U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert after Siebert received Democratic support and amid reporting that he was unwilling to bring criminal cases against Comey and James.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the DOJ for comment.

Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports from Manhattan criminal court as defendant Luigi Mangione seeks to block backpack evidence and police statements in the murder trial of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Accused assassin Luigi Mangione returned to court Monday for the first of three hearings in which his lawyers will ask the court to toss evidence in the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

The 27-year-old Ivy League alumnus is accused of stalking Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, before allegedly shooting him from behind outside a Manhattan hotel.

Thompson, who lived in Minnesota, was expected to attend a shareholder conference later that morning.

Mangione's lawyers are asking the court to suppress evidence collected during his arrest at a Pennsylvania McDonald's five days after the murder. The evidence includes physical evidence from a backpack, including the suspected murder weapon and his journals, as well as statements he made to police before they read him a Miranda warning.

The first witness was NYPD Sgt. Chris McLaughlin, a member of the Deputy Commissioner for Public Information's office, which is responsible for communications between police and the media. 

Prosecutors asked McLaughlin about a series of surveillance photos and videos taken in the lead-up to the shooting and its immediate aftermath, including the image of a then-unidentified person of interest smiling at a woman at a Manhattan hostel, which led to Mangione's arrest when witnesses saw him in Altoona and called police.

The next witness is Bernad Pyles, who works at ADI Global Distribution, a security camera company that installed the surveillance system at the Altoona McDonald's where police arrested Mangione.

During Pyles' testimony, a monitor showed previously unseen surveillance video from the fast food restaurant, before, during and after his arrest.

The third witness is Emily States, who works for the Blair County Department of Emergency Services. 

The hearings are expected to run for several days, with a break on Wednesday.

There are three different types of suppression hearings — Mapp, Huntley and Mosley. Two of them are expected this week: a Mapp hearing, to determine whether certain types of physical evidence should be suppressed or thrown out, and a Huntley hearing, to determine if a confession or other statements to law enforcement are admissible. 

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has not yet finalized its trial strategy, and a Mosley hearing, which determines if non-eyewitnesses can testify at trial, is not expected yet.

Mangione faces a slew of charges in New York, Pennsylvania and federally.

State-level terror charges were thrown out earlier this year, but Mangione still faces second-degree murder, seven counts of criminal possession of a weapon, and possession of a forged ID in New York.

            A federal appeals court on Monday found Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, is serving unlawfully as US attorney for New Jersey, dealing a legal blow to the Trump administration that could have far-reaching consequences on other appointments across the country.
    


            A panel of three appellate judges with 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's finding that the administration violated the law when it used of a series of maneuvers to install Habba in the position after failing to win Senate support.
    


            “Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U.S. Attorney indefinitely,” the unanimous panel wrote. “This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional (appointment and Senate confirmation) process entirely.”
    


            The ruling could impact what happens in several key jurisdictions where the Trump administration doesn't have Senate-confirmed US attorneys, including the Los Angeles and Las Vegas areas.
    


            Last week, a district court threw out two indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after finding Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was serving unlawfully.
    


            While the 3rd Circuit's decisions cover New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin Islands, appeals court cases are often given deference in other parts of the country especially when they are dealing with novel legal issues.
    


            It isn't clear who will lead the US attorney's office following the court's ruling. The Justice Department could appeal the case further by asking the full bench of 3rd Circuit judges to rehear the argument or go directly to the US Supreme Court.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.
    


            An attorney for Julien Giraud, Jr., one of the three defendants who challenged Habba's eligibility, praised the ruling.
    


            “The panel issued a clear and carefully reasoned decision that recognizes the extraordinary power vested in US attorneys and reinforces the limits Congress has set on who may occupy those positions,” said Thomas Mirigliano. “We appreciate the court's thoughtful approach and the clarity it brings to this important issue.”
    


From White House adviser to Trump's handpicked prosecutor: 63 days with Lindsey Halligan



            In the districts where US attorneys were found to be serving unlawfully, criminal cases have mostly continued, although some judges have postponed trials or sentencings. To date, except in the cases involving Halligan, judges have not dismissed indictments of the defendants who brought – and won – the challenges because they found other prosecutors were involved.
    


            Trump's lawyers appealed the ruling by Judge Matthew Brann, saying he erred when he found that Habba is not serving legally because she was not the first assistant US attorney when the US attorney vacancy arose. They also argued Habba should be able to act as US attorney on authority delegated to her as a special attorney from Attorney General Pam Bondi.
    


            Trump named Habba interim US attorney for New Jersey earlier this year. As the 120-day clock for interim appointments was set to expire, and it was clear the district court judges were not going to name her US attorney, Habba resigned. Bondi named Habba special attorney and designated her as the first assistant US attorney. She then delegated to Habba the authority of the US attorney.
    


            The three-judge panel was made up of two appointees of former President George W. Bush – Judges Michael Fisher, D. Brooks Smith – and former President Barack Obama-appointee Felipe Restrepo.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Less than a month after Democrats scored a string of victories over Republicans in the Nov. 4 general election, the next test at the ballot box for both parties heading into the 2026 midterm season will be Tuesday in a Tennessee special congressional election on usually reliable GOP turf.

House Republicans look to hold the seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District and pad their narrow 219-213 advantage in the chamber. Democrats hope to extend their winning streak by pulling off an upset in this Middle Tennessee district, where Donald Trump and other GOP candidates routinely win with around 60% of the vote.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July to join the private sector.

Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who headed the Tennessee Department of General Services under Republican Gov. Bill Lee. With endorsements from both Trump and Green, he easily won the October special primary against 10 opponents.

Behn is a state representative first elected in a 2023 special election. She narrowly won a four-way Democratic primary that featured two other state representatives and a well-funded local businessman. A former political organizer and progressive activist, Behn was described by some state Democrats as “our very own AOC of TN,” a reference to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Prominent Van Epps backers have frequently repeated the nickname in support of the Republican nominee.

As the final high-profile head-to-head party matchup of the year, the race has attracted attention from national political figures. Trump phoned into a tele-rally for Van Epps on Nov. 13 just as early voting began. His 2024 presidential election rival, Democratic then-Vice President Kamala Harris, appeared at a Nov. 18 event in Nashville to encourage Democratic turnout in the special election.




As a result, spending has ballooned. Going into the October primary, Van Epps had spent more than $348,000 and had about $54,000 in the bank. Behn spent more than $168,000 ahead of her primary and had about $20,000 in the bank. As of mid-November, according to the pre-election Federal Election Commission filings, Van Epps had raised an additional $590,000, compared with about $1 million for Behn.

Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years. The district also includes parts of heavily Democratic Davidson County, which is home to Nashville. The Nashville area once anchored a separate congressional district favorable to Democrats, but state Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 and divided Davidson County among the 7th and two neighboring Republican-friendly districts.

Trump carried the 7th District in 2024 with about 60% of the vote, compared with about 38% for Harris. In the Davidson County portion of the district, Harris received nearly 68% of the vote, which comprised about 22% of total votes in the district. Trump won each of the remaining 13 counties with at least 59% of the vote.

Green was elected twice each under the old and new district boundaries. Under the old lines, he received between 67% and 70% of the vote. His margin of victory narrowed after new lines were drawn in 2022 — he won with 60% of the vote in 2022 and 2024.

The contest marks the year's fifth special election to fill a vacant congressional seat. An additional vacant seat in a heavily Democratic Houston-area district in Texas will be filled in a runoff election on Jan. 31, 2026, while a recently vacated seat in northern New Jersey held by Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will be filled next April.

The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it's determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.

In Tennessee, recounts are held only as part of a legal challenge in the courts. There are no automatic recounts, and losing candidates may not request recounts. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is subject to a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.

Here's a look at what to expect on Tuesday:

The special election in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District will be held Tuesday. Polls in the district close at 7 p.m. local time, which is 8 p.m. ET. Although Tennessee is in two time zones, the 7th District falls entirely within the Central time zone.

The AP will provide vote results and declare a winner in the special congressional election.

Any voter registered in the 7th Congressional District may participate in the special election.

There were about 466,000 registered voters in the 7th Congressional District in the November 2024 general election. Turnout in the congressional race was about 69% of registered voters in the 2024 presidential election year and about 41% in the 2022 midterm elections.

Among the 14 counties located either entirely or partly within the 7th District, about 73% of 2024 general election ballots were cast early in person or by absentee. About 51% of the vote in these 14 counties were cast early or by absentee in the 2022 midterms.

As of Nov. 26, the last day of early voting, just over 84,000 ballots had been cast before the special election.

The votes were tallied quickly in the Oct. 7 special primaries. The AP first reported results from both the Democratic and Republican primaries at about 8:05 p.m. ET from Perry County, about five minutes after polls closed. The vote count was completed in both contests at 10:28 p.m. ET with the final vote update from Humphreys County.

In the 2024 general election, the AP first reported results in the 7th District congressional race at 8:03 p.m. ET from Perry County. The election night tabulation ended at 12:36 a.m. ET, with more than 99% of total votes counted.

As of Tuesday, there will be 336 days until the 2026 midterm elections.

            There is no love lost between hip-hop moguls 50 Cent and Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            50 Cent has long trolled Diddy on social media, especially after CNN's publication of surveillance video showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in 2016.
    


            Now the rapper turned actor and producer has taken it up a notch with his latest project, a Netflix docuseries about Combs.
    


            50 Cent, born Curtis Jackson, is a producer on the four-part series “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” which drops Tuesday.
    


            According to the director, Alexandria Stapleton, the project was inspired in part by Ventura. She testified against Combs in a federal sex trafficking trial this year, in which Combs was convicted on charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.



            “Being a woman in the industry, and going through the #MeToo movement — watching giants in music and film go on trial, and to know what their outcomes were … When Cassie dropped her lawsuit, I just thought this could go a million different directions,” Stapleton said. “I wondered how she had the confidence to go out there against a mogul like Sean Combs. As a filmmaker, I instantly knew it was a stress test of whether we've changed as a culture, as far as being able to process allegations like this in a fair way.”
    


            Combs has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing. That hasn't stopped 50 Cent from trolling him on social media since the allegations went public.
    


            But why the bad blood? Here's a look back at how there came to be animosity between the two men.
    


            In 2006, 50 Cent released a diss track “The Bomb,” which featured sounds of gunfire and his allegation that Combs knew the identity of the killer of Christopher Wallace, a rapper known as The Notorious B.I.G., who was both a protégée and best friend to Combs.
    


            Wallace was gunned down in Los Angeles in March 1997 as he and his crew, which included Combs, were traveling in a caravan. Combs was in a different vehicle from the one Wallace was in at the time Wallace was shot.



            No one has ever been charged with the murder.
    


            In his diss track, 50 raps, “I guess this means I won't be invited to the white parties in the Hamptons,” referencing Combs' famous soirees held in the upscale New York community.
    


            50 Cent has also said he believes Combs is connected to the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur.
    


            Combs called such allegations “nonsense” in a 2016 interview with the syndicated radio show “The Breakfast Club.” He has never been charged in connection to either case.
    


            Followers of 50 are familiar with his reputation for sharp comments and social media trolling.
    


            The rapper-turned-television-producer has made Combs a frequent target, attacking everything from his music to his age.



            Some believed it was mostly marketing, especially given the men's parallel career tracks and even competing vodkas at one point, Effen Vodka from 50 Cent and Ciroc, which formally partnered with Combs.
    


            But 50 upped his comments after Combs was sued in November 2023 by Ventura, who in a now-settled civil complaint alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 and abused her over the more than decade they were in an off-and-on relationship.
    


            Combs has denied the allegations, but apologized on Sunday for the incident depicted in the surveillance video.
    


            After federal investigators searched Combs' homes in Miami and Los Angeles in March, 50 Cent posted on X, “Now it's not Diddy do it, it's Diddy done. They don't come like that unless they got a case.”
    


            Combs was asked about the tension between him and 50 Cent during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club” in 2018.
    


            “I don't have no beef with Fif. He loves me,” Combs said. “Y'all can't see that he loves me? You really think that's hate? … You know he loves me.”
    


            He added that he didn't take the things 50 Cent says about him seriously.
    


            “When he does that it's like funny to me,” Combs said. “I don't really take it personal. I know he has a different sense of humor, and he's just not in my life. We don't have to never cross paths, and I will never say nothing negative about him, you know, because that's just not me.”
    


            Christian Combs, who goes by King Combs, is the 27-year-old son of Diddy. In May 2024 he released a song titled “Pick a Side” in support of his father and taking aim at critics like 50 Cent.
    


            The younger Combs and his brother, Justin, were temporarily handcuffed and detained by authorities during the March 2024 search of their father's home. Neither was arrested or charged.
    


            Aaron Dyer, Diddy's attorney, said in a statement to CNN at the time that “there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs' residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.”
    


            King Combs appeared to profess his father's innocence in his track and took a swipe at 50 Cent.
    


            “All that gossip sh*t is whack when all they had was 50 Cent / Who put this city on the map? / Stop lying,” the younger Combs raps.
    


            50 Cent responded with a tongue-in-cheek post on social media.
    


            “I feel so threatened by the things Christian is saying on his record,” he wrote in a since-delated post on Instagram, according to Billboard. “I'm afraid for my life, please don't hurt me guys.”

A leading consumer product group on Monday is kicking off a campaign promoting transparency in processed food labeling and pushing back on unrealistic claims that the only good meal is one Americans grow, butcher, and bake from scratch.

With a new ad and educational drive, the Consumer Brands Association is joining the MAHA movement's push for transparency while rebutting food purists targeting processed foods.

“I hear some influencers say, ‘Forget convenient packaged foods. Grow your own,” says a woman in the new 30-second television and digital ad while surrounded by clucking chickens. In the next scene, four boys appear shocked when their mother, holding one of the live birds, asks them, “Sure, it takes a little extra work, but look how fresh it is. Who wants to help make dinner?”

The point of the humorous ad is that most processed and pre-made foods are healthy and convenient, and their ingredients are easy to see on today's packaging.

“Growing food is great, but sometimes you just need convenient, nutritious, and affordable. America's favorite brands make that possible. Expectations about food are high, so we're offering more transparency, choices, and detailed product information so you'll always have confidence about what's on the table,” concluded the new ad.

The campaign will be focused on Washington, where Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is rewriting the rules on food. Kennedy has suggested that he will regulate “ultra-processed foods,” claiming that they are unhealthy.

The campaign by the Consumer Brands Association is aimed at helping educate leaders on the reality of processed foods and join in Kennedy's demands for transparency in food labeling.

“The makers of America's favorite household brands have long been committed to transparency and empowering consumers to make informed purchasing decisions about the products they rely on. But we also know consumers expect more information today about what's in their products,” said Melissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the trade group.

“Consumer Brands is proud to launch this exciting new campaign that puts transparency, safety and the consumer front and center and emphasizes the industry's commitment to a healthier America,” she added in a statement shared with Washington Secrets.

While it is kicking off the first-ever National Consumer Transparency Week on Monday, the industry has been on a transparency kick for a while through its SmartLabel and Facts up Front campaigns and its “food processing facts” website.

It has also tackled food “influencers” who have been attacking processed offerings. In one recent blog post, for example, the group said that Americans who might choose a frozen pizza for dinner shouldn't be demonized by food purists.

In a push for a common-sense approach to food, the post said, “The assertions — made in what largely feels like an effort to weigh in on the topic du jour — are so ridiculous, lacking not only in common sense but also in understanding and empathy for the variety of dietary needs many consumers face and budgets they're balancing.”

President Donald Trump said the 2024 conviction of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez should be pointed to as a “Biden setup.”

Trump announced Friday that he would pardon Hernandez because he has been “treated very harshly and unfairly.” The former Honduran president was convicted of helping drug traffickers move hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States and was sentenced to 45 years in prison.

“Well, I was told — I was asked by Honduras, many of the people of Honduras, they said it was a Biden setup,” Trump told reporters Sunday. “He was the president of the country. And they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country.”

Federal prosecutors accused Hernandez in 2019, during Trump's first term, of using drug money to fund his 2013 presidential bid. The Biden administration extradited him to face trial in 2022 after he left office. His trial did not start until last year, when a prosecutor revealed that he told drug dealers that “together, they were going to shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos.”

Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said after Hernandez‘s sentencing that the former Honduran president, who served his people from 2013 to 2022, “abused his power to support one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world.”

Former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams also accused Hernandez of moving “well over approximately 4.5 billion individual doses of cocaine.”

Trump said he heard the people of Honduras believed he was “set up.”

“He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country, and they said it was a Biden administration setup,” he said. “And I looked at the facts, and I agreed with that.”

When asked what evidence he had to support the alleged setup, he said, “They could say that you take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life. That includes this country.”

The pardon stunned Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.

“He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco-trafficking,” Kaine said on CBS's Face the Nation.

Trump announced Hernandez‘s pardon alongside his support of Honduran conservative presidential candidate Nasry “Tito” Asfura. Hondurans are voting in their presidential general election, and early results have favored Asfura, who is facing off against former Honduran Vice President Salvador Nasralla.

Trump suggested he would be dissuaded from sending money to Honduras if Nasralla wins.

“If [Asfura] doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,” Trump wrote.

TRUMP DOWNPLAYS VENEZUELAN AIRSPACE ‘CLOSURE' AFTER MADURO PHONE CALL

Trump's support of the former Honduran president convicted of drug trafficking comes as his administration has taken a harsh stance on the drug problem. The president recently expressed support for War Secretary Pete Hegseth, as he has been accused of carrying out an extra strike on two drug traffickers who were shipwrecked in September.

The War Department has killed at least 83 people in 21 strikes on alleged drug boats since September.

Lawmakers from both parties said Sunday they support congressional reviews of U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, citing a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.

The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week's Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns.

“This rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.

Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information on what happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations. “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said.

President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump is also weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country's president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel's parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Under the deal announced Monday, the Trump administration agreed to exempt U.K.-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes. In return, U.K. drugs firms committed to invest more in the U.S. and create more jobs. The U.K. government said it will invest around 25% more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades.

“This vital deal will ensure U.K. patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives,” Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said.

U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement “strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to U.S.–U.K. pharmaceutical trade.”

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa's efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it's “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump's comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday's expected launch of what they're calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee. 

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump's endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. 

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state's two Democratic U.S. House members. 

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana's other current Democratic district is in the state's northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District. 

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state's congressional districts in Republicans' favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump's demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there's no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal's fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana's existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

“Home is Where the Heart is” is the theme she chose for her family's first Christmas back at the White House.

Public tours resume on Tuesday.

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro's support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party's leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela's Caribbean coast. 

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration's maneuvers to keep the president's former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration's push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government's moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings.

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

Fox News Digital spoke with terrorism expert Dr. Casey Babb about a recent NYU study that found U.S. extremists are exploiting social media with far fewer limits than foreign terrorist groups.

Extremist groups in America are exploiting social media's chaos and cashing in on it, as violent rhetoric spreads faster than platforms can contain it, according to a new report and security experts who warn the problem is no longer limited to foreign terrorist networks.

A study from New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, titled "Digital Aftershocks: Online Mobilization and Violence in the United States," found that violent Islamist groups' shrinking online presence shows how terrorist designations, when paired with platform enforcement, can push extremists into smaller corners of the internet, successfully limiting their recruitment and propaganda.

But that same legal framework doesn't apply to domestic extremist movements, creating what the report calls an "enforcement asymmetry" that allows far-right, far-left, nihilistic groups and antisemitic networks to thrive on mainstream platforms.

ONLINE ‘GORE' FORUMS ARE ‘GATEWAY TO EXTREMISM' IN MASS SHOOTINGS, NORMALIZING HORROR FOR KIDS: EXPERTS

Dr. Casey Babb, terrorism professor and director of the Promised Land Project with Canada's Macdonald-Laurier Institute, told Fox News Digital that policymakers already have the authority to curb homegrown extremism.

"Despite the First Amendment, and, of course, some of this is in a gray zone, but not all speech is protected," Babb said. "There are already tools there that enable policymakers, law enforcement, intelligence agencies and so on to crack down on domestic extremists." "Statements that are intended to provoke unlawful action, incitement, that's not protected speech. Or statements where the person making [them] intensely communicate[s] some sort of intent to commit an unlawful act or violence, or says something that could be perceived as a legitimate threat, that's not protected."

DAVID MARCUS: DEMOCRATS MUST STOP THEIR DEADLY ANTI-FASCISM COSPLAY

The NYU report mirrors that frustration, concluding that the U.S. has "ample tools" to confront extremism but applies them unevenly. It found that when foreign terrorist designations restrict groups like al Qaeda and ISIS, their online reach collapses.

"The ability to designate organized nations and individuals as terrorist entities is a very useful tool," Babb said. "It's a tool that policymakers should really lean into and think about, possibly modernizing and reforming to better address a lot of what we're seeing domestically."

Babb said extremists are "learning from one another," adopting propaganda and recruitment methods once pioneered by Islamist organizations.

"Groups like ISIS, al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood were some of the early adopters of these platforms," he said. "They recognized many, many years ago the power of these social-media outlets to recruit, to disseminate harmful messaging and to really undermine the populations that they target."

He also blamed social-media companies for enabling the spread of hate.

"There's frankly no reason that I should be seeing much of what I'm seeing online," Babb said. "Free speech is one thing; giving a platform for nefarious state and non-state actors to spread divisive language deliberately with the intent of dividing Americans and endangering certain minorities, that's something else entirely. These platforms reward outrage and they reward divisive content. A lot of people are monetizing this."

"You shouldn't be making thousands of dollars a month by spreading the same messages that Adolf Hitler or Yahya Sinwar would spread," he added.

President Trump once floated designating Antifa a domestic terrorist group, an idea Babb believes deserves renewed attention.

"Designation opens a whole suite of tools," he said. "It makes adversaries' lives much more difficult."

The Digital Aftershocks report concludes that U.S. policymakers and tech platforms must coordinate more aggressively to combat online extremism.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani told NBC News' Kristen Welker that he still believes President Trump is a "fascist" after his meeting with the president at the White House.

A sociology professor at Brooklyn College appointed to New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's transition team wrote a book about ending policing.

"I'm excited to announce that I have been asked to join the Mamdani Transition Team to work on community safety issues. A New Era for NYC," Alex Vitale said on X.

Vitale is the author of "The End of Policing," published in 2017. The book, which opens by explaining that police don't exist to help citizens, argues for an end to traditional policing for certain criminal activity, including narcotics use, prostitution, patrolling borders and "misbehaving adolescents." The book also argues that police shouldn't combat street gangs.

On ending gang units, Vitale argues that they are racist.

"In most cities, gang units function as a mechanism for racialized social control," the book says in chapter five. "Black and Latino youth are labeled as gang members for hanging out together, while white youth groups are dismissed as harmless."

Policing borders is also racist, according to the author. 

"The expansion of Border Patrol powers has been justified through fear and racism. It legitimizes xenophobic narratives that define immigrants as threats rather than as fellow workers or neighbors," the book says in chapter six.

Vitale also describes border policing as "inhumane." 

Chapter nine of the book argues against training police officers on implicit bias, claiming that police officers' views on race do not matter because the whole system of policing is racist.

"Racism in policing is structural, not simply a product of bad attitudes," the book says. "Training officers to recognize implicit bias without changing what they are tasked with enforcing is like teaching a soldier to be sensitive while sending him to occupy a foreign country."

The professor's faculty profile on Brooklyn College's website says Vitale has spent 30 years writing about policing and that he consults with law enforcement entities and international human rights organizations.

He teaches courses about African Americans in the criminal justice system, according to his university profile.

Vitale has often called to abolish police on his X account, including bicycle police, police helicopters and police in schools. He has also called to abolish joint terrorism task forces, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Border Patrol and even the presidency of the United States.

He has also called for the NYPD to abolish its gang database.

Neither Vitale nor Brooklyn College returned requests for comment.

Mamdani has hired others who harbor anti-police sentiments.

Earlier this month, he announced that campaign advisor Elle Bisgaard-Church would join his staff. She has been dubbed the "chief architect" of Mamdani's campaign proposal to have social workers respond to certain non-violent 911 calls and is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America.

Mamdani officials did not return a request for comment.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  As part of CNN Style's Art of Gifting series, selected tastemakers share their top tips for gifting and mastering the holiday season.



            If gift-giving talents were ranked by profession, interior designers would likely top the list — after all, curating thoughtful objects to fit a client's purpose or taste is one of the things they do.
    


            For famed California-based designer Kelly Wearstler, curiosity has always guided the projects she works on. “It's about finding that new thing that really moves me and makes me fall in love with it,” she explained during a video call.
    


            Wearstler began her business in 1999, and her accolades are oft repeated. She shot to fame for her bold style, which she describes as “old soul, new spirit.” Early projects — including her transformation of the historic Avalon Hotel in Beverly Hills — helped build a starry client list that today includes the likes of Gwen Stefani and Cameron Diaz.
    


            Her eponymous studio has touched nearly every facet of design. She's brought to life dreamy restaurants and cocktail bars layered with texture and color; established her own furniture and lighting line; and has partnered with a range of collaborators, including fashion designer Ulla Johnson for her earthy LA boutique and industry-favorite paint purveyors Farrow & Ball. Today, she has some 2.2 million followers on Instagram and 33,000 subscribers to Wearstlerworld, her Substack where she shares inspo, musings and tips.
    


More is more: Maximalism is making interior design fun again



            Most recently, she launched Side Hustle, a flexible gallery concept out of the white cube and into her pool house (literally), in which she commissions artists across sculpture, design, performance, sound and even scent to produce collectible designs. The idea was born from all the singular artistic objects she's commissioned over the years for her interior design clients.
    


            “We were seeing all these exclusive works were so desirable,” she explained. “And so I've always wanted a gallery where it is totally a free-spirit platform.”
    


            She believes art is a “special and memorable” gift, whether a small catch-all ceramics dish or a print by an emerging photographer. But just as important is how attuned a gift is to the person's tastes and needs (she never wants a present to become clutter, she said), and how it's given.
    


            “I always think about the presentation and how it's wrapped,” she said. “The whole experience to me is getting a gift and seeing something so beautiful and a really thoughtful note accompanied with the gift.” Below, she reveals her gifting secrets.
    


CNN: What's the best gift you've ever received?



            KW: My husband gave me this necklace I wear every day. I got it for the holidays last year. And it's something that's personalized — it has the initials of my three boys, my husband, and my initials and has this little star in the middle. I wear it every day, and it's my good luck charm. It keeps me safe and my family close.
    


CNN: What is the best gift you've ever given?



            KW: There's this ceramic artist in Europe, and the name of her company is called The English Boys. She does these really amazing hand-painted ceramics. And several times, I've given a set with a tea pot, cups, saucers and plates. And it's a great little ensemble for dessert or small bites. And then I have her write the name of every family member on it, and everyone really loves that.
    


CNN: Who is the hardest person in your family or friend circle to buy for?



            KW: Oh my god, my husband.
    


CNN: What makes it so challenging?



            KW: He's simple. He loves exercise and working out, so I know to give him anything that fits inside that box. But he's definitely very particular.
    


CNN: How do you approach gift giving to someone you don't know very well?



            KW: I love giving throws — and we actually designed some really nice, luxurious throws. It's something that everyone loves, and they're like, ‘That throw you gave me, we still use it and we snuggle with it, and I travel with it.”
    


CNN: What's a great gift that costs nothing?



            KW: A card. Our family, we make our own cards and it's something we've always done, and now my boys do it. Anytime there's any holiday, we all make our cards and the envelopes they go in. It's so thoughtful and sweet, and that's a gift in itself.
    


CNN: Do you have any traditions or rituals around the holidays?



            KW: I always have a holiday party with all my girlfriends. We do it two or three weeks before Christmas. A couple of my friends are really good cooks, and so they make the food. It's such a nice time to reflect on the year and the things we want to do in the following year. It's a really special moment.
    


CNN: If you're celebrating with loved ones around a table, what are the most important components of the celebration?



            KW: Honestly, the most important part of any celebration around a table is that everything speaks the same language. It's never just the food or flowers or a great bottle of wine — it's a full, multi-sensory experience. The menu, the tablescape, the lighting, the playlist, they all have to be in conversation with each other. You're essentially telling a story, and every element is a character that supports the narrative.

            Rows of worshippers, some with their faces raised toward the sky, others with their heads bowed, prayed for rain at a mosque in Tehran earlier this month. Theirs is an increasingly desperate plea. The city is grappling with a water crisis so severe the Iranian president has suggested people may need to evacuate. The weeks tick by, still the rains don't arrive.
    


            There are fears water may run out completely in this vast, bustling city, whose metropolitan area is home to around 15 million people.
    


            In a speech earlier this month, President Masoud Pezeshkian said water will be rationed if it does not rain in Tehran by December. If the lack of rain continues, residents “have to evacuate,” he said. Many experts say evacuation is unfeasible, but Pezeshkian's rhetoric reflects the seriousness of Iran's situation.
    


            Tehran is in the spotlight, but this is a crisis that goes well beyond the capital. Around 20 provinces haven't seen a single drop of rain since the start of the rainy season at the end of September, said Mohsen B. Mesgaran, an associate professor of plant sciences at the University of California, Davis. Roughly 10% of the country's dams have effectively run dry, according to Reuters.
    


            The roots of Iran's water woes echo those in many other parts of the world: decades of over-extraction; aging, leaky infrastructure; a proliferation of dams erected across rivers; mismanagement; accusations of corruption. Through it all runs the thread of climate change, driving hotter, drier weather, meaning year after year, dried-out reservoirs are not replenished.
    


            Iran's current drought is the worst for at least 40 years and water levels are shrinking “at a time of year when you would normally expect storage to be recovering, not collapsing further,” said Amir AghaKouchak, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Irvine.
    


            Iran, a mostly semi-arid country, is no stranger to water shortages, but rarely have they affected Tehran, home to most of the country's rich and powerful.
    


            The main reservoirs supplying the city are only around 11% full, according to Mohsen Ardakani, the director general of the Tehran Provincial Water and Sanitation Authority, as reported by Iran's semi-official Mehr News Agency earlier this month.
    


            The Latyan Dam, around 15 miles outside the city, is only about 9% full. Since May, the reservoir, nestled in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, has receded so much it has left an almost entirely dry riverbed in its wake, etched with just a few trickling streams.
    


            The Amir Kabir Dam, about 40 miles northwest of Tehran, is also at perilously low levels, currently at around 8% of its total capacity, according to Reuters.
    


            Beyond Tehran, water levels in the reservoirs supplying Iran's second largest city Mashhad, home to around 3 million people, are at only around 3%, said Hossein Esmailian, head of Mashhad's water and wastewater utility company, according to ISNA News.
    


            Iran's situation isn't a short term disaster, but a rolling, long-term catastrophe bringing irreversible damages, said Kaveh Madani, director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, who previously served as deputy head of Iran's Department of Environment.
    


            He described the country as being in “water bankruptcy,” extracting from its rivers lakes and wetlands (akin to its checking account) and its underground aquifers (its savings account) at a much faster rate than they are replenished.
    


            The government's aim to achieve food self-sufficiency, partly in response to Western sanctions, is largely responsible for the situation, experts say. “For decades, policies have encouraged the expansion of irrigated agriculture in arid regions,” AghaKouchak said.
    


            Irrigated farmland has doubled since 1979 and crops are thirsty, especially rice, an Iranian staple. The vast majority of Iran's water, around 90%, goes to agriculture.
    


            Lake Urmia, in northwestern Iran, is a clear casualty. Once one of the planet's largest saltwater lakes, Urmia has shriveled over the past decades. Drought has played a role but the bigger driver is the dams and wells that have sprung up nearby to support farms, choking off supply to the lake. They have “pushed the system beyond its limits,” Mesgaran said.
    


            Water-guzzling industries such as oil and gas have also been built in Iran's arid and semi-arid regions, adding to the pressure in already fragile areas.
    


            Swelling urban populations have increased demand, too. The situation is exacerbated by aging infrastructure. “An estimated 30% of treated drinking water is lost through old, leaky distribution systems, and there's very little water recycling,” Mesgaran said.
    


            On top of all these problems is the climate crisis. “The house was on fire because of mismanagement, and then climate change … is adding fuel,” Madani said.
    


            Iran is now in its sixth consecutive year of drought, which is now at a scale,  intensity and duration that “is unprecedented in modern times,” Madani said.
    


            The conditions driving it — low rainfall and soaring temperatures — would not have been possible without human-caused climate change, according to a recent analysis by World Weather Attribution network.
    


            For people in Tehran, it's an anxious wait. There was hope fall would bring much-needed rains but, aside from a few isolated bursts, they have failed to arrive.
    


            Authorities say there isn't formal water rationing, but residents report reduced water pressure. Sometimes the taps run dry for periods of time.
    


            Government communication with the public has been fragmented and inconsistent, Madani said, leading to high levels of mistrust and flourishing conspiracy theories, including the idea that foreign powers are modifying Iran's weather and stealing clouds.
    


            Evacuation seems a remote possibility, despite the president's words. “Where would people even go?” Mesgaran asked. “The country is facing one of its worst economic situations, and most households simply can't afford such a move.”
    


            Temporary evacuations may be more likely. In the summer, authorities announced emergency public holidays to persuade people to leave the city. “If you have only days or weeks of water left, even saving for a few hours can make a huge difference,” Madani said.
    


            The government has also tried cloud seeding, where particles are injected into clouds to draw out rain or snow. There is little scientific consensus on how well this works, however. “It's a good solution for desperate governments to just show that they're taking action,” Madani said.
    


            To really tackle the long-term crisis means widespread reform, including diversifying the economy away from water-intensive sectors like farming, experts say. This, however, is likely to be extremely unpopular and could cause big unemployment problems.
    


            For now, officials are pinning their hopes on — and directing prayers toward — the arrival of rain. “In the past, people would go out to the desert to pray for rain,” said Mehdi Chamran, head of Tehran's City Council, according to a Reuters report citing state media. “Perhaps we should not neglect that tradition.”
    


            The situation is so acute, however, that even if the rains come, it's unlikely to be enough. “Nature is now imposing hard limits,” AghaKouchak said. Aquifers that have been drained will not rebound and ecosystems that collapse cannot quickly be restored.
    


            The longer the government waits to make meaningful reforms, the fewer options remain, he added. “The water crisis is not only an environmental issue; it is increasingly intertwined with Iran's social and political future.”

            The remains of some of those killed in last week's inferno at a Hong Kong apartment complex may never be recovered, a city official said Monday, as a painstaking search effort continues at the site.
    


            The death toll has risen to 151 people and at least 30 remain missing, officials said Monday, after the city's worst fire in decades, which tore through seven high-rise towers of the Wang Fuk Court complex. The housing complex, which was undergoing renovations, was home to more than 4,000 people, many of which were elderly.
    


            “Since some of the bodies have been reduced to ashes, we don't rule out that we may not be able to bring all the missing people out,” said Chief Superintendent Karen Tsang, head of the casualty inquiry unit, who fought back tears during a press conference on Monday afternoon.
    


            The number of people arrested over the fire has risen to 14 and more arrests may follow, authorities said, as they accused construction companies of buying and using materials that were not fire-safe.
    


            Most of those arrested are consultants, contractors and subcontractors connected to the construction work, and 13 of them are being investigated on suspicion of “manslaughter by way of gross negligence,” officials said.
    


            An estimated 600 disaster victim identification specialists have been slowly going door to door to clear each apartment since the fire was extinguished Friday.
    


            “During the search, bodies were found in the building corridors, flats, staircases, and even on rooftops,” said police superintendent Cheng Ka-chun, who led the specialist police identification unit.
    


            Images released by police showed boiler-suit-clad searchers carefully checking through the ashes of burned belongings inside a fire-ravaged unit. The complex task is made harder by dim lighting conditions and narrow corridors blocked by fallen objects, police said.
    


            Officers had to navigate corridors blocked by burned wooden panels to get to apartments where windows were shattered, with walls blackened and paint peeling off.
    


            “The whole apartment has gone pitch-dark without electricity and lighting,” Cheng said Sunday.
    


Hong Kong has suffered its deadliest fire in decades. Survivors are asking how it was allowed to happen



            By Monday night, the search had concluded at five of the towers, but officials said some apartments in the remaining two damaged blocks were structurally unsafe for searchers to enter.
    


            “Everyone remembers Wang Cheong House was the first to catch fire and was among the last to be put out,” said Regional Commander Lam Man-han, adding that “the environment is extremely horrible.”
    


            Those killed included a number of elderly residents, foreign domestic workers who lived with their employers – many of which are older people or families with children –– construction workers and a firefighter who had been deployed to the scene.
    


            Nine of the domestic workers were from Indonesia and one was from the Philippines, their consulates said.
    


            Substandard mesh netting that was wrapping bamboo scaffolding around the complex towers contributed to the rapid spread of the blaze, officials said Monday.
    


            Seven of 20 samples taken from the complex after the fire had failed fire safety tests, said Hong Kong's Secretary for Security Chris Tang.
    


            A corruption probe into 12 of those arrested is now underway.
    


            Woo Ying-ming, the city's corruption commissioner, said the netting around the building had been damaged during a typhoon in July and accused the group of purchasing non-compliant netting to replace it. “They applied it on the damaged spots,” said Woo, who added that officials had calculated they had bought enough to wrap all eight towers at the complex.
    


            Fearing the netting would be examined after a fire at another Hong Kong high-rise in October, the group allegedly purchased more fire-safe netting that they wrapped only around the ground floors one the buildings, said Woo.
    


            “The suspects are very cunning,” said Chief Secretary Chan Kwok-ki. “For very little profits, they take the lives of many people.”
    


            The city's building department is now collecting samples from 300 building sites where similar netting is being used.
    


            Polystyrene boards that were used by contractors to block windows at the complex have been identified as another factor that contributed to the speed of the inferno's spread. Officials said they had identified three other building sites in the city where the same technique was being used and asked for the boards to be removed.
    


            On Sunday, hundreds of Hong Kongers came to lay flowers at the site of the blaze, forming a long queue that stretched more than a kilometer into the Tai Po neighborhood.
    


            Among the mourners were families, elderly people and foreign domestic helpers, many of whom left notes attached to columns of the pavilion in a nearby park.
    


            “Truth will reveal itself. God bless Hong Kong,” one wrote.

            Over recent days, donations amounting to 900 million Hong Kong dollars ($115 million) have poured in from businesses and the community, with people also sending food and necessities to a resource center set up by volunteers in the housing complex.
    


            Volunteers helped distribute food and water at the scene.
    


            Some aspects of the community response have drawn suspicion from authorities, who have warned against a resurgence of anti-government sentiment in Hong Kong, referencing pro-democracy protests that broke out in 2019.
    


Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous part of China and run by its own local government that answers to leaders in Beijing.
    


            On Saturday, Beijing's national security office in the city warned against any renewed dissent, calling for the city's government to punish those wishing to use the fire as a pretext to “oppose China and stir chaos in Hong Kong.”
    


            National security police have since arrested three people, including one detained on suspicion of incitement after allegedly distributing materials in support of an online petition calling for an independent enquiry into the fire, among other demands, their lawyers told CNN.
    


            The petition, which has since been removed, had over 10,000 signatures by Saturday afternoon, Reuters reported.
    


            A pro-Beijing newspaper reported that a high-ranking Hong Kong police superintendent in charge of national security also visited the site of the fire.
    


            Authorities have asked volunteers to leave the fire scene, announcing that it would centralize the distribution of resources and require people to register through WhatsApp for their donations.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Sunday that suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal may have been radicalized after he was granted asylum in the U.S. (NBC)

President Donald Trump on Sunday said his administration's halt on asylum processing in the wake of the deadly National Guard shooting earlier this week could last "a long time" and floated the possibility of revoking citizenship from some naturalized immigrants with criminal histories.

While the administration has framed the asylum freeze as an emergency response to Wednesday's shooting, the president's comments to reporters aboard Air Force One suggest the restrictions could evolve into a longer-term approach.

President Trump tied the pause to a more robust stance toward 19 countries he derided as "crime-ridden" and vowed that he would "absolutely" de-naturalize immigrants convicted of crimes — if it is within his presidential authority.

"We have enough problems. We don't want those people," Trump said, adding that there was no time limit on the moratorium.

"We have criminals that came into our country and they were naturalized," Trump said, vowing that, "If I have the power to do it – I'm not sure that I do, but if I do – I would de-naturalize. Absolutely."

Trump clarified his recent use of the term "reverse migration," saying it means removing people already inside the U.S.

"Get people out that are in our country – get them out of here," Trump said.

LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDING AFTER 2 NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS SHOT NEAR WHITE HOUSE

U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed, while her colleague, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition. Both Guard members had been deployed to D.C. as part of Trump's crime-fighting mission that federalized D.C. police. Trump said he has invited both Guard members' family members to the White House.

"I said, 'When you're ready, because that's a tough thing, come to the White House. We're going to honor Sarah,'" Trump told reporters. "And likewise with Andrew, recover or not."

Lakanwal faces one count of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed in the shooting, charges that prompted the Trump administration to halt all asylum decisions and pause issuing visas for people traveling on Afghan passports.

            Intensifying US threats against Venezuela are raising expectations of imminent military action as President Donald Trump heaps pressure on the Caracas regime and flexes power in the Western Hemisphere.
    


            Every public sign and warning by the president raises the risk that the US is on an inexorable path toward a military confrontation that would represent a big political gamble given the public's antipathy toward new foreign wars.
    


            Trump plans to hold a meeting at the White House Monday evening about next steps on Venezuela, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend, as well as White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.
    


            Controversy is also mounting because of new concerns about the legality of any potential action against Venezuela and warnings that the administration's lethal strikes against alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean have infringed the laws of war. Congressional committees are pledging vigorous, bipartisan oversight of the attacks — a rare occurrence in Trump's second term.
    


            And in an extraordinary move over the Thanksgiving holiday, Trump appeared to undercut the rationale that he's fighting regional cartels with the offer of a pardon to a former Honduran president jailed last year in the US for funneling cocaine into the country.
    


            Trump fueled expectations of looming warfare in Venezuela by warning on Thanksgiving Day that the US will “very soon” start taking action to stop alleged drug-trafficking networks on land. On Saturday, he declared the impoverished, oil-rich country's airspace should be considered closed. An armada of US ships is stationed in the Caribbean Sea off Venezuela, led by the world's mightiest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford. Administration officials have meanwhile spent weeks crafting legal arguments for action against regional drug traffickers that critics warn fall short of legal and constitutional stipulations.
    


            Yet, with the US potentially on the edge of a new war, the administration is yet to provide the public with evidence-based and legally detailed rationales for sending American sons and daughters into action.
    


            This raises the possibility that the buildup and threats are part of a psychological pressure campaign to force President Nicolás Maduro to step down or to encourage officials or generals to topple him. Or a possible military showdown with Venezuela could simply be a new sign this administration sees few political, moral, legal or constitutional curbs on acting exactly how Trump wants.
    


            And even if this is all a bluff to trigger regime change peacefully, officials must soon consider what to do if it fails. Trump's authority will suffer a huge blow if he draws down US forces with Maduro still in office.
    


            Trump on Sunday confirmed for the first time that he'd spoken over the phone to Maduro recently but did not say when or what he discussed. “I don't want to comment on it; the answer is yes,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I wouldn't say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.”
    


            A new US war or concentrated military action abroad would contradict one of the president's core foreign policy principles — the avoidance of new overseas conflicts. And multiple polls show Americans are opposed to a strike on Venezuela. A CBS News survey last month found 76% didn't believe that Trump had explained his position there and only 13% saw the country as a major threat to US security.
    


            In the past, some US administrations have made strenuous efforts ahead of military engagement to prepare the public for action and to rally support behind the president — as was the case before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. But apart from vague comments about fighting drug cartels — some of which may overstate Venezuela's place in the narcotics trade — senior officials have offered few explanations to the public.
    


            Still, millions of Venezuelans would not miss Maduro if he's toppled after years of repression that has impoverished a country with huge economic potential and led to the flight of millions of refugees, including to the US. There are some scenarios in which Maduro's departure might benefit US foreign policy and the region — although administration officials have offered little clarity on whether they've planned for the day after any military action. The failure to do so in Iraq and Afghanistan led to foreign policy disasters. Some analysts fear regime change could trigger chaos and bloodshed in a nation as fractured as Venezuela, possibly sending even more refugees into neighboring countries and the US.
    


            Sen. Markwayne Mullin, however, defended Trump's approach. He said on CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday the president gave Maduro an invitation to leave and that he's protecting the US from drug traffickers. “He's made it very clear we're not going to put troops into Venezuela,” the Oklahoma Republican told Dana Bash, though Trump hasn't publicly ruled out that possibility.
    


            Controversy over the administration's intentions in the region has been fueled further by what people familiar with the incident described to CNN's Natasha Bertrand as a follow-up US military attack on a suspected drug vessel on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone aboard. Experts and some lawmakers have expressed concern that the so-called double-tap strike would violate the laws of armed conflict, which prohibit the execution of an enemy combatant who is taken out of the fight due to injury or surrender.
    


            Details of the strikes were first reported by The Intercept and The Washington Post. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists all strikes on alleged drugs boats are lawful under US and international law, partly because traffickers have been designated terrorists by the US government. But Trump's critics argue the president is waging war without acquiring the authorization of Congress as is required by the Constitution and is infringing the victims' rights to due process.
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and fighter jet pilot, said on “State of the Union” that from what he knew about the attack, he would not have carried out the order to conduct a second strike. “If what has been reported is accurate, I have got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over. We are not Russia. We're not Iraq,” Kelly said. “They have tied themselves in knots trying to explain to us on the Armed Services Committee how this is legal, not sharing all of the information either, which is really troubling. But going after survivors in the water, that is clearly not lawful.”
    


            Kelly has been warned by the Pentagon that he could be called back into uniform for court-martial over a video he filmed with other Democratic lawmakers reminding military personnel they were not obligated to carry out illegal orders. The lawmakers have said Trump jeopardized their safety after he accused them of “seditious behavior, punishable by death.” He has since denied he was “threatening death” against the group.
    


            The House and Senate armed services committees have pledged to carry out rigorous oversight of the administration's operations in the Caribbean.
    


            Disquiet about the Trump administration's motives in Latin America is also being fed by an extraordinary announcement by the president that he plans to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, only a year into a 45-year federal prison sentence for drug trafficking. Hernández was found guilty of conspiring with cartels as they moved 400 tons of cocaine through Honduras to the US and of protecting and enriching drug traffickers in his inner circle.
    


            The president's pardoning of a leader who operated his country as a narco-state would severely undercut his rationale for using military force against Maduro — whom he accuses of the same offense.
    


            “He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in US courts. And less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco-trafficking,” Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” “If he doesn't care about narco-trafficking … then what is this Venezuela thing really about?”
    


            The president insisted to reporters Sunday that the conviction was a “Biden setup” and implied that no one who had served as a president should face justice for transgressions in office. “You take any country you want — if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life,” he said.
    


            Mullin said on “State of the Union” there was “probably a good-faith” gesture in the president's pardon offer, and that he trusted his “natural” approach to foreign affairs.
    


            The comparison of the due process previously offered by the United States to Hernández, who was convicted by a jury, to the fate of drug traffickers blown out of the Caribbean Sea, without officials apparently knowing their identities, is striking.
    


            The timing of Trump's pardon move suggests an alternative explanation, as it came just before Hondurans voted in a presidential election on Sunday. On Friday, Trump endorsed the populist outsider candidacy of Nasry “Tito” Asfura, who comes from the same conservative National Party as Hernández. His double intervention looks like an attempt to influence the elections, since he threatened in a Truth Social post that the US would not work with any other president but Asfura.
    


            This is far from the first time that Trump has tried to use his power and clout to support MAGA-like leaders in the Western Hemisphere. He slapped a 50% tariff on Brazil after it prosecuted his friend and former President Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overthrow an election. He offered a $40 billion bailout to Argentina, conditional on voters supporting the party of another ally, President Javier Milei, in the midterm elections. Trump has also allied himself with President Nayib Bukele, the leader of El Salvador, who accepted into a notorious prison deportees from the Trump administration's purge, and who bills himself as “the world's coolest dictator.” He has feuded with Colombia's leftist leader, President Gustavo Petro.
    


            There are legitimate foreign policy reasons why the United States might seek closer relations with Latin American leaders, especially as it aims to curtail influence-building efforts in the region by Russia and China. The question now preoccupying Latin America is whether Trump is willing to use the sword, not just executive power and taxpayer cash, to get the regime he wants in Venezuela.

President Donald Trump was mum on recent developments with Venezuela on Sunday, even after he declared its airspace “closed” and spoke with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump spoke to the press aboard Air Force One a day after he said the airspace over and around Venezuela is now “closed in its entirety,” a major escalation in the United States's pressure tactics on the regime.

However, Trump downplayed the move to reporters, saying “don't read anything” into his statement.

He was similarly silent on any details about his phone call with Maduro, which reportedly happened two weeks ago.

“I wouldn't say it went well, or badly. It was a phone call,” Trump said.

HEGSETH'S REPORTED ‘KILL EVERYBODY' ORDER IN DRUG BOAT STRIKE DRAWS SENATE SCRUTINY

Tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela have increased as the U.S. has amassed an armada in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on alleged drug boats departing from Venezuela. Those strikes have recently received scrutiny after a report that War Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a follow-up strike to kill two survivors of a September attack. Hegseth has denied the story, calling it “fabricated.”

The U.S. government also recently designated the “Cartel de los Soles,” a cartel linked to Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. The move gives the administration more ability to target the cartel with sanctions and block access to the U.S. banking system, though it doesn't automatically authorize lethal military force.

OpenAI on Monday announced it is taking an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, a company that was launched by one of its major investors, Thrive Capital, in April. 

The startup said it will embed engineering, research and product teams within Thrive Holdings' companies to help accelerate their AI adoption and boost cost efficiency. 

Thrive Holdings buys, owns and runs companies that it believes could benefit from technologies like artificial intelligence. It operates in sectors that are "core to the real economy," starting with accounting and IT services, according to its website. 

OpenAI, which is valued at $500 billion, did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.

"We are excited to extend our partnership with OpenAI to embed their frontier models, products, and services into sectors we believe have tremendous potential to benefit from technological innovation and adoption," Joshua Kushner, CEO and founder of Thrive Capital and Thrive Holdings, said in a statement. 

It's the latest example of OpenAI's circular dealmaking. 

In recent months, the company has taken stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave.

The partnership is structured in a way that aligns the incentives of OpenAI and Thrive Holdings long term, according to a person familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named because the details are private. 

If Thrive Holdings' companies succeed, the size of OpenAI's stake will grow.  

It also acts as a way for OpenAI to get compensated for its services, according to another person familiar with the agreement who declined to be named because the details are confidential. 

"This partnership with Thrive Holdings is about demonstrating what's possible when frontier AI research and deployment are rapidly deployed across entire organizations to revolutionize how businesses work and engage with customers," OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said in a statement. 

OpenAI also announced a collaboration with the consulting firm Accenture on Monday. 

The startup said its business offering, ChatGPT Enterprise, will roll out to "tens of thousands" of Accenture employees.

Artificial intelligence startup Runway on Monday announced Gen 4.5, a new video model that outperforms similar models from Google and OpenAI in an independent benchmark.

Gen 4.5 allows users to generate high-definition videos based on written prompts that describe the motion and action they want. Runway said the model is good at understanding physics, human motion, camera movements and cause and effect.

The model holds the No. 1 spot on the Video Arena leaderboard, which is maintained by the independent AI benchmarking and analysis company Artificial Analysis. To determine the text-to-video model rankings, people compare two different model outputs and vote for their favorite without knowing which companies are behind them.

Google's Veo 3 model holds second place on the leaderboard, and OpenAI's Sora 2 Pro model is in seventh place.  

"We managed to out-compete trillion-dollar companies with a team of 100 people," Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela told CNBC in an interview. "You can get to frontiers just by being extremely focused and diligent."

Runway was founded in 2018 and earned a spot on CNBC's Disruptor 50 list this year. It conducts AI research and builds video and world models, which are models that are trained on video and observational data to better reflect how the physical world works. 

The startup's customers include media organizations, studios, brands, designers, creatives and students. Its valuation has swelled to $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook. Runway's investors include General Atlantic, Baillie Gifford, Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures, among others.

Valenzuela said Gen 4.5 was codenamed "David" in a nod to the biblical story of David and Goliath. The model was "an overnight success that took like seven years," he said. 

"It does feel like a very interesting moment in time where the era of efficiency and research is upon us," Valenzuela said. "[We're] excited to be able to make sure that AI is not monopolized by two or three companies." 

Gen 4.5 is rolling out gradually, but it will be available to all of Runway's customers by the end of the week. Valenzuela said it's the first of several major releases that the company has in store.

"It will be available through Runway's platform, its application programming interface and through some of the company's partners," he said.

Corporate capital expenditures have surged in 2025, led by AI hyperscalers' sprawling infrastructure buildout, but JPMorgan says something odd is happening under the surface of the economy.

As companies across industries continue a spate of layoffs in 2025, some business leaders have continued to argue that AI will ultimately create new jobs. 

However, a recent JPMorgan analysis challenges this narrative. The bank's data reveals that tech companies' big capex isn't having much of an impact on the labor market. 

Spending and hiring are often correlated, as companies grow and require a larger labor force. Yet, as JPMorgan's outlook notes, 2025's capex boom has led to a "decoupling effect," in which the two have come apart.

The bank's 2026 economic outlook looks at why this "decoupling" is unfolding in developed markets and highlights why investors should be concerned.

"Across the DM hiring has weakened broadly and is tracking a 0.4%ar during 3Q25," the report said. "Outside COVID lockdowns, this pace is the slowest since the early phase of the post GFC recovery. A deceleration in labor demand of this magnitude is normally a warning signal."

The report includes even more data that may be troubling for investors. US payroll growth has fallen to 0.6% on an annualized basis. In previous years, whenever it has fallen to such a low level, a recession has followed.

JPMorgan's analysts said that the kind of economic decoupling they're tracking is extremely unusual, making it hard to account for in a full-year outlook.

"Accelerating capex amid a stall in job growth is hard to incorporate into the outlook. Such a juxtaposition is not evident over any US expansion in the past 60 years," the report added.

The bank added that while they expect the economy to demonstrate a continued resilience, its analysts have had to scale back their baseline forecast because historical precedent makes points to this kind of job-growth decline historically leading to a recession.

"This fear has shifted the Fed's risk bias toward labor market weakness and prompted the restart of its easing cycle," the report said.

The tempered outlook suggests that JPMorgan's analysts see recession signals flashing red, even as tech companies continue to spend heavily on AI.

Nvidia on Monday announced it has purchased $2 billion of Synopsys' common stock as part of a strategic partnership to accelerate computing and artificial intelligence engineering solutions.

As part of the multiyear partnership, Nvidia will help Synopsys accelerate its portfolio of compute-intensive applications, advance agentic AI engineering, expand cloud access and develop joint go-to-market initiatives, according to a release. Nvidia said it purchased Synopsys' stock at $414.79 per share.

"This is a huge deal," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Monday. "The partnership we're announcing today is about revolutionizing one of the most compute-intensive industries in the world: design and engineering." 

Synopsys stock climbed 4%. Nvidia shares rose 1%.

Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom because it makes the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that are key to building and training AI models and running large workloads. 

Synopsys offers services like silicon design and electronic design automation that help its customers build AI-powered products. 

CEO Sassine Ghazi told CNBC that its partnership with Nvidia will help it take workloads that used to run for weeks and reduce them to hours.

"We're going through a platform shift from classical, general-purpose computing running on CPUs to a new way of doing computing, accelerated computing running on GPUs," Huang said. "That old way of doing is going to continue to, to exist, of course, but the world is shifting to this new way of doing computing."

Nvidia and Synopsys have a long-standing relationship, so Monday's announcement builds on their existing partnership. 

Huang said Nvidia was "built on a foundation of design tools from Synopsys."

The partnership is not exclusive, which means that Nvidia and Synopsys can still work with other companies in the ecosystem.

Eli Lilly on Monday said it is lowering the cash prices of single-dose vials of its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound on its direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, building on efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the medicine more accessible.

The announcement also comes weeks after chief rival Novo Nordisk unveiled additional discounts on the cash prices of its obesity and diabetes drugs. 

Starting Monday, cash-paying patients with a valid prescription can get the starting dose of Zepbound vials for as low as $299 per month on LillyDirect, down from a previous price of $349 per month. They can also access the next dose, 5 milligrams, for $399 per month and all other doses for $449 per month, down from $499 per month across those sizes. 

Zepbound carries a list price of roughly $1,086 per month. That price point, and spotty insurance coverage for weight loss drugs in the U.S., have been significant barriers to access for some patients. 

Eli Lilly's announcement comes just weeks after President Donald Trump inked deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to make their GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to get and afford. The agreements will cut the prices the government pays for the drugs, introduce Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offer discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January, TrumpRx. 

But Eli Lilly's deal with Trump centers around lowering the prices of a different form of Zepbound – a multi-dose pen – after it wins Food and Drug Administration approval. 

That means Eli Lilly's Monday announcement around cutting prices on the existing single-dose vials could allow more patients to get discounted treatments more quickly. 

"We will keep working to provide more options — expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access — so more people can get the medicines they need," said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly USA and global customer capabilities, in a statement. 

With single-dose vials, patients need to use a syringe and needle to draw up the medicine and inject it into themselves. Eli Lilly first introduced that form of Zepbound in August 2024. 

It's unclear how many patients are currently using single-dose vials of Zepbound. But Eli Lilly previously said that direct-to-consumer sales now account for more than a third of new prescriptions of Zepbound. 

Novo Nordisk earlier this month lowered the price of its obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic for existing cash-paying patients to $349 per month from $499 per month. That excludes the highest dose of Ozempic. 

The company also launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment.

Intel stock fell Monday, sinking from a Friday surge when an analyst predicted the chip giant was nearing a deal to supply Apple in 2027. 

Shares of the chipmaker rose 10% on Friday after TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted on X that he expected Intel to begin shipping its lowest-end M processor to Apple as early as second or third quarter 2027. 

He said that his latest industry surveys indicate that "visibility on Intel becoming an advanced-node supplier to Apple has recently improved significantly."

Kuo added that the timeline of the partnership is contingent on the development process after Intel releases its process design kit — the blueprint from which Apple's engineers can build the chips — which is expected early 2026.

Apple's silicon chips for its iPhone, iPad and Mac products are currently supplied by TSMC.

In his post, Kuo played down the potential Intel-Apple partnership's impact on the Taiwanese chip maker, saying that Apple is expected to remain "highly dependent" on the company's advanced nodes for the "foreseeable future."

"In absolute terms, order volumes for the lowest-end M processor are relatively small and virtually no material impact on TSMC's fundamentals or its technology leadership over the next several years."

Kuo added a deal with Intel would signal strong support from Apple for the Trump administration's push for its homegrown companies to manufacture in the U.S.

Neither Intel nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment from CNBC.

Intel's stock has seen a resurgence over the past 12 months after years of decline. Share price fell as low as $17.66 in April, before recovering over the past few months.

"Apple is a potential major reference customer whose presence validates Intel's high-performance foundry offering," Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Global Equities, told CNBC.

"If Intel pulls it off, there is potential to win higher volume and value business from Apple, for example CPU production for the iPhone, and win business from other large chip designers."

Intel has had an up and down relationship with Apple since it first announced the chip giant's processors would power some products in 2005. The iPhone maker transitioned away from the company's processors at the start of the 2020s.

Last week Intel was on the subject of a lawsuit filed by TSMC, in which it alleged one of its former senior vice president had leaked "confidential information" to the company. Intel did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment at the time.

Shares of European aerospace giant Airbus fell as much as 10% on Monday, following reports the company has discovered an industrial quality issue regarding dozens of A320-family aircraft. 

The flaw, which is said to affect the aircraft's fuselage panels, is delaying some deliveries but there are no immediate indications that it has reached aircraft in service, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. 

In response, Airbus confirmed it had identified a quality issue regarding a "limited number" of A320 metal panels, saying the source of the issue has been "identified and contained." CNBC has contacted Airbus for comment. 

Paris-listed shares of Airbus plunged to the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index on the news. The stock was preliminarily 5.8% lower after the closing bell on Monday, paring losses from earlier in the session.

The latest report comes after Airbus said the vast majority of the roughly 6,000 A320-family aircraft impacted by a software glitch over the weekend had now received the necessary modifications.

In a statement published Monday, Airbus apologized for delays caused to passengers and airlines impacted by the software issue, which affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.

The directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.

American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which were both impacted by the Airbus recall, traded 0.2% lower and 0.3% higher, respectively. 

Meanwhile, shares of French aerospace and defense firm Thales, which supplied the flight system software to Airbus, were last seen down 2%.

Michael Burry is taking on a who's who of the world's biggest tech giants — and now he's picking a fight with Elon Musk.

The investor of "The Big Short" fame called Tesla "ridiculously overvalued" in a post on his Substack released late Sunday evening, after previously disclosing bets against Nvidia and Palantir.

"Tesla's market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time," Burry wrote, adding that he expects Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package to continue to dilute the company's shares.

"As an aside, the Elon cult was all-in on electric cars until competition showed up, then all-in on autonomous driving until competition showed up, and now is all-in on robots — until competition shows up," the legendary investor said.

It's not the first time Burry has taken aim at Tesla. The investor placed a bet against $530 million worth of Tesla shares in 2021 but exited the position a few months later, with Burry telling CNBC the move was "just a trade."

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's post.

Musk's EV maker is the latest tech giant to draw the investor's fire.

Burry, whose bet against the housing market in 2008 was famously depicted in "The Big Short" movie, has been outspoken in his belief that the current AI boom is a bubble.

Last month, he disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir and engaged in a war of words with both companies.

In a pivot, he deregistered his hedge fund in November and set up his Substack last week.

Burry is not the first to call Tesla overvalued. The company's shares trade at over 250 times its earnings, far higher than other carmakers, and fellow famed short-seller Jim Chanos also said in 2023 that Tesla was overvalued.

Despite a DOGE-related wobble at the start of the year, Tesla's shares are up 11% in 2025 as investors have cheered the company's robotaxi rollout.

Musk has hit out against Tesla's critics and short sellers, predicting that the EV maker will become the most valuable company on the planet.

The billionaire's $1 trillion pay package, which was approved by Tesla shareholders last month, is contingent on the company's market cap rising over the next decade to $8.5 trillion, nearly double the valuation of Nvidia.

The Cybertruck maker continues to dominate the EV market in the US, with around 41% market share as of August — but that number has fallen in recent years as competitors have rolled out more electric models.

Musk has said that Tesla's robotaxi and Optimus robot are the future of the company. But Tesla faces fierce competition there too, from companies like Google-backed Waymo and Chinese robotics startup Unitree.

Yesterday's classroom threat was: Use AI and you'll be caught.

Today's is: Don't use it, and you'll be obsolete.

As artificial intelligence becomes table stakes on Wall Street, business schools are racing to overhaul their programs for finance industry hopefuls. The technology is set to automate much of the work that has defined junior bankers' roles, including the rote tasks of building models or the endless tinkering of slide decks.

Across the country, universities are adding AI-focused courses, launching new majors, and retraining professors to prepare students for a world where algorithms handle the grunt work and humans provide the judgment.

Wharton, the famed business school at the University of Pennsylvania, is introducing a new academic track built around AI, offering students classes that fold in psychology, ethics, and governance to help them understand how humans and machines will reshape business. In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University is establishing a new College of Connected Computing to meet the moment. Nationwide, insiders say a debate is underway about how to update business-school curricula that have long centered on traditional finance fundamentals — like accounting, statistics, and financial modeling — as the advanced technology races past anyone's ability to keep up.

The push is to better prepare the next generation of Wall Street talent, as recruiters now prize candidates who have the human insight to interpret the outputs that AI produces, question a system's logic, and channel insights into cohesive strategies on deals.

Jacqueline Arthur, global head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, told Business Insider that, as AI becomes more commonplace, the firm has doubled down on efforts to probe candidates' analytical thinking. When meeting with students, the firm tries "to see how they think critically, react in the moment, and solve a problem," she said — essentially, the attributes that would make a human more valuable than a robot.

Business Insider spoke to leaders at educational institutions as well as bank-hiring executives to determine how the AI revolution is transforming what and how students learn as they prepare to embark on Wall Street careers.

About 10 years ago, Wharton, the famed business school at the University of Pennsylvania, became one of the first business schools to formally explore the potential of artificial intelligence. It launched a research center, enhancing its academic offerings, and partnering with corporations on real-life projects for its students.

Now, the school is taking that work into the classroom, rolling out new courses and an undergraduate and MBA academic track built around AI, Eric Bradlow, Wharton's vice dean of AI and analytics, told Business Insider.

New course offerings explore classes from interdisciplinary points of view, looking at how AI will change business and society from philosophical and psychological lenses. They include "Artificial Intelligence, Business, and Society," "Applied Machine Learning in Business," "Big Data, Big Responsibilities," and "AI in Our Lives," according to Wharton's online course listings. Classes combine quantitative analysis and lab-based data projects with coursework on ethics, governance, and behavioral responses to AI technologies; or case studies that unpack how humans and AI will work together to reshape organizations and the labor economy.

While some classes involve coding, training of large language models, or statistics, many also tie in elements of critical analysis to teach students how to validate the output of AI systems.

Students learn to query models, review results, and determine whether the underlying assumptions withstand business scrutiny. To accelerate the shift, Bradlow said, Wharton established an AI in Education Fund that provides faculty with funding, data, and technical support to integrate AI material into existing courses.

Six months ago, a tech executive at a large private-equity firm, Bradlow, sought recommendations for hires who could sit at the intersection of business strategy and data science.

"I said, 'We'll send you five names,' Bradlow told BI. "He hired every single one of them the next day."

Across the country, other schools besides Wharton are also catching the AI wave. One is Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, which recently announced the creation of a standalone college that will be dedicated to advanced technologies in AI, computing, data science, and robotics.

Though the school hasn't finalized its curricular programming, the College of Connected Computing is exploring where subjects overlap as part of its ongoing academic planning with Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management, the University told Business Insider in a statement.

"Our teams are actively developing opportunities that reflect the rapidly evolving role of data, AI, and analytics in business education," Vanderbilt added.

At the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, Steve Sibley, a professor who oversees the investment-banking workshop — a program that's sent students to leading banks including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Moelis — said faculty were exploring how to "pivot the curriculum" in light of AI's rise. The school is expanding the number of case-based classes it offers, he said, and exploring more coursework tied to AI and programming, such as Python for Finance and a graduate-level AI and Business class.

Training The Street, which provides technical training to banks and early-career finance professionals, has launched a series of free online resources on how to use AI and data tools in finance roles. Scott Rostan, the company's founder and chief learning and strategy officer, told Business Insider the tutorials are open to the public, underscoring the growing demand for AI training.

Recruiters say those changes mirror what Wall Street is looking for.

"Many of the tasks junior employees would have traditionally performed will over time be automated, but that will really enable them to focus their attention on higher-value deliverables," said Arthur, Goldman's human global human capital management head. Training programs at Goldman incorporate AI lessons, she added, with new-hire development including hands-on experience with the firm's internal AI tools as well as instruction on responsible use and continuous human oversight.

"Many of these quantitative analyses will be automated, but will we need our people to understand how to look at that and actually assess it and make sure that what the AI has delivered is actually right?" Arthur asked. "Absolutely."

All eyes are on Russia this week as talks over a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine shift to Moscow and step up a gear.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is travelling to Russia on Monday and is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for discussions on a U.S.-backed 19-point peace plan. 

Ukraine has tentatively supported the fledgling peace proposals, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it too can work with the framework agreement.

The latest plan is an amended version of an initial 28-point plan, reported several weeks ago, that had been devised by the U.S. and Moscow without Ukraine's involvement, and which favored Russia.

Russia will be eager to have its say on the amended proposals after a flurry of diplomacy and discussions between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in the last week and talks being in Florida on Sunday. 

Whether Putin will play ball when it comes to a new peace plan is a big unknown, however, with Russia feeling like it has both the advantage on the battlefield and U.S. President Donald Trump's ear when it comes to the outlines of a future peace deal. 

The Kremlin confirmed that Witkoff and Putin will meet on Tuesday.

Putin and Kremlin officials have reacted cautiously to the amended peace plan so far, signalling that Russia is ready to talk but that the war in Ukraine might not necessarily end soon.

"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements," Putin said during a trip to Kyrgyzstan. He added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement "into account" and that Moscow was ready for "serious discussions" with Witkoff. 

But Putin also praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting there would only stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas.

If they did not do so, Putin said, Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives of having full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted in analysis on Sunday that Russian military bloggers appear skeptical that Putin will compromise when it comes to his territorial demands on Ukraine.

"Russian information space voices continue to argue that the Kremlin will likely reject a ceasefire or any iteration of the U.S.-proposed peace plan because the Kremlin views these efforts as inconsequential and as a hindrance to Russia's goals in Ukraine and globally," ISW analysts noted Sunday.

The lead up to the latest diplomatic scramble for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia comes after some seesawing from the White House over its position on how the war should end and what concessions are needed in order for a ceasefire. 

President Trump has vacillated over his support for Ukraine and has appeared, at times, to support Russia's demands that Ukraine cede occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. He has then backtracked, stating that Kyiv's forces can win back all their land, muddying the waters as to where het stands on a peace settlement.

Following talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the process toward a peace deal was "delicate" and that Russia's position needed to be factored in to any deal.

He said the four-hour long talks — which included Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as a Ukrainian delegation headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Ustem Rumerov — had been productive but that more work was left to be done. 

"So much work remains, but today was, again, a very productive and useful session where I think additional progress was made," Rubio told reporters after the talks.

Hong Kong authorities said on Monday they had arrested 13 people for suspected manslaughter in a probe into the city's deadliest fire in decades, pointing to substandard renovation materials for fueling a blaze that has claimed at least 151 lives. Police continued to sweep the seven burnt-out towers engulfed in Wednesday's disaster at the Wang Fuk Court estate, finding bodies of residents in stairwells and on rooftops, trapped as they tried to flee the flames.

More than 40 people are still missing. "Some of the bodies have turned into ash, therefore we might not be able to locate all missing individuals," police official Tsang Shuk-yin told reporters, choking up with emotion. Tests on several samples of a green mesh that was wrapped around bamboo scaffolding on the buildings at the time of the blaze did not match fire-retardant standards, officials overseeing the investigations told a news conference.

Contractors working on the renovations used these substandard materials in hard-to-reach areas, effectively hiding them from inspectors, said Chief Secretary Eric Chan.

Foam insulation used by contractors also fanned the flames and fire alarms at the complex were not working properly, officials have said. Thousands have turned out to pay tribute to the victims, who include at least nine domestic helpers from Indonesia and one from the Philippines, with lines of mourners stretching more than a kilometer (a half-mile) along a canal next to the estate.

Vigils are also due to take place this week in Tokyo, London and Taipei, authorities said. Amid pockets of public anger over missed fire risk warnings, Beijing has warned it would crack down on any "anti-China" protests. At least one person involved in a petition calling for an independent probe and a review of construction oversight among other demands was detained for around two days, sources familiar with the matter said. Police have declined to comment on the case. Hong Kong Security Chief Chris Tang also declined to comment on specific operations at a press conference on Monday.

"I've noticed that some people with malicious intent, aiming to harm Hong Kong and national security, have taken advantage of this painful moment for society," he said.

"Therefore, we must take appropriate action, including enforcement measures."

The buildings being scoured for remains are the worst damaged and the search may take weeks, authorities have said.

Images shared by police showed officers clad in hazmat suits, face masks and helmets, inspecting rooms with blackened walls and furniture reduced to ashes, and wading through water used to douse fires that raged for days.

Throngs of officers arrived at the site early on Monday morning to continue their search of the burnt-out buildings.

The apartment blocks were home to more than 4,000 people, according to census data, and those who escaped must now try to get their lives back on track.

More than 1,100 people have been moved out of evacuation centers into temporary housing, with a further 680 put up in youth hostels and hotels, authorities said.

With many residents leaving behind belongings as they fled, authorities have offered emergency funds of HK$10,000 ($1,284) to each household and provided special assistance for issuing new identity cards, passports and marriage certificates.

Residents of Wang Fuk Court were told by authorities last year they faced "relatively low fire risks" after complaining about fire hazards posed by the renovations, the city's Labour Department said.

The residents raised concerns in September 2024, including about the potential flammability of the mesh contractors used to cover the scaffolding, a department spokesperson said.

Hong Kong's deadliest fire since 1948, when 176 people died in a warehouse blaze, has stunned the city, where legislative elections are due to be held this weekend.

On Saturday, police detained Miles Kwan, 24, part of a group that launched a petition demanding an independent probe into possible corruption and a review of construction oversight, two people familiar with the matter said. Reuters could not establish whether he had been arrested.

Kwan left a police station in a taxi on Monday afternoon, according to a Reuters witness.

Two others have also since been arrested on suspicion of seditious intent, the South China Morning Post said. The police declined to comment on those reported arrests.

China's national security office warned individuals on Saturday against using the disaster to "plunge Hong Kong back into the chaos" of 2019, when massive pro-democracy protests challenged Beijing and triggered a political crisis.

"We sternly warn the anti-China disruptors who attempt to 'disrupt Hong Kong through disaster'," the office said in a statement. "No matter what methods you use, you will certainly be held accountable and strictly punished."

Business Insider Edition 

Sudan and Russia have resumed discussions over a deal under which Moscow would provide Su-30 and Su-35 fighter jets in exchange for rights to a naval logistics facility on the Red Sea.


        The Sudanese Defence Ministry is reportedly in talks with Russia to acquire Su-30 and Su-35 fighter aircraft, which would be provided in exchange for rights to build a major naval facility on the Red Sea, according to Military Watch Magazine.



        The development comes as Russia pushes to establish a permanent naval base in Africa, while Sudan seeks additional weapons for its ongoing conflict, despite repeated calls for a ceasefire from Western powers, particularly the United States.
    


        Plans to procure Su-35 fighter jets were first reported in late 2017, following a visit to Moscow by then-President Omar al-Bashir. 
    


        Those plans were disrupted after his government was overthrown in early 2019 amid riots and a Western-backed coup. 
    


        The current discussions are seen as a renegotiation of a long-delayed agreement originally reached in 2020, which had been postponed due to political instability and, later, by the outbreak of war in Sudan.
    


        In November, Business Insider Africa reported that Russia's long-planned naval base in Port Sudan, its first permanent foothold in Africa since the Soviet era, has been suspended indefinitely due to the ongoing civil war. 
    


        Russian Ambassador to Sudan Andrey Chernovol confirmed the pause, saying: “Given the current military conflict, movement on this issue has for now been halted.”
    


        The report also noted that Russia had formally stepped back from active construction planning, prompting a reassessment of the deal rather than its cancellation.
    


        Under the original agreement, Russia would have been allowed to establish a logistics hub at Port Sudan, capable of hosting up to four warships and about 300 personnel. 
    


        The deal also granted Moscow the right to bring in weapons, ammunition, air-defence systems and electronic warfare equipment to support naval operations.
    


The location on the Red Sea would place the facility near the Suez Canal, a major global shipping route that carries about 10 percent of worldwide maritime trade.
    


        Russia's fighter exports in Africa have increased in 2025. Deliveries of Su-35 jets to Algeria began earlier this year, while leaked documents in October indicated additional sales to Iran and Ethiopia. The Su-30 aircraft is also in service with the air forces of Algeria, Ethiopia, Angola and Uganda.
    


        Sudan's northern neighbour Egypt previously ordered Su-35 jets in 2018 but cancelled the deal under Western political and economic pressure.
    


        However, Russia has not publicly documented a deal exactly like the proposed Sudan arrangement, where fighter aircraft would be supplied in exchange for rights to build and operate a naval base.
    


        The Sudan case appears to be a rare instance of linking advanced combat aircraft supply directly to overseas military basing rights, reflecting Russia's strategic interest in securing a foothold on the Red Sea.
    


        The outcome of the renewed negotiations remains uncertain and will depend on security conditions and the final terms agreed by both sides, even as the Rapid Support Forces have reportedly expressed support for a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, which has not yet been accepted by the Sudanese Armed Forces.

Oil prices rose about 1% on Monday as the Caspian Pipeline Consortium halted exports after a major drone attack and U.S.-Venezuela tensions raised concerns about supply, while OPEC+ agreed to leave oil output levels unchanged for the first quarter of 2026.

Brent crude futures advanced 57 cents, or 0.91%, to $62.95 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 56 cents, or 0.96%, to $59.11.

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which carries 1% of global oil, on Saturday said it halted operations after a mooring at its Russian terminal on the Black Sea was damaged by a Ukrainian drone. Chevron, a CPC shareholder, said late on Sunday that loadings were continuing at the Russian port of Novorossiysk.

The attacks on the CPC export terminal drove oil prices higher on the back of reduced export volumes, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

Ukraine has also attacked two oil tankers, which were heading to Novorossiysk.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies initially agreed on a pause in early November, slowing a push to regain market share with looming fears of a supply glut.

LSEG senior analyst Anh Pham said the market was reacting positively to the news.

"For some time, the narrative has centred on an oil glut, so OPEC+'s decision to maintain its production target provided some relief and helped stabilise expectations for supply growth in the coming months."

Brent and WTI crude futures settled lower on Friday for the fourth straight month, their longest losing streak since 2023, as expectations for higher global supply weighed on prices.

On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump said "the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela" should be considered closed, sparking fresh uncertainty in the oil market, as the South American nation is a major producer.

Trump on Sunday said he had spoken to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro but did not give details.

London, United Kingdom, Dec.  01, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For years, artificial intelligence computing power has been the domain of large technology companies, top research labs, and institutions with massive data centers. Now, JDH AI (JDH WEALTH LTD), a UK-based fintech innovation company, has announced the upcoming launch of its AI-powered digital asset management platform. JDH AI  aims to combine AI and blockchain technologies, marking a new chapter in smart finance—the fusion of AI automation, blockchain transparency, and sustainable computing—aimed at empowering digital investors in the global cryptocurrency market.

Driven by the rapid development of artificial intelligence, large-scale models, blockchain, and the metaverse, computing power has become a new carrier of digital assets, and the global demand for GPU computing power continues to grow. Industry analysis shows that computing power has transformed from "behind-the-scenes technical support" into a core resource for enterprises and individuals, and its value is even regarded as "digital gold." JDHAI has seized this trend and launched a "computing power as an asset" model, allowing users to participate in the global computing power network without hardware investment, thereby obtaining transparent and stable daily computing power revenue.



Since its inception in 2015, JDHAI has been dedicated to providing technology-driven long-term asset allocation solutions for institutional and high-net-worth clients. Unlike traditional financial investments, JDHAI focuses on high-performance computing (HPC) and GPU cluster infrastructure to support the development of artificial intelligence, big data analytics, blockchain, and cloud computing ecosystems.

The JDHAI platform currently supports a variety of mainstream cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC), providing secure and transparent services to users worldwide.
		



This app allows users to view earnings progress, manage contracts, and adjust basic settings in real time on their mobile phones. Whether commuting, during work breaks, or in daily life, the earnings system runs automatically in the background, providing continuous earnings without any additional effort.

A representative from the platform stated that the purpose of launching the mobile application is to enable users unfamiliar with Web3 to smoothly enter the field of crypto finance, making computing power revenue more accessible and usable, rather than just a domain for professionals.

Is the bloodshed over for crypto markets? Not quite, given that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major coins are all deep in the red to start the new week—but at least crypto funds finished November strong, putting up positive flows last week to break a recent losing streak.

Digital asset exchange-traded products experienced a significant reversal with $1.07 billion in inflows last week, according to data from CoinShares, following four consecutive weeks of substantial outflows totaling $5.7 billion.

Bitcoin ETFs attracted $464 million in inflows last week, while Ethereum funds saw $309 million and XRP recorded its largest weekly inflows ever at $289 million.

XRP's recent six-week inflow streak represents 29% of its assets under management, likely linked to new US ETF launches. Conversely, Cardano experienced outflows of $19.3 million, representing 23% of its total assets held in crypto funds.

The United States dominated inflows with $994 million, while Canada contributed $97.6 million and Switzerland added $23.6 million. Germany was a notable outlier with outflows of $57.3 million. Trading volumes remained subdued at $24 billion due to the Thanksgiving holiday, contrasting sharply with the previous week's record $56 billion.

The price of Bitcoin rebounded last week, rising above $90,000 ahead of the holiday and holding that level through much of the weekend. The improved market sentiment last week was driven in part by comments from FOMC member John Williams regarding restrictive monetary policy, CoinShares said, raising expectations for a potential interest rate cut in December.

But the renewed optimism in crypto markets didn't last into the new week, with prices plunging late Sunday as losses accelerated overnight.

Bitcoin was recently priced at $84,917, showing a 7% drop over the last day, while assets like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are all showing deeper daily losses.

Bitcoin treasury play Strategy (MSTR) slid 11% to its lowest level since October 2024 after revealing a new $1.44 billion cash reserve and slashing its 2025 profit outlook.

Other crypto treasury bets also slumped. American depositary receipts of Metaplanet (MTPLF), a Japan-listed corporate BTC holder, declined 10%, while KindlyMD (NAKA) fell 9.9% and American Bitcoin (ABTC) lost 6.7%. Ether-focused BitMine (BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (SBET) slumped more than 10%, while Solana-centric companies DeFi Development (DFDV) and Solana Company (HSDT) also suffered double-digit  losses.

The Nasdaq, meanwhile, dropped almost 1% in the early minutes of the session, and the S&P 500 Index fell 0.3%.

The sector-wide pullback came amid renewed interest-rate hike signals from the Bank of Japan, catching many traders flat-footed, said Paul Howard, senior director at trading firm Wincent.

"The potential rate hike news from BoJ took many in the markets by surprise and led to a pulldown in risk assets generally overnight," Howard said in a Telegram message. "Cryptocurrency continues to be the risk-on asset class and a bellwether of macro-economic events 24/7."

Cryptomixer, a cryptocurrency-mixing service allegedly used by cybercriminals to launder illicit bitcoin BTC$86,563.37, has been dismantled in a coordinated law-enforcement operation in Zurich, European Union (EU) law-enforcement agency Europol said on Monday. 

The takedown, carried out Nov. 24–28 by Swiss and German police alongside Europol, resulted in the seizure of three servers, the cryptomixer.io domain, more than 25 million euros ($29 million) in bitcoin and over 12 terabytes of data.

The authorities said Cryptomixer has facilitated more than 1.3 billion euros in bitcoin laundering since 2016. Its long settlement windows and randomized distribution patterns made it a preferred tool for obfuscating proceeds from drug trafficking, weapons sales, ransomware attacks and payment-card fraud, they said.

Crypto mixers are services that pool and redistribute user funds to obscure their origin. While mixers claim to offer privacy, they are also popular as laundering tools for ransomware gangs, dark web markets and other cybercriminals. 

By breaking the onchain transaction trail, mixers allow crypto whose provenance cannot be traced to be sent to exchanges and converted into other assets or fiat. High-profile examples include Tornado Cash, whose operators were sanctioned and prosecuted for enabling billions in illicit flows.

Europol supported the takedown through forensic analysis and coordination, marking another major mixer shutdown following its role in the 2023 ChipMixer operation, the agency said in the announcement.

The top crypto may be flashing bear-market signals, but its fastest Layer-2, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), is showing the exact opposite trend.

Bitcoin Hyper's ICO has climbed to nearly $29 million, with momentum suggesting it could break that level within hours. That's happening even as Bitcoin itself slipped back to $85,000 on Monday after briefly reclaiming $91,000 last week.

The drop was triggered by heavy liquidations, with roughly $646 million in leveraged positions wiped out during early Asia trading, adding fuel to an already bearish technical backdrop.

Investors backing Bitcoin Hyper believe it can unlock a new layer of demand for BTC – driven by day-to-day utility instead of passive holding. To them, this may be the catalyst that finally stabilizes Bitcoin's economic role and places it in the same class as long-standing monetary assets, such as gold.

For now, HYPER remains available at $0.013355 per token for the next eight hours, after which the presale will advance to a higher pricing tier.

Bitcoin's sharp drop to the mid-$80,000s on Monday was triggered by a slew of forced liquidations that swept through the market during early Asia trading. 

More than $646 million in leveraged positions were wiped out within hours, accelerating BTC's decline and shaking investor sentiment that had only recently stabilized above $91,000. 

The sell-off pushed funding rates into negative territory and forced derivatives traders to unwind positions at a rapid pace, thereby deepening intraday volatility. The cascade came as global risk appetite weakened, with traders pulling back from high-beta assets following increased rate-hike expectations in Japan and a broader shift toward safer positions.

Adding to the unease, a widely watched technical indicator has just flashed a major bearish signal. A new chart shared by analyst Northstar Charts highlights that Bitcoin's monthly MACD has confirmed a “bear cross,” which has historically preceded deeper market downturns.

In both 2018 and 2022, the same MACD cross was followed by prolonged Bitcoin bear markets marked by multi-month declines. The latest crossover mirrors those past signals, suggesting that BTC may not be done correcting and could be entering a broader cooling phase unless buyers step in aggressively.

While MACD trends don't guarantee outcomes, they often reflect weakening long-term momentum, and in this case, the timing aligns with rising liquidations, ETF outflows, and fading macro risk appetite.

Yet amid Bitcoin's weakness, one project is moving in the opposite direction. Bitcoin Hyper, the fastest Layer-2 under development, is now closing in on the $29 million funding mark as investors double down on its long-term vision.

The demand Bitcoin Hyper aims to unlock comes from something Bitcoin has never had: an environment where BTC functions as currency and not just an asset that sits in cold storage.

Bitcoin's base layer was intentionally designed this way. Its scripting language is non–Turing complete, meaning it cannot run complex applications, which is a deliberate trade-off by Satoshi to minimize attack vectors, simplify consensus, and prevent catastrophic bugs. 

This design choice is what makes Bitcoin the most secure settlement layer in existence, but it also limits its ability to support high-throughput economic activity.

Solana, by contrast, delivers the speed and low-cost execution developers need for modern applications – DeFi, gaming, payments, social apps. Still, with roughly over 865 active validators (at least in the past 224 hours), it does not approach Bitcoin's far broader decentralization or its unmatched settlement security.

Bitcoin Hyper bridges these two worlds.

Applications are built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), but settlement and finality anchor back to Bitcoin. Through a canonical bridge, BTC is locked on the base layer, and a wrapped version is minted inside the Bitcoin Hyper execution environment, allowing wrapped BTC to move freely across SVM-powered apps.

The result is that BTC, which was previously static, can now flow through an ecosystem where it is the default currency for every application.

And with its latest upgrade, the team shared performance benchmarks validating how Bitcoin Hyper can deliver real-time app performance while still anchoring reliably to Bitcoin L1.

Performance defines what's possible. ⚡️

Bitcoin Hyper is benchmarking how to deliver Solana-grade throughput on a Bitcoin-anchored SVM rollup—balancing speed, cost, and security with real data, not hype.

If this ecosystem gains traction, even a small percentage of Bitcoin's supply flowing into Bitcoin Hyper would translate into billions of dollars of active, utility-driven BTC, something the Bitcoin network has never seen in its 16-year history. That prospect is exactly why investors are paying attention.

Now, backing for the project has been nothing short of explosive. Since the presale began, support has been explosive, and for two straight months, solo whales have stepped in with massive individual buys, each accumulating huge HYPER positions.

One whale bought $833,000 worth in October, while another snapped up nearly $500,000 worth last month.

These investors clearly understand the role HYPER plays in the ecosystem. Just as ETH powers execution on Ethereum, HYPER is the token that pays for gas fees, fuels transactions across the SVM-powered environment, and secures the network through staking.

What this means is that as the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem scales – and as more applications rely on wrapped BTC for real economic activity – demand for HYPER should scale alongside it. 

And investors see the dual-growth effect: BTC gains a new utility demand source, and HYPER becomes the indispensable asset that makes that system function.

One asset becomes the medium of exchange; the other becomes the engine powering the entire economy.

To get HYPER while there's still time, head to the Bitcoin Hyper presale website and purchase using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. 

Bitcoin Hyper recommends using Best Wallet, which is considered the best crypto and Bitcoin wallet available. HYPER is listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

Best Wallet is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

Trust Stamp introduces StableKey to prevent violent crypto-related home invasions by binding digital assets to biometric identities.

Trust Stamp has introduced a Turnkey Solution aimed at addressing the increasing threat of violent home invasions targeting cryptocurrency holders, exemplified by a recent San Francisco incident where a homeowner was forced to transfer $11 million in crypto. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the digital asset ecosystem, allowing criminals to coerce victims into unauthorized fund transfers that are often unrecoverable. Trust Stamp's solution integrates StableKey, a patented technology that cryptographically ties digital assets to their rightful owners using biometric markers, rendering forced transfers ineffective for attackers. This technology aims to shift the focus in the crypto industry from protecting key security to prioritizing the safety of individuals. John Bridge, Trust Stamp's President of GovTech, emphasized the need for this innovation as the prevalence of stablecoins increases, urging stakeholders to address these risks robustly.

Trust Stamp's Turnkey Solution utilizes its patented StableKey technology to prevent violent crypto-focused home invasions by binding digital assets to their rightful owners.

StableKey cryptographically binds digital assets to the biometric identity of their owners, making forced transfers worthless to attackers.

Home invasions targeting cryptocurrency holders are on the rise due to vulnerabilities in the digital-asset ecosystem that criminals exploit.

StableKey protects various digital assets, including stablecoins, tokenized deposits, CBDCs, and NFTs, from forced transfers.

Law enforcement, regulators, and insurers should be concerned about the rising threats of crypto-focused home invasions and the implications for coverage.

  ATLANTA, GA, Dec.  01, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trust Stamp announced a Turnkey Solution to Violent Crypto-Focused Home Invasions and “Wrench Attacks.” A recent attack in San Francisco, where a criminal posing as a delivery driver tied up a homeowner and forced an $11 million crypto transfer, has highlighted a growing wave of home invasions involving kidnappings, beatings, and even torture. The home invasions target cryptocurrency holders exploiting a fatal flaw in today's digital-asset ecosystem: criminals can physically coerce victims into transferring funds, and once the assets move, they are often irrecoverable.
 


  Global cases, including, demonstrate that traditional wallet security fails when a victim is forced, at gunpoint or worse, to authorize a transfer.
 


  Today, Trust Stamp explained how this rising threat can be prevented through the integration of StableKey, the company's patented quantum-ready embedded-identity algorithm, which cryptographically binds a digital asset to its rightful owner, rendering forced transfers worthless to attackers without creating a link to their own biometric identity.
 


  Trust Stamp's StableKey technology introduces a breakthrough: digital assets, including stablecoins, tokenized deposits, CBDCs, NFTs, and other on-chain instruments, can be embedded with cryptographic identity binding, ensuring that the ownership of an asset is tied to an irreversibly transformed biometric marker of the rightful owner.
 


  John Bridge, Trust Stamp's President of GovTech and former Chief Inspector of the Financial Surveillance Unit of the United States Marshals Service commented, "The crypto industry has focused on protecting keys, versus people. StableKey transforms stablecoins and other digital assets from bearer instruments into privacy-protected yet ownership-bound instruments. With embedded identity, it is pointless for a criminal to force a victim to transfer value that they cannot later unlock. As stablecoins proliferate, this grave risk needs to be addressed not just by law enforcement and regulators but also by insurers who would arguably be justified in refusing coverage for irrecoverable digital assets.”

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the Ethereum-centric crypto treasury firm helmed by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, said on Monday it acquired 96,798 in ether ETH$2,842.79 through last week continuing its buying spree while digital asset treasuries remain under pressure due to falling crypto prices.

The latest purchase lifted the firm's total ETH holdings to 3.73 million tokens, worth about $10.5 billion at the latest prices, extending its lead as the largest Ethereum treasury company. The firm also holds 192 bitcoin BTC$86,563.37, a $36 million stake in Eightco Holdings (ORBS) and $882 million in cash.

BitMine's shares were down 7.7% pre-market as ETH plunged 6% overnight to just above $2,800.

Digital asset treasuries, or DATs, are feeling the heat as falling crypto prices and slipping stock valuations have pushed many into retreat. Most have stopped adding to their crypto piles while some have even started selling, aiming to close the gap between their stock price and net asset value.

BitMine remained one of the few firms that kept buying. However, the firm is estimated to be sitting on nearly $4 billion in unrealized losses on its ETH stash.

Upcoming Ethereum upgrade, Fed policy 

Thomas Lee, BitMine's pointed to market conditions and Ethereum's upcoming network upgrade as key motivators to increase the pace of acquisitions from the previous week. The Fusaka upgrade, expected to activate on December 3, is designed to improve scalability, security and usability on the Ethereum network.

Speaking of the macro context, Lee said that the Federal Reserve is expected to halt quantitative tightening (QT) this month and will likely cut interest rates on the December meeting, while crypto markets stabilized since the October 10th crash.

"Collectively, we see these acting as positive tailwinds for ETH prices and thus, we stepped up our weekly purchases of ETH by 39%," he said in a statement.

B2B crypto payments already account for 25% of global transaction volume, with a significant share coming from FX and CFD firms. In the FX and CFD industry, cryptocurrency is increasingly used — for deposits, partner payouts, B2B settlements, client fund management, and working with marketing and contractors. But there's a problem that's rarely discussed publicly: all crypto operations on public blockchains are fully transparent. For financial companies operating in highly competitive environments with strict regulatory obligations, this transparency poses a direct risk.

In this article, the BitHide team breaks down how business operations are “read” on the blockchain, why traditional privacy schemes (mixers, privacy coins) no longer work, and what technologies allow Forex brokers and fintech companies to work with crypto transactions confidentially and securely while maintaining AML compliance.

Once a company starts using crypto without a privacy-aware architecture, its financial activity becomes partially exposed to anyone with access to a blockchain explorer.

Below is a breakdown of the insights that can be reconstructed from on-chain data alone, even without breaching any systems.

By correlating incoming and outgoing amounts, frequency of transfers, and balance fluctuations on key addresses, an analyst can approximate a company's turnover, liquidity buffers, and operational activity cycles. Brokers and finance companies, whose revenue correlates directly with client volumes, are particularly exposed: predictable flows may reveal market activity peaks, payout schedules, or even liquidity stress.

Transaction origins and preferred networks (TRON, Ethereum, or BNB Chain) often reveal where a company operates. If a broker frequently interacts with Asian exchanges or regional OTC desks, it provides indirect evidence of the distribution of its client base. Combined with timestamp patterns, an observer can infer operating hours, regional hubs, or the location of back-office operations.

Repeated transfers between the same sets of addresses allow clustering algorithms to detect commercial relationships. On-chain metadata from DeFi platforms or service contracts can accidentally expose vendor names, liquidity providers, marketing partners, or payout infrastructure. Even if internal addresses change frequently, behavioural similarity exposes the underlying connection.

Outgoing transactions to known fund addresses, OTC aggregation wallets, or institutional custodial services may expose investment rounds, treasury diversification, hedging strategies, or lending operations. Finance companies managing client funds on-chain are especially vulnerable — their treasury decisions can be inferred long before any public disclosure.

Payroll has one of the most recognisable on-chain signatures: recurring transfers of fixed or quasi-fixed amounts on a predictable schedule. Clustering methods quickly detect payout groups, allowing estimation of staff count, contractor networks, and even seniority levels (via compensation patterns).

Large, infrequently used wallets that regularly accumulate excess funds are easily classified as reserves or treasury addresses. Even if a company uses several such wallets, clustering models combine them into one logical pool.

For FX and CFD companies regulated by authorities such as CySEC, the FCA (UK Financial Conduct Authority), ASIC, and MFSA, operational confidentiality must coexist with strict transparency standards. These regulators expect firms to maintain verifiable audit trails, comply with AML directives (including EU AMLD5/AMLD6), and ensure the traceability of client funds under rules like MiFID II.

A similar regulatory stance exists in the United States. For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury stated as early as 2023 that financial companies are prohibited from using infrastructure that renders transactions irreversibly opaque — specifically referring to mixers and privacy-enhancing tools flagged as incompatible with AML requirements. The same year, Consensys, the developer of MetaMask, publicly confirmed that its default RPC provider Infura records users' IP addresses, a policy later formalized in its updated privacy disclosure.

Taken together, these global regulatory expectations have given rise to a new paradigm: managed confidentiality. Rather than attempting full secrecy, an approach incompatible with AML frameworks, managed confidentiality shields sensitive operational data on public blockchains while preserving provable legitimacy for regulators.

BitHide is a non-custodial confidential wallet used by Forex brokers, payment service providers (PSP), IT and fintech companies working with high-volume crypto operations.

BitHide's architecture is built around its proprietary Dark Wing technology, a network-level privacy layer that masks real IP addresses and metadata before any transaction reaches public nodes. Now they introduced Transaction Safety Levels — a payout framework that lets companies choose their preferred level of transaction confidentiality. This technology protects companies from malicious actors, competitors, and hackers attempting to trace operations or link addresses.

The wallet's real IP address is changed using BitHide's proprietary Dark Wing technology, protecting infrastructure and preventing metadata leaks.

IP addresses protection with Dark Wing, combined with funds aggregated on a transit address. This prevents third parties from tracking business flow structures or operational patterns, strengthening overall confidentiality.

Funds are aggregated on a transit address, undergo Dark Wing IP address rotation, AML screening, pass through secure conversion, and are forwarded to the recipient. As with traditional bank transfers, the recipient cannot see your crypto address or internal data. This approach allows companies to protect their sensitive business information while remaining fully compliant with regulatory requirements.



Corporate privacy on public blockchains is both a technical challenge and an emerging regulatory requirement. With proper architectural controls, businesses can rely on public networks without exposing financial flows, internal structure, or counterparty activity to fraudsters or competitors. As standards continue to evolve, privacy layers for businesses are poised to become as common as firewalls, VPNs, or network segmentation in traditional IT security.

Today, public blockchains resemble documents published for everyone on the internet; the goal for institutional finance is to transform them into controlled-access records, accessible only to authorized participants. Managed confidentiality is the path toward achieving that balance.

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American: SGN) announced that BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with the SEC for the proposed business combination with One Blockchain LLC and the planned listing of BlockchAIn common shares on NYSE American under the ticker AIB.

One Blockchain operates a 40 MW South Carolina data center that generated approximately $22.9 million in revenue and $5.7 million in net income in 2024. The Registration Statement is preliminary and has not been declared effective; additional proxy/prospectus materials will follow.

Filing of Form S-4 advances the proposed SPAC-style business combination but completion remains conditional.

BlockchAIn filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to register shares for the proposed combination of Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain and a listing under the ticker "AIB". The filing formalizes the transaction mechanics and begins the public disclosure and shareholder-vote process.

The combination links a recruitment platform with a digital infrastructure operator that reported $22.9 million in 2024 revenue and $5.7 million in 2024 net income for its 40 MW facility. Key dependencies include SEC effectiveness of the Registration Statement, holder approvals, NYSE American clearance, and access to sufficient funding to operate post-combination.

Watch for the SEC declaring the Registration Statement effective, the definitive proxy/prospectus mailing, the shareholder vote timeline, and any disclosed financing terms; these milestones form the near-term decision points for completion and listing.

SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Dec.  01, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Signing Day Sports, Inc. (“Signing Day Sports” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: SGN), the developer of the Signing Day Sports app and platform dedicated to improving the recruiting process for high school athletes and college coaches, today announced the public filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc. (“BlockchAIn”), a newly formed Delaware corporation created for the purpose of consummating the Company's previously announced business combination with One Blockchain LLC (“One Blockchain”). The filing follows the Company's confidential submissions of drafts of the Registration Statement with the SEC on July 8, 2025, August 28, 2025, and September 24, 2025.

As previously disclosed, on May 27, 2025, Signing Day Sports entered into a Business Combination Agreement with BlockchAIn, One Blockchain, and certain other parties, as amended on November 10, 2025. The Registration Statement provides information on the proposed business combination and listing of BlockchAIn common shares on the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American”) under the ticker symbol “AIB.” 

“Today marks an important milestone in our progress toward completing the business combination with One Blockchain and launching BlockchAIn as a publicly traded company,” said Daniel Nelson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Signing Day Sports. “Filing the Registration Statement reflects the coordinated effort, preparation, and discipline shown by both organizations throughout this process. From the beginning, it has been clear that this combination is a strategic alignment of vision and long-term objectives. Our teams have worked together with a shared sense of purpose, ensuring that each step has been executed thoroughly and on schedule.”

“Looking ahead, we believe the combined company will be well-positioned to leverage Signing Day Sports' technology-driven recruitment platform alongside One Blockchain's digital infrastructure and high-performance computing resources. This structure will provide greater financial flexibility and broader technical capabilities. It also gives us the ability to pursue scalable growth initiatives that were previously out of reach.”

“The transaction further enables us to accelerate innovation across our platform and enhance the tools we offer to student-athletes and coaches. It creates opportunities to expand into new markets and partnerships. With our anticipated improved operational capacity and access to the public markets, we are confident in our ability to advance key initiatives, strengthen our competitive position, and create long-term value for shareholders.”

“I am incredibly proud of the diligence and collaboration that have brought us to this point, and we remain focused on completing this transformative transaction and executing on the opportunities that lie ahead,” concluded Nelson.

Last month, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) launched a consultation on its new Data Protection Enforcement Procedural Guidance. This guidance is intended to replace the ICO's Regulatory Action Policy (RAP), which was first issued in November 2018, and will sit alongside the ICO's Data Protection Fining Guidance (updated in March 2024). 

Overview

The consultation and draft guidance mark a shift from the high-level approach set out in the RAP. It sets out in greater detail how the ICO will exercise its investigatory and enforcement powers, including its new investigatory powers introduced under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA). The guidance covers the processes for existing powers such as opening investigations, issuing warnings, reprimands, enforcement notices, and penalty notices but also introduces a structured settlement procedure and clarifies rights of appeal.

According to the ICO: 

“The purpose of the new draft guidance is to provide organisations with more detail about our approach to give greater transparency and certainty about how we use our investigatory and enforcement powers.”

The ICO consultation seeks stakeholder feedback on the draft procedural guidance and has asked them to comment on the processes outlined within it. The consultation period runs for almost 12 weeks and closes on 23 January 2026, with final guidance expected later next year.

Scope and underlying principles

The draft guidance is primarily aimed at organisations that process personal data within the scope of the UK GDPR and DPA 2018 (i.e. controllers and processors). However, it may be of wider interest to those seeking to understand how the ICO uses its statutory powers to investigate and enforce compliance with data protection legislation. 

It explains that the ICO's investigatory and enforcement powers include:

The guidance and any regulatory decision is underscored by the ICO's principal objective to 

“secure an appropriate level of protection for personal data, having regard to the interests of data subjects, controllers and others and matters of general public interest; and 

promote public trust and confidence in the processing of personal data”.

Importantly, the guidance is not a definitive statement of law but sets out the ICO's general approach. It is designed to be flexible, allowing departures where justified, provided the ICO acts fairly and reasonably.

The ICO notes that it does not explain the process followed for prosecuting criminal offences beyond its information-gathering powers – for more information on this, see their prosecution policy statement.

What's changing?

Some of the key differences between the RAP and the new draft guidance include:

1. Procedural Detail

The RAP presented a high-level policy framework which emphasised deterrence, consistency and proportionality, with sections on aims, objectives, hierarchy of regulatory action, and statutory guidance. 

In comparison, the new draft guidance provides a much more procedural manual with detailed step-by-step processes for enforcement actions such as investigations, notices, settlements, and appeals. The guidance also sets out some of the factors it will consider when making decisions - for example, when deciding whether to open an investigation and what action to take, the ICO will generally consider a number of factors including:

the risk of harm to people caused by the processing operations (with reference, where appropriate, to the ICO data protection harms taxonomy) and whether the conduct is ongoing;

the extent to which opening an investigation supports the ICO strategic objectives;

the resource implications and risks involved in opening an investigation; and

whether the controller or processor has been subject to previous regulatory action, or if this conduct is repeated.

This new detail highlights the ICO's desire for transparency about how it enforces compliance with data protection legislation and aligns guidance with its principal objective (see above) to secure an appropriate level of protection for personal data and to promote public trust and confidence in the processing of personal data.

2. Settlement Procedure

The new draft guidance introduces an explicit settlement procedure, including discounts (in the form of reduced fines) for early resolution, whereas RAP does not include a formal settlement framework at all. 

Discounts

The reduced fine will be applied after the penalty notice fine amount is calculated, with the level of discount available being dependent on what stage of investigation the controller or processor enters settlement discussions. Although the ICO will consider settlement discounts on a case-by-case basis, in general the level of discount available will be greater the earlier the settlement process is started with the following maximum amounts in place:

40% if a case is settled before the ICO gives a notice of intent;

30% if a case is settled after they give a notice of intent but before the ICO receives written representations; and

20% if a case is settled after the notice of intent is given and the ICO receives written representations.

When is the settlement procedure offered by the ICO?

The ICO may consider settlement to be appropriate in any investigation into a suspected infringement where they consider that they have a sufficient basis to give a notice of intent to impose a penalty notice. The guidance lists a number of factors that will be taken into account to determine a case's suitability including:

whether the ICO has sufficient evidence to impose a penalty notice;

the procedural efficiencies and resource savings that the ICO considers it is likely to achieve; 

how likely it is that the case will be settled in a reasonable timeframe; and

any impact on related matters.

A case may also be found not suitable for settlement for a range of reasons including:

public policy reasons such as if the infringement was committed intentionally;

as a result of the attitude and conduct of the controller or processor during the investigation; and

where the controller or processor indicates that it is willing to settle at a late stage in the investigation and the ICO determined the resource savings from settlement to be limited.

Importantly, the ICO still maintains flexibility in that decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, and both the ICO and controllers / processors still maintain discretion as to when to enter into settlement discussions or settle a case. Equally though, as there is no obligation to enter into the process, neither party can require the other to enter into discussions.

3. What about DUAA?

DUAA includes provisions that supplement the ICO's existing investigatory and enforcement powers. This includes new powers to send notices by email, compel interviews and request technical reports to be prepared at the expense of the body being investigated. The draft guidance reflects these changes following DUAA, including those provisions that have already come into force as well as those that are expected to do so in the coming months.

In addition, DUAA will bring investigatory and enforcement powers under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) broadly into line with its powers under UK data protection legislation. It is understood that while some differences will remain between the frameworks in relation to enforcement, the ICO will adopt the same approach as set out in the draft guidance to the use of its powers under PECR.

Interview Notices

These are formal written requests which require an individual to attend an interview at a specified time and place, and to answer questions relevant to an investigation into compliance with data protection law. Its purpose is to obtain oral evidence when written responses or other methods are insufficient, with failure to comply potentially leading to further enforcement action.

The draft guidance indicates that the notice can only be given to controller or processor, one of their employees or anyone involved in their management or control if the ICO suspects that a controller or processor has failed or is failing to comply with data protection legislation. Again, a range of factors will be considered before issuing the notice including whether an interview would help the ICO understand how the data is being processed, especially where it is complex, and if they have previously asked someone to interview voluntarily, but the request was refused.

Reports of Approved Persons

The draft guidance also confirms that the ICO will have the power to compel an organisation to provide a technical report prepared by an approved person (such as an independent expert) as part of its information-gathering toolkit. This may form part of an assessment notice for a controller or processor. The power stems from the ICO's statutory powers under the Data Protection Act 2018 and DUAA, but we are still awaiting confirmation of when this power will come into force under DUAA.

The ICO must approve the nominated person and may specify terms about how the report is to be prepared. If a controller or processor does not nominate someone, or they are not approved, then the ICO may approve someone that they are satisfied is suitable instead.

The ICO will consider a range of factors, as set out in the guidance, before issuing the assessment notice that imposes a requirement for a report. This includes whether the matter is sufficiently technically complex that it requires specialist skills or resources that the ICO does not have available and whether the report would assist them in identifying, understanding or assessing a specified matter.

4. Enforcement Notices 

Further clarification is provided on enforcement notices and when these can be issued. The ICO can use these where it concludes that a controller or processor has infringed, or is continuing to infringe, data protection legislation. The notice requires the organisation to take specified steps or refrain from certain actions to bring its processing into compliance.

The guidance also lists a number of grounds for issuing the notice. For example, where there is evidence of infringements that concern failing to comply with:

principles of processing personal data;

data subject rights;

controller/processor obligations e.g. security measures and carrying out data protection impact assessments; and

rules on international transfers.

A range of factors will also need to be considered before issuing the notice including:

the nature and seriousness of the infringement which might include whether the infringement is likely to or has caused any damage or distress; and

whether there are any aggravating or mitigating factors about the controller or processor's conduct such as what action it has taken to remedy the infringement and mitigate any damage or distress, and how effective it was.

The notice will set out the infringement, reasons for the decision, required steps, compliance deadlines, consequences of non-compliance, and rights of appeal. In exceptional cases, the ICO can require compliance in less than 28 days (minimum 24 hours) if urgent action is needed to prevent serious harm or distress.

5. Public Announcements

The draft guidance formalises the ICO's ability to make public announcements at various stages of enforcement, a step beyond the 2018 RAP, which only referenced transparency in general terms. 

The guidance notes that while announcements are a tool the ICO may use in relation to warnings, reprimands, enforcement notices, penalty notices and settlements, they are not automatic. Decisions will be made on a case‑by‑case basis.

The process and guidance on when a public announcement will be suitable is different for each enforcement action. For example, in relation to settlement discussions, announcements will be considered carefully to avoid prejudicing the investigation or unfairly impacting the parties involved. This means that the ICO will not comment publicly while discussions are taking place or if they have been unsuccessful. If the discussions are successful and a penalty notice is issued though then the circumstances will be announced.

However, for preliminary enforcement, information, assessment and interview notices, the ICO has clarified that it will not typically make an announcement that it has given one of these unless there are circumstances in which it considers it appropriate to do so, such as if it is in the public interest, or they are providing updates on the progress of their work.

For enforcement notices and penalty notices, the guidance explains that these will be announced on the ICO website and the text of any accompanying statement will not be agreed with the controller or processor. The controller or processor will, however, be provided with such text in advance to give it an opportunity to comment on factual inaccuracies or confidentiality. After an announcement, there may be a small delay before the non-confidential copy of the notice is posted on the website to allow the recipient to make representations about confidential information it may contain.

Comment

There may be changes following the consultation process, but the draft guidance signals a shift from the 2018 RAP in terms of the UK's enforcement landscape. Where the RAP provided a broad policy framework, the draft guidance moves towards a detailed and transparent procedural framework. It sets out steps for how investigations will be opened, how information is gathered and how enforcement outcomes will be determined, giving organisations greater visibility into how decisions will be made. 

Controllers and processors should assess the impact of the ICO's proposed enforcement approach on their compliance strategy and its alignment with other regulatory requirements.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin shed 5% in the past 24 hours, dragging Ethereum, XRP, and other altcoins down with it.

The top crypto is now down over 21% in the past month, ending October on a negative note. Bitcoin plunged to an intraday low of $85,694 and is currently trading around $86,800, down 31% from its all-time high, according to CoinGecko data.

Beta assets like Ethereum and XRP, which follow Bitcoin's cues, have shed 5.6% and 6.5% respectively over the past day, highlighting the delicate situation among altcoins.

As a result of the sudden selloff, total crypto market liquidations have skyrocketed to $637 million, some $568 million of which are long  positions, according to CoinGlass data.

The short-term factors behind Bitcoin's weekend plunge are “straightforward,” Wenny Cai, COO of SynFutures, told Decrypt. “A rapid, momentum-driven drop forced outsized long liquidations (over half a billion dollars), which then amplified selling across spot and derivatives markets,” Cai explained, adding that, “That cascade effect is what turns a correction into a sharp short-term crash.”

One key crypto-related catalyst behind the drop is Strategy CEO Phong Le's comments about selling Bitcoin.

“We can sell Bitcoin, and we would sell Bitcoin if needed to fund our dividend payments below 1x mNAV,” Le noted in a Friday podcast.

Strategy's $55 Billion Bitcoin Bet Undeterred by Index Delisting Concerns, Says Michael Saylor

Strategy holds 649,870 BTC, worth $56.26 billion at the current price, with a 1.19x mNAV, according to the company's official website.

Comments from listed BTC holders, including Strategy CEO Phong Le, “can spark fear because they change investors' perceived supply dynamics — even if the comments are narrowly conditional rather than an intent to sell immediately,” Cai added.

The recent S&P downgrade of MSTR stock and attendant press due to the company's reserve composition “are a more persistent vulnerability,” the analyst noted.

Despite Le's comments, traders on prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, appear unmoved. They place just a 5% chance on Strategy selling any of its Bitcoin before the end of the year.

Tether's potential insolvency concerns if Bitcoin and gold fall by 30%, as highlighted by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes in a Sunday tweet, also played a role in aiding the weekend crash.

Hayes noted that, “A roughly 30% decline in the gold, Bitcoin position would wipe out their equity, and then USDT would be, in theory, insolvent.”

When participants worry that crypto's largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, might become impaired in a stress event, “liquidity premia widen, and margin desks can pull risk, which increases volatility across crypto,” Cai explained.

Another factor that may have contributed to the market's already bearish sentiment is China's central bank, which noted that crypto activity is illegal and raised concerns about stablecoins, according to a China Daily report.

Looking ahead, Cai expects a continued choppy, volatile trading environment in December, rather than a one-way trend with a potential “near-term washout that pressures leveraged positions, followed by rotation where long-term buyers assess value.”

 Despite the sudden crash, liquidation spree, and bearish sentiment, investors remain bullish, with Myriad users putting just a 12% chance on the likelihood of a crypto winter.

Quick Facts:

If 2026 is going to deliver a real altcoin season, it probably won't start with fireworks. It usually begins quietly: Bitcoin cools off after a strong run, $BTC dominance rolls over from local highs, and suddenly alt/$BTC charts stop bleeding and start printing higher lows.

Michael van de Poppe thinks that we're witnessing the ‘end of the bear market for altcoins' as we steer into 2026 and that Bitcoin holds the key to the next altseason.



You'll likely see it first in on-chain data. Layer 2s and DeFi protocols push higher daily active addresses, DEX volumes creep up, and fees rise without a matching spike in $BTC.

Those are the conditions where narrative-driven plays, experimental token models, and infrastructure bets can move fastest. In other words, being early to altseason is about positioning before those rotations show up on mainstream charts, while Bitcoin is still chopping in a range instead of setting new highs every week.

Together, they map out the speculative to blue‑chip spectrum heading into a potential 2026 rotation.

PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) bills itself as the ‘world's first mine-to-earn memecoin,' and the idea is simple: take the excitement of mining, remove hardware and electricity costs, and wrap it in a meme‑driven game layer.

Instead of GPUs or ASICs, you interact with a virtual mining system directly tied to your $PEPENODE holdings.

The core loop revolves around buying and upgrading ‘Miner Nodes' and ‘Facilities'. Early adopters can secure more powerful nodes that sit in higher reward tiers, meaning their virtual rigs earn larger ongoing meme coin emissions over time. It's the kind of asymmetric setup that typically attracts degen capital early in an alt season narrative.



Crucially, this mining is all virtual and smart-contract-based on Ethereum, using ERC‑20 infrastructure plus dedicated contracts for staking, rewards, and later governance.

No rigs, no power bills, no configuration headaches − just a gamified dashboard and post‑TGE gameplay activation that lets you optimize and upgrade your setup like a strategy game.

The presale is already showing traction, having raised over $2.2M with tokens currently priced at $0.0011731 and a mouth-watering staking APY of 579%.

If 2026 does bring a renewed memecoin wave as $BTC cools and retail returns, this gamified mining model could become one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025.

Read our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE before that happens to stay ahead of the curve.

Buy your $PEPENODE today.

If altseason rotations in 2026 lean toward real‑world use cases, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) positions itself at the intersection of AI, creator economies, and crypto payments. It targets the roughly $85B content creation industry by letting creators own their audiences, automate their workflows, and monetize via tokens instead of opaque platforms.

The SUBBD platform's AI Personal Assistant can handle automated fan interactions, subscription flows, and basic support, effectively becoming a 24/7 “team member” for solo creators.

On top of that, AI Voice Cloning and AI Influencer Creation open up new content formats, from synthetic personas to multi‑language distribution without extra recording time.



On the Web3 side, the SUBBD platform integrates token‑gated content and crypto payouts so creators can keep more of what they earn while retaining direct control over their subscriber relationships.

That's a sharp contrast to traditional platforms where fees, algorithms, and sudden policy changes can wipe out years of work overnight.

The market seems to be paying attention. The presale has already raised over $1.3M, with tokens at $0.057075, giving $SUBBD a running start before major listings.

For an altseason positioning around creator tech rather than pure memes, it's a project worth tracking, so read our guide on how to buy $SUBBD today.

Buy your $SUBBD while it's still in presale.

Ripple's $XRP sits at the opposite end of the risk spectrum: a large‑cap asset designed for fast, low‑cost cross‑border payments rather than speculative meme cycles. XRP settles transactions in roughly 3–5 seconds, with a consensus mechanism that's cheap and energy‑efficient compared to proof‑of‑work systems like Bitcoin's.

The big overhang for years was regulation. That changed when the SEC officially ended its lawsuit against Ripple in August 2025, closing a long‑running chapter of uncertainty. With that resolved, many market participants now see XRP with renewed confidence, particularly as regulators globally define clearer digital asset frameworks.

Heading into a potential 2026 altcoin season, $XRP offers a different kind of exposure: it's already one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and a leading enterprise‑focused blockchain payments asset, but it can still benefit from broader liquidity and renewed interest in compliant infrastructure coins.



If you want a piece of it, buy your $XRP today.

Recap: If 2026 delivers an altcoin season, you'll want exposure across different narratives: PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) for mine‑to‑earn memecoin speculation, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) for AI‑powered creator tools, and Ripple ($XRP) for post‑clarity payments infrastructure.

Non-fungible tokens changed the way people bought, sold, and owned digital assets. From art and music down to virtual land and utilities, NFTs are more than just digital files; they represent verifiable ownership made possible by blockchain. But behind this booming digital revolution is a very crucial infrastructure: NFT marketplaces. These websites serve as virtual meeting points for creators, traders, and collectors.

As it grows, the deeper the understanding of how marketplaces work will become, and some of the risks that come along-like generative AI phishing will also be of greater importance to all participants.

NFT marketplaces are online platforms, incorporating blockchain technology, where one can mint, buy, sell, trade, or auction NFTs. They are similar in concept to the virtual versions of eBay or Amazon, but with ownership being recorded on and verified by a blockchain.

Most existing NFT marketplaces are currently supporting assets that have been created based on blockchain standards such as:

ERC-721:

ERC-1155

BEP-721

Tezos FA2 tokens

Unlike tokens, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible, NFTs have unique metadata that makes each one of them different and impossible to interchange one for another.

Smart contracts are thus the basis of ownership transfer and verification of an asset's authenticity in NFT marketplaces. That said, here is the basic process:

Create or Mint an NFT

Users upload a digital file and convert it into a blockchain asset.

Listing the NFT

This marketplace hosts the asset on its platform, accompanied by thorough metadata, price, history, and creator-related information.

Buy or Bid

The buyers are either paying a fixed price or are taking part in an auction.

Transfer of Ownership

The smart contract transfers the NFT into a buyer's wallet once the transaction is completed.

Most platforms have transaction fees starting from:

Minting fees

Listing fees

Royalty fees

Marketplace commissions

Different platforms are used for different reasons. Common types of platforms include the following:

1. General NFT marketplaces

These support a wide array of digital assets.

Examples include OpenSea, Magic Eden, and Rarible.

2. Curated or Exclusive Marketplaces

They do strict artist selections where high-quality creators are first verified.

Examples include: SuperRare, Foundation

3. Gaming & Metaverse Marketplaces

Focused on skins, weapons, land, and in-game assets.

Examples include Axie Marketplace and Sandbox Marketplace.

4. Branded or Proprietary Marketplaces

Companies create their own NFT platforms to maintain full control over the user experience.

The rise of demand for digital ownership, increased transparency, and more power given to creators propelled the NFT marketplace into the mainstream. Key factors include:

Creator royalties

Each time the NFT is resold, artists earn a certain percentage.

Global accessibility

Anyone who has a crypto wallet is invited to the platform.

Diversified monetization

From virtual fashion to AI art, creators find new income models.

Integration into Web3

While NFT marketplaces offer growth opportunities, they also attract cybercriminals. One of the newer and more dangerous risks emerging today is AI-driven scams in Crypto.

AI-powered language models (LLMs) are being used by attackers to:

Craft highly personalized scam messages

Mimic official support staff of NFT platforms

Trick users into revealing wallet keys or signing malicious transactions

Clone creator identities to list fake NFTs

Because LLMs can generate human-like communication, scams become more convincing.

Fake “support messages” asking users to reconnect their wallets

AI-generated phishing emails impersonating marketplace administrators

Scammers using AI chatbots to guide users into signing fraudulent approvals

As NFT marketplaces grow, so does this threat. Understanding generative AI phishing helps users stay alert and avoid losses.

To protect yourself from scams, frauds, and phishing attempts, implement these practices:

Never share your private keys—no legitimate platform will ask for them.

Double-check marketplace URLs to avoid spoofed websites.

Use hardware wallets for high-value NFTs.

Avoid clicking unknown links shared via DMs on Discord or Twitter.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.

Verify collections before buying to avoid counterfeit NFTs.

Do not trust unsolicited support messages.

Verify identities of creators and moderators.

Cross-check announcements from official channels.

Staying aware reduces your exposure to evolving AI-driven threats.

The evolution of NFT marketplaces will be shaped by technological, regulatory, and cultural shifts. We are likely to see:

AI-generated NFTs and dynamic digital assets

Cross-chain trading where users can buy NFTs across different blockchains

Regulation and compliance frameworks

Decentralized marketplaces with no central control

Real-world asset tokenization including real estate, luxury goods, and documents

NFT marketplaces are transitioning from niche art hubs into robust ecosystems that support creators, brands, and digital economies.

NFT marketplaces are the engine behind the global NFT movement. They make digital ownership transparent, accessible, and scalable. Yet with growth comes responsibility: the user must be constantly aware of various risks, including LLM-Powered Social Engineering in Crypto, collection scams, marketplace vulnerabilities, and phishing. Whether a newbie who is just starting to learn about NFTs or a well-seasoned trader in them, understanding how marketplaces work offers the ability to confidently navigate such an ecosystem. If treated the right way, an NFT marketplace offers unlimited possibilities for creativity, investment, and innovation. 

The NFT marketplace is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to mint, buy, sell, or trade NFTs. 

 Most require either transactional cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, or MATIC to go through with it. 

 Avoid unsolicited messages, use only verified platforms, and stay cautious against crypto scams resulting from LLM-Powered Social Engineering. 

Yes, many of the marketplaces allow the resale of NFTs, whereby the creator earns royalties on any secondary sales. 

They are basically safe in themselves if used responsibly, yet the user must always be cognizant of the associated risks: phishing, fake collections, AI-driven scams.

In an era of rapid innovation, the legal landscape is shifting just as fast. You're advising on complex challenges, anticipating risks, and driving business forward. Staying ahead means having a partner who understands not just the law, but the industries redefining it.

At Davis Wright Tremaine, we offer deep industry knowledge, strategic insight, and a commitment to practical, actionable advice tailored to your needs—so you're prepared to tackle today's challenges while seizing tomorrow's opportunities.

Let's get started.

The OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1186, confirming that
national banks may hold crypto-assets as principal to pay network
"gas fees" and to test crypto platforms. IL 1186 builds
upon the foundation laid during the first Trump Administration and
reflects the second Trump Administration's regulatory
priorities and supervisory posture. More clarifications from the
OCC on digital assets are expected to follow. If the OCC continues
at this pace, DeFi is poised to become the "electronic"
and "internet" activities of the 1990s—just another
thing banks can do. This is just the latest step in promoting the
interoperability of crypto and blockchain technologies with
traditional financial services.

The OCC also released a public database of prior requests for
supervisory non-objections for permissible crypto-related
activities under a now-defunct framework. The database provides
overdue transparency into an opaque process marked by delays and
uncertainty.

IL 1186 reflects the OCC's broader effort under Comptroller
Jonathan Gould—the agency's former Chief Counsel who
developed key Brooks-era interpretations on crypto-related
activities—to modernize the OCC's approach. Comptroller
Gould has emphasized his intent to put OCC supervision
and expectations "on a firmer legal foundation" and IL
1186 follows a string of proposed reforms to supervision.

IL 1186 also continues the trend of the first Trump
Administration's ILs that clarified that national banks may
engage in key crypto-related activities.

Click to Enlarge.

IL 1186 is very much the logical outgrowth of these ILs,
especially IL 1174:

We note that the bank's explanation of how it would ensure
that its activities would be conducted in a safe and sound manner
is something of a roadmap for banks and others seeking future OCC
clarification.

Under the permissibility analysis framework in 12 C.F.R. §
7.1000(d), an activity is permissible if it:

*We note that banks that don't have the operational or
compliance capacity in place to leverage this authority very well
may want to use third-party fee providers—at least until they
are ready to conduct the activities in a safe and sound manner and
with appropriate risk controls.

IL 1186 also analogizes holding crypto-assets as principal to
long-standing practices in traditional payment systems, where banks
have typically invested capital in "building, joining, or
maintaining the network[.]" In that way, using these
technologies is just a new way to "conduct[] the very old
business of banking."

IL 1186 applies the same permissibility analysis to crypto-asset
platform testing. A bank developing or acquiring a crypto-asset
platform must be able to test transfers, settlement, recordkeeping,
controls, and compliance before putting the service in front of
customers. Banks, therefore, may hold the amount of crypto-assets
needed to test platforms, helping banks avoid increased costs and
heightened operational risks, while encouraging banks to test
systems thoroughly.

IL 1186 doesn't suggest this is the end of clarifying
permissible crypto-related activities for national banks.

By revisiting and developing previous ILs, conducting an
incidental activities analysis, and analogizing these new
activities to long-standing payment systems practices, the OCC has
charted a viable way forward.

In addition, the OCC notes in footnote 35 that national banks
"may also hold some amount of crypto-assets as principal
for other permissible purposes" that
are unspecified and thus quite broad. The OCC gives two examples:
(1) foreclosing on crypto-assets used as collateral for a loan; or
(2) physically hedging a customer-driven derivative on a
crypto-asset in conformity with 12 C.F.R. § 7.1030. Taking the
OCC's statement at face value and to its logical conclusion,
there are likely many more "permissible purposes,"
including possibly:

The OCC also released a Summary of Interpretive Letter 1179 Requests
database to show how its earlier interpretations were applied in
practice under the now-defunct supervisory non-objection framework
of the prior administration. It provides overdue transparency and
follows the FDIC's release of the crypto letters earlier in
2025 in response to reports and allegations of debanking.

While the disclosure of 21 "formal requests" over two
years is useful, the submissions represent fairly measured requests
to update banking systems and processes. Banks that sought to
modernize banking businesses faced an opaque agency process that
added costs and delays. Some received a supervisory non-objection,
while many didn't; those who didn't, withdrew their
requests—a practice that previously typified the application
process at other federal banking agencies.

The controls the OCC specified for those that received a
non-objection are not terribly informative, either. Providing the
OCC's interpretations more broadly through general guidance or
developed regulation could have promoted consistent and specific
risk controls, through a transparent routine process, backstopped
by supervisory oversight.

The database moreover doesn't show the many
informal requests the OCC presumably received during this
period, which we imagine would significantly expand the
dataset.

IL 1186 is helpful as national banks and others develop their
products and services. It also confirms the new supervisory
approach that the OCC announced.

We expect additional guidance from the OCC to promote innovation
in financial services, banking, and payments. Banks and traditional
financial institutions remain at the heart of the U.S. financial
system and integrating the best technology from blockchain and
crypto use cases constitutes the next step in creating the future
generation of financial products and services.

The content of this article is intended to provide a general
guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought
about your specific circumstances.

Neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge report that the human brain moves through five "major epochs" as it rewires itself from early development to late old age. Each stage reflects a different way the brain supports thinking, learning, and behavior as we grow, mature, and eventually experience age-related decline.

A team from Cambridge's MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit analyzed MRI diffusion scans from 3,802 individuals ranging from newborns to 90 years old. These scans track the movement of water through brain tissue, which helps researchers map the networks that link one region to another.

Their findings, published in Nature Communications, show that the brain's structure progresses through five broad phases. Four key "turning points" divide these phases, marking ages when the brain undergoes meaningful reorganization.

Childhood, Adolescence, and a Slow Path to Adulthood

The first epoch spans from birth to about age nine, when a major turning point leads into the adolescent phase. This adolescent period lasts much longer than expected, continuing until roughly age 32 on average.

In the early thirties, the brain's wiring shifts into an adult configuration. This becomes the longest era and continues for more than three decades. A third turning point near age 66 marks the beginning of an "early aging" phase, while the final "late aging" stage emerges around age 83.

"We know the brain's wiring is crucial to our development, but we lack a big picture of how it changes across our lives and why," said Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar who led the research. "This study is the first to identify major phases of brain wiring across a human lifespan."

"These eras provide important context for what our brains might be best at, or more vulnerable to, at different stages of our lives. It could help us understand why some brains develop differently at key points in life, whether it be learning difficulties in childhood, or dementia in our later years."

Early Brain Growth: Synapses, Consolidation, and Rapid Change

From infancy through childhood, the brain is shaped by "network consolidation." Babies generate an enormous number of synapses, the points where neurons communicate. Over time, only the most active connections are kept while the rest are eliminated.

During this period, the entire brain follows a consistent rewiring pattern. Grey and white matter grow quickly, pushing cortical thickness (the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter) to its highest point. The folds of the cerebral cortex also stabilize, forming the ridges seen on the outer surface.

By age nine, the brain encounters its first major turning point. Cognitive abilities expand rapidly at this age, but the risk of developing certain mental health conditions also becomes higher.

Adolescence: Increasing Efficiency and More Organized Brain Networks

The second epoch, adolescence, is marked by continued growth of white matter. As these pathways expand, the organization of communication networks becomes more refined. MRI diffusion scans show more orderly water movement in the tissue, reflecting stronger and more coordinated connections.

This period is notable for rising efficiency in how signals move both within individual regions and across the whole brain. These improvements are linked to gains in cognitive performance.

"Neural efficiency is as you might imagine, well connected by short paths, and the adolescent era is the only one in which this efficiency is increasing," said Mousley.

These changes peak in the early thirties, which researchers describe as the "strongest topological turning point" across the entire lifespan.

"Around the age of 32, we see the most directional changes in wiring and largest overall shift in trajectory, compared to all the other turning points," said Mousley. "While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically. Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early thirties."

Adulthood: Stability and Gradual Compartmentalization

At approximately age 32, the adult epoch begins. This phase is relatively stable compared with earlier stages of life, and no additional major turning points appear for about thirty years. According to the researchers, this aligns with a "plateau in intelligence and personality" described in other studies.

They also noted growing "segregation" during this time, meaning that different brain regions begin to operate in more distinct and specialized ways.

The next turning point, around age 66, is much more subtle. While it does not involve dramatic structural changes, the team still observed meaningful shifts in network organization.

"The data suggest that a gradual reorganization of brain networks culminates in the mid-sixties," said Mousley. "This is probably related to aging, with further reduced connectivity as white matter starts to degenerate. This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension."

Late Aging: Declining Global Connectivity and Regional Reliance

The final turning point arrives near age 83, signaling the start of the last brain structure epoch. Although the amount of data for this phase is limited, researchers found a clear pattern. The brain becomes less globally connected and depends more heavily on specific regions.

"Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterized by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras," said senior author Prof Duncan Astle, Professor of Neuroinformatics at Cambridge.

"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviors."

"Understanding that the brain's structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption."

The research received support from the Medical Research Council, the Gates Foundation, and the Templeton World Charitable Foundation.

A new study suggests that gravity could quantum-entangle particles even if it remained classical.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Today, our conception of the universe is governed by two big theoretical frameworks. Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity describes the universe of the very big—the movement of planets and the propagation of gravity across space-time. Quantum theory, on the other hand, describes the universe of the very small, where forces are quantized. For example, the electromagnetic force's quantum is the photon, while bosons and gluons are the quanta for the weak and strong force, respectively. 

You might've noticed that gravity isn't included in this list of forces and their associated smallest pieces. While scientists theorize that quantum gravity must also have a force carrier (called a graviton), we've never actually seen one. This summer, Nature reported a growing effort among scientists to discern once and for all if quantum gravity exists as our theoretical understanding and experimental capabilities improve. One of the most exciting efforts exploring this idea comes from the University of London, where physicists Joseph Aziz and Richard Howl are investigating whether classical gravity could induce quantum entanglement—a phenomenon where two particles become linked, and the measurement of one influences the other.

“With the other interactions, we quantized them assuming they live within an independent background of classical space and time,” Howl, whose paper was published in late October in the journal Nature, told Physics World. “But with quantum gravity, arguably you cannot do this [because] gravity describes space−time itself rather than something within space−time.”

Quantum theory postulates that entanglement occurs via the exchange of virtual gravitons. As Space.com explains, these gravitons don't really exist, but due to “wacky world of quantum physics,” such particles are mathematically allowed for an extremely limited amount of time. The idea behind Aziz and Howl's work is that gravity can remain classical while still mediating quantum entanglement. 

“You could think about the gravitational interaction as more general than just the mediation of the gravitational field,” Howl told Space.com, “and there could be quantum processes associated with it, virtual matter processes, and in that case even if the gravitational field is classical the gravitational interaction could still potentially entangle matter.”

Howl notes that this idea doesn't mean quantum gravity doesn't exist—in fact, he thinks there'd be methods for distinguishing between these two methods of entanglement. Quantum gravity would have stronger correlations, meaning that one could easily discern the state of one particle in an entanglement pair using the information of the other. In a classical entanglement scenario, the correlation would be weaker due to the nature of probabilities. This study helps form the parameters, establishing these effects for future experiments. 

“There's nothing to say you can't do [an experiment] in theory,” Howl told Space.com, “but you have to eliminate all decoherence [things that would cause the superposition to collapse] and it is an incredibly difficult challenge.”

Luckily, difficult challenges are well-known obstacles for physicists trying to merge the two most powerful theories in the history of science.

Metamorphosis: A Natural and Human History Oren Harman Basic Books (2025)

“Metamorphosis is wild,” marvels historian Oren Harman. A caterpillar completely dissolves inside its chrysalis, before reconstructing itself in the shape of a butterfly. The ‘immortal jellyfish' (Turritopsis dohrnii) reverts from its mature, floating form into a polyp that dwells on the ocean bed when threatened, only to eventually turn back into a mature jellyfish again — never dying of old age.

Survival of the nicest: have we got evolution the wrong way round?

Survival of the nicest: have we got evolution the wrong way round?

How such weird natural phenomena strike at the core of our understanding of biology is the focus of Harman's beautiful book, Metamorphosis. The author uses the life stories of four scientists to argue that studies of metamorphosis — drastic changes in the body plan of an organism after birth — have been key to our understanding of the mechanisms of genetic inheritance, organismal development and evolution. It is a sweeping biography that is also part biology textbook, part cultural human history and part personal odyssey.

Harman begins in the 1600s, when philosopher Aristotle's influence on popular theories was still prevalent and science and magic co-existed in the minds of scholars. “In reports of the highest caliber, sightings of new planets lay side by side with sightings of unicorns and dogs who could bark in French,” he notes. Many people still adhered to Aristotle's theory that spontaneous generation — the miraculous formation of a living organism from dead material — accounted for metamorphoses.

It was against this backdrop that naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian travelled to South America in 1699 to document the life cycles of insects. According to Aristotle, most insects are ‘imperfect' animals — born in a state that is completely different from their adult form. Driven by her obsession with metamorphosis, Merian published an illustrated book on the insects of Suriname, which remains a classic for its demonstration of caterpillar–butterfly life cycles.

As Harman shows, the work of naturalists in the seventeenth century led to an understanding that, rather than appearing through spontaneous generation, animals arise from fertilized eggs. Later, studies of butterflies developing in their chrysalises contributed crucial insights to the debate on whether an organism builds itself from scratch, as we now know to be the case, or whether the adult form exists inside the egg and simply grows larger.

Next, Harman turns to zoologist Ernst Haeckel, a nineteenth-century adopter of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Haeckel viewed it as ridiculous to expect that living organisms could be reduced to simply ‘cold' physical forces, as his university professors thought. Nor did he take to the romanticism of the natural philosophers, who thought that vital forces animated living creatures.

From egg to animal: retracing an embryo's first steps

From egg to animal: retracing an embryo's first steps

Instead, Haeckel saw biology as a historical science and argued that the ways in which species develop are intimately tied to their evolution over eons. For example, the human embryo changes shape as it develops: from a single cell to a mass of cells, then a body that temporarily has a tail and gills, followed by webbed fingers that later separate as the embryo takes on its mature form. To Haeckel, “Nothing made more clear how we humans had once been amoebas, sea squirts, fish, amphibians, then four-legged mammals.”

Haeckel dubbed this concept the biogenetic law and argued that it accounted for the apparent tendency of animals to become increasingly complex as they evolved. This tendency has been disproven as a law, but is sometimes still used as a rule of thumb. It is known by biologists today as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

Harman argues that metamorphosis is related to this concept, albeit tangentially, because the rate at which organisms metamorphose from a fertilized egg into their mature form can be explained by the biogenetic law. Haeckel emerges as an early forefather of the field that would come to be dubbed ‘evo-devo'.

The author also notes Haeckel's tarnished legacy. He promoted theories of race that were related to his biogenetic law, which some historians have argued contributed to the rise of the Third Reich in Germany. Haeckel insisted on the supremacy of “civilized” Europeans and argued that, by flipping the lens of his biogenetic law, it was possible to predict how successful various groups of people would be — if development reveals secrets of the deep past, then it might also uncover aspects of the future of humanity.

Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist and antidiabetic drug, has shown neuroprotective effects in animal models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome. ‘Evaluating liraglutide in Alzheimer's disease' (ELAD) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial in 204 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome with no diabetes. Participants received daily injections of liraglutide or placebo for 52 weeks. They underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and detailed neuropsychometric evaluations. The primary outcome was a change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate. Secondary outcomes were safety and tolerability and cognitive changes. The primary outcome showed no significant differences in cerebral glucose metabolism (difference = −0.17; 95% confidence interval: −0.39 to 0.06; P = 0.14) between the two groups. The secondary outcome—score on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Executive domain (ADAS-Exec)—performed better in liraglutide-treated patients compared to placebo (0.15; 95% confidence interval: 0.03−0.28; unadjusted P = 0.01). No significant differences were observed in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) (−0.58; 95% confidence interval: −3.13 to 1.97; unadjusted P = 0.65) or Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SoB) (−0.06; 95% confidence interval: −0.57 to 0.44; unadjusted P = 0.81) scores. Liraglutide was generally safe and well tolerated in non-diabetic patients with Alzheimer's disease. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01843075.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by multiple pathologies, including β-amyloid deposition, tau aggregation, neuroinflammation/glial activation and synaptic dysfunction, which contribute to progressive neurodegeneration. For an effective treatment, a multitargeted approach influencing these different pathologies may be required. The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has shown compelling preclinical evidence of influencing multiple targets in transgenic mouse models. Liraglutide has 97% homology to human GLP-1 and is currently approved worlwide for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity1.

In transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, liraglutide improves memory, prevents synaptic loss, reduces β-amyloid and tau aggregation, reduces neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, restores protein kinase A and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/protein kinase B signaling and improves insulin signaling2,3,4. Liraglutide increases stem cell proliferation and differentiation into neurons5, enhancing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus6 and preventing memory decline7.

In one study evaluating dulaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, patients with diabetes showed delayed cognitive impairment (n = 9,901) compared to placebo8. Another pooled post hoc analysis of three large cardiovascular outcome trials revealed that liraglutide and semaglutide significantly reduced the incidence of dementia9. Liraglutide significantly prevented the decline of brain glucose metabolism in a pilot study involving 38 patients with Alzheimer's disease10. Another small study involving at-risk participants demonstrated that liraglutide improved intrinsic connectivity within the default mode network11. A trial of the GLP-1 analog exenatide in Alzheimer's disease found a reduction of β-amyloid 42 in plasma neuronally derived extracellular vesicles12. Systematic reviews and the Delphi consensus in 2012 and 2020 highlighted GLP-1 agonists as the most promising class of compounds for repurposing as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease13. Another recent study evaluating liraglutide in Parkinson's disease improved non-motor symptom scores, Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part II scale and the 39-item Parkinsonʼs Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)14. Exenatide treatment improved MDS-UPDRS scores in participants with Parkinson's disease compared to controls15,16. Motor and cognitive improvements were maintained 12 months after exenatide treatment cessation17. Analysis from neuronal-derived exosomes shows that exenatide engaged insulin, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways18. A phase 2 trial showed that 12 months of lixisenatide treatment improved MDS-UPDRS part III scores relative to placebo19.

In the ELAD study, we sought to evaluate the influence of liraglutide on the change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRglc), cognition and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volume from baseline to week 52 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome.

Of the 204 participants randomized, 102 were assigned to receive liraglutide and 102 to receive placebo. In total, 169 participants completed the study. Analyzable scans at week 52 for the primary outcome were 72 participants (70.6%) in the treatment arm and 82 participants (80.4%) in the placebo arm. The most common reasons for participants not completing the trial included withdrawal of consent, clinical decision, poor compliance, adverse events and participants unable to tolerate scans (Fig. 1). The participants in the treatment and placebo groups were generally similar in terms of baseline demographics and clinical characteristics (Table 1). Female sex (38% versus 41%), age (72.5 years versus 70.6 years) and education (12.9 years versus 13.1 years) were balanced in the placebo and treatment groups, respectively. Four participants identified as non-White, and the remainder identified as White. A similar number of patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ≤18 (n = 13 for placebo and n = 10 for treated) and MMSE scores >18 (n = 89 for placebo and n = 92 for treated) were included (Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, a similar number of participants with CDR scores of 0.5 (n = 60 for placebo and n = 61 for treated), 1 (n = 38 for placebo and n = 40 for treated) and 2 (n = 2 for placebo and n = 1 for treated) were included (Supplementary Table 2).

Study procedures: patient enrollment and randomization. PET, positron emission tomography.

No significant difference was observed between the treatment and placebo groups for the primary outcome (change in fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F] FDG) standard uptake value (SUV)) adjusting for baseline SUV, age and MMSE (adjusted difference = −0.17; 95% confidence interval: −0.39 to 0.06; P = 0.14; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). The sensitivity analysis of the spectral analysis results agreed with this conclusion.

Whiskers show the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and points beyond this range are plotted as outliers. Individual data spread is plotted on the box-and-whiskers plot. Analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values and stratification factors (age and MMSE) was used to compare between the placebo and treatment groups.

The secondary outcome of cognitive function—change in ADAS-Exec (ADAS-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Executive domain scores from the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB)) z-score (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4)—was slower in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (0.15; 95% confidence interval: 0.03−0.28; unadjusted P = 0.01). No significant differences were observed in ADCS-ADL (−0.58; 95% confidence interval: −3.13 to 1.97; P = 0.65) or CDR-SoB (−0.06; 95% confidence interval: −0.57 to 0.44; unadjusted P = 0.81) scores (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4).

A multilevel mixed-effects model was used to compare between the placebo and liraglutide treatments. a, Baseline n (placebo, 100; treatment, 100), 24 weeks n (placebo, 95; treatment, 83) and 52 weeks n (placebo, 87; treatment, 79) for ADAS-Exec. b, Baseline n (placebo, 100; treatment, 99), 24 weeks n (placebo, 89; treatment, 80) and 52 weeks n (placebo, 88; treatment, 79) for CDR-SoB. c, Baseline n (placebo, 100; treatment, 100), 24 weeks n (placebo, 94; treatment, 83) and 52 weeks n (placebo, 89; treatment, 80) for ADCS-ADL. P values are unadjusted (P < 0.05).

The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events and clinically important changes in safety assessments was a key secondary outcome of the study. There were 991 adverse events in the 12 months of the study. There were 450 adverse events in the placebo arm occurring in 87 participants and 541 in the treatment arm occurring in 88 participants. There were 25 recorded serious adverse events in the 12 months of the study occurring in 18 (17.6%) participants on placebo and in seven (6.9%) participants on treatment. Most serious adverse events were considered unlikely to be related to the study treatment. There were 14 unexpected serious adverse events in the placebo arm and four unexpected serious adverse events in the treatment arm. There was one life-threatening serious adverse event in the placebo group. All adverse events are shown in Supplementary Table 5.

The most common adverse event was a gastrointestinal disorder, which had a higher incidence rate in the treatment group compared to the placebo group and accounted for 25.5% of all adverse events reported in those treated with liraglutide. Common gastrointestinal side effects included anorexia, bloating, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea and weight loss. Up to 5% weight loss was experienced by 39.2% of patients in the liraglutide arm and by 12.6% of patients in the placebo arm, and 5–10% weight loss was experienced by 8.9% of patients in the treatment arm and by 1.1% of patients in the placebo arm.

Liraglutide has a clinically acceptable safety profile for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease syndrome and was well tolerated in participants without diabetes or obesity.

No significant treatment difference was observed on MRI volumes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex or ventricular volume (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 6). However, the exploratory analyses of liraglutide-treated participants showed lower volume reductions in the temporal lobe (696 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 184.37−1,208.12; P < 0.001) and total gray matter volume (7,274 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 2,704.05−11,844.8; unadjusted P = 0.002) compared to the placebo group (Supplementary Table 6). Additionally, parietal lobe (1,978 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 360.12−3,597.67; unadjusted P = 0.018) and frontoparietal lobe (4,272 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 722.41−7,820.64; unadjusted P = 0.02) showed a trend of lower reduction in volume.

Analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values and stratification factors (age and MMSE) was used to compare between the placebo and treatment groups. Baseline n (placebo, 101; treatment, 101) and 52 weeks n (placebo, 83; treatment, 75). P values are unadjusted (P < 0.05). A predefined P < 0.01 was used.

Exploratory regional voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 7) demonstrated that liraglutide-treated participants showed a trend of slower reduction in frontal (2.82 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 2.10 × 10−4 to 5.44 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.036), parietal lobe (2.61 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 5.9 × 10−5 to 5.16 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.047), temporal (3.90 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 8.27 × 10−4 to 6.98 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.014), whole cortical gray matter (2.98 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 5.91 × 10−4 to 5.36 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.016) and white matter (3.22 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 9.30 × 10−4 to 5.51 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.007) volumes compared to placebo-treated participants (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 7).

Panel a shows reduced voxel-wise decline of gray matter VBM in participants treated with liraglutide. VBM analyses are reported for frontal lobe (b), hippocampus (c), medial temporal lobe (d), parietal lobe (e), temporal lobe (f), whole gray matter (g) and whole white matter (h).

In this first phase 2b study, we evaluated the effect of liraglutide on glucose metabolism, cognition and MRI volume in patients with Alzheimer's disease syndrome. Although this study revealed no significant changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in participants treated with liraglutide compared to those treated with placebo, the secondary trial outcomes revealed a beneficial treatment effect of slowing cognitive deterioration (ADAS-Exec), and liraglutide was generally safe and had an acceptable safety profile. The exploratory outcome measure revealed a beneficial effect of slowing of brain volume loss. The liraglutide-treated participants performed better on the comprehensive ADAS-Exec cognitive battery (which is a combination of ADAS-Cog and Executive domain scores from the NTB) but not on other cognitive measures (CDR-SoB or ADCS-ADL) after 52 weeks of treatment compared to the placebo group. As the results were not corrected for multiple comparisons due to the exploratory nature of the study, this must be interpreted with caution. Although the improvement started to appear before 6 months, it was more obvious by 52 weeks, suggesting that GLP-1 analogs may positively influence cognition in Alzheimer's disease over a prolonged period of treatment, and the preserved MRI outcomes may be compatible with a possible neuroprotective effect. Due to the exploratory nature of this phase 2b study, these findings need to be confirmed in larger studies.

Preservation of cognitive function observed in liraglutide-treated participants was consistent with preclinical findings20,21 and the cognitive benefits identified in a meta-analysis of antidiabetic agents in participants with Alzheimer's disease22. In our study, the ADAS-Exec z-score for cognitive function was higher for the placebo group at baseline; the slope of decline changed at 24 weeks and became significant at 52 weeks (Fig. 2). This may be due to liraglutide exerting its effect via neuroprotective mechanisms rather than having a direct symptomatic efficacy, which would have been evident within 24 weeks. The symptomatic agent donepezil showed cognitive improvement of Alzheimer's disease cases by week 12, which continued at weeks 18 and 24 (ref. 23). Our observations are consistent with and supported by the REWIND trial, where long-term dulaglutide treatment prevented cognitive decline in participants with diabetes assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test24. Taken together with our current trial, we suggest that a neuroprotective effect may be a class effect of GLP-1 analogs.

Although we acknowledge that this was a 12-month-duration study, which may be insufficient to definitively establish long-term clinical benefit in Alzheimer's disease, it can still yield meaningful insights, and further studies are necessary to fully establish the effectiveness of this drug. Modest cognitive or biomarker effects over this timeframe may represent early indicators of a slowed neurodegenerative process, which, if sustained, could translate into tangible long-term benefits. Determining what constitutes a clinically meaningful change in Alzheimer's disease trials is inherently complex. This is due to the heterogeneity of disease progression, the limitations of traditional cognitive and functional scales and the often-subtle nature of early-stage change. Importantly, cognitive changes may precede observable functional or global benefit, particularly over short trial durations. Furthermore, the field lacks a universally accepted quantitative threshold for meaningfulness; rather, regulatory and clinical interpretations increasingly emphasize consistency across multiple domains, biological plausibility and the potential for preservation of autonomy and quality of life over time.

The observed attenuation of gray matter loss and reduced temporal lobe atrophy in liraglutide-treated participants aligns with evidence from other therapeutic trials, including donepezil and blarcamesine, that have shown similar effects25,26. However, this remains a noteworthy finding, given that such structural preservation is still relatively uncommon across the broader landscape of Alzheimer's disease trials.

Blarcamesine demonstrated an attenuation in global brain volume loss measured by MRI and reduction of the expansion of the lateral ventricular volume compared to placebo. Volumetric MRI improvements associated with blarcamesine appeared global and may be in response to restoration of cellular homeostasis. The global improvements in volumetric MRI associated with blarcamesine are accompanied by reducing the decline of clinical disease progression, which suggests that the drug effects might be exerted by mitigating neurodegeneration25. In another trial, a 45% reduction of rate of hippocampal atrophy was observed in prodromal Alzheimer's disease after 1 year of treatment with donepezil compared to placebo26. No significant difference was observed in neuropsychological performance between treatment groups25. Longer observation periods and longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the association between reduced rate of hippocampal atrophy and protective effects on cognition, such as memory and other clinically relevant domains. Similarly, there is a need to replicate the results in prodromal Alzheimer's disease to understand the basic mechanism through which liraglutide impacts morphology and/or structure of brain regions affected by Alzheimer's disease.

It is possible that MRI outcomes could be considered as a composite measure reflecting an improvement of several underlying pathological processes occurring in Alzheimer's disease. The potential beneficial neuronal effect of liraglutide is supported by previous observations of improved intrinsic connectivity compared to placebo in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease11. Therefore, it is possible that GLP-1 analogs, as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, produce observable neuroprotective effects on both brain structure and function, thus reducing the decline in participants' cognitive function. It has been shown that liraglutide reduces neuroinflammation, reduces tau phosphorylation mediated by PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling27, attenuates toxic protein buildup and improves synaptic function in transgenic animal models of Alzheimer's disease, all of which could decrease gray matter atrophy and ultimately provide protection against cognitive decline. It is likely that the effect of GLP-1 analogs is not region specific and influences the whole of the brain. Although we did not observe the preservation of volume in some of the smaller structures, it is likely that we would need a larger number of participants to demonstrate an effect in the smaller structures due to significant variability in the atrophy in these structures for the advanced participants who were included in the study.

Additionally, based on our cortical VBM results, the spatial distribution of significant voxels in the cortex closely resembles the spatial distribution of the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and other molecules in the insulin signaling cascade28. IRS-1 is an effector molecule of the insulin receptor. Specific changes in its phosphorylation result in impaired insulin signaling, which is an established pathological marker of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Various differentially phosphorylated forms of IRS-1 have been considered pathological markers of insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease28,29. Impaired insulin signaling and IRS-1 signaling have been observed in the postmortem Alzheimer's disease brain30. This is an indirect finding and provides evidence suggestive of target engagement by liraglutide. Liraglutide treatment has been shown to ameliorate insulin resistance aberrations and decrease IRS-1 pS616 upregulation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease31. This warrants additional investigation of the therapeutic potential of liraglutide and GLP-1 agonists in Alzheimer's disease.

In the present study, we did not demonstrate a reduced change in cerebral glucose metabolism in participants treated with liraglutide. This finding differs from a previous 26-week pilot study in which liraglutide prevented a decline in glucose metabolism compared to placebo10. There are several possibilities to explain this discrepancy. First, failure to observe any changes in cerebral glucose metabolism probably reflects key differences in methodology. The participants continued treatment up to the scanning date in the previous study but discontinued treatment 3 days before the week 52 PET scan was acquired in the ELAD study. The rationale for conducting the scans 3 days after the final dose was to minimize the potential for acute pharmacodynamic effects (giving a minimum of five half-lives of liraglutide)—particularly those that could transiently alter systemic glucose availability or uptake mechanisms unrelated to central neuronal activity. [18F] FDG uptake in the brain is largely insulin independent, especially in neurons, and is thought to reflect neuronal metabolic activity rather than peripheral insulin action32. Although liraglutide can influence peripheral glucose metabolism, the brain's glucose utilization, as measured by [18F] FDG PET, is relatively stable and less subject to short-term fluctuations in insulin sensitivity. Future studies should evaluate the influence of suddenly stopping the GLP-1 analogs on the brain after daily injections for a year. A greater number of participants may be needed to demonstrate a group difference upon treatment cessation. Second, it is possible that the wider clinical range of Alzheimer's disease participants (MMSE scores 15−30) included in this trial may have diluted any [18F] FDG changes. Participants with MMSE scores lower than 18 have severe hypometabolism that is associated with advanced disease, which may be difficult to protect with liraglutide owing to the extent of neuronal damage. Third, the number of participants who completed the trial was less than that anticipated by our power calculation. Finally, levels of microglial activation may drive [18F] FDG signal alterations. It is also possible that as liraglutide has been shown to reduce microglial activation33, [18F] FDG signal discrepancies could also reflect that 52 weeks of treatment may also be attenuating the inflammatory response, resulting in a relative reduction in glucose metabolism in patients who received treatment.

Liraglutide was well tolerated by the participants with Alzheimer's disease. The total number of adverse events was greater in the patient group treated with liraglutide, consistent with the side effect profile of the drug; however, serious adverse events were more common in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most frequently reported in participants receiving liraglutide, an established class effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist compounds that declines over the course of treatment34. Once-daily injections can be a substantial burden for participants. An oral formulation of GLP-1 receptor agonist is available and regularly used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity, which would reduce this burden and benefit the level of treatment compliance in future studies, although our study did demonstrate that even daily injections in the context of a clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease are possible.

Together, our study provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale evaluation of GLP-1 analogs in people living with Alzheimer's disease and provides an insight into the mechanism of action of GLP-1 analogs in neurodegenerative diseases. There is an unmet need to identify effective treatment strategies beyond targeting β-amyloid pathology. Although promising, novel anti-β-amyloid therapies provide only modest improvements to activities of daily living and cognitive benefits despite effectively reducing β-amyloid load. Alzheimer's pathogenesis is multifaceted, and here we indicate a cognitive benefit of a candidate that is evidenced to influence several pathological aspects of Alzheimer's disease beyond β-amyloid. This is a notable finding, demonstrating the ability of non-β-amyloid targets to provide cognitive benefit and neuroprotection and showing the importance of developing alternate treatments to accompany therapies such as lecanemab and, potentially, donanemab. To identify an effective treatment strategy, we indicate that a multitargeted approach is essential for the future of Alzheimer's therapy. With a well-established safety profile in patients with obesity and diabetes, we demonstrate that liraglutide is generally safe and well tolerated in this neurodegenerative population.

Participants were diagnosed in specialized centers after detailed clinical and neurological examination, neuropsychometric evaluation and MRI scans. All participants had repeat MRI and [18F] FDG PET as a part of the study. Any patient whose MRI and [18F] FDG PET were not consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was excluded.

Although β-amyloid PET, tau PET or translocator protein (TSPO) PET were outcome measures, owing to participants' burden due to the number of PET scans and that these scans were optional, participants did not proceed to have the optional β-amyloid PET, tau PET or TSPO PET, and we were unable to evaluate regional levels of β-amyloid, tau deposition and neuroinflammation. We collected blood samples of patients at baseline and follow-up; however, the plasma biomarkers have not been analyzed. As a result, we cannot provide complementary biomarker evidence to contextualize the observed metabolic findings. Future studies incorporating both β-amyloid biomarkers and genetic risk stratification (APOE genotype) will be important to fully understand treatment heterogeneity. Moreover, integrating blood-based and imaging-based biomarkers alongside genetic profiling will better elucidate mechanisms and treatment effects.

A key limitation of this study was that attrition reduced the achieved sample size compared to that planned in the original power calculation. Although power calculations are prospective tools and are not typically reestimated post hoc, the reduced sample size likely lowered the probability of detecting small effects and limits replication confidence. In addition, no formal power calculation was performed for secondary or exploratory endpoints; analyses should, therefore, be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis generating. Nonetheless, the study successfully demonstrated feasibility, safety and some early biological signals.

Moreover, a key limitation of the present study was the limited population diversity, in that most of the participants were White. The ethnic composition of the population makes it challenging to assess whether findings are representative across different demographic groups and generalizable to the general public. In addition, important sources of heterogeneity, such as diet and medical history, were not described or modeled, limiting the ability to account for potential confounders that may influence treatment response. However, participantsʼ medical history that may influence cognitive function was not included in the study.

We performed mean imputation that has limitations and may not fully preserve variability or multivariate relationships. Only four patients had missing data at baseline, which makes up 2% of the study population. Hence, mean imputation in the present study was applied only to baseline covariates. More sophisticated approaches, such as multiple imputation, would be preferable in larger confirmatory trials.

The ELAD study showed no significant changes in cerebral glucose metabolism in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome, which was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures revealed that patients treated with liraglutide had a significantly slower decline in cognition (ADAS-Exec) and a slower reduction in MRI brain volume compared to the placebo arm, demonstrating a favorable response to liraglutide treatment. Liraglutide was well tolerated by patients with Alzheimer's disease syndrome.

Between March 2014 and January 2021, we conducted a 12-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial in 24 sites across the UK. All PET and MRI scanning was performed at a single site at the Imperial College Clinical Imaging Facility, and other trial-related activities were performed at the individual sites. Participants were recruited from memory clinics and Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Networks.

Eligible participants were aged 50 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease based on detailed clinical and neurological examination, neuropsychometric evaluation and MRI scans in the secondary or tertiary centers as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. Participants with Alzheimer's disease had an MMSE score of 15 or higher and a CDR Global score of 0.5, 1 or 2, calculated using the University of Washington online algorithm. Participants who were taking treatment for diabetes mellitus were excluded. A complete list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the supplementary files.

This study was approved by the local and regional Regulatory Ethics Committees (National Research Ethics Committee-Riverside and Imperial College London/Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Joint Research Office) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Approval for the administration of radioactivity was given by the Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee. Written informed consent was provided by all participants before participation in the trial. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee and an Independent Trial Steering Committee met regularly during the trial to monitor the safety and conduct of the trial. Clinical data will be entered directly into computers via Inform. The data manager will arrange appropriate quality assurance checks. After each assessment, data will be entered in the study database. Participants will be identified by their unique patient identifier only. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are provided in the supplementary materials.

A total of 204 participants were randomized to receive the active drug or placebo with a 1:1 allocation ratio using stratified block randomization with a fixed block size of six. Randomization was performed by Mawdsley and Brooks. Participants were stratified according to age groups (age 50–75 years and age >75 years) and MMSE scores (MMSE 15–24 and MMSE >24).

In animal models of Alzheimer's disease, a liraglutide dose of 0.25 mg kg−1 d−1 was used to test its efficacy, which translates to a human equivalent dose of 1.2−1.8 mg of liraglutide daily in a 60−90-kg human, as per the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conversion table 2005 (https://www.fda.gov/media/72309/download)35. In humans, liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg has been approved in several countries, including the European Union, Japan, Australia and the United States, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes under the trade name Victoza. In March 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved its use in obesity under the trade name Saxenda, at doses up to 3 mg. The doses used in the ELAD trial are those approved for diabetes, as, at the time of the study design, liraglutide was only approved for clinical use in diabetes36.

Pharmacokinetic data from the clinical development program for liraglutide demonstrated that it is absorbed slowly (tmax = 8–12 hours) and has a half-life of approximately 13 hours37. Although liraglutide's brain penetration is limited, pharmacokinetic and functional data demonstrate that sufficient concentrations of liraglutide reach the central nervous system (CNS) to activate GLP-1 receptors, including in cortical and hypothalamic neurons37. Preclinical (animal model) studies have demonstrated that liraglutide suppresses β-amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation and inflammation38,39. Thus, liraglutide does pharmacokinetically engage CNS targets at therapeutic doses. Liraglutide is suitable for once-daily subcutaneous injection given any time of the day, independent of meals. Investigation of liraglutide metabolism in vitro and in healthy participants has indicated that liraglutide is endogenously metabolized and that neither renal excretion nor hepatic extraction is a major route of clearance. The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide has been investigated in human participants with renal and hepatic impairment and has not raised any safety concerns. However, the therapeutic experience in participants with hepatic or renal impairment is limited. The effects of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide have been investigated, and it was concluded that all participants, regardless of age or gender, should be dosed in accordance with the usual proposed dose regimen for liraglutide36.

Participants received once-daily injections of liraglutide or placebo. The study drug was administered as a daily subcutaneous injection, commencing with a dose of 0.6 mg once daily, and the dose was escalated to 1.8 mg within 4 weeks. Participants who did not tolerate 1.8 mg remained on 1.2 mg for an additional 2 weeks, and then two more attempts were made to increase the dose to 1.8 mg. If participants did not tolerate 1.2 mg, they were withdrawn from the study but were included in the safety reporting. After completion of the 52-week treatment period, participants were given the opportunity to participate in a 12-month open-label extension, in which they received liraglutide, the results of which are not reported here.

There were no recorded treatment crossovers in this trial. The compliance was measured in two ways: the total drug prescribed to individuals, dispensed at visits and returned at visits (measured in mg), and the number of injections taken according to diaries and time on the trial (participants provided diary information at each visit). The mg prescribed compliance was calculated according to:

The number of injections taken compliance was calculated according to:

The patients were recruited from memory clinics across the UK in 24 sites. All patients had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on their clinical evaluation, neurological examination, neuropsychometric evaluation and MRI scans. All patients were provided with a detailed patient information sheet with adequate time to consider the study. Participants were then invited to the trial site, and written informed consent was obtained. All participants underwent a detailed screening test that involved reviewing the clinical history and diagnosis, collecting medical history and ensuring that the patient satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants had detailed physical and neurological examination and neuropsychometric evaluation. Patients also underwent vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory tests and safety blood tests. Patients had 17 visits in total during the 52-week study. After the screening, eligible participants underwent a baseline visit, as detailed in the supplementary materials. Participants were given liraglutide 1.8 mg per day or placebo. Safety visits were performed at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 and 56. [18F] FDG and MRI scans were completed at baseline and at week 52 visits. ADAS-Exec, CDR-SoB and ADCS-ADL were rated at baseline, week 24 and week 52.

The primary outcome measure was the change in rCMRglc in the cortical regions (combination of regions: hippocampal, medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate) from baseline to follow-up (12 months) in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. rCMRGlc was estimated by creating parametric maps using spectral analysis with an arterial plasma input function as previously described40,41. We used a lumped constant of 0.48. Additionally, SUV was calculated using the following formula: \(\frac{\mathrm{Tracer}\,\mathrm{uptake}\,\mathrm{value}}{(\mathrm{Dose}\,\mathrm{of}\,\mathrm{radioactivity}\,\mathrm{injected}/\mathrm{Body}\,\mathrm{weight})}\).

A region of interest analysis was undertaken for rCMRGlc and SUV images, and all individual images were co-registered to their corresponding MRIs. Object maps were created by multiplying the binarized MRI with the probabilistic atlas using SPM8 in MRI space to create individualized object maps of volumes of interest. Parametric maps were then sampled combining hippocampus, medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex using Analyze AVW. We assessed cerebral glucose metabolism in a composite region combining the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex from rCMRglc and SUV parametric images of [18F] FDG PET scans.

The key secondary outcomes included a change from baseline to 12 months in z-scores for the ADAS-Exec (ADAS-Cog and the Executive domain scores from the NTB), the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically important changes in safety assessments over 12 months. CDR-SoB and ADCS-ADL were also secondary outcome measures.

MRI changes in the volume of the ventricles and a composite region (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) from baseline to 52 weeks were assessed in a predefined secondary analysis. Participants' T1 MRI volumetric scans at baseline and 52 weeks were processed using FreeSurfer software 7.4.1 (ref. 42). Predefined exploratory analysis was performed for temporal lobe, ventricles and isthmus cingulate. As GLP-1 analogs can have global effects, we performed additional analyses for whole gray matter, frontoparietal and occipital lobe volumes. (Image processing of [18F] FDG PET imaging and MRI scans are detailed in the supplementary materials.)

VBM analysis was performed as an exploratory analysis of brain macrostructure at a regional and voxel-wise level. Regional analysis was conducted within the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe volume, whole gray matter and whole white matter.

Safety and tolerability were assessed based on all reported adverse events and serious adverse events. Clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, laboratory evaluations, ECG recordings and physical examinations were recorded as adverse events on the relevant medical/psychiatry history. Key secondary outcomes included the change from baseline to 52 weeks in z-scores for the ADAS-Exec, CDR SoB and ADCS-ADL.

The ADAS-Cog has been employed as a cognitive efficacy measure in most Alzheimer's disease clinical drug trials. However, its use has been criticized on the grounds that it does not index all the functions known to be compromised early on in Alzheimer's disease, and, because measurement is variable, studies require many study participants. Additional tests have been added to remedy the deficiencies of the original instrument43. However, it is not clear that they have successfully remedied the identified issues. Alternative instruments, such as the NTB44, have been validated and accepted for use. However, even when used in tandem with the ADAS-Cog, the NTB does not satisfactorily map all the cognitive domains specified by the EMEA44. To remedy these issues, we combined the standard 13-item ADAS-Cog with the executive function components of the NTB (namely, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Category Fluency Test (CFT), Wechsler Digit Span (WDS) and Trail Making Test (TMT)). Performance on the ADAS-Exec is summarized as a composite to which each measure contributes equally via z-score transformation. Support for the utility of this approach was previously provided by applying this methodology to the data from proof-of-concept trials of PBT2 (refs. 45,46).

The total scores for ADAS-Exec were calculated for each test all in the same direction (higher score means better performance). The ADAS-Cog 13 subtest scoring (1.1−1.14) and the NTB scoring (1.15−1.18) are shown below:

The ADAS-Exec z-score was calculated in the following steps:

The screening and baseline total scores were averaged and used as a single baseline assessment. Where only one screening or baseline score was available, this value was used as the baseline.

The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each total score at baseline.

The participants' z-score for each test was calculated at each timepoint:

The average z-score for each participant was calculated.

ADAS for each patient was calculated as the average of the z-scores.

The z-scores were estimated for participants with at least one NTB subtest and at least two-thirds (9/14) of the ADAS-Cog subtests completed.

Additional secondary outcomes included TSPO and tau PET, amyloid load and APOE4 status. Patients were keen to undergo minimal PET imaging; therefore, tau and TSPO PET were not completed as part of this study, and cerebrospinal fluid data were also not collected. Genotyping and plasma markers have not yet been analyzed and are not reported in the paper.

Landau et al.47 used the [18F] FDG PET imaging biomarker to monitor the progression of Alzheimer's disease. At and after 12 months, they found a mean change in the [18F] FDG region of interest of −0.055, with an s.d. of 0.068 (ref. 47). Assuming that the treatment reduces the mean change of [18F]FDG SUV in the participants with Alzheimer's disease to −0.025 (44% effect size), 82 participants would be required per group to provide 80% power at a 5% significance level. Allowing for a dropout of 15% over the study period, the trial required 103 participants per group (206 in total). Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB version 2020a, and all P values were two-sided. A significance level of 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance for the primary outcome, key secondary outcomes and other secondary outcomes. A predefined significance level of 0.01 was used to declare statistical significance for any exploratory analyses. 95% confidence intervals are reported throughout. In this study, only the primary endpoint was designated for confirmatory testing and subjected to the predefined type I error control. All secondary and exploratory endpoints were analyzed to generate hypotheses for future trials.

The primary analysis was intention to treat and involved all patients who were randomly assigned. An analysis of covariance was undertaken for the primary outcome of participants who completed the baseline and follow-up scans, with rCMRglc as the response variable and adjusting for stratification factors (age and MMSE) and baseline values of rCMRglc. No missing data were imputed for the outcome data, and any missing baseline data were imputed as the mean of the participants with this measurement48 (irrespective of treatment). We calculated the adjusted mean difference in change in rCMRglc in the composite cortical region between randomized groups at 12 months with 95% confidence interval and associated two-sided P value. The primary outcome was analyzed using two methods: SUV and spectral analysis. We had 101 participants for the analysis using spectral analysis with arterial plasma input, whereas the less invasive SUV method had 154 participants with baseline and 52-week analyzable scans. The SUV results were analyzed as the primary outcome, and the spectral analyses were analyzed with the same method as part of the sensitivity analysis.

A multilevel mixed-effects model was used to interrogate the repeated key secondary outcome measures at 24 weeks and 52 weeks. The model allowed for an interaction between treatment and time as a categorical variable and was adjusted for the randomization factors and baseline values of the outcome. An analysis of covariance as described for the primary outcome (without imputation) was used for the MRI volumetric secondary and exploratory outcomes. A change in volume from baseline to 52 weeks was analyzed as part of an exploratory analysis. P < 0.01 was considered significant.

Safety and tolerability assessments included the monitoring and recording of all adverse events and serious adverse events as well as the regular monitoring of vital signs. Clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, laboratory evaluations, ECG recordings and physical examinations were recorded as adverse events and followed-up as appropriate. Adverse events were described by duration, severity grade, relationship to the study drug, the actions taken and the outcome if relevant.

All analysis was conducted using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC).

During the design and conduct phase of this study, participants from the Alzheimer's Society (patient representative groups) reviewed the study proposal and all study-related materials. They considered this study highly important and strongly supported it. Their input was incorporated into the study protocol, patient information sheet and other study-related materials. Throughout the study, the Patient and Public Involvement group met regularly and provided advice on improving recruitment and on other challenges met during the study.

There is an inherent trade-off between the design of comfortable wearable sensors and the need for high-resolution and large-area sensing. Here we address this challenge by introducing a generative electromyography (EMG) network (GenENet), a self-supervised generative representation learning framework combined with a wearable sensor that extrapolates limited sensor inputs to reconstruct muscle activity in unseen regions not covered by the sensor. This approach allows for gathering information equivalent to those from high-density EMG sensor networks, but using a more compact, wearable device with much reduced sensor counts, without sacrificing performance. For example, a 6-channel EMG device trained on a 32-channel dataset from low-impedance polymer electrodes shows similar performance to a 32-channel device in accuracy for predicting sign language and gait dynamics, highlighting the utility of the GenENet concept to reduce wearable-sensing-system complexity while maintaining prediction quality. Such electrophysiological data are essential for many applications, including motion detection and control, but traditionally require high-density, high-resolution sensors that can be cumbersome. This concept should be applicable to other types of electrophysiological mapping application across health monitoring, prosthetics, sports and human–machine interfaces, paving the way for more comfortable and efficient wearable devices.

The world has lost a giant of virology, molecular biology and science advocacy with the death of David Baltimore, at age 87. Baltimore demonstrated that RNA viruses that cause cancer contain an enzyme capable of directing the synthesis of DNA from an RNA template. We now know this enzyme as reverse transcriptase and the viruses as retroviruses, reflecting the backward flow of genetic information in this type of virus.

This is how the world finally ends the HIV/AIDS pandemic

This is how the world finally ends the HIV/AIDS pandemic

The discovery of reverse transcriptase in 1970 explained a mystery in the capabilities of these viruses. It clarified how an RNA virus could generate a genomic copy of itself that could persist in the infected cell and be inherited by daughter cells. It also revealed how, much later, cells could produce further copies of the viral RNA. The idea that this mechanism could involve the formation of a DNA copy of the RNA genome was proposed by Howard Temin, who shared the 1975 medicine Nobel with Baltimore and Renato Dulbecco. But accepting this theory required unusual willingness on Baltimore's part to challenge the central dogma of molecular biology — specifically, the principle that information flows in all living systems from DNA to RNA to protein.

Reverse transcriptase has become an essential tool in modern molecular biology, because the ability to make DNA copies of any RNA molecule, coupled with the extraordinary power of recombinant DNA methods, enables the characterization of the RNA molecules that define cell types and their functions.

Baltimore was born and grew up in New York City. He graduated with a chemistry degree at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, in 1960. He then joined the graduate biology programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, before moving to The Rockefeller University in New York City, where he completed a PhD in animal virology. After a postdoc at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California, he returned to MIT in 1968 to establish his own group, where he made his first seminal discovery. His laboratory went on to show how reverse transcriptase orchestrates, through an extraordinarily complex series of steps, the formation of a double-stranded DNA copy of the single-stranded retroviral RNA genome.

It's time to admit that genes are not the blueprint for life

It's time to admit that genes are not the blueprint for life

Baltimore uncovered aspects of the replication of many other viruses, including poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus. He discovered and characterized several cancer-causing genes, including the one encoding the v-abl tyrosine kinase in Abelson murine leukemia virus. The mammalian homologue, c-ABL, later proved to be the driver of chronic myeloid leukaemia in humans, a cancer now treated successfully with the kinase inhibitor Gleevec (imatinib) and its successors.

Despite risks ranging from exacerbating inequality to causing existential catastrophe, the world has yet to agree on regulations to govern artificial intelligence. Although a patchwork of national and regional regulations exists, for many countries binding rules are still being fleshed out.

In October, at a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's proposal to create a body known as the World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization (WAICO), which would bring nations together as a step towards creating a global governance system for AI.

China seeks self-reliance in science in next five-year plan

China seeks self-reliance in science in next five-year plan

The proposal is part of a wider drive to be at the helm of efforts to govern AI, in contrast to a US approach that is focused on deregulation. When it comes to transparency and AI policy, “China is the good guy at the moment,” Wendy Hall, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton, UK, told reporters at an event in London in October.

Many hurdles lie in the way to creating a binding intergovernmental agreement on AI, but some advocates say it is possible, comparing the technology to other risky but useful endeavours for which agreements exist, such as nuclear power and aviation. Nature looks at China's approach, what a global AI governance body might look like and its chance of success.

Encouraged by the government, Chinese firms tend to release models as open weight, meaning that they can be downloaded and built on. And compared with Western nations, China has less of a focus on making machines that could outsmart humans — often referred to as artificial general intelligence — and is instead concentrating on a race to use AI to drive economic growth. This is exemplified by a policy introduced in August called AI+, says Kwan Yee Ng, who leads international AI governance at Concordia AI, a Beijing-based consultancy that focuses on AI safety.

China was among the first nations to introduce AI-specific regulations, beginning in 2022, and has wide-ranging rules on harmful content, privacy and data security, for example. Developers of public-facing AI-powered services must let Chinese regulators test their systems ahead of deployment, says Ng. The result is that models such as those developed by the Hangzhou-based company DeepSeek, which found world fame with its R1 model earlier this year, are among “the most regulated in the world”, says Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and researcher in AI ethics at the Hertie School in Berlin. Despite this, the authorities often take a soft approach to enforcing that regulation, says Angela Zhang, a law researcher and specialist in AI regulation at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

By contrast, the United States has no comprehensive legislation on AI at the federal level, and in January President Donald Trump revoked an executive order aimed at ensuring AI safety. He has positioned his administration as pro-industry, last month suggesting in a social-media post that it would add a clause to a federal bill to prevent states from regulating AI. The European Union approach has been to classify AI systems by risk level, with different rules relating to transparency and oversight at each tier, and obligations that came into force in August, aimed at the most powerful AI systems. The UK government, meanwhile, has shelved plans to introduce comprehensive AI legislation until next year, at the earliest.

Very little. The only legally binding international regulation comes from the Council of Europe, an international organization of European member states, separate from the European Union, which established its Framework Convention on AI in May 2024. The treaty commits any signatory country to implementing its broad obligations — such as ensuring that AI activities align with human rights — through their national laws. But there are no sanctions or a supranational enforcement body, says Lucia Velasco, an economist and researcher at the Oxford Martin School's AI Governance Initiative, who is based in New York.

Companies and nations have also signed various non-binding agreements, such as the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the OECD AI Principles and the Bletchley Declaration, an international agreement signed by 28 countries at the UK AI Safety Summit in 2023. Several expert groups have produced documents outlining the risks, one of the most prominent being the International AI Safety Report. The United Nations (UN) is running a ‘dialogue' process and has created a scientific panel to guide countries' regulatory efforts.

WAICO would be a way for countries to coordinate AI governance rules while “fully respecting the differences in national policies and practices” and championing the global south, Chinese officials have said. China has proposed that the body's headquarters be in Shanghai, but other details remain uncertain.

WAICO looks unlikely to govern AI directly in any enforceable way (and China has said it backs a UN approach to governing global AI) but it could be a route for countries to gradually coalesce around a framework. 

Xi's call to create WAICO was at least the fourth such push from a Chinese official in four months, suggesting the idea is important to the government, says Ng. One reason is commercial, says Zhang. “The fact that China is able to set standards helps China's product diffusion all over the world,” she says.

The move also gives China some diplomatic cachet. “China is trying to be like [an older] brother to the global south, arguing ‘we also need to have our voice in the governance of AI and not be dictated to',” says Zhang.

We don't know. AI-safety experts often cite nuclear-power regulation and the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency as an analogy, says Ng. Standards set by the UN agency are non-binding but are complemented by legally binding treaties it helped to forge, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety.

by Lisa Stiffler on Dec 1, 2025 at 10:26 amDecember 1, 2025 at 10:35 am

— Expedia Group appointed Xavier Amatriain as its first chief artificial intelligence officer and data officer. He joins the Seattle-based travel giant from Google where he served as vice president of product in AI and Compute Enablement. Other past employers include Quora, LinkedIn and Netflix.

“[Amatriain's] deep expertise in building large-scale AI platforms will help redefine how people experience travel,” Expedia CTO Ramana Thumu said in a statement. “Expedia Group operates at a scale few can match, and we invest deeply in our talent, giving technologists the space to learn, experiment, and push the boundaries of what AI can do.”

Amatriain, based in San Jose, Calif., has mapped a diverse career path — he's been a university professor in Spain, a healthcare startup co-founder, a researcher, and an engineering leader.

— Textio co-founder and former CEO Kieran Snyder returned to Microsoft as vice president of AI transformation.

“My goal in this new role is to help Microsoft be the best living case study of effective, human AI transformation in the world,” Snyder said on LinkedIn. 

Snyder began her tech career at Microsoft in 2004, working on the Bing search engine and Windows. In 2014, she launched Textio, which claims to be the first-to-market venture using AI for HR functions. The company's software helps organizations recruit, hire and retain inclusive teams.

Over the past two years, Snyder ran a business called “nerd processor,” which offered research and leadership coaching, and served as chief scientist emeritus at Textio, where she is now on the board of directors.

— Ross Tennenbaum is leaving his role as president of Avalara for a new role with an unnamed public company, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. Tennenbaum joined the tax software giant in 2019 and was previously CFO. He worked at Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse before joining Avalara, which relocated its headquarters from Seattle to North Carolina following its acquisition by Vista Equity Partners in 2022. It filed to go public, again, earlier this year. 

— After more than 12 years at T-Mobile, Janice Kapner is leaving the telecommunications giant. Kapner was chief communications and corporate responsibility officer and executive VP at the Bellevue, Wash., company where she led a team of more than 160 employees. 

“From Magenta sneakers and confetti cannons to competitive stunts, big bets, and a front-line team that made the brand burst off the page and into the world — these are moments I'll never forget,” Kapner said on LinkedIn. “They shaped me as much as I helped shape them.”

Prior to T-Mobile, Kapner was at Microsoft for more than a decade.

— Former Microsoft and Amazon leader Vinita Ananth is now senior director of product for the cloud company Nebius. Ananth, based in the Seattle area, has been working since July on stealth-mode startups HelpViber and FulcrumAX. Ananth called the decision to leave these ventures “difficult and emotional.”

“I'm thrilled that my co-founder will continue driving both HelpViber and FulcrumAX forward, with a strategic focus on customer traction, platform maturity, and meaningful funding milestones over the coming year,” she said on LinkedIn, adding that she'll continue in advisor and co-founder roles.

— PayPal appointed Bo English-Wiczling as VP of global developer relations. English-Wiczling, based in Seattle, joins from Oracle, where she worked for nearly nine years in leadership roles in database product management and developer relations. Previous employers include Amazon and Best Buy.

“After an incredible journey working alongside talented engineers, community leaders, and innovation-minded partners, this new role feels like the perfect next step,” English-Wiczling said on LinkedIn. “I'll be working at the intersection of PayPal's global payments platform and developer ecosystems — helping build, grow, and energize the communities and relationships that power our future.”

— Jaimin Gandhi joined Seattle-based AI roleplay startup Yoodli as a product leader. Gandhi's past roles include leadership positions at Nerdy, Binance, Uber, DocuSign, Microsoft and others.

Over the past year, Gandhi built FourPoint.AI, a tool that helps job seekers improve their communications. While he won't be adding new features to FourPoint, “I am opening it up for free,” Gandhi said on LinkedIn. “If it helps someone land their next opportunity the way it helped me find mine, that is a meaningful way to pay it forward.”

— Kapil Hetamsaria is now chief business officer of Neo4j, a data analysis, graph intelligence platform. Hetamsaria joins from C3 AI, where he served as a vice president, and was previously co-founder and CEO of Viddl App, a Bellevue-based short-video platform.

— Dave Rosenbaum is leaving his role as senior publications manager at Seattle-based pet sitting company Rover to join Airbnb. 

“I have always been a firm believer in the transformative power of travel — discovering new places, trying new foods, and having new experiences,” Rosenbaum wrote on LinkedIn. “Airbnb's mission is central to this belief that the world offers limitless possibilities.” 

Rosenbaum is also a deputy mayor and city council member for Mercer Island, a city east of Seattle, and previously served in legislative roles for members of Congress.

— Ambika Singh, founder and CEO of online clothing rental company Armoire, joined the board of trustees for the Seattle Metro Chamber.

— Pete Fewing, associate athletic director at Seattle University and longtime Sounders FC broadcaster, joined the board of directors for Starfire Sports. The organization provides coding classes, drone summer camps, and other free, after-school sports programming for underprivileged kids in South Seattle.

I love a digital notebook. I write about them all year long here at WIRED, and it's not often my favorites go on sale. (Or for any to go on sale, besides Amazon's own sale events.) But this year, multiple digital notebooks I love are on sale for the biggest sale event of the year.

If you've thought about getting one of these for yourself, there's truly no better moment. From reMarkable's on-sale bundles to Kobo's deals, you can shop five of the best digital notebooks we've ever tried right now at a lower price than you might find until next year. They're a handy device just about everyone can enjoy, whether you want to digitally annotate your books or write out your grocery list without using a piece of paper.

Looking for more great sales to shop? Don't miss our guides to the Best Amazon Device and Kindle Deals, Best Laptop Deals, the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals, and our liveblog.

Update Dec. 1: We updated prices, links, and deals, and added the Rocketbook Fusion Plus notebook.

reMarkable

Amazon (Marker Plus and Folio)

ReMarkable (Marker Plus and Folio)

ReMarkable (Marker Plus and Folio)

Some of the best digital notebooks we've tried come from reMarkable, and one of reMarkable's models always seems to reign supreme over our digital notebooks guide. While the Paper Pro Move is the newest model, the reMarkable Paper Pro that launched in September 2024 is my current all-around favorite. It's not only powerful with tons of tools and an easy interface, but packs a color screen for colorful notes. It also has a gentle front light so that you can use it in darker environments. You can get the bundles on sale right now, so combine one of reMarkable's markers and folio covers with a Paper Pro to get $50 off.

reMarkable

Amazon (With Marker Plus and Book Folio)

ReMarkable (with Marker Plus)

ReMarkable (With Marker)

The best discount from reMarkable is actually for its older device and our previous top pick, the reMarkable 2. It doesn't have a color screen or the front light, but you'll get the reMarkable's great software and options for accessories like the Keyboard Folio to use it like a laptop. The reMarkable 2 bundles are also on sale, so add on your favorite folio of choice on reMarkable's website to get $70 off.

Kobo

Amazon (E-Reader Only)

Kobo (With Stylus 2)

Amazon (With Case and Stylus)

The Kobo Libra Colour is my favorite all-around e-reader with its color screen and page turner buttons, but you can add on a stylus to have it double as a digital notebook. It's one of the more affordable options, and it's a smaller screen than the rest of these, but I especially love that you can use the stylus to doodle on the books you're reading (something you can't do with the Kindle Scribe). It's $30 off on Kobo's site for Cyber Monday.

Amazon

Amazon

Best Buy

The second-generation Kindle Scribe isn't the best digital notebook, but the long battery life (12 weeks!!) and convenient starting point of it being a Kindle I could already be reading on makes it a great go-to for casual notetakers and doodlers. It's a good choice for Kindle and Amazon users, and there are new models due out this winter, but they likely won't be as cheap as this one. (Especially since some of those new models will have color!)



Walmart

Kobo

Amazon

If you like the idea of getting a Kobo e-reader that doubles as a digital notebook, you can go for more of a classic size with the larger Elipsa 2E. This one comes with the stylus, so you won't have to add it on, and it's $50 off.

Rocketbook

Rocketbook

Amazon

The Rocketbook Fusion Plus digital planner and notebook is for those who don't want to charge their notebook or give up on the whole “paper” experience. Take notes with the included, erasable Pilot Frixion Pen, scan photos of the pages into the app, and erase the whole thing with the damp microfiber cloth (also included). Fusion Plus is on its steepest discount of recent memory, and comes templates that range from monthly and weekly pages to project management and meeting notes.

OpenAI is taking an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, whose parent company is one of the AI giant's major investors, Thrive Capital. 

Thrive Holdings operates like a private equity firm for AI, rolling up companies that it believes could benefit from the tech in sectors like accounting and IT services. 

Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal, but it will involve OpenAI embedding engineering, research, and product teams within Thrive's companies to accelerate AI adoption and boost efficiency, the company says. If those companies succeed, OpenAI's stake will grow, and it will get compensated for its services, according to reporting from CNBC.  

The partnership follows a pattern of circular dealmaking for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave. Analysts will be watching to see if Thrive-owned firms actually succeed in building long-term profitable businesses using OpenAI's tech, or if the result is really just pumped-up valuations based on speculative market potential.

Nvidia is investing $2 billion into Synopsys, which makes software and components for designing semiconductor chips. The deal deepens their existing partnership at a time when analysts have started to scrutinize increasingly common circular AI-industry deals and warn of a potential bubble.

Nvidia said it bought Synopsys shares at $414.79 each as part of a multi-year partnership to integrate Nvidia's AI hardware and computing capabilities into Synopsys's electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation software. The deal will help Synopsys transition its platform from CPU-based computing to GPUs, a shift it hopes will speed up chip-design workflows, per a release.

The deal gave Synopsys's stock a lift by signaling long-term growth – a boon after the company recently reported weakness in its IP segment due to U.S. export restrictions and issues at a major customer.

For Nvidia, the investment strengthens its influence over Synopsys's widely used EDA tools at a time when chip-design competition is starting to heat up. It also comes after major investors such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel have sold off their Nvidia positions.

On Monday, Clipbook, an AI-powered platform that helps companies monitor their media coverage, announced a $3 million seed round co-led by Mark Cuban, Commonweal Ventures, and Carpenter Capital. 

The deal happened because Clipbook's founder, Adam Joseph, took a long shot with a cold email that he never thought anyone would read, he told TechCrunch. 

Joseph launched Clipbook in 2023 and bootstrapped it to a million dollars in annual recurring revenue, he said. At that point, about a year ago, he felt he was ready to find investors. 

“I literally made a list of the top five media investors in the world,” Joseph recalled. His product uses AI to help companies track what the world says about them and their competitors in the press, across podcasts, and in social media. So he wanted investors who understood that scene. 

Mark Cuban, who has founded media networks, starred on “Shark Tank,” written books, produced movies, and is regularly interviewed on TV, was at the top of Joseph's list. 

So, one evening in late 2024, Joseph drank a beer for courage and sent a one-page investment pitch via cold email to everyone on the list. No warm intro.  

Cuban, alone, answered. It turns out, busy and inundated with pitches as he is, Cuban still scans his own emails. He's always looking for his next deal. “I have literally invested tens of millions of dollars from emails, and a lot of them have paid off, turned into unicorns,” Cuban tells TechCrunch about why he answered Clipbook.  

But before Cuban cracked open his checkbook, he put Joseph through a series of tests. His first email response “was the most skeptical 20 questions that he could ever ask,” Joseph recalled. 

Cuban admits he's fairly famous for that from “Shark Tank.” 

“When I start to pepper them, they wilt, right? They wilt or they get angry at a certain level,” Cuban explained. “It's their baby. They don't like to be questioned, yeah? But Adam was just like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.”  

After answering every question to Cuban's satisfaction, the billionaire then asked Joseph to prove the product by producing a report for Cuban's own baby: CostPlus Drugs. That's an online pharmacy and public benefit corporation he co-founded in 2022 that prices drugs affordably at cost plus 15%. 

“I know what a pain in the ass it is to do the research for PR and for marketing, and to learn about [competitor] companies, and to find out what people are saying about your own company,” Cuban explained. 

Not that Clipbook doesn't have plenty of competitors that also do this work. Sprinklr is among the best known, but others include Sprout Social, Emplify, Hootsuite, and more.  

Joseph contends that Clipbook is different because it was built from the ground up to be AI native. That means it doesn't just scan for keywords, but it understands the context of how those words are used. It knows that media references to “cost” and “drugs” is not the same as looking for CostPlus Drugs. It knows the difference between any person named “Adam Joseph” and the one who is the founder of Clipbook. 

Being AI-native (not an AI bolt-on) also helps it search where other products struggle to go, such as audio and video references in podcasts, Joseph contends. He built this product after doing PR work for Boston Consulting Group and so experienced the pain of media sentiment research firsthand, he said. 

Joseph speedily produced the report for Cuban that really “nailed” relevant references, Cuban says. He was especially impressed when it unearthed a previously unknown podcast conversation about pharmacy benefit services. 

After a few days of negotiating, Cuban agreed to send Joseph a term sheet. The first part of that seed round closed in early 2025 and other investors piled in over the next few months.

Joseph declined to share updated ARR figures with TechCrunch from since his seed round closed — except to say the company has grown since its first million. But the company now counts 200 companies as customers, including Weber Shandwick and his old employer, the Boston Consulting Group, he says.

Last week on It: Welcome to Derry, we learned some important new details about Madeleine Stowe's character Ingrid, the head housekeeper at Juniper Hill Asylum who befriends the troubled Lilly Bainbridge (Clara Stack).

Even when Lilly's no longer a patient, she seeks out the kindly older woman for comfort and advice—and why not, considering Derry is a hellscape and positive role models are hard to come by? However, every Stephen King fan watching was startled to learn last week that Ingrid's last name is “Kersh.” As in Mrs. Kersh, the manifestation of Pennywise that torments the original It character Beverly Marsh. What's the connection exactly? This week's sixth episode lifted the lid on who Ingrid Kersh is and what her motivations are for being such a good friend to Lilly.

First, though, let's look back at what else we know about Mrs. Kersh from Welcome to Derry so far. We know she's the alibi for accused killer Hank Grogan (Stephen Rider); he was with her when the movie-theater massacre took place in episode one. But she's a married white woman—making her connection with Hank taboo on multiple levels, especially in a small town circa 1962.

We don't know what will become of her relationship with Hank now that he's a fugitive. The show may pick back up with them eventually. But so far, we've witnessed many more scenes between her and Lilly, starting in episode three.

Lilly's wrapping up a brief return to Juniper Hill Asylum after a breakdown in the grocery store—you'd need your medication adjusted too if you saw your dead father's head in a pickle jar—and is sharing a moment with her pal Ingrid before she goes.

“It's going to be okay, dear,” Ingrid reassures her; clearly, Lilly has unloaded many woes on her, including her rift with Ronnie (Amanda Christine), who happens to be Hank's daughter.

“My father used to say that life is about the journey,” Ingrid continues. “But I think it's more about who you take that journey with. And if this Ronnie means as much to you as it sounds, you're going to find a way to make things right somehow.”

She also offers this very welcome reassurance: “If you tell me that you've seen the impossible, then I believe you. Most people, they only believe what they can see with their own eyes.”

Ingrid Kersh says all the right things, and it happens again in episode three when Lilly seeks her out again. The kids are starting to poke into Derry's grim history, and Lilly wants Ingrid's insights.

“I do remember some kids going missing in the ‘30s,” Ingrid muses, though she claims she hasn't thought about that in years. It was the Depression. Times were tough back then.

She's encouraging of Lilly's detective work, though: “My father always said that with good friends at your side, anything's possible. And it sounds like you have those.”

In episode five, we learn she's Ingrid Kersh, married to an unpleasant man who mostly cares about how his steak is cooked. Lilly runs to her with the news that Matty—the boy who went missing at the beginning of Welcome to Derry's first episode—has somehow escaped his prolonged captivity in the sewers. What's worse, he's pretty sure one of the kids from the theater, Phil, is still alive down there too.

Mrs. Kersh sensibly tells Lilly to go to the police, but it's clear by now that authorities in Derry have zero patience for kids and their clown nonsense.

Mrs. Kersh, at least, is willing to listen, but she begs Lilly not to go to the sewer in search of Phil. Lilly agrees, but as we saw in episode five, it wouldn't be a show about Pennywise if kids didn't barge into Derry's underground tunnels and find a demonic clown waiting for them.



Episode six begins with another flashback to an earlier Pennywise “cycle,” a glimpse into 1935. We see a younger version of Ingrid Kersh leading a little girl into the Juniper Hill Asylum basement because “this is where the clown told you to meet him.” A red balloon appears, which is never a good sign.

Before we see the full scope of that encounter, we go back to Welcome to Derry's present day. Lily has another freak-out, this time in math class when she sees her father's pickled corpse slithering around in her desk. “Who's gonna help you now, crazy?” the apparition cackles.

Who else but Lilly's best friend in the world, and maybe only friend now that she's on the outs with Ronnie and the rest? Ingrid doesn't answer her door, but Lilly goes inside anyway. Sitting in plain view is a photo album, filled with wedding portraits and the like; the images get older and older as Lilly flips through, until we finally arrive at 1908 and see a man who is clearly Pennywise out of make-up.

It's Ingrid's father. The one with all the homespun advice. This is sinking in as Ingrid suddenly appears; instead of being angry about the intrusion, she gives the distraught Lilly a big hug, telling her, “Whatever it is, it's going to be ok.”

Then, Lilly notices another photo over Ingrid's shoulder. It's the man from 1908, this time in full Pennywise regalia. Ingrid notices her looking at it and asks, “Have you seen him?”

Uh-oh. “You saw him! Oh, sweetheart, you did it! You brought him back!”

Lilly, growing ever more uneasy, spies a vintage clown costume and a pointy white wig; it's exactly what the clown in the cemetery was wearing when the kids went on their photo mission. Later, we saw that same pointy wig spying outside Will's house. It's also what the little girl clown was wearing in the 1908 flashback in episode three.

“I thought he might appear that night. I was worried I might miss him!” Ingrid explains, admitting it was her in the graveyard with the kids. Then, she tells Lilly what we've already guessed: “My father was a carnival performer. He called himself Pennywise the Dancing Clown.” Also, “I adored him, and he was taken from me.”

There's no elaboration beyond that, but we can guess her father was Bob Gray, a name known from It lore that Welcome to Derry's creators have been teasing will appear. While we're pondering what “he was taken” means, we go back into the 1930s and see that Ingrid overheard a young patient, Mabel, talking about Pennywise, only to be scolded, “There are no such things as clowns in pipes.”

Pennywise? As in, Ingrid's long-lost father? With Mabel in tow, Ingrid heads to the basement, and it goes about how you'd expect. The sequence is filmed in black-and-white aside from pops of yellow (Pennywise's eyes) and red (the balloon, Mabel's blood), but despite witnessing a child devoured by a supernatural clown—a child she delivered up to be slaughtered—all it takes is an appearance from “Papa” to get Ingrid on board with the program.

Bob Grey appears to his daughter, calling her “pumpkin” and saying he's missed her. “Don't be scared; I can explain everything. Just open the door and let me in! Everything's gonna be all right!”

There's a literal door that gets opened here, but you can infer that It wormed its way into Ingrid Kersh right then as well, exploiting her desire to reunite with her beloved father again.

“I did what I had to do to see him again,” she explains to Lilly, who is quaking in fright. “If he could just see me once more as his Periwinkle [Ingrid's clown character], remind him of the love we shared, I know that he'll be able to break free.”

Though Ingrid assures Lilly she would never let anything hurt her, how can you believe the word of a woman who's been dressing up in a 50-year-old clown outfit trying to reconnect with her long-dead father? “No one who dies here ever really dies,” she tells Lilly. “Come with me tonight and let me show you!” Lilly's response to this invitation is to slice her with the alien dagger and get the hell out of there.

This surely won't be the only Bob Gray appearance on Welcome to Derry, especially since we now know that Ingrid has been trying to resurrect her father for 27 years—all while encouraging kids to believe the unbelievable, since kids are tasty bait for Pennywise.

We're glad that Lilly has realized in Derry, you'd better be extremely careful before you trust anyone—even someone who appears completely harmless. It's a lesson Beverly Marsh has to learn for herself decades later when she has her own encounter with Mrs. Kersh in It: Chapter Two.

New episodes of It: Welcome to Derry arrive Sundays on HBO and HBO Max.

Now look at us: the Swiss federal cartographers, salaried, pensioned, triple-proofread, still cannot resist smuggling a naked woman and a cheeky marmot into the official topography. And the admisntration? They wait until the perpetrator has safely retired on full index-linked benefits, then solemnly announce the marmot will be "removed in the next revision cycle, pending environmental-impact assessment of the pixel."This is what passes for rebellion inside the European regulatory state: a rodent drawn at 1:25 000 scale that offends precisely no one and will be erased by a civil servant who wasn't even born when it was sketched. Truly the revolutionary spirit of our continent has been reduced to a change-request ticket with fourteen mandatory approvers and a carbon-copy to Bern.I fill in another compliance form and weep for the age when men risked the stake for a badly drawn leviathan.

I read (and re-read, and re-read) the book You Can't Win on recommendation of a HN user. It's about a thief from the late 1800s-early 1900s, and the crimes he and his thief buddies did were pretty creative. A lot of crime is more brute-force than clever, but people can do some pretty interesting things if they want something and don't care if they lose everything.

I really don't understand these types and why they think its "harmless" to do this type of stuff.  I don't want to create potentially more work for myself and I definitely don't want people that work for me to do so.I've also worked with people that did this many times.  It seems to be something like 5-10% of the working population that has this weird near neurotic compulsion to do this sort of "funny-sabotage" at work and cannot seem to resist even at the cost of their job.

I wager this is going to become more and more common as humanity cries against the hyper-specialization and hyper-inferred MEANING on work that may be trivial in scope when juxtaposed that we really only know that ourselves our conscious (or choose your word for whatever illusion we're experiencing). I imagine there exists at least 1 UBER phd gig worker who did not fully take seriously the annotative training work he or she was doing, if you're familiar with that article that made rounds recently.People also change with age, and perhaps in 20 years you may find yourself doing these same things.

At TSMC's European OIP forum this week, Alchip and Ayar Labs demonstrated a fully integrated, in-package optical I/O engine built on TSMC's COUPE platform that enables optical connectivity for next-generation AI accelerators. The solution — which combines Ayar's silicon-photonics TeraPHY IC with Alchip's electrical interface die and a detachable fiber connector — can deliver up to 100 Tb/s of bandwidth per accelerator and connect to other chips using the industry-standard UCIe interface. The solution is aimed at hardware developers who need optical connectivity but cannot build their own optical subsystem from scratch.

When TSMC introduced its Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) framework in 2024, the company primarily targeted large chip developers like AMD or Nvidia that can afford to build their own electronic integrated circuits (EICs) and photonic integrated circuits (PICs), and then order TSMC to build them.

However, many designers of custom accelerators do not have resources for vertical integration (unlike Nvidia, which controls the whole stack of technologies — from compute to scale-out connectivity — with its NVL72, NVL144, and NVL576 platforms) tend to license everything they can and then focus on developing IPs that differentiate their solution from others. This is where the production-ready optical subsystem from Alchip and Ayar Labs comes into play, enabling smaller chip designers to add optical connectivity to their chips relatively easily without investing tens of millions of dollars upfront.

 




The solution jointly developed by Alchip and Ayar Labs is a three-chiplet co-packaged optical I/O subsystem that consists of an Alchip UCIe-A to UCIe-S protocol-converter chiplet that terminates the accelerator's UCIe-A interface and implements scale-up protocols (UALink, PCIe, Ethernet, SUE) over UCIe-S (streaming), an Alchip EIC that provides low-power SerDes, modulation drivers, clocking, and control, and an Ayar Labs TeraPHY PIC that performs the optical modulation and detection using silicon photonics.

The Alchip protocol converter can also carry non-UCIe protocols encapsulated over the UCIe physical interface, so it can work with compute dies that use proprietary protocols. The PIC uses a microring architecture and is delivered with detachable fiber connectors for manufacturability and offers two link options: PAM4 CWDM (100–200 ns per hop, BER < 10⁻⁶) and a DWDM fast-follower (20–30 ns per hop, BER < 10⁻¹²).

The optical subsystem can achieve extreme scale-up, supporting 100+ Tb/s of bandwidth per accelerator and 256+ optical ports per device to connect hundreds of processors across multiple racks and operate them as a single large processor. Alternatively, the companies envision that their solution could be used for memory extenders as well.

The reference design (a mockup) includes two full-reticle accelerator dies, eight HBM stacks, four protocol-converter chiplets, and eight Ayar Labs TeraPHY optical engines, all mounted on a single substrate with integrated passive devices for power integrity. Alchip's system diagrams demonstrate the platform connecting XPU-to-XPU, XPU-to-switch, and switch-to-switch, and even enabling optical memory expansion.

By using the subsystem from Alchip, which will be sold in the form of chiplets, almost any developer of AI accelerators can enable ultra-high-bandwidth, low-latency, and energy-efficient rack-scale and even multi-rack-scale connectivity for their accelerators, which is too costly to develop in-house for a small company.

Dell has been slashing prices on Alienware gaming PCs throughout Black Friday, but it's gone even further for Cyber Monday. Two of its Aurora PCs with Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics cards have just seen a further drop in price, but the affordable option is this Intel-powered rig that's now priced for under $2,000 and for a whopping $730 less than its usual price.

Alienware is a brand that typically sees premium prices, so a discount as big as this one is brilliant to see. The $1,749 sale price on the first model, featuring Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU and 16GB of DDR-5200 RAM, is an absolute steal for under $2,000, with Cyber Monday pushing the price down by $60 compared to the weekend, making it one of the cheapest RTX 5080 PCs you can buy right now.

The 265F is one of Intel's latest CPUs and comes with 20 cores, eight of which are performance cores (good for gaming) with a further 12 efficiency cores, which are good for multi-threaded tasks. This machine also comes with a 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD.

The big focus here, however, is the Nvidia graphics card. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is the second-best consumer GPU, by performance, that you can buy right now, with a whopping 10,752 CUDA cores and 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM. It's a 4K-capable gaming GPU with all the goodies, like full ray tracing and multi-frame gen, thanks to DLSS 4 support.

Featuring a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, this particular Alienware Aurora variant features an Intel Core Ultra 7 265K CPU with 20 cores, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. It also includes a 1000W Platinum-Rated PSU and a 240mm AIO liquid cooler for the CPU.

If you need a bit more of a boost, another model features a $2,399 sale price, compared to as high as $3,199 before. That's a drop of $100 since last week, and a total $800 savings overall, making this a seriously good value option to consider if your budget stretches a little further.

For your money, you're getting the same RTX 5080 build and typical Aurora case design, along with a monstrous 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU and 32GB of DDR5 RAM. This memory is faster than the model above, too, as it's DDR-6400, rated for 6,400M/Ts.

Featuring a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, this particular Alienware Aurora variant features an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. It also includes a 1000W Platinum-Rated PSU and a 240mm AIO liquid cooler for the CPU.

Both SKUs feature a 1000W platinum-rated power supply, along with a 240mm liquid cooler with Alienware's AlienFX lighting, which you can customize and control using the Alienware Command Center app. While these are the prices for these configurations, you can customize your rigs to suit your needs, although you will see updated pricing as a result.

You will struggle to find better prices on RTX 5080-powered gaming PCs with these specs for Cyber Monday, especially on the sub-$2000 model. If you're thinking about upgrading your setup, a pre-built rig from a trusted gaming brand like this could be one of your best options, but don't expect these prices to stick around for very long.

South Korean e-commerce platform Coupang over the weekend said nearly 34 million Korean customers' personal information had been leaked in a data breach that had been ongoing for more than five months.

The company said it first detected the unauthorized exposure of 4,500 user accounts on November 18, but a subsequent investigation revealed that the breach had actually compromised about 33.7 million customer accounts in South Korea. 

The breach affected customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories, per Coupang. More sensitive data like payment information, credit card numbers, and login credentials was not compromised and remains secure, the company said.

Coupang said it has reported the incident to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), and the National Police Agency.

One of South Korea's biggest e-commerce platforms, Coupang also offers a quick-commerce service called “Rocket Delivery” in the country, and also operates its marketplace in Japan and Taiwan. A Coupang spokesperson told TechCrunch that the investigation has found no evidence that consumer data from Coupang Taiwan or Rocket Now was affected in the data breach.

“According to the investigation so far, it is believed that unauthorized access to personal information began on June 24, 2025, via overseas servers,” the company said. “Coupang blocked the unauthorized access route, strengthened internal monitoring, and retained experts from a leading independent security firm.”

Police have reportedly identified at least one suspect, a former Chinese Coupang employee now abroad, after launching an investigation following a November 18 complaint.

This is the latest in a string of cybersecurity incidents in South Korea this year. Coupang itself has suffered several data breaches that have exposed customer and delivery drivers' information in previous years. Past incidents included leaks between 2020 and 2021, and most recently in December 2023, when its seller management system compromised the personal information of more than 22,000 customers.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

A US telecom company trained an AI model on years of inmates' phone and video calls and is now piloting that model to scan their calls, texts, and emails in the hope of predicting and preventing crimes. 

Securus Technologies president Kevin Elder told MIT Technology Review that the company began building its AI tools in 2023, using its massive database of recorded calls to train AI models to detect criminal activity. It created one model, for example, using seven years of calls made by inmates in the Texas prison system, but it has been working on building other state- or county-specific models.

Over the past year, Elder says, Securus has been piloting the AI tools to monitor inmate conversations in real time (the company declined to specify where this is taking place, but its customers include jails holding people awaiting trial, prisons for those serving sentences, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities).

“We can point that large language model at an entire treasure trove [of data],” Elder says, “to detect and understand when crimes are being thought about or contemplated, so that you're catching it much earlier in the cycle.” 

As with its other monitoring tools, investigators at detention facilities can deploy the AI features to monitor randomly selected conversations or those of individuals suspected by facility investigators of criminal activity, according to Elder. The model will analyze phone and video calls, text messages, and emails and then flag sections for human agents to review. These agents then send them to investigators for follow-up. 

In an interview, Elder said Securus' monitoring efforts have helped disrupt human trafficking and gang activities organized from within prisons, among other crimes, and said its tools are also used to identify prison staff who are bringing in contraband. But the company did not provide MIT Technology Review with any cases specifically uncovered by its new AI models. 

People in prison, and those they call, are notified that their conversations are recorded. But this doesn't mean they're aware that those conversations could be used to train an AI model, says Bianca Tylek, executive director of the prison rights advocacy group Worth Rises. 

“That's coercive consent; there's literally no other way you can communicate with your family,” Tylek says. And since inmates in the vast majority of states pay for these calls, she adds, “not only are you not compensating them for the use of their data, but you're actually charging them while collecting their data.”

A Securus spokesperson said the use of data to train the tool "is not focused on surveilling or targeting specific individuals, but rather on identifying broader patterns, anomalies, and unlawful behaviors across the entire communication system." They added that correctional facilities determine their own recording and monitoring policies, which Securus follows, and did not directly answer whether inmates can opt out of having their recordings used to train AI.

Other advocates for inmates say Securus has a history of violating their civil liberties. For example, leaks of its recordings databases showed the company had improperly recorded thousands of calls between inmates and their attorneys. Corene Kendrick, the deputy director of the ACLU's National Prison Project, says that the new AI system enables a system of invasive surveillance, and courts have specified few limits to this power.

“[Are we] going to stop crime before it happens because we're monitoring every utterance and thought of incarcerated people?” Kendrick says. “I think this is one of many situations where the technology is way far ahead of the law.”

The company spokesperson said the tool's function is to make monitoring more efficient amid staffing shortages, “not to surveil individuals without cause.”

Securus will have an easier time funding its AI tool thanks to the company's recent win in a battle with regulators over how telecom companies can spend the money they collect from inmates' calls.

In 2024, the Federal Communications Commission issued a major reform, shaped and lauded by advocates for prisoners' rights, that forbade telecoms from passing the costs of recording and surveilling calls on to inmates. Companies were allowed to continue to charge inmates a capped rate for calls, but prisons and jails were ordered to pay for most security costs out of their own budgets.

Negative reactions to this change were swift. Associations of sheriffs (who typically run county jails) complained they could no longer afford proper monitoring of calls, and attorneys general from 14 states sued over the ruling. Some prisons and jails warned they would cut off access to phone calls. 

While it was building and piloting its AI tool, Securus held meetings with the FCC and lobbied for a rule change, arguing that the 2024 reform went too far and asking that the agency again allow companies to use fees collected from inmates to pay for security. 

In June, Brendan Carr, whom President Donald Trump appointed to lead the FCC, said it would postpone all deadlines for jails and prisons to adopt the 2024 reforms, and even signaled that the agency wants to help telecom companies fund their AI surveillance efforts with the fees paid by inmates. In a press release, Carr wrote that rolling back the 2024 reforms would “lead to broader adoption of beneficial public safety tools that include advanced AI and machine learning.”

On October 28, the agency went further: It voted to pass new, higher rate caps and allow companies like Securus to pass security costs relating to recording and monitoring of calls—like storing recordings, transcribing them, or building AI tools to analyze such calls, for example—on to inmates. A spokesperson for Securus told MIT Technology Review that the company aims to balance affordability with the need to fund essential safety and security tools. “These tools, which include our advanced monitoring and AI capabilities, are fundamental to maintaining secure facilities for incarcerated individuals and correctional staff and to protecting the public,” they wrote.

FCC commissioner Anna Gomez dissented in last month's ruling. “Law enforcement,” she wrote in a statement, “should foot the bill for unrelated security and safety costs, not the families of incarcerated people.”

The FCC will be seeking comment on these new rules before they take final effect.  

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Competition is heating up, with Mattel and OpenAI expected to launch a product for kids this year.

Step back into the 1980s with this retro mini LCD monitor for your desk

The Cyber Monday sales are officially here, but if you've already filled your boots up with the big stuff like a new PC or a keyboard, what else is there to buy? This 3.5-inch Hagibis mini screen is what you need. This is both a retro desk ornament and a fully-functional LCD display with a built-in SD card reader and USB hub, and it's plummeted in price to a new record low.

Techies are the absolute target market for a gadget like this 3.5.-inch Hagibis mini monitor, especially with a $79.99 sales price, down from as high as $109.99 earlier in the year, according to Camelcamelcamel's data. Sure, this Hagibis display might not be able to compete with the big OLED displays, and it certainly isn't the biggest monitor you'll see on sale, but its design is a lovely nostalgic throwback, with a set of seriously good features that would make for a brilliant addition to your setup.

This retro Hagibis monitor features a 3.5-inch IPS LCD display with a native resolution of 960 x 640, although it can scale up to 2,560 x 1,600 if you like punishing your eyes. It also includes several USB-A and USB-C ports with Gen 3.1 speeds, an HDMI port, as well as SD and TF card readers.

That's mainly down to its 3.5-inch IPS panel and a 178° viewing angle. While the size obviously restricts you from using it as your daily driver, it features support for resolutions stretching from 800 x 600 to 2,560 x 1,600, although the screen's native resolution is 960 x 640. You're probably going to want to stick to that or closer for the sharpest image, but your mileage may vary, so it's worth testing it out to see what works best, and what you can actually end up reading on-screen if you do.

This Hagibis monitor also has a great set of connections with it, too, allowing you to use it as an attractive desk hub. It has SD and TF card slots, a USB-C port, and two USB-A ports on the front with Gen 3.1 speeds. At the rear, it features a 5V USB-C power connector, HDMI port, as well as a 3.5aux audio connector for speakers and headphones, as well as a USB-C port labeled as host, which you'll need to use to hook it up to your PC for it to work as a USB hub.

I can already think of a dozen use cases for a monitor like this. First, it looks fantastic, sitting on your desk like some kind of 1980s throwback. From a more practical point of view, however, this is perfect for any small-size tasks or notifications you need.

I could see myself using this as a screen for an alarm clock or timer app, to monitor a running Discord chat, as a photo album, or to keep an eye on PC health with temperature and resource usage stats. You could also use it for streaming video, especially if you're using your main monitor for more important things. The display also has built-in widgets you can fall back to, including digital clock and ambient temperature widgets.

This is a gorgeously retro, fully functional mini monitor and hub for your PC or laptop. This Hagibis display's $79.99 sale price is only here for Cyber Monday, however, so if it doesn't sell out, you're going to want to jump on it now before the deal runs out.

A new report from the New York Times digs into the financial disclosures of President Trump's AI and crypto czar, PayPal Mafia founding member David Sacks, and finds ample reason to doubt that he could possibly advise anyone, let alone the president, on AI and crypto impartially. 

One telling detail in the Times' piece is that Sacks or his venture capital firm Craft Ventures have 438 software or hardware company investments involving companies that aren't necessarily AI companies, but pitch themselves as AI companies anyway, or have AI in their names. This is a headache-inducing factoid because over the past two years, seemingly every tech startup has pivoted to AI. In fact, companies now bend the definition of “AI” until it breaks to stay relevant.

So the question isn't just whether or not Sacks necessarily profits from the questionable investments in the Times report. He's a billionaire podcaster whose show, “All-In,” is a bunch of perceived insider tech bros yukking it up about politics and the markets. The presence of such a guy—who everyone knows has a massive tech-based portfolio of investments—totally guarantees the perception that public policy is being shaped by self-dealing in the tech world, which in turn distorts common sense.

At any rate, it's hard to give him the benefit of the doubt like this, because there do appear to be conflicts. (A spokesperson denied this to the Times, for the record.)The Times claims that Sacks' stake in AI companies—apparently even ones that he retains after unloading some of his investments for ethical reasons—have gone up in value or stand to go up in value due to his recommended policies. His portfolio, and the portfolio of his company still have “708 tech investments,” the Times says, along with “449 stakes in companies with ties to artificial intelligence,” plus the aforementioned 438 “software or hardware” companies that just happen to love AI.On some level, it feels absurd to talk about this right now. Anti-corruption protesters picketed an event where Trump spoke at a dinner full of crypto fans who bought a total of $148 Million in Trump's own cryptocurrency in order to be allowed to attend. There have been corruption accusations over Trump's questionable pardon of Changpeng “CZ” Zhao while he still appears to be engaging in the practices that got him convicted. Trump has tried to swat away at least one question from the press about this, and has done so with a certain lack of grace, even for Trump. But even with more than the usual ambient chatter about corruption happening, it's still worth pointing out that if someone is rich, and gets richer from owning stakes in companies, then unless you happen to really like that person, they'll come across as untrustworthy if they are in any way in charge of government policy while all that wealth accumulation happens. (And this is true of Nancy Pelosi and her publicly-disclosed portfolio as well.)

For my money, the marquee example from the Times piece is Sack's stake in Anduril Industries, which makes AI-powered night vision goggles.Anduril Industries is part of the Craft Ventures portfolio, and even has its own page on the company's website. Also, the Trump A.I. Action Plan—which Sacks masterminded—pushes for U.S.-based AI companies to contract with the Pentagon. In September, Anduril announced that the Pentagon was paying it $159 million to design prototypes for the government. “This award represents the largest effort of its kind to equip every soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities—fusing the best of night vision, augmented reality, and AI into a single system,” Anduril's announcement says.This is ostensibly okay, however, because as an Anduril spokesperson named Shannon Prior told the Times, Anduril got the contract not because Sacks has a stake in it, but because company founder Palmer Luckey, is “the world's best virtual reality headset designer,” and contracting with Anduril was an “obvious idea.” Plus Anduril had already been in talks with the Army before the AI Action Plan was rolled out, Prior says. When it comes to taking solace in these excuses, your mileage may vary. When you zoom out, it looks like this: As an advisor, Trump hired a venture capitalist who held a $500,000-per-couple dinner for him last year in San Francisco. It turns out that guy has a stake in a company that makes AI night vision goggles. When he writes you an AI action plan calling for AI in the military, and your Pentagon ends up contracting with that very company, that's just sensible government policy. After all, the military needs AI-powered night vision goggles, doesn't it?

In a reality where David Sacks works for Donald Trump's White House, of course the government thinks the military needs that. But it's easy to imagine another reality where the White House AI and crypto czar is someone else, or—gasp—there is no AI and crypto czar. In this reality, perhaps, “Hey wait, does it serve the public's interest to pay $159 million in an attempt to shoehorn AI into night vision goggles?” is a question that at least gets asked.

The Czech Republic's largest digital art festival became an international phenomenon this year as it once again transformed the center of Prague into a laboratory for visual experimentation.

The 13th edition of the Signal Festival, which took place from October 16 to 19, presented 20 installations by Czech and international artists, including projections on a cloud of mist and interactive objects that responded to the movements of viewers.

The Lone Soul Disco performance was choreographed by Viktor Konvalinka.

The Signal Festival mixed dance, art, and interactive exibits.

And thanks to a mention in Dan Brown's new novel, The Secret of Secrets, the festival has gained even more global recognition. Just a few weeks after the release of Brown's new bestseller set in contemporary Prague, viewers were able to see for themselves what drew the popular writer to the festival, which is the largest Czech and Central European showcase of digital art. In one passage, the Signal Festival has a cameo appearance when the novel's protagonist recalls attending an event at the 2024 edition.

“We're happy about it,” festival director Martin Pošta says about the mention. “It's a kind of recognition.” Not that the event needed promotion, even in one of the most anticipated novels of recent years. The organizers have yet to share the number of visitors to the festival this year, but the four-day event typically attracts half a million visitors.

On the final day, there was a long queue in front of the monumental installation Tristan's Ascension by American video art pioneer Bill Viola before it opened for the evening, even though it was a ticketed event. In the Church of St. Salvator in the Convent of St. Agnes, visitors could watch a Christ-like figure rise upwards, streams of water defying gravity along with him, all projected on a huge screen.

The festival premiere took place on the Vltava River near the Dvořák Embankment. Taiwan's Peppercorns Interactive Media Art presented a projection on a cloud of mist called Tzolk'in Light. While creators of other light installations have to deal with the challenges of buildings—their irregular surfaces, decorative details, and awkward cornices—projecting onto water droplets is a challenge of a different kind with artists having to give up control over the resulting image. The shape and depth of the Peppercorns' work depended on the wind at any given moment, which determined how much of the scene was revealed to viewers and how much simply blown away. The reward, however, was an extraordinary 3D spectacle reminiscent of a hologram—something that can't be achieved with video projections on static and flat buildings.

Another premiere event was a projection on the tower of the Old Town Hall, created for the festival by the Italian studio mammasONica. It transformed the 230-foot structure into a kaleidoscope of blue, green, red, and white surfaces. A short distance away, on Republic Square, Peppercorns had another installation. On a circular LED installation, they projected a work entitled Between Mountains and Seas, which recounted the history of Taiwan.

An immersive projection MLHA (Czech for “fog”) was created especially for the historic courtyard of the Clam-Gallas Palace. The installation artist Robert Seidel and sound producer Nikolai von Sallwitz, both from Germany, combined Baroque and contemporary aesthetics to transform the courtyard into a space charged with digital light and sound.

While city center locations were mainly dedicated to works by foreign artists, Czech artists could be found at those in Prague's Vinohrady neighborhood. Artist Pavla Sceranková prepared an interactive installation called Constellation for the Rieger Gardens, allowing viewers to create their own light constellations by interacting with a system of kinetic objects.

The Rafani collective, known for its political and performative interventions in public spaces, presented the performance piece Grill Flame, in which two large trucks spewing flames were parked near the Vinohrady water tower. The members of the group used an ancient form of light—open flames—and with the help of flamethrowers and apocalyptic electronic sound effects, set fire to objects resembling voodoo dolls.

The Rafani collective perform some pyrotechnics.

Antonín Kindl created an interactive object called EYE for Svatopluk Čech Park, near Jiřího z Poděbrad Square, that consisted of a sphere on spidery legs emitting beams of light in response to nearby activity. The creature was accompanied by a dramatic robotic voice and cosmic sound effects.

The organizers have already announced that the 14th edition of the Signal Festival will take place from October 15 to 18, 2026. In the meantime, however, they have opened a permanent gallery called Signal Space in the center of Prague. The Czech capital's first space dedicated to digital and light art presents a selection of the best works from previous editions of the festival.

Cancer remains one of the most critical global public health challenges, exerting profound social, economic, and clinical burdens while limiting gains in human life expectancy. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, treatment failure and cancer recurrence are frequently driven by a subset of resistant tumor cells that evade conventional programmed cell death pathways. The scientific community has thus been actively exploring strategies to engage alternative intracellular "death switches" within malignant cells. In recent years, the discovery of novel immunogenic cell death modalities—such as pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis—has reinvigorated anticancer efforts. These mechanisms can remodel the tumor microenvironment, effectively converting immunologically "cold" tumors into "hot" ones, thereby augmenting the efficacy of immunotherapy.

In a groundbreaking 2024 study published in Science, a new form of cell death, termed triaptosis, was first reported. The study revealed that menadione, a common precursor of vitamin K, acts as a potent pro-oxidant that selectively oxidizes a key kinase, PIK3C3/VPS34. This oxidation disrupts endosomal function, impairing cargo sorting and transport, and ultimately leads to the accumulation of massive intracellular vacuoles, culminating in plasma membrane rupture and cell death. This process is mechanistically distinct from all previously known cell death pathways. In a mouse model of prostate cancer, oral administration of menadione to induce triaptosis resulted in superior tumor control compared to standard clinical regimens, with a favorable safety profile, highlighting its promising translational potential.

In this context, the research team led by Associate Professor Lin-Lin Bu fromWuhan University School and Hospital of Stomatology, has published a comprehensive review entitled "Triaptosis and Cancer: Next Hope?" in the journal Research. This article systematically elaborates the triaptosis pathway from molecular mechanism to therapeutic application, detailing its signaling cascade, discussing the central role of oxidative stress homeostasis in cancer, and offering a forward-looking perspective on future directions—collectively underscoring the compelling potential of triaptosis as a novel anticancer strategy.

The mechanism of triaptosis targets a vulnerability inherent in many cancer cells. To sustain rapid proliferation, cancer cells often exhibit a heightened dependence on their endomembrane trafficking system. By specifically disrupting endosomal function, triaptosis may precisely strike this "Achilles' heel." Moreover, triaptosis holds considerable promise for combination with immunotherapy. Although its immunogenic potential remains unverified, endosomes play an indispensable role in antigen presentation and immune cell activation. Therefore, inducing triaptosis may not only kill tumor cells but also stimulate a specific antitumor immune response, potentially synergizing with immune checkpoint inhibitors to effectively convert "cold" tumors into "hot" ones. Furthermore, since triaptosis operates independently of canonical apoptotic pathways, it may offer a final-line therapeutic option for patients resistant to existing treatments.

The review also outlines future research directions concerning the mechanism and targeting of triaptosis. Subsequent studies will focus on identifying and developing novel agents that can efficiently and selectively induce triaptosis. To maximize efficacy and minimize side effects, intelligent drug delivery systems capable of precise tumor targeting should be engineered. In addition, elucidating the crosstalk between triaptosis and other cell death modalities may inform the design of sophisticated combination therapies and offer new avenues to overcome treatment resistance. It is worth noting that preliminary evidence suggests menadione also shows efficacy in a non-cancer disease, indicating that the implications of triaptosis may extend well beyond oncology.

The discovery of triaptosis not only expands our understanding of fundamental biological processes governing cell death but also represents a promising strategy in the fight against cancer. It is our hope that triaptosis-based therapeutic innovations will soon bridge the gap between bench and bedside, offering renewed hope for cancer patients as the "next hope" in oncology.

For decades, lung cancer has been associated with stigma, anxiety, and loss. Advances in screening, therapeutics, and survivorship have created a new reality; lung cancer is treatable, survivable, and increasingly understood as a chronic disease for many. A special issue of the Journal of the American College of Radiology, published by Elsevier and in collaboration with the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT), details this transformation, outlining how radiology is moving beyond disease detection to providing equitable care and becoming a champion of patient dignity.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of premature death as measured by years of life lost. Lung cancer is by far the most common cause of cancer deaths, responsible for the deaths of more people in the United States every year than the next two causes of cancer death combined among both men and women. In 2025, there were a projected 226,650 lung cancer cases diagnosed and 124,730 lung cancer deaths.

A crosscutting theme reflected in this special issue is the move from counting scans to measuring impact across the full continuum of care.

Lung cancer screening has matured into a system of care. It is not merely about increasing uptake; it is about ensuring that those who are screened are reached equitably, managed appropriately, and supported holistically. The next leap is ensuring every patient, in every setting, experiences screening as humane, coordinated, and equitable."

Lisa Carter-Bawa, PhD, MPH, Co-Guest Editor, Center for Discovery and Innovation at Hackensack Meridian Health, Nutley, NJ, and Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC

Contributors to the special issue identify the following four core principles defining the transformation of the lung cancer screening and treatment landscape:

The special issue's articles detail the full scope of lung cancer screening, covering eligibility requirements (including the potential to leverage high mammography participation to engage women), strategies for increasing uptake through community-based interventions and state-level policy, a discussion of screening harms such as "scanxiety" as well as radiation dose management, and persistent implementation issues like system operability, challenges in rural cross-specialty collaboration, and cannabis use among screened individuals.

Co-Guest Editor Ashley Prosper, MD, Department of Radiological Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, notes, "Clinical trials and reports from real-world screening programs have confirmed that lung cancer screening is a worthwhile endeavor with the potential to significantly improve lung cancer outcomes. Maximizing this positive impact requires a combination of strategic multidisciplinary partnerships, effective communication, and informatics tools-closing data gaps between radiology, primary care, and oncology, which are foundational to timely diagnosis, appropriate follow-up, and equitable outcomes."

Co-Guest Editor Julie Barta, MD, Jane and Leonard Korman Respiratory Institute, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, observes that "Although we know that lung cancer screening improves early detection and reduces lung cancer mortality, there is still much work to do in understanding how we identify high-risk patients for screening and deliver high-quality care."

The contributors emphasize that achieving this systemic transformation requires a unified effort to dismantle the historical stigma and fear associated with the disease and replace it with a message of hope.

"Lung cancer is treatable and survivable. Everyone and every patient deserve to know that. Radiologists and their teams are an integral part of the medical community and, together with our primary care clinicians and specialty colleagues, we can help to increase knowledge and awareness of what is possible and replace nihilism and stigma with empathy and hope for patients and their families," adds Ella A. Kazerooni, MD, MS, Chair, American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT), and Terry M. Silver Professor of Radiology and Professor of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.

"The question is no longer whether lung cancer screening saves lives-it does- but how we ensure that its benefits are realized broadly, equitably, and with dignity. Radiology is uniquely positioned to lead this charge," concludes Dr. Carter-Bawa.

In an increasingly acute surgeon shortage, artificial intelligence could help fill the gap, coaching medical students as they practice surgical techniques.

A new tool, trained on videos of expert surgeons at work, offers students real-time personalized advice as they practice suturing. Initial trials suggest AI can be a powerful substitute teacher for more experienced students.

"We're at a pivotal time. The provider shortage is ever increasing and we need to find new ways to provide more and better opportunities for practice. Right now, an attending surgeon who already is short on time needs to come in and watch students practice, and rate them, and give them detailed feedback-that just doesn't scale," said senior author Mathias Unberath, an expert in AI assisted medicine who focuses on how people interact with AI. "The next best thing might be our explainable AI that shows students how their work deviates from expert surgeons."

Developed at Johns Hopkins University, the pioneering technology was showcased and honored at the recent International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention.

Currently many medical students watch videos of experts performing surgery and try to imitate what they see. There are even existing AI models that will rate students, but according to Unberath they fall short because they don't tell students what they're doing right or wrong.

"These models can tell you if you have high or low skill, but they struggle with telling you why," he said. "If we want to enable meaningful self-training, we need to help learners understand what they need to focus on and why."

The team's model incorporates what's known as "explainable AI," an approach to AI that – in this example – will rate how well a student closes a wound and then also tell them precisely how to improve.

The team trained their model by tracking the hand movements of expert surgeons as they closed incisions. When students try the same task, the AI texts them immediately to tell them how they compared to an expert and how to refine their technique.

Learners want someone to tell them objectively how they did. We can calculate their performance before and after the intervention and see if they are moving closer to expert practice."

Catalina Gomez, first author, a Johns Hopkins PhD student in computer science

The team performed a first-of-its-kind study to see if students learned better from the AI or by watching videos. They randomly assigned 12 medical students with suturing experience to train with one of the two methods.

All participants practiced closing an incision with stitches. Some got immediate AI feedback while others tried to compare what they did to a surgeon in a video. Then everyone tried suturing again.

Compared to students who watched videos, some students coached by AI, those with more experience, learned much faster.

"In some individuals the AI feedback has a big effect," Unberath said. "Beginner students still struggled with the task but students with a solid foundation in surgery, who are at the point where they can incorporate the advice, it had a great impact."

Next the team plans to refine the model to make it easier to use. They hope to eventually create a version that students could use at home.

"We'd like to offer computer vision and AI technology that allows someone to practice in the comfort of their home with a suturing kit and a smart phone," Unberath said. "This will help us scale up training in the medical fields. It's really about how can we use this technology to solve problems."

A programme of smell screening, awareness campaigns and health policies could improve the mental and physical health of millions - according to research led by the University of East Anglia.

Smell dysfunction is present in more than 130 neurological, somatic and hereditary disorders, with some evidence suggesting a causal role.

But a new paper published today reveals how smell is overlooked as a "Cinderella sense" in public health.

And researchers are calling for a worldwide campaign to put smell health on the map - with screening, education and awareness at its core.

A good sense of smell is vital for physical and mental health, and social wellbeing.

However, smell remains a Cinderella sense which has lagged behind sight and hearing in terms of its perceived importance.

Smell health underpins good nutrition, cognitive function, and psychological resilience. But national public health agendas around the world rarely consider smell health.

Even before the emergence of Covid-19, smell disorders were very common but under-rated, under-researched, and under-treated sensory loss.

Smell issues occur in at least 139 different neurological, physical, and inherited conditions. Research suggests smell loss may play a causal role because it often appears early and can predict future health issues.

Increasing evidence has shown that smell loss is an independent risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, increased frailty and reduced longevity."

Prof Carl Philpott, lead researcher from UEA's Norwich Medical School

To address this gap, the team are calling for education, awareness campaigns, and targeted public health policies that make smell health a priority.

Prof Philpott said: "The sense of smell should be promoted as an essential pillar of health, as it enables good nutrition and cognitive and psychological well-being.

"We recommend developing smell health educational programmes and awareness campaigns, introducing smell screening and developing and implementing smell health policies across all sectors of society.

"Inclusive efforts are particularly needed to ensure equity and diversity, particularly given the current demographic as those seeking help are typically not from a diverse cross-section of the community," he added.'The Need to Promote Olfactory Health in Public Health Agendas Across the Globe' is published in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology.

An international research team led by RMIT University have created tiny particles, known as nanodots, made from a metallic compound that can kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells largely unharmed.

While this work is still at the cell-culture stage – it hasn't been tested in animals or people – it points to a new strategy for designing cancer treatments that exploit cancer's own weaknesses.

The particles are made from molybdenum oxide, a compound based on a rare metal called molybdenum, which is often used in electronics and alloys.

The study's lead researcher Professor Jian Zhen Ou and Dr Baoyue Zhang, from the School of Engineering, said tweaking the chemical makeup made the particles release reactive oxygen molecules – unstable forms of oxygen that can damage cell components and trigger cell death.

In tests, the particles killed three times more cervical cancer cells than healthy cells over 24 hours. Importantly, they worked without needing light, which is unusual for this kind of technology.

Cancer cells already live under higher stress than healthy ones.

Our particles push that stress a little further – enough to trigger self-destruction in cancer cells, while healthy cells cope just fine."

Dr. Baoyue Zhang, School of Engineering, RMIT University

The collaboration involved Dr Shwathy Ramesan at The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne and researchers from institutions in China including Southeast University, Hong Kong Baptist University and Xidian University, with support from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Optical Microcombs (COMBS).

"The result was particles that generate oxidative stress selectively in cancer cells under lab conditions," she said.

The team adjusted the recipe of the metal oxide, adding tiny amounts of hydrogen and ammonium.

This fine tuning changed how the particles handled electrons, helping them produce more of the reactive oxygen molecules that drive cancer cells into apoptosis – the body's natural clean-up process for damaged cells.

In another test, the same particles broke down a blue dye by 90 per cent in just 20 minutes, showing how powerful their reactions can be even in darkness.

Most current cancer treatments affect both cancerous and healthy tissue. Technologies that more selectively stress cancer cells could lead to gentler, more targeted therapies.

Because these particles are based on a common metal oxide rather than expensive or toxic noble metals like gold or silver, they could also be cheaper and safer to develop.

The COMBS team at RMIT is continuing this work, with next steps including:

New research among older adults with sleep apnea reveals that verbal memory performance is significantly worse in women - but not in men - who also have insomnia.

Results show that older adults with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea - often referred to as COMISA - demonstrated worse memory performance than those with sleep apnea alone. This interaction remained significant even after adjusting for age, body mass index, sleep apnea severity, and education. However, when analyzed by sex, COMISA was significantly associated with worse verbal memory outcomes in women, but not in men.

"We expected that having both insomnia and sleep apnea would worsen memory for everyone, but only older women showed this vulnerability. That was striking, especially because women typically outperform men on verbal memory tasks," said lead author Breanna Holloway, who has a doctorate in clinical psychology and behavioral medicine and is a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego School of Medicine. "The fact that COMISA seemed to offset that advantage hints at a hidden sleep-related pathway to cognitive decline in women. Prior studies have shown increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease in women with untreated sleep apnea."

The study is published in the Dec. 1 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, the official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

The study involved 110 older adults between the ages of 65 and 83 who were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. They completed an overnight sleep study and cognitive testing, and insomnia and verbal memory were assessed using validated tools. COMISA was present in 37% of participants.

According to the authors, sex differences in sleep architecture may explain the cognitive vulnerability observed in women with COMISA. Post hoc analyses revealed that women with COMISA had reduced rapid eye movement sleep and more slow wave sleep compared with men, underscoring the importance of considering sex-specific patterns when evaluating COMISA.

These results point to an overlooked risk in women with both insomnia and sleep apnea. Because women are more likely to have insomnia and often go undiagnosed for sleep apnea, recognizing and treating COMISA early could help protect memory and reduce dementia risk."

Breanna Holloway, lead author

The researchers noted that the findings support sex-specific screening and treatment strategies.

Dr. Atul Malhotra, the Peter C. Farrell Presidential Endowed Chair in Pulmonary Medicine at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and pulmonologist at UC San Diego Health, was the principal investigator for this study.

One of the largest MRI-based studies comparing knee injuries between men and women reveals surprising differences in injury patterns based on gender and age. The findings, which can be used to improve risk assessment and develop early intervention strategies, will be presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

In recent years, we've grown more interested in the differences in knee injuries between men and women. The majority of past research has focused on men, but as we expand our focus to include women, the more we see that they have different risk profiles and are prone to different injuries."

Jenifer Pitman, M.D., study co-author, assistant professor of radiology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institute in Baltimore, Maryland

The study included 13,549 consecutive routine knee MRI exams performed between 2019 and 2024 at four outpatient radiology facilities affiliated with Johns Hopkins Hospital. The patients reported knee pain as their chief complaint. The researchers extracted the following features from radiology reports: tears in or injuries to the medial and lateral menisci, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament complex, and extensor mechanism or patellofemoral dislocation.

The ACL is a major ligament in the knee that connects the thigh bone to the shin and provides stability, especially during twisting, jumping, sudden stops or changes in direction. ACL injuries are common in sports and can cause pain, swelling and instability in the knee. The menisci are C-shaped pieces of cartilage on the inner (medial) and outer (lateral) side of the knee that act like shock absorbers, cushioning the joint and providing stability. Tears in the menisci can happen with twisting injuries or gradual wear and tear over time.

Analysis of the MRI reports revealed that specific injuries were observed more often in men compared to women, including ACL tears alone, ACL tear with medial meniscal tear or ACL tear with lateral meniscal tear.

"We saw more ACL tears in men especially in the 20- to 40-year-old age group, which is contrary to what's been reported in the literature," said first author Ali Ghasemi, M.D., postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins. "Prior studies focused on sports-related injuries have shown that young women athletes have increased rates of and a greater risk for ACL tears. However, our results show a significantly higher prevalence of ACL injuries in male patients across all age groups."

Dr. Pitman theorized the discrepancy between their research and previous studies may be due to broadening their focus beyond sports-related knee injuries. The Johns Hopkins researchers studied all patients with knee pain, regardless of age or cause of injury.

Men had a greater number of injuries overall.

The researchers also found that meniscal and MCL tears occurred more frequently in men under 40 and among older women.

"In younger patients, meniscal and MCL tears were more commonly seen in men, while in older patients, women had more of these types of tears than men, which was unexpected," Dr. Ghasemi said.

The findings suggest that older women are more prone to injuries that lead to joint degeneration over time.

"Both men and women should take precautions to avoid high-impact injuries, especially during sports or physical activity and women, especially over 40, should pay attention to joint health and consider incorporating dedicated strength training to help protect their knees as they age," Dr. Pitman said.

Recognizing the injury patterns may help radiologists and clinicians tailor imaging protocols, risk assessments and early intervention strategies to optimize patient outcomes.

"The pre-established notion that ACL tears are more common in younger women may not be the case 100% of the time," Dr. Pitman said. "Radiologists can also expect to see more frequent meniscal pathology and arthritis in older women."

The researchers are continuing their investigation into knee injury patterns by gender, analyzing demographic information and patient history to better understand trends in injury patterns.

Dr. Pitman said that athletes should consider working with a health professional to build balanced strength around the knee. She advises individuals-especially older patients-with knee pain to see their physician.

"If you're having knee pain, don't just brush it off or attribute it to old age," she said. "We've seen higher rates of meniscal tears, in particular, in women 40 years and older."

Other co-authors are Shivani Ahlawat, M.D., and Laura M. Fayad, M.D.

Patients with major depressive disorder, including those who have not responded to first-line antidepressants, may benefit from short-term nitrous oxide treatment, a major meta-analysis led by the University of Birmingham has found.

The new paper published in eBioMedicine today has assessed the best available clinical information to show how clinically administered nitrous oxide (N2O) can offer fast-acting depressive symptom relief for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). 

TRD is characterised as depression that isn't effectively managed after a patient tries two different antidepressants. It affects approximately 48% of UK patients who experience limited benefit from standard treatments, according to a previous study* led by the research team. 

Researchers from the University of Birmingham, University of Oxford, and Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust assessed seven clinical trials and four protocol papers published by investigators from around the world. Each research study looked at the use of nitrous oxide, also used as pain relief in a range of medical situations, for treating depressive disorders, including MDD, TRD and bipolar depression.

The team found that a single treatment of inhaled clinical nitrous oxide at 50% concentration (in three trials), produced rapid and significant reductions in depressive symptoms within 24 hours, although these effects were not sustained at one week. In contrast, repeated dosing over several weeks led to more durable improvements, suggesting that multiple treatment sessions (compared to a single dose) may be required to maintain clinical benefit. It is thought to target glutamate receptors in a similar way to ketamine, another rapid-acting antidepressant, and this may help explain why improvements in mood can be observed soon after inhalation. 

Depression is a debilitating illness, made even more so by the fact that antidepressants make no meaningful difference for almost half of all patients diagnosed with it. There is a growing body of research on repurposing treatments from other clinical domains to alleviate low mood. This study brings together the best possible evidence indicating that nitrous oxide has the potential to provide swift and clinically significant short-term improvements in patients with severe depression. 

Our analyses show that nitrous oxide could form part of a new generation of rapid-acting treatments for depression. Importantly, it provides a foundation for future trials to investigate repeated and carefully managed dosing strategies that can further determine how best to use this treatment in clinical practice for patients who don't respond to conventional interventions."

Kiranpreet Gill, a PhD researcher funded by the Medical Research Council at the University of Birmingham and first author of the study

The meta-analysis of studies found strong evidence for short-term improvements in mood following nitrous oxide administration. Due to the limited number of existing trials, there was notable variability in how depressive symptoms were measured and reported, as well as in the timing of these assessments. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose, nitrous oxide's long-term safety, and the best way to integrate it into existing treatment pathways. 

The team also examined the safety and potential side effects of nitrous oxide. Some patients experienced side effects such as nausea, dizziness and headaches, all of which passed quickly and resolved without medical intervention. While higher dosing (at 50% concentration) increased the likelihood of these side effects, none of the studies reported any short-term safety concerns. The researchers emphasised that longer-term safety must be assessed through future studies with extended follow-up periods. 

Professor Steven Marwaha from the University of Birmingham, Honorary Consultant Psychiatrist at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust, and senior author of the study said: "This is a significant milestone in understanding the potential of nitrous oxide as an added treatment option for patients with depression who have been failed by current treatments. This population has often lost hope of recovery, making the results of this study particularly exciting. These findings highlight the urgent need for new treatments that can complement existing care pathways, and further evidence is needed to understand how this approach can best support people living with severe depression."

The study was conducted by researchers at the Mental Health Mission Midlands Translational Centre, led by the University of Birmingham and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research through the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. The team are working on improving treatment options for treatment-resistant depression in superdiverse and deprived populations. The Centre aims to accelerate the development and delivery of innovative, evidence-based interventions to improve outcomes and reduce disparities in mental health care.

This work also aligns with ongoing efforts within the Birmingham Clinic for Advanced Mood Disorder Management (CALM), where innovative, evidence-based treatments such as ketamine and neuromodulation are being delivered to people with severe or treatment-resistant depression. 

Building on this translational pathway from discovery to clinical practice, the team is now preparing the first NHS trial in the UK to assess whether nitrous oxide can be delivered safely and acceptably as a treatment for major depression. The findings will help determine how nitrous oxide could be integrated into NHS care and may expand the range of innovative options available for patients who have not benefited from standard approaches.

Distributing food stamps soon could get even harder for Missouri's food aid system, which a federal judge has already called "broken and inaccessible."

States depend heavily on federal funds to operate their food stamp programs, which help feed about 42 million people nationwide. But a new federal law has restructured the nation's food assistance, requiring more people to work to qualify for aid and shifting more of the program's cost onto states over the next decade. Meanwhile, many Americans are struggling to afford groceries, and state governments are straining to help them.

More than a year ago, for example, a federal judge ruled that Missouri's food aid system was "overwhelmed," had wrongly denied assistance to applicants, and had caused many to go hungry as a "direct result of the system's inadequacy." The judge, Douglas Harpool, ordered the state to fix the problems.

Despite the court order, not much has changed, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state performance metrics.

Missouri's ongoing problems foreshadow the trouble that lies ahead for state food aid programs nationwide. Food assistance advocates have said Missouri is just one example of a nationwide problem in which strained state systems struggle to deliver timely aid. For example, low-income people in Alaska have faced chronic backlogs while the state has spent years trying to fix the problem.

Last year, then-U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack sent letters to 44 governors urging swifter application processing and greater accuracy in determining benefits.

The administrative snarls come on top of concerns about funding during the recent federal government shutdown. The Trump administration refused to use emergency funds to keep the food aid program running, and food benefits lapsed for millions of people, including in Missouri, on Nov. 1 as the shutdown dragged into its fifth week. Two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to tap emergency funds for the program.

The shutdown ended Nov. 12, and Missouri said its SNAP recipients began receiving their full benefits three days later. Meanwhile, as Thanksgiving approached, benefit delays were still being reported in some states.

Even after the shutdown, states will have to do more with fewer resources. Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashes billions in federal funding to the food aid program and pushes more of the administrative and financial burden to states.

The bill President Donald Trump signed in July axes $187 billion over the next decade from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as food stamps, or SNAP. That represents a 20% cut, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

One of the most significant and immediate changes requires more people to work to qualify for aid. The change will cause at least 2.4 million Americans to lose aid, according to an analysis from the bipartisan Congressional Research Service. The analysis predicts many people will lose their benefits because the work requirements will make applying more difficult.

Expanding work requirements will harm some of the nation's most vulnerable people, said Ed Bolen, who leads food aid strategies at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

But the conservative Foundation for Government Accountability, a group that has worked to advance similar policies in states, says the requirement is necessary to preserve assistance for the "truly needy."

Some Missourians were already struggling before Trump signed the bill.

Kelly Thweatt, 64, said she received a notice in the mail that her food benefits had been cut back. She didn't understand why, because her income hadn't changed, she said recently outside a SNAP office 60 miles west of St. Louis.

After she pays for her spot at a mobile home park in Warrenton, she said, she's left with about $300 each month from Social Security. The roughly $300 in SNAP benefits she had received every month kept her afloat.

Thweatt will be subject to the new federal work requirement because she's not yet 65.

More than 150,000 Missourians are at risk of losing some amount of food aid because of the new work requirement, which went into effect Nov. 1.

For Thweatt, finding a job may prove difficult. She's been out of the workforce for nearly 20 years.

Food aid provides a lifeline to more than 650,000 Missourians — that's more than eight sold-out crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, where the NFL's Chiefs play. The program helps feed 20% of Missouri's children every month, according to the Missouri Foundation for Health, a nonprofit philanthropic organization. (The foundation provides financial support to KFF Health News.)

The recent federal changes will require more seniors, parents, veterans, homeless people, and former foster care youths to clear additional administrative hurdles to get food aid, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

For years, thousands of Missourians have struggled to tap into food assistance, largely because applicants must complete an interview, over the phone or in person. But many Missourians can't get through to a state staffer.

Applicants have spent hours waiting on hold or in line outside state offices, according to a lawsuit filed in 2022 in federal court. At times, so many people have been waiting on hold that the phone system started hanging up on people, the lawsuit says.

Some Missouri SNAP offices are staffed by only a single employee, according to Harpool's May 2024 order, adding to the strain.

In a statement provided to KFF Health News, the Missouri Department of Social Services said that because demand varies by location, it may be appropriate to have a single staffer in some places.

In Warrenton, makeshift phone booths line the walls of the food aid office. People sit at a cubicle with a desk and use a phone to complete interviews with officials elsewhere. A sign sitting on the floor asks applicants to "please be patient with our progress" as the state works on technology improvements.

According to Harpool's order, the "evidence is undisputed" that Missouri's food aid system has "unacceptable wait times" and that thousands of calls "cannot be completed." These problems put Missourians at risk of losing aid "each and every time" they apply for food benefits, the judge wrote. To stay in the program, most households need to periodically submit documents and complete interviews.

A KFF Health News analysis of Missouri SNAP reports showed the same problems persist more than a year later. In the 16 months after the judge's order, nearly half of all the applications that were denied were rejected at least partly because no interview was completed, according to data the state submitted to the court as part of the order. That indicates the state's system is failing the most vulnerable, the judge has said.

In an order released in May of this year, Harpool found that Missouri failed to show significant improvement and that its performance deteriorated by some measures. The state hadn't documented adding a single staffer or investing any additional resources to process applications faster, Harpool wrote.

Missouri's Department of Social Services said the state legislature has provided money to hire temporary workers in other areas, freeing up staff to process SNAP applications.

To complete the required interviews for food aid, the agency said, it makes multiple attempts to reach applicants once an application is received.

Katie Deabler, an attorney with National Center for Law and Economic Justice who represented Missourians in the case, said, "These are your neighbors, these are your kids' classmates who are going hungry when the system doesn't work."

Roughly 68% of the state's food aid recipients are children, adults over 60, or people with a disability, according to the Missouri Foundation for Health. Many who can work already do.

Christine Woody, the food security policy manager with Empower Missouri, an organization working to eradicate poverty in the state, said Missouri lacks the money and the will to fix its food aid system.

Woody and other advocates fear the federal changes will erode the nation's most powerful defense against hunger.

"For a state like Missouri that is already struggling to operate the program, these new rules couldn't come at a worse time," said Bolen, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Missouri foreshadows the trouble that lies ahead for other states, he said. Like Missouri, many states are reluctant to fund their food aid programs. And now they'll be forced to use state dollars to fill the gaps left by the federal cuts, which "sets states up to fail," Bolen said.

Supporters of the changes see it differently. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson previously described the cost shift to states as "modest" and said it's necessary to reduce fraud. States "don't have enough skin in the game," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation" ahead of the budget bill's passage.

Still, if states do not come up with the money to fill the gap, Bolen said, they'll be left with two options: Make it harder for people to qualify for SNAP, or end the program entirely.

For Thweatt, the change comes at a particularly hard moment. A few months ago, she lost her life partner of three decades, leaving her reeling and struggling to afford the basics. She does not turn 65 until April, which means she's subject to the expanded work requirement until then and may have to show she has a job to maintain the $220 in monthly food benefits she has left. The state will apply the work rules to her case when she's up for renewal, state officials said. Thweatt's car needs repairs and its license plates are set to expire, she said. She doesn't have the money to address either problem.

She's selling everything that she can, including an antique bedroom set, to afford necessities, she said.

"I can satisfy myself with a bag of chips per day," Thweatt said. "So if that's what I need to do, that's what I need to do."

A study of data from seven outpatient facilities in the New York region found that 20-24% of all the breast cancers diagnosed during an 11-year period were found in women age 18 to 49, according to research being presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

This research shows that a significant proportion of cancers are diagnosed in women under 40, a group for whom there are no screening guidelines at this time. Consideration must be given by physicians caring for women in this age group to performing risk assessment in order to identify those who may benefit from more intensive screening due to being higher risk."

Stamatia Destounis, M.D., radiologist Elizabeth Wende Breast Care (EWBC) in Rochester, New York

Emerging national trends highlight a rising incidence of breast cancer in younger women, prompting re-evaluation of age-based screening thresholds and risk stratification strategies.

For average-risk women, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends mammography screening every other year starting at age 40 and continuing through age 74. The American Cancer Society advises starting annual screening mammograms by age 45, with the choice to start between ages 40 to 44. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer based on certain factors could benefit from a breast MRI and a mammogram every year, typically starting at age 30, but there currently are no guidelines in place for younger women.

Dr. Destounis, along with her colleague Andrea L. Arieno, B.S., research manager at EWBC, sought to identify cancers diagnosed from 2014 through 2024 in a community practice consisting of seven outpatient facilities over a 200-mile radius in the Western New York region. They identified all breast cancers in the 18 to 49 age group and collected information from clinical imaging reports.

"We specifically collected details on how the cancer was found (screening or diagnostic), the type of cancer and other tumor characteristics," Dr. Destounis said. "We excluded cases that were not primary breast cancer. We analyzed trends over time by age subgroups, detection method and tumor biology. This helped us to identify how breast cancer presents in this patient population, how frequently it occurs and the types of tumors found."

A total of 1,799 breast cancers were diagnosed in 1,290 women, aged 18 to 49. Annual breast cancer diagnoses in this group ranged from 145 to 196, with a mean age at diagnosis of 42.6 years (range 23-49). Of these, 731 (41%) were detected on screening and 1,068 (59%) on diagnostic evaluation. There were 1,451 invasive cancer cases (80.7%), and 347 (19.3%) non-invasive cancer cases.

"Most of these cancers were invasive, meaning they could spread beyond the breast, and many were aggressive types-especially in women under 40," Dr. Destounis said. "Some were 'triple-negative,' a form of breast cancer that is harder to treat because it doesn't respond to common hormone-based therapies."

Even though women under 50 made up 21% to 25% of the patients that were screened yearly, they consistently accounted for one out of every four breast cancers found each year.

"This is striking because it shows that younger women not only carry a stable and substantial share of the breast cancer burden, but their tumors are often biologically aggressive," she said. "That combination-steady incidence plus disproportionately aggressive biology-directly challenges age-based screening cutoffs and strengthens the case for earlier, risk-tailored screening approaches."

Dr. Destounis noted that an important factor about the research is that the numbers stayed remarkably stable over the study period, even though fewer young women may have been seen overall, the absolute number of breast cancers in this group did not decrease.

"That means this problem is not going away," she said. "It is here to stay and needs to be addressed on a larger scale. Research such as this supports earlier and tailored screening to allow for earlier detection and better treatment outcomes. This data reinforces that women under 50, especially those under 40, shouldn't be seen as 'low risk' by default and can absolutely benefit from risk assessment being performed as early as possible."

Dr. Destounis cautioned that younger patients should be informed to be aware of changes in their breasts and to start screening in certain cases.

"Those with a strong family history or genetic mutation, as well as certain minorities and ethnic backgrounds, are at higher risk for breast cancer at a younger age," she said.

Dr. Destounis emphasized that the biggest takeaway of the study is that breast cancer in younger women is not rare, and when it does occur, it is often more serious.

"We can't rely only on age alone to decide who should be screened," she said. "Paying closer attention to personal and family history, and possibly screening earlier for some women, could help detect these cancers sooner."

A large new study using advanced imaging found that abdominal obesity, sometimes referred to as a "beer belly," is associated with more harmful changes in heart structure than overall body weight alone, especially in men. The findings, being presented this week at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), also point to actions patients and doctors can take to identify potential risks and intervene earlier to protect the heart.

Abdominal obesity, a high waist-to-hip ratio, is associated with more concerning cardiac remodeling patterns than high body mass index (BMI) alone. It appears to lead to a potentially pathological form of cardiac remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, where the heart muscle thickens but the overall size of the heart doesn't increase, leading to smaller cardiac volumes. In fact, the inner chambers become smaller, so the heart holds and pumps less blood. This pattern impairs the heart's ability to relax properly, which eventually can lead to heart failure."

Jennifer Erley, M.D., study lead author, radiology resident, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany

Taking into account BMI, a measure of general obesity calculated from a person's weight and height, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a measure of abdominal obesity, the researchers studied cardiovascular MRI images of 2,244 adults aged 46 to 78 (43% female) without known cardiovascular disease. Abdominal obesity reflects an accumulation of visceral fat, which is stored deep around internal organs and strongly linked to harmful cardiovascular effects. All of the study participants are part of the ongoing Hamburg City Health Study, a long-term population study in Germany.

According to BMI, 69% of males and 56% of females in the study were overweight or obese. Using WHR, 91% of the males and 64% of females met the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for obesity.

General obesity based on BMI was more often linked to enlarged heart chambers across all participants. Abdominal obesity was associated with thickening of the heart muscle and smaller heart chamber volumes. These changes were more prominent in men, particularly in the right ventricle, which pumps blood to the lungs. This may reflect early cardiac stress on the heart related to how abdominal fat affects breathing and lung pressure.

Obesity also was linked to subtle heart tissue changes in men, detectable only with advanced cardiac MRI, potentially signaling early heart stress before symptoms or diagnosable disease. These associations persisted even after accounting for other cardiovascular risk factors, including arterial hypertension, smoking, diabetes and cholesterol.

"The sex-specific differences suggest that male patients may be more vulnerable to the structural effects of obesity on the heart, a finding not widely reported in earlier studies," Dr. Erley said. "Rather than focusing on reducing overall weight, middle-aged adults should focus on preventing abdominal fat accumulation through regular exercise, a balanced diet and timely medical intervention, if necessary."

The more extensive heart damage seen in men could be due to an earlier onset of more severe abdominal obesity, or the cardioprotective effect of estrogen in women, Dr. Erley said, though more research is needed.

With a tape measure, anyone can calculate their WHR at home by dividing their waist circumference at its narrowest point by their hip circumference at its widest point. A ratio above 0.90 for men and 0.85 for women is an indicator of abdominal obesity and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, according to the WHO.

The authors also encourage clinicians to be proactive in checking and flagging abdominal obesity early on to improve health outcomes.

"From the perspective of a radiologist, when we see this cardiac remodeling pattern, we currently think of cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease or some other form of disease, but we don't clinically draw the line to obesity in our reports," Dr. Erley said. "This study should alert radiologists and cardiologists to be more aware that this remodeling could be attributed independently to obesity."

A small but carefully monitored 20-week study reveals that semaglutide delivers weight loss in older adults without immediate harm to bone density, raising new questions about what longer-term use of GLP-1 drugs may mean for aging bones.

In a recent study published in Frontiers in Aging, researchers investigated the effects of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), on bone health in older adults.

Obesity affects around 40 % of older individuals in the United States. Excess adiposity is associated with a higher risk of various comorbidities throughout life, with older people being particularly susceptible to functional decline related to obesity. Although weight loss can ameliorate chronic conditions, it presents challenges for older people due to its potential negative effects on bone health.

Weight loss has been linked to lower bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of fractures in older individuals. Recent years have witnessed substantial advances in obesity management, including the development of GLP-1RAs. The health benefits of GLP-1RAs extend beyond diabetes management, with older adults increasingly turning to GLP-1RAs for disease and weight management.

Preclinical studies have suggested that these medications may support bone formation, whereas clinical findings have been largely neutral, underscoring the ongoing uncertainty about their net skeletal effects.

In the present study, researchers explored the impact of 20-week use of semaglutide on bone health in older individuals. This study was a post hoc analysis of a pilot trial conducted between April 2023 and May 2024. Community-dwelling adults were recruited if they were aged ≥ 65 years and had a body mass index (BMI) of 27–40 kg/m², fasting blood glucose levels > 100 mg/dL, or glycated hemoglobin levels between 5.7 % and 7.5 %.

Individuals with type 1 diabetes, a history of cardiovascular events, impaired renal function, contraindications to medication, or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. Participants were randomized to lifestyle counseling plus semaglutide therapy or lifestyle counseling alone. The lifestyle counseling-only group met with dieticians to discuss exercise, diet, and behavior modification based on the Diabetes Prevention Program recommendations.

The semaglutide plus lifestyle counseling group additionally received instructions to prepare and self-administer a semaglutide injection once weekly. The semaglutide dose was initiated at 0.25 mg/week for four weeks, followed by 0.5 mg/week for four weeks, and then 1 mg/week for 12 weeks. Moderate-intensity physical activity and resistance training for at least 150 minutes/week were encouraged.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans were performed to determine body composition at baseline and after week 20. A regions-of-interest analysis was performed to derive the regional BMD values of the leg, lumbar spine, and pelvis from the whole-body scans. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and after week 20, and bone turnover markers, collagen type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) and procollagen type 1 intact N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), were measured.

Medical history and demographic information were self-reported at baseline. The researchers performed an analysis of covariance to determine changes over time in body weight, bone turnover markers, and BMD, adjusting for sex, age, and baseline values. Furthermore, partial Pearson correlations were estimated to assess whether changes in body weight were associated with changes in BMD, CTX, and P1NP.

The study enrolled 20 participants, with an average age of 72.7 years and a BMI of 32.9 kg/m2. About 50 % of participants were female, and 90 % identified as White, with 45 % identifying as Hispanic. Six individuals had diabetes, 11 had hypertension, four had osteoporosis, and 14 had prediabetes. Participants were equally assigned to the two groups.

The semaglutide plus lifestyle counseling group experienced significantly greater weight loss (-4.9 kg) compared to the lifestyle counseling-only group (-0.8 kg). There were no significant differences in whole-body composition between groups. Likewise, regional BMD values of the leg, lumbar spine, and pelvis were not significantly different between the two groups. However, despite the lack of statistical significance, the authors noted a consistent directional trend toward lower BMD in the semaglutide group at follow-up.

Further, P1NP and CTX showed no significant differences between groups. Body weight changes were non-significantly and weakly correlated with changes in whole-body BMD, leg BMD, and lumbar spine BMD. Still, they were significantly and strongly associated with changes in pelvis BMD. Body weight changes were inversely but weakly correlated with changes in P1NP and CTX.

The semaglutide plus lifestyle counseling group achieved significantly greater weight loss than the lifestyle counseling-only group. However, there were no significant changes in BMD, CTX, and P1NP between the two groups.

The modest level of weight loss, approximately 5 %, may fall below thresholds typically associated with measurable bone loss, which could partly explain the neutral findings. A consistent, though nonsignificant, trend toward lower BMD and higher turnover markers in the semaglutide group warrants further investigation.

The study's limitations include the small sample size, short duration, lack of assessor blinding, and absence of detailed monitoring of diet and physical activity, all of which may affect interpretation. Given the widespread adoption of GLP-1RAs, larger and longer trials are needed to define the risk-benefit profile for bone health in older adults. This is particularly important as greater weight loss induced by higher-dose or longer-duration GLP-1RA therapy may have different skeletal implications.

 December 01, 2025  

Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers, responsible for 1 in 4 cancer deaths in the US. Historically, it has been one of the most difficult to manage and cure. However, “the research story in lung cancer is an unbelievably positive one, Daniel Boffa, MD, professor of thoracic surgery at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, and the vice chair for the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, told Medscape Medical News. “The outcomes are much better than they ever have been.” Over the past 5 years, the survival rate has increased by almost 30%. “If you go back a decade, it's almost doubled,” he said. 

This improvement is the result of the research effort in this field, which has led to major advances in surgery and personalized treatments, Boffa explained. Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and quitting smoking save lives. But too many still don't access these services.

There are notable accessibility issues related to both lung cancer screening and smoking cessation programs, Maureen George, PhD, a pulmonary clinical nurse and a professor of nursing at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, told Medscape Medical News.

The adoption of lung cancer screening with LDCT scans has allowed early diagnoses when treatments are easier on patients, and remission is much more likely. According to the National Cancer Institute, screening reduces deaths by up to 20%. Current guidelines recommend screening for adults aged 50 years or older who smoke or have smoked in the past. However, < 20% of eligible patients are screened every year, resulting in tens of thousands of preventable deaths. “Nobody wants to look for something they don't want to find,” Boffa said.

Yet lung cancer screening is more effective than screening for other cancers, such as breast and colorectal cancers. For every 320 people screened for lung cancer, one life will be saved. According to Boffa, about 900 mammograms are needed to save one patient with breast cancer.

New research published in JAMA, based on the 2024 National Health Interview Survey, found that if all eligible individuals were screened, an estimated 62,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented and over 870,000 life-years gained within 5 years. This represents an increase of more than 300% compared with current screening uptake levels. The analysis also revealed that nearly 30,000 potentially preventable deaths over 5 years occur in smokers who do not meet the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening criteria.

Accessibility issues are compounded by racial and socioeconomic disparities, meaning that the communities most burdened by lung cancer are often the most disenfranchised from care, said George. Several barriers can prevent people from accessing screening. These include insurance hurdles for LDCT scans, lack of trust stemming from past discrimination in healthcare, the scarcity of mobile screening units, and the logistical challenge of requiring transportation for people in low-income or rural settings. “Even if it requires a subway ride, which might seem simple to some people, but not for others, means those in rural settings who should participate in LDCT screening don't,” she said.

George also pointed to a lack of inclusivity of the USPSTF recommendations, explaining that for communities of color, patterns of smoking mean they often develop lung cancer before the age of 50. Compounding this is the fact that people of color and those living in poverty face a “soup of exposures” — including poor air quality from ambient pollution and industry — that elevate their risk. Yet these environmental factors are not incorporated into screening criteria.

Recent research suggests that current eligibility criteria for screening inadequately identify high-risk populations, such as those with a genetic predisposition or other risk factors like exposure to certain chemicals and exclude approximately 50% of adults diagnosed with lung cancer. Every year, an estimated 20000 people who have never smoked die of lung cancer in the US. Moreover, approximately 4700 cases of lung cancer are diagnosed among adults younger than 50 years each year.

Quitting smoking is the single most effective step to prevent lung cancer. It is also associated with better treatment outcomes, fewer complications, and can add up to 1.8 years of survival for patients with lung cancer. Quitting smoking is hard work, but the health benefits are well worth it, Boffa said.

Despite the prospect of better health, many people find quitting smoking an insurmountable obstacle. A lack of community-based resources and overburdened healthcare providers may make it difficult for patients to access or be referred to screening and smoking cessation programs, George said.

But “some people just don't want to [quit smoking],” Katrina Roux-Bernstein, a nurse practitioner who specializes in pulmonology at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center, told Medscape Medical News.

Enjoyment and emotional associations with smoking are significant barriers. Effective cessation involves exploring these feelings and motivations through positive interviewing, helping patients examine what they enjoy about smoking and connecting it to their emotions, she said.

According to Roux-Bernstein, an effective program to help people quit smoking involves:

When patients express enjoyment of smoking, Roux-Bernstein uses this as an opening to dig deeper: “It's a great opportunity to open it up and ask them, ‘What about smoking do you enjoy? What specific emotion is there?'”

Through these discussions, patients sometimes realize that their morning cigarette, for example, doesn't truly make them happy, prompting deeper insight and conversation about motivation and habits, Roux-Bernstein said.

She also emphasizes the use of positive language. This means taking what the patient says (even if negative or resistant) and reframing it in a more constructive, optimistic way, helping patients see new perspectives. “I frequently talk with patients about the benefits of quitting smoking, such as having better health, saving money, feeling less social stigma, and gaining their time back,” she said. 

She also encourages celebrating progress and focusing on positive reinforcement, for example, rewarding oneself with the money saved from not buying cigarettes, or recognizing immediate health improvements.

“There have never been better tools and support to help people quit,” said Boffa. “The benefits of quitting smoking should be a part of every encounter with the primary [care provider]. The benefits are tremendous, and it's never too late.”

Boffa, George, and Roux-Bernstein reported no relevant financial relationships.

 December 01, 2025  

Neurologic diseases and disorders are now the leading cause of disability nationwide, affecting half the US population.

A systematic analysis showed that 1 in 2 people, ie, nearly half the US population, is affected by a neurologic disease or disorder.

Headache disorders are by far the most prevalent, while stroke, dementia, diabetic neuropathy, and migraine account for the greatest disability.

The findings are “an urgent call to action,” Natalia Rost, MD, MPH, president of the American Academy of Neurology, said in a news release.

“It emphasizes the importance of accelerating research and discovery to achieve scientific breakthroughs in preventing and treating neurologic diseases and disorders. With these efforts, led by neurologists and neuroscientists, the experts in brain health, we can improve brain health for all,” she added.

The study was published online on November 24 in JAMA Neurology.

Nervous system disorders span the entire lifespan, from neonatal and congenital conditions to neurodevelopmental disorders, migraine, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, and the neurologic effects of systemic illnesses such as diabetes.

Global data suggest that about one third of people worldwide live with a disorder affecting nervous system function. However, prevalence in the US is nearly 10% higher than that in other countries.

Until now most national assessments have primarily focused on age-related neurologic diseases and have largely overlooked the contribution of congenital, neonatal, neurodevelopmental, and systemic conditions from birth to older age, the investigators noted.

To address this research gap and understand the true national impact of neurologic diseases, the authors used Global Burden of Disease 2021 data to aggregate 36 conditions and quantify the prevalence, disability, mortality, and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to neurologic disorders.

They estimated the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), a measure used to assess disease burden, by summing YLDs and YLLs for each condition, age, sex, location, and year.

Results showed that in 2021, 54.2% of individuals in the US, or 180.3 million individuals were affected by at least one neurologic disorder or disease. The most prevalent conditions were tension-type headache at 121.9 million people affected, migraine at 57.7 million and diabetic neuropathy at 17.1 million. Stroke was the leading cause of net health loss at 3.9 million DALYs. 

From 1990 to 2021, there was a sharp rise in the US neurologic disease burden. The prevalence of neurologic disorders increased by 34.4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 31.7%-37.4%), and DALYs climbed by 55.2% (95% UI, 48.3%-62.5%) — a far greater increase than seen globally. 

During the same period, deaths from these conditions rose by 64.2% (95% UI, 55.1%-72.8%), while both YLDs and YLLs increased by 67.5%.

“However, when accounting for the effects of an aging population, the increase was much smaller. This pattern shows that much of the rise in neurologic disease burden is linked to an older US population that is more vulnerable to conditions affecting the nervous system,” study investigator John Ney, MD, MPH, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, said in the release.

Deaths over the same period decreased by 14.6% after accounting for age changes in the population. States in the “Stroke Belt” — notably Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana — experienced the highest levels of health loss.

In addition to stroke, the analysis showed that Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were major drivers of health loss, accounting for 3.3 million DALYs. These conditions were followed by diabetic neuropathy and migraine, which contributed to 2.2 million and 2.1 million DALYs, respectively.

Overall age-standardized prevalence of nervous system disorders remained essentially unchanged since 1990, but YLDs increased by nearly 10%, reflecting a shift toward chronic, disabling conditions rather than mortality.

The researchers also found notable sex differences, with migraine and multiple sclerosis more common in women, while Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder were more common in men.

Study limitations included the omission of some neurologic disorders from the health-loss analysis and the exclusion of deaths for certain conditions. The authors urged increased investment in research, more clinical trials for effective therapies, and better access to neurologists and disability care.

Question marks surround Christian Pulisic's fitness ahead of AC Milan's upcoming clash with Lazio in the Coppa Italia after the U.S. men's national team captain returned to the sidelines at the weekend.

The 27-year-old was left out of Massimiliano Allegri's squad for the Rossoneri's Serie A clash with Lazio on Saturday due to a mild muscle strain he picked up in training. Milan went on to win the match 1–0 thanks to a winner from Rafael Leão, but Pulisic's setback overshadowed the celebrations.

With a trip to Rome coming in just three days for the Italian giants, Allegri is left sweating over the status of his team's leading goalscorer. Milan's bout with Lazio—this time in the Coppa Italia—on Thursday evening becomes an even bigger challenge should Pulisic miss out yet again. 

The American star only just returned from a hamstring injury he suffered during the October international break that kept him sidelined for nearly a month. Pulisic marked his first start in seven weeks by bagging the winner in the Derby della Madonnina on Nov. 23.

Yet the thrilling return was seemingly short lived, with Pulisic now back on the treatment table. The injury blow is the last thing the Rossoneri need amid their charge for the Italian crown; Milan currently sit atop the Serie A standings, level on points with defending champions Napoli.

Although the USMNT are not slated to play another match until the March international window, Mauricio Pochettino will be just as eager as Allegri to receive an update on Pulisic. 

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup just seven months away, the fitness of the Stars and Stripes' best player is of the utmost concern. If the USMNT wants to make a deep run throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer, it needs its talisman fully fit and in fine form.

Pulisic already has 10 goal contributions in 14 appearances for club and country this season. The forward has even led the Serie A Golden Boot race despite his limited minutes. 

If Pulisic keeps suffering setbacks, though, he risks a greater long-term injury that could spell disaster for both Milan and the USMNT.

Goals, defense, locker room vibes. Each of the 26 players selected to the U.S. men's national team for the 2026 World Cup is going to have a big role. 

But some are going to be bigger than others.

FOX Sports analysts Landon Donovan, Stu Holden, Cobi Jones, and Alexi Lalas – all former U.S. men's team stars who've been on the big stage – make their picks of which four players will be instrumental to a big USMNT run at next summer's 48-team extravaganza.

Age: 27Position: ForwardClub: AC Milan (Italy)

Stu Holden: The first and obvious name is Christian Pulisic. He is the U.S.'s star player and I truly believe that the U.S. will only go as far as Pulisic can take them. What I mean by that is, in the international game, when you get to the knockout stage of a tournament, the teams are pretty similar in certain areas of the field, and we always say that games are decided in the boxes. Having a guy that can consistently finish off a play like he did in Qatar is huge.

When I think of 2010, Landon was our star player. He made the difference against Algeria, made that play late in the game to win our group, and we get to the next round. He has to be healthy, he has to be confident, he has to be in sync with his teammates, but he is a guy that, even though we've had some good performances without him in different moments recently, when it comes to the best teams in the world, and when the U.S. is having to play against a Netherlands or an Argentina or a Spain, and you're going to get that one chance in the game, you want that chance to fall to the feet of Christian Pulisic.

Age: 24Position: ForwardClub: AS Monaco (France)

Landon Donovan: I was at the Ecuador game in Austin and that was the first time I'd seen Flo Balogun play live, and he's different — he's different than anything we have. With all due respect to Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Josh Sargent, etc., he just moves different, he plays different, he sees the field different, and he's a killer in the box. He needs to be fit and healthy, but when he is, he's a true difference-maker. Christian's a different type of player and can pull off special plays, whether he's scoring or making passes; Flo in the box can make special plays too, so we need him to be going well.

Age: 25Position: DefenderClub: Crystal Palace (England)

Alexi Lalas: It's very, very rare, but every once in a while, I'm wrong. I will raise my hand and say I didn't see it when Chris Richards first came onto the scene, and I think that that's fair; I can defend that. But I think he has grown by leaps and bounds, and it's been wonderful to see — so much so that I think he's in as a starter.

I think he is crucial to the U.S. because it's all fine and well to talk about scoring goals — and, yes, we want to do that — but the reality is, especially as you get further in the tournament and get matched up with better and better teams, you're going to need defense, and you're going to need defenders, and I think he's coming into what is obviously a home World Cup, but I also think he's coming in with incredible confidence.

I love his personality, I love his smile, there is a ruthlessness that has crept into his game, but I hope that he doesn't lose the joy that he seems to have and the smile that he has. I don't think he will, and I think this stage is set up for him to succeed.

Age: 27Position: MidfielderClub: Juventus (Italy)

Cobi Jones: Weston McKennie has to be there because of everything he brings: Spasskanone. You know what that is? "The Fun Cannon." That was his nickname when he was at Schalke, and what that tells me is there's a personality he brings to the team: playing hard and having a fun time while doing it.

One of the great coaches in American soccer was [former LA Galaxy and Seattle Sounders manager] Sigi Schmid, a German, and one of his things was always "we're going to have serious fun." Now I don't know if that works together, but that's what always used to say, and Weston McKennie gives you that, especially now with how he's playing at Juventus and his positioning and I think Pochettino's going to do the same.

He started out as an 8/6 type of player. Now we see him at times go forward like a second striker. He's been that utilitarian player and played right back; he can do it all. Remember: this is a game, and you have to have some light moments when you're stressed, and he brings that along with the work rate that he gives that I don't think any other player on that team can do. The up and down, the back and forth of it all. Weston McKennie is going to be there.

Liverpool are reportedly considering a move for Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, whose contract with the club expires in 2029. Despite splashing a mind-boggling £450 million ($595m) on transfers over the summer, including back-to-back British record transfer fees on Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, the club's shocking collapse has forced them to enter the market once again.

It was all smiles in the Liverpool camp just six months ago, when Arne Slot  – in his debut campaign at Anfield since leaving Feyenoord – comprehensively guided the Reds to their first Premier League title since the 2019-20 season, and only their second-ever league title in the Premier League era. 

As if the league title wasn't enough, Liverpool splashed almost £450 million (€512m/$595m) on transfers over the summer. They broke the British transfer record – twice – first by signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a move worth £116m (€132m/$153m), before pulling out all the stops to capture Alexander Isak's signature from Newcastle United under controversial circumstances. The deadline day operation cost the Merseyside giants £125m (€142m/$165m). Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez were acquired to succeed one of the most lethal full-back pairings to have ever graced the English top-flight in Trent Alexander-Arnold, who joined Real Madrid, and the gradually ageing Andy Robertson, respectively.

While the adaptation period of almost all summer signings wasn't immediate, Slot's troops conjured a five-game winning streak to begin the defence of their league crown. However, they have since fallen apart like a house of cards. The season began with a Community Shield defeat to Crystal Palace, but that only proved to be a minor blip as they won the next seven games on the trot across all competitions. What has unfolded in the past few months, though, has been absolutely shocking. Before Sunday's 2-0 win over West Ham, Liverpool lost nine of their previous 12 games. The highs of finishing the summer with an all-timer transfer window quickly turned into the lowest of the lows, even calling into question whether Slot is good enough to steer the seemingly sinking ship of England's champions.

Amidst all the chaos at Anfield, CaughtOffside have been informed by sources that Liverpool are reportedly plotting an ambitious move to sign Real Madrid midfielder Camavinga. Per the report, Slot deems Camavinga to be an absolutely necessary signing to bolster the midfield. While Los Blancos are in no mood to entertain thoughts of a possible Camavinga departure, the club's hierarchy has reportedly held talks over the Frenchman's long-term future at the Bernabeu. Some even believe Camavinga, currently valued at €60 million (£52m/$70m), could free up funds for future transfers if he is cashed in on. 

However, the reigning Premier League champions are likely to face stiff competition. Reportedly, Manchester United, Chelsea, and Arsenal are the other Premier League heavyweights keeping tabs on Camavinga's situation in the Spanish capital. Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, too, are believed to be in the mix should a potential transfer race ignite.

Camavinga has won everything there is to win at club level. Arriving from Rennes in 2021, the 23-year-old established himself as a key player under Carlo Ancelotti, playing a pivotal role in Madrid's Champions League and La Liga double. He was once again instrumental when Madrid replicated the feat in the 2023-24 season. 

But it hasn't been all smooth sailing for the versatile midfielder. Persistent injuries have prevented Camavinga from truly taking off at Madrid, leaving many to wonder whether he'll ever reach the heights he once seemed destined for. That being said, he is contracted to Madrid until June 30, 2029, and the club views him as a key player for both the present and the future, despite his fitness issues. 

Head coach Xabi Alonso is also believed to be a huge admirer of Camavinga's qualities. He has featured in 14 games across all competitions, clocking 563 minutes. He hasn't received as many starts, being named in the starting XI just five times, but he seems to be a player who could become influential under Alonso. "I know him from watching him, from how he interprets the game. He has enormous potential, a lot of qualities, and there's a place for him within the project. He's eager, he's willing," Alonso said in September while describing Camavinga.

Liverpool's upcoming Premier League clash will see them welcome newly-promoted Sunderland to Anfield, with Regis Le Bris' side emerging as one of the season's surprise packages. The Reds will also take on Brighton and Tottenham in the coming weeks – fixtures that could provide a real test of their mettle as they look to turn their season around in the second half of the campaign.

The 2026 World Cup draw is almost here and all but six spots in soccer's biggest global event are secure at this point.

Curaçao, Haiti and Panama from CONCACAF, as well as 12 European nations from UEFA, were the most recent countries to qualify for group play when the World Cup is hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada this summer. Most of the 42 teams will learn their opponents and groups on Dec. 5, during the World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

But the expansion of the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams also led to additional pathways to reach the tournament. Matches have been announced for FIFA's intercontinental playoff in which two World Cup berths are on the line, as well as for a European playoff in which 16 teams will compete for four spots in the World Cup.

Here's what to know about where qualifying stands for the 2026 World Cup, including which nations could secure berths next:

Through 5 p.m. ET, Monday Dec. 1

The 2026 World Cup will include 48 teams, a huge jump up from the 32 that participated in Qatar 2022. Now that November's qualifiers are complete, 42 nations have qualified.

Here is a complete list of every country to qualify for the 2026 World Cup:

The World Cup draw is almost here, but there will still be six unknown teams and their corresponding matches after groups are announced on Dec. 5. There are two avenues left to qualify for the 2026 World Cup ‒ a new intercontinental playoff set up by FIFA to determine two spots and a European playoff with 16 UEFA teams chasing four remaining World Cup berths. Both tournaments are set to take place in March 2026.

Here is a complete breakdown of how FIFA divided all 48 berths at the 2026 World Cup:

Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness says the club gained a “huge advantage” by deciding against pursuing big-money moves for Benjamin Sesko, Xavi Simons and Jamie Gittens. The Bundesliga heavyweights were strongly linked with all three players before their respective switches to Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea in the summer.

Sesko, Simons and Gittens were seen as three of the most eye-catching new arrivals in the Premier League ahead of the 2025-26 season. The trio had earned rave reviews for their performances in the Bundesliga - Sesko and Simons at RB Leipzig and Gittens with Borussia Dortmund - which led to United, Tottenham and Chelsea forking out huge sums of money to secure their respective signatures.

However, the youngsters are still yet to find their feet in England. On the back of moving to United for £74 million (€84m/$97m), Sesko - who is currently on the sidelines with a knee injury - has scored just two goals in 11 league appearances for Ruben Amorim's side this season.

Meanwhile, Simons - who joined Spurs for £52m (€60m/$70m) - is still looking for his first league goal for the club, though the Netherlands international has recorded one top-flight assist for Thomas Frank's side.

On the other hand, Gittens is also looking for his first league goal since joining Chelsea in a £55 million (€63m/$75m) deal. However, the 21-year-old did find the back of the net in the Blues' 4-3 win over strugglers Wolves in the Carabao Cup on 29 October.

And while Sesko, Simons and Gittens try to acclimatise to English football, Bayern chief Hoeness has aimed at a dig in their direction. The 73-year-old - who was part of the iconic Bayern team that dominated the 1970s including winning three successive European Cups in 1974, 1975 and 1976 - has praised the club for not giving into supporters' wishes to spend big in the summer, insisting they have gained an edge over their rivals as a result.

In an interview with German newspaper BILD, Hoeness said: "For months we were accused of not buying enough top-class or experienced players. That's precisely what's now a huge advantage for us, because we all decided together not to buy expensive players like Xavi [Simons] or [Jamie] Gittens, who had been discussed, or [Benjamin] Sesko, who costs €80 million. 

“Instead, we said, come on, let's do nothing, let's just loan [Nicolas] Jackson from Chelsea. And that's how we ended up with a relatively balanced transfer budget. And we also have a coach [Vincent Kompany] who agreed to giving young players a chance.

“The Thomas Muller decision [letting the forward leave upon the expiration of his contract] was also extremely tough, but important. Because one thing is clear: if Thomas Muller had stayed, he would have been on the bench – and then the whole stadium would have chanted 'Muller, Muller' every time someone was substituted. And then [Lennart] Karl and [Tom] Bischof would have been relegated to the sidelines.”

It is not the first time a Bayern board member has sent a jibe towards a Premier League club this season, with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge having earlier labelled Newcastle as “idiots” for spending £69m (€79m/$93m) on striker Nick Woltemade - another player who was linked with a summer move to the Allianz Arena.

He told German publication Blickpunkt Sport in September: “When the story with Woltemade and Stuttgart's demands came up, at some point I said to Uli [Hoeness], Herbert Hainer, Jan Dreesen and Max Eberl: 'Guys, we're getting into sums of money that I simply don't find acceptable anymore,'"

Rummenigge then joked that one could only “congratulate Stuttgart for finding an idiot [Newcastle] who paid so much money,” adding: "Because we certainly wouldn't have done that in Munich.”

Woltemade, 23, has been in excellent form since arriving at Newcastle on 30 August, scoring seven goals in 17 appearances in all competitions for the club. Eddie Howe's side return to league action against Simons' Tottenham on Tuesday, while Gittens will be hoping to feature when Chelsea travel to Leeds on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, United head coach Amorim confirmed before his side's 2-1 league victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday that Sesko could make his return against West Ham on Thursday.

 Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images

Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo has been granted indefinite leave by the club following a request for a period of absence.

The Uruguay international has played 15 games across all competitions for Hansi Flick's side this campaign and his most recent appearance was in last week's Champions League defeat at Chelsea, when he was sent off in the 44th minute.

The 26-year-old was not part of the Barca matchday squad for Saturday's 3-1 league home win over Alaves on Saturday.

Araujo's representative met with Barca sporting director Deco on Monday to discuss the matter with the club committed to giving him the time he needs.

“It is a private situation, I don't want to say more,” Barca head coach Hansi Flick had said earlier on Monday. “And please, if you can respect it I'd appreciate it.”

The coach's comments came after Barca president Joan Laporta said on Friday that he wanted to “support and defend” the player.

“He has been heavily criticised, and I don't think that's fair,” Laporta said at an event in Andorra.

“He gives his all on the pitch, he's our captain, and now he needs to get through this difficult period because he's a very emotional person with strong feelings.

“He's had a tough time, and I want to tell him that we're behind him, that he needs to turn the page because here we all win and we all lose, and no one person is responsible for defeats or victories.”

Araujo, a central defender who has also been played at right-back, has made 190 first-team appearances for Barca since joining in 2018 from Uruguayan club Boston River.

Barca go into Tuesday's match against Atletico Madrid one point clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga and three clear of fourth-place Atletico.

You may fall into different camps about who you want to see the U.S. men's national team play against in the group phase at the World Cup. A bunch of low-ranked teams? A gauntlet of star-laden opponents? Familiar foes? Unknown opponents? All of the above? 

If that's the case, then this potential group will provide plenty of drama and an unhealthy dose of heartburn. FOX Sports analysts and U.S. men's team greats Landon Donovan, Stu Holden, Cobi Jones, and Alexi Lalas put together the worst-case scenario for the USMNT. 

FIFA World Ranking: 16Qualifying record: 7W-7D-4LTop scorer: Darwin Núñez (5 goals)

Donovan: Despite the 5-1 thrashing of Uruguay very recently for our U.S. team, that is a really dangerous opponent. They won't be bothered by the weather or the travel. There won't be a massive Uruguayan contingent, but their fans are passionate, and it's just a team that, when they're all full strength, they're very dangerous. And by the way: getting beat 5-1 by the U.S. and then being placed in our group? It would be an absolute revenge game for them. This is a team I would not want to face. That would be a worst-case scenario for me.

Holden: I'm with you. You think of the Uruguay of the past with Luis Suárez, Edinson Cavani and Diego Godín, but now they've got Darwin Núñez, and they just have this ruthlessness about them. I'm also looking at another South American team in Pot 2. If I was to say another one it would maybe be Morocco, but more so Colombia. I just think seeing what they did at the Copa América in 2024, even in the pre-friendlies, the U.S. played them a got absolutely thrashed. They're a team that can run the score up on you 6-0, 7-0. Luis Diaz is electric. They're going to bring one of the biggest parties off of the field that we've seen in a World Cup. It's a very dangerous, high-octane team.

FIFA World Ranking: 29Qualifying record: 8W-0D-0LTop scorer: Erling Haaland (16 goals)

Jones: When you've got Erling Haaland, "The Viking," arguably (and I don't even know who would argue against it) the best striker in the world playing up against you, I don't think the U.S. wants to see that. And then you talk about Antonio Nusa and Oscar Bobb, the wingers that Norway has and how they're electric 1-v-1 in dribbling and taking you on. Martin Odegaard and his fantastic left foot. They're good all the way around, solid. I may be jinxing them a bit here, but is this their Golden Generation?

Holden: In a one-off game, do you take the U.S. or Norway?

Jones: Right now, unfortunately, I would probably say Norway.

Donovan: They're way better than a Pot 3 team. They're not a Pot 1 team. It's just recently that this form has come, so it hasn't caught up yet.

Holden: But doing it in qualifying is different from doing it in a World Cup.

Jones: Very true, but look at Haaland and what he has done: 16 goals in the UEFA qualifying process; the closest person to him has eight goals. I mean, that's insane.

Donovan: This is what I think about: our U.S. team, in the recent friendlies that we've played, you play against some decent strikers. If you have to play against a player like that, it is a nightmare. It's a nightmare in a World Cup. You get isolated in a 1-v-1, it's a disaster.

Holden: He's dunking on you.

FIFA World Ranking: 72Qualifying record: 8W-1D-1LTop scorer: Jordan Ayew (7 goals)

Lalas: History matters and Ghana is in Pot 4 — it's going to be Ghana. This isn't a great Ghana team, but it's still Ghana, and we have plenty of history playing against Ghana.

Holden: Give me Ghana.

Donovan: I want to play them. I want to get over that hurdle. For my personal sake, I want some vindication.

Holden: 2010 still hurts, man. We had 'em.

Trouble may be brewing at Real Madrid, with Los Blancos' dressing room said to be divided when it comes to head coach Xabi Alonso and the methods that he has introduced since taking the reins in the Spanish capital. Precious points have been dropped over recent weeks, leading to uncomfortable questions being asked of those underperforming on and off the field.

Real's latest setback came in a 1-1 draw with relegation-threatened Girona. They have been held in their last three La Liga fixtures - having also failed to emerge victorious against Rayo Vallecano and Elche - and now trail Clasico rivals Barcelona by one point in another intriguing title race.

Alonso's side have played four successive games away from home in all competitions - battling to a 4-3 victory over Olympiacos in the Champions League - since their Santiago Bernabeu home played host to an NFL fixture on November 16.

Travel sickness appears to have set in, with The Athletic reporting on a “certain division of opinion in the dressing room” following a run of forgettable results and performances. That is not considered to be terminal just yet, with no “significant impact on the relationship between the players” being seen.

Alonso has, however, found himself under scrutiny for some time. It was revealed back in October that his “personal approach and some of his footballing concepts had not gone down well with a significant number of the first team” in Madrid.

It is claimed that a meeting has taken place at the Bernabeu which saw Alonso and his players attempt to get to the bottom of any supposed issues. First-team stars such as Kylian Mbappe, Federico Valverde and Eduardo Camavinga have attempted to quash talk of their being rifts in the Real camp.

The Athletic claims that there is “currently a mix of players who remain unconvinced about Alonso's methods and others who argue that the manager is not to blame”. Someone that falls into the latter of those two camps has said: “This is not the coach's problem, it's very obvious.”

Another source at the Bernabeu has said: “The problem is not Xabi. Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and (Jude) Bellingham are incompatible; you can't have a balanced team with those three.” It is said that Alonso's messages are “not getting through to the players”, leading to disjointed displays.

Others inside the coaching team have acknowledged the difficulty that Alonso faces when it comes to “changing the dynamic” that he inherited from predecessor Carlo Ancelotti. There is seemingly no quick fix to the problems that he faces.

With that in mind, the former Blancos midfielder is not under immediate pressure when it comes to his job. It is, however, being reported that upcoming clashes - starting with another away game at Athletic Club on Wednesday - are “important not just in terms of results, but in terms of image”.

An insider has conceded that things look “very difficult” at the moment because Real are “playing very badly”, with that stalemate on the road at struggling Girona being viewed as a “disaster”.

That does not bode well for Alonso, who has only taken in 25 games at the helm - winning 18 of those matches and coming unstuck in only three. He was brought back to Madrid after impressing as a coach in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen, whom he led to an unbeaten Bundesliga title triumph in 2023-24.

Some prominent figures there questioned his approach on the back of a return to Spain, with success not enough to keep everybody happy. Similar discussions are now taking place at the Bernabeu.

Alonso still has plenty of time in which to get things right this season - having already overseen a win over Barcelona - and has enough talent at his disposal in order to deliver major silverware. Mbappe, Bellingham, Vinicius and Co must, however, buy into his vision in order for collective triumphs to be enjoyed.

This weekend, nobody was taking any risks with Christian Pulisic, while Tyler Adams scored a stunner, and other U.S. stars also made contributions for their European teams.

Welcome to the latest USMNT Player Tracker.

So often with club and country, there is that niggling tension between the two sets of coaches around player welfare and injury risk.

Club managers gripe about their star players being overused and made to travel long distances for less meaningful international fixtures, while the national boss worries their main man's availability for big tournaments is impacted by the ever-growing demands of the domestic game.

At least when it comes to Christian Pulisic and the onset of the biggest year of his international career, there appears to be an abundance of caution on both sides. Take this weekend, for example. The USMNT star reportedly felt a slight muscle problem during training earlier in the week, and Milan were taking no risks.


Based on his prolonged absence with a hamstring problem in October, the club's medical team decided he should not be part of the squad for Saturday's 1-0 win against Lazio despite the forward's inclination that he was well enough to be involved.

He has a chance of being ready to face the Rome outfit again in the Coppa Italia on Thursday, and for his part, Mauricio Pochettino is likely to be encouraged by Milan's careful treatment of his most important player after he also decided to rest the 27-year-old for the recent friendlies.

Tyler Adams has had some memorable moments during his Bournemouth career so far: big performances, high-level consistency and a reputation for quietly becoming one of the Premier League's most effective defensive midfielders.

But on Saturday, he pulled something out of the locker that not many saw coming — and will be remembered for a long time. Matching memorable Premier League moments by David Beckham and Wayne Rooney, Adams scored an audacious long-distance strike.

Tyler Adams' goal was scored 43.3 metres from goal.

It was the sort of goal that deserved to win any game. Alas, that wasn't to be. But when the disappointment of the eventual 3-2 defeat by Sunderland wears off, Adams can be forgiven for savouring a few replays of his goal.

In the EFL Championship, Patrick Agyemang also notched his third goal of the season for Derby County in a 2-1 defeat by Middlesbrough.

It was his first non-headed goal in England since his summer switch from Charlotte, and his manager John Eustace was at least pleased. 

“I'm delighted for Pat,” Eustace told the club's website afterwards. “It was a goal with his feet after scoring a couple with his head, and he was very composed in front of goal there and took it really well.”

Aidan Morris was missing from Boro's line-up with a leg injury sustained last week in a loss against Coventry. New Boro boss Kim Hellberg said the USMNT man will “be back soon”. 

So too, hopefully, will Haji Wright for Coventry, with the striker missing out again on Saturday as Frank Lampard's side maintained their 10-point lead at the top by beating Charlton Athletic 3-1. Wright, who picked up a hip injury on international duty, is expected back in the middle of December.

In France's Ligue 1, it was a triumphant afternoon for USMNT striker Folarin Balogun and his Monaco team-mates, who pulled off an impressive home win over Paris Saint-Germain, with Takumi Minamino scoring the only goal.

Balogun didn't even manage a shot during a tight encounter, which Monaco finished with 10 men after Thilo Kehrer was sent off on 80 minutes.

The forward still had a smile on his face even when his number came up to be replaced on 85 minutes. It meant a belated home debut for midfielder Paul Pogba, whose first season at Monaco has been ravaged by injury.

Elsewhere in the division, Toulouse battled to a creditable raw at Marseille thanks, in part, to USMNT defender Mark McKenzie. The centre-back created the added-time goal for Santiago Hidalgo, which made it 2-2 and ensured a point for his team on Saturday.

While he may have been happy at the final whistle, Tim Weah, who had a solid performance for the hosts, was more frustrated. 

Tanner Tessmann, meanwhile, proved his versatility for Lyon on Sunday, playing at times as a makeshift centre-back, in their 3-0 win over Nantes.

And it was a winning week for PSV's U.S. duo. After Sergino Dest and Ricardo Pepi helped their side to a shock Champions League win over Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday, they were back at it in a 3-0 victory over Volendam four days later.

Pepi built on his lively substitute cameo against the Premier League champions with a goal that helped keep his own team's title defence ticking over nicely.

Back in Italy, there was a weekend to savour for USMNT goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann too.

His team, Cesena, beat Modena 1-0 on Friday evening, and there is unlikely to be a clearer man-of-the-match winner all season in Serie B. Not only did he save a 24th-minute penalty to keep the game goalless, but Klinsmann also created the eventual winner with the long ball (and direct assist) that led to Jalen Blesa's goal just before half-time.

Manager Michele Mignani was happy, telling the club's website: “It was a team victory, a group victory, and a beautiful victory against a very strong, complete team, built from the goalkeeper to the striker.”

Klinsmann, son of former Germany and USMNT manager Jurgen, made six impressive saves in total throughout the game.

One U.S. player still missing, but not forgotten by his team-mates, is Wolfsburg midfielder Kevin Paredes. Although the 22-year-old, who impressed for the national team in last summer's Olympics, has been a long-term injury absentee for the Bundesliga club this season, captain Max Arnold wants him back soon.

“He's the kind of guy I really like,” Arnold told German media last week. “Because he always gives his all, he works hard. We're missing someone like that, of course.”

Wolfsburg are 15th in the league, but hope to have Paredes finally fully fit after a foot injury by the middle of this month.

We'll see if Pulisic can return for Milan's round-of-16 Coppa Italia tie, as the Rossoneri bid to reach the final again this season (Thursday, 3pm, Paramount +).

Adams might have the taste for goals after his weekend inspiration, and after Everton shipped four on Saturday, the midfielder could be tempted to try his luck again when Bournemouth host the Merseysiders (Tuesday, 2:30pm, Peacock Premium).

Weston McKennie had a good game for Juventus as they beat Cagliari 2-1 on Saturday. See if he can maintain that form as Juve take on Napoli this Sunday (2:45pm, Paramount +).

The countdown to the 2026 World Cup is well and truly on for U.S men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff, and the Argentine's data analysts will have been hard at work after another week of exhilarating action around the globe.

Only 26 players can punch their ticket onto USMNT's roster, with competition for places as fierce as they've ever been, and Friday's World Cup draw is only going to add to the excitement of potentially playing at a home tournament.

Those on the periphery will be working the hardest to get into Pochettino's plans, but no player will take their place on the USMNT's roster for granted—which is potentially why we saw some big-name stars step up this past weekend to deliver in spectacular fashion.

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top five performances from around the globe.

It was a backs to the wall job for Mark McKenzie and his Toulouse teammates on Saturday afternoon, with the USMNT defender's side expected to struggle against Champions League participants Marseille.Toulouse were on the back foot throughout, maintaining just 21% possession, but they dug out a valiant point in stoppage time as McKenzie, playing as part of a back three that transitioned into a five more often than not, set up Santiago Hidalgo for a dramatic equalizer.The surprise assist added to an impressive slate of five clearances, three blocks and two duels won for McKenzie—a stoic showing that left Marseille ruing a missed opportunity to go top of Ligue 1.

Tim Weah played the full 90 minutes of Marseille's clash with Toulouse, but it was his showing in the midweek Champions League fixture against Newcastle United that earns him a place among the best performers of the week.The versatile fullback provided the assist for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 50th-minute winner against the Magpies, capping a well-rounded outing that saw Weah create four chances, complete 93% of his 46 attempted passes and successfully perform seven defensive contributions—including four clearances.He also covered plenty of ground, totaling 10.4km (per FotMob) and was clocked with a top speed of 32.7 km/h.

One of the most outrageous goals of the weekend came away from midfielder Tyler Adams—a player who had only recently broken his Premier League goalscoring duck.With Bournemouth already leading 1–0 at a rain-soaked Sunderland, Adams charged away on the counterattack and advanced into the home team's half at pace with the ball at his feet, before lifting his head to spot goalkeeper Robin Roefs way off his line.He then looped a stunningly executed lob over the Dutchman's head from all of 47.4 yards—only former USMNT goalkeeper Tim Howard has ever scored from further out after his unbelievable wind-assisted goal for Everton against Bolton Wanderers in 2012.Sadly for Adams and Bourmemouth, their 2–0 lead evaporated and they came out on the wrong side of a 3–2 defeat—not the way the central midfielder would have wanted to celebrate just his ninth goal for club and country from 350 appearances.

Juventus needed a morale boost after three straight draws under new manager Luciano Spalletti and they got one with a last-gasp 3–2 Champions League win over Norway's Bodø/Glimt. After falling behind early in the match, Juventus tied the game at one goal apiece in the 48th minute through Loïs Openda, before Weston McKennie scored his first goal of the season to put the Italian side up 2–1 in the 59th minute. Despite the Norwegians tying the game up in the 87th minute, Juventus were able to sneak out with all three points thanks to a stoppage-time winner from another Concacaf star—Canada's Jonathan David.McKennie also won the most duels in the match with nine, created three chances and followed up the positive performance with another good showing in Juve's 2–1 win over Cagliari.

Ricardo Pepi played just once for the USMNT in the calendar year of 2025—but it's fair to say the 22-year-old is doing everything in his power to earn a spot in Pochettino's World Cup plans.Pepi took his season's tally to five goals in all competitions, scoring in the 3–0 Eredivisie win over Volendam, but it was the sheer brilliance of his goal that will make Pochettino sit up and take notice.With the ball dropping over his shoulder, Pepi executed a sublime overhead kick to make it 2–0 after just 24 minutes—the perfect way to build on his sixth minute assist for Joey Veerman's opener.He didn't look too surprised by what he'd done when he got up to celebrate—though anything may be possible for a player who netted 17 goals last season and has a decent scoring record for USMNT in his career to date (13 in 34 appearances).

The USMNT have been told what represents a successful 2026 World Cup, with Brad Friedel looking ahead to the tournament in an exclusive interview with GOAL. Mauricio Pochettino's side are being challenged to reach the knockout stages on home soil, but there will be “no shame” in falling short if they come unstuck against a heavyweight rival such as England or Brazil.

Having qualified as co-hosts of FIFA's flagship event - alongside neighbours Canada and Mexico - the United States have had fewer competitive fixtures to ready them for a shot at global glory. A series of friendlies, Gold Cup games and Nations League ties have, however, allowed Pochettino to experiment and shuffle his pack.

The former Tottenham, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain boss will be close to settling on a 26-man squad that he believes can be competitive against the very best in the business. He is considered to be working with a ‘Golden Generation' of talent but can they live up to expectations, or even exceed them?

Asked what success will look like next summer, former USMNT goalkeeper Friedel - speaking in association with ToonieBet - told GOAL: “My expectation is that we get through the group. I think exceeding expectations is past the quarters. It's really difficult to say what I think will be success or failure, the knockouts etc, until you see the draw and the knockout games. There is no shame in getting knocked out to Brazil or England. It just happens. For me, it's the manner in which it would happen.

“Mauricio I know very well and he is going to have a team that is well prepared, that is fit, that is going to fight for everyone, and they are going to compete really well. That's why I think over a three-game period in the group stages, they can get out of the group - that's what I expect. After that, unfortunately no matter how hard you compete against some of the teams at the World Cup - that's why so few have won it over the history of the tournament - it's difficult to win it. We'll have to wait and see.

“I would say that the team is definitely capable of - with the talent that they have and I know how Mauricio works - getting to the quarter-finals. We'll see after that because then it becomes really hard.

“Sometimes you are going to need luck or penalties or sendings off, or whatever it is. Look at all the great England teams that have been so close. Talent-wise, playing with them and against them, they have had the talent to win a World Cup. For whatever reason, they haven't been able to finish it off.”

The USMNT made it to the last-16 of the 2010, 2014 and 2022 World Cups - having failed to qualify in 2018 - and believe that they can emulate those achievements in their own backyard. They will, however, cross paths with at one least of the favourites at some stage.

Quizzed on whether Lionel Messi and Argentina would be a dream draw or whether it is best to avoid the elite for as long as possible, Friedel added: “You are going to get at least one of the best in your group. Back in ‘94, we were lucky to get out of the group but really unlucky because we had two European countries. We had Switzerland and Romania and Colombia.

“You are going to get somebody really good to play against. The European countries are generally of the higher quality, and the South American countries. I would still say avoid everyone at the top for as long as you can! You can lose against those guys any time, with no shame and playing a really good match, so why not play against people that you know you can beat seven out of 10 times.”

The USMNT will discover their fate - and whether that includes a meeting with eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi, who has helped to guide Inter Miami to the 2025 MLS Cup final - when the group stage draw is held at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC on December 5.

FIFA's new digital resale marketplace gives them exclusive rights to print money

The 2026 FIFA World Cup that's coming to America isn't a celebration — it's a financial shakedown, a gold-plated stick-up, a global extortion scheme hidden behind a soccer ball. 

FIFA organizers didn't just raise the bar for price gouging. They built an entire economic dystopia and handed fans the bill.

Let's start with the "affordable" seats — FIFA's favorite buzzword as it lectures fans about inclusion and accessibility. It proudly crowed about $60 tickets for the "most inclusive World Cup ever." Sounds great, right? Until you see the stadium map, where those $60 seats appear as four microscopic green freckles tucked into the outer reaches of each corner of the upper deck. You'd need a telescope and a Sherpa guide to find them. 

And shocker: They sold out instantly.

Everyone else gets to enjoy FIFA's new "dynamic pricing," which is basically Uber surge pricing if Uber had no brakes, no rules and no shame. Prices rise instantly with demand — and this is the World Cup, where demand is the highest for any sporting event in the world. It's like charging people more for breathing during allergy season.

Then there's FIFA's new masterpiece of cruelty: the "right to buy." This isn't the ticket itself. Oh, no. This is the ticket you buy just to have the right to buy the actual ticket later — at whatever surprise price FIFA pulls out of its vault. Congratulations — you've now purchased a ticket to purchase a ticket.

Opening-round games? Several hundred bucks minimum. USMNT games? More than $2,700, and that's before factoring in the emotional cost of watching the U.S. try to string together more than five passes.

MetLife Stadium is scheduled to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup final.

But the real heist begins deeper into the tournament. Prices explode into the thousands, then tens of thousands, and then — for the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — we enter full-blown luxury-crime-thriller territory.  

The starting price for the final is $5,867. The average? Nearly $13,000. Many seats fly past $6,300, because FIFA apparently assumes every American bought NVIDIA at $12 and never sold.

And for the high rollers, private suites are selling for $199,000, complete with champagne, catered food and your own bathroom where you can privately weep over your financial decisions.

Now for the main heist — and this one comes straight from The Upshot podcast, which broke down the insanity of FIFA's new digital resale marketplace.

FIFA claims it was created to combat gouging. Which is hilarious, because it removed the one thing that actually stopped gouging at past World Cups — the price cap. Now fans can list tickets for whatever wild number they dream up. And when those tickets sell?

FIFA takes 15% from the seller AND 15% from the buyer. A 30% commission.

FIFA basically said, "If anyone is going to fleece fans, it's gonna be us."

The Upshot podcast laid out the perfect example: The cheapest final ticket from the initial lottery was $2,030. The next day, someone listed it for $25,000 — on FIFA's own resale platform. If it sells, FIFA pockets $7,500 for doing absolutely nothing but providing a digital street corner.

And since tickets can be resold over and over, FIFA can just keep raking in commissions.

This isn't a marketplace. This is passive income for tyrants.

Meanwhile, FIFA expects to reinvest 90% of its revenue back into the game to boost soccer around the world, which is adorable PR speak for: "We promise some of this will eventually leave Switzerland."

For context, the most expensive Super Bowl ticket is around $27,000, and even the Champions League final tops out around $35,000. But analysts say the World Cup final might push fans toward $200,000 loans just to walk through the gate.

So no — the 2026 World Cup isn't just a tournament. It's the world's biggest legal mugging.

And FIFA is smiling while they empty your pockets.

Don't let them. Save your hard-earned money, and enjoy the beautiful game on FOX.

Liam Delap has 'got to do more' if he is going to make England's World Cup squad.

That is the view of talkSPORT's Gabby Agbonlahor after the striker's latest Chelsea display.

Delap was a second half substitute during the Blues' 1-1 draw with Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday.

However, his display has caused debate among Chelsea supporters after he struggled to make an impact off the bench.

The 22-year-old had replaced fellow forward Joao Pedro in the 55th minute.

Having failed to score, Delap remains without a Premier League goal since joining the club in June.

The former Ipswich man did miss two months with a hamstring injury earlier in the campaign, though, following his £30million arrival.

Agbonlahor admits that it was a difficult match for Delap to come into but believes he's 'got a lot to improve' to make the World Cup squad.

Assessing his performance alongside Jeff Stelling, he told Breakfast: "It's not easy to come on in a game like that. But I was watching him and I just felt, can you just hold the ball up for your team, win a foul?

"He was slipping over. He wasn't really affecting the game. I'm just looking at this open now for the World Cup.

"Come on Liam, we want you to go to the World Cup, but you've got to do more whenever you get a chance.

"Yesterday wasn't about scoring. It was about holding the ball up, gaining fouls for your team. But he's got a lot to improve to get into that England squad."

Delap has three goals in 12 caps for England at under-21 level but is yet to be called up to a senior squad.

Meanwhile, captain Harry Kane was the only recognised striker included by Thomas Tuchel in November.

It came as Ollie Watkins was left out of the side due to fitness concerns.

Despite his league goal drought, Delap has found the net twice in 15 appearances for Chelsea across all competitions.

Having joined the club at the end of last season, he was part of the side which won the Club World Cup in the summer.

Former Chelsea full-back Ashley Cole, who is currently an assistant manager to England Under-21 boss Lee Carsley, backed Delap for a World Cup spot in the summer.

Asked if he thinks the forward has a chance of being on the plane, he told talkSPORT: "I think they all have, I really do.

"Working with Liam on and off for about two years, at the start of the campaign we had him in the squad and he was influential in qualifying us.

"He's a great lad, he's enthusiastic, he wants to learn, he wants to get to the next level and he's got all the tools to do it."

England qualified for the tournament by topping their group with maximum points and without conceding a goal.

Tuchel will learn his group stage opponents during Friday's World Cup draw, with two friendlies also set to be scheduled for March.

They are expected to provide players with a final opportunity to force their way into the squad for the finals.

Chelsea star Enzo Fernandez says he aims to captain Argentina after Lionel Messi.

Fernandez burst onto the world scene at World Cup 2022, brought in to bolster Argentina, who had fallen to a shock defeat by Saudi Arabia in the opening stages. 

The midfielder helped his side to the World Cup in Qatar and has since won several trophies in West London with Chelsea, such as the Club World Cup and Conference League. 

The 24-year-old is now pushing for his country to lift the World Cup once more, for the first time since Brazil recorded back-to-back World Cup wins in 1958 and 1962. 

Speaking this week, Fernandez told GIVEMESPORT that he dreams of taking Messi's role of captaining Argentina and leading his country to glory. 

“On a personal level, of course, I dream of captaining Argentina, but that decision doesn't come down to me. It's up to the coaching staff. Of course, I dream of being the Argentina captain. 

“I don't know when it might be. Time will tell, and it's up to the coaching staff to make the decision. It's certainly one of my dreams, and I'd be honoured to wear the captain's armband.” 

Fernandez also opened up on defending their title in what will be Messi's last World Cup for his country in what will be an emotional end. 

“We'll try to defend it and win it again, which is what this national team must do. The Argentine people are so passionate and we always want more. Our mentality is that we deserve to defend our World Cup crown and have a great tournament, which means winning it.” 

 “Winning the World Cup is in the past now, and we are focused on what lies ahead. We know it could be Messi's last World Cup, so we'll aim to defend our crown from Qatar as a team. We'll do our best to retain it.”

When the FIFA World Cup comes to North America next year, pubs such as the Dog and Bear in Toronto won't be able to use the words 'World Cup' or other associated images or slogans.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

In June of next year, fans will pack into the Dog and Bear, a popular sports bar on Toronto's Queen Street West, to watch countries battle it out in soccer's greatest tournament, which is being co-hosted for the first time in Canada. Just don't call it a “World Cup” watch party. 

The 2026 World Cup is expected to be the most lucrative sports event ever staged, with FIFA's revenues projected to be in excess of $14-billion, according to a recent report by a British marketing firm. 

For the 16 Canadian, Mexican and U.S. cities that will be playing host to games, it will also be a test of their ability to protect corporate trademarks. 

As part of their host-city agreements, Toronto and Vancouver are obligated to enforce the trademark rights of the International Federation of Association Football, known by its French initials FIFA, and create a two-kilometre-wide brand-exclusive “clean zone” around their stadiums for official World Cup sponsors. 

That means municipal bylaw officers and volunteer brand-protection agents will be patrolling the streets around those venues, looking for signs of trademark infringement. 

Some businesses in the affected areas may be surprised to learn that common terms or images associated with FIFA – such as the phrase “World Cup” or its iconic golden trophy – are off-limits in their advertising around the tournament, even if it's just a sandwich board urging people to come inside and watch on TV. 

“I can't say the World Cup?” asked Richard Lambert, co-owner of the Dog and Bear pub, when informed of the restrictions for the first time. 

To help businesses such as his, the city has produced a guide on words to use and avoid when promoting World Cup celebrations. He said the rules mean his bar will have to tiptoe around the obvious when it rents out its second floor to create a 600-person watch party for every game. 

“I guess we'll just have to say ‘football is being played here,'” Mr. Lambert said. 

In addition to “clean zone” rules, Toronto and Vancouver are required by FIFA to patrol major routes into their stadiums, looking for any signs of non-FIFA-affiliated companies trying to cash in on the World Cup, and guarantee that airspace above their stadiums is ad-free. They must also keep any host-city events “free and clean of any visible third-party advertising,” according to the agreements. 

Neither city could provide an estimate as to what these brand-policing efforts might cost, but Vancouver said it hoped to meet its obligations with existing bylaw resources. Saira Virani, a spokesperson for the City of Toronto, said the municipality was still “working with FIFA to define” what enforcement efforts would look like within the brand-protection zone” around BMO Field – which for the tournament will be called Toronto Stadium.

Under the agreements, the costs of policing FIFA's trademark interests are to be carried by the host cities, which are also barred from generating any outside advertising revenue associated with the World Cup. The international soccer federation says this is “common practice for major international sporting events” and that it's good for the game. 

“The FIFA World Cup is one of the most iconic football competitions in the world. Investing time and resources to protect its brands is of paramount importance to FIFA in order to secure the revenue streams which enable us to support the development and growth of football, globally,” FIFA's Alicia Diotte, head of public relations for the Canadian portion of the tournament, said in an e-mail.

FIFA is no stranger to the war waged by major sporting events against ambush marketing, a problem that dates back to at least 1996 during the Atlanta Olympics, when Nike blitzed every available ad space in the city despite not being a sponsor. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, FIFA officials ejected 36 Dutch fans from a stadium and had them detained by police after they showed up wearing orange dresses affiliated with a non-sponsor brewery. 

Brand protection was also an issue at the Olympic Games in 2010, when the owner of Olympia, a Greek restaurant in Vancouver, was threatened with legal action over the use of Olympic rings on his business's sign. The Olympic Organizing Committee finally backed down after thousands of people signed a petition in his defence. 

John Furlong, head of the organizing committee for those Vancouver Games, said most businesses were co-operative, however, and there were not a lot of major trademark infractions. 

Organizers need to use their discretion, he said, and do plenty of outreach so affected businesses understand the rules around trademarks and the reasons behind them.

“We tried not to be ridiculously heavy-handed,” he said. “You really need the public on your side.”

Canada men get first look at what could await them at draw for 2026 FIFA World Cup

The brand-protection efforts are not only demanded by FIFA, but also by the companies that partner with it. 

Candice Kloes, a lawyer and expert in trademark law at Borden Ladner Gervais, said FIFA sponsors such as Coca-Cola pay many millions to be affiliated with the World Cup, and have a “reasonable expectation” that competitors won't get the benefit of association with the brand for free. 

Host cities receive a lot of economic benefit from the World Cup in the form of tourism and hospitality spending, so the cost of using municipal staff to protect FIFA's brands and trademarks are worth it, she added.

It's why cities are willing to enact bylaws to protect those brands – as Vancouver did this week – and why Canada enacted specific legislation in 2007 to protect Olympic trademarks ahead of the Vancouver Games. 

Vancouver plans temporary bylaw changes ahead of 2026 soccer World Cup

The temporary bylaws introduced by Vancouver will allow the city to aggressively remove any graffiti and clamp down on unauthorized advertising related to the World Cup.

FIFA has shown that it will use the courts to protect its affiliated brands if necessary. It wants anyone considering ambush marketing at the World Cup to know that they face potential fines and other penalties, and will have municipal staff on the lookout, Ms. Kloes said.

For companies – or even the local pub planning to hold watch parties – that want to cash in on the excitement around the World Cup without paying for that association, it's just not worth the risk, she said. 

“These are very famous trademarks that come with a lot of reputation. And so, it's difficult to be able to say that the small pub down the street can use it, but not the big guy up the road. It's best to enforce it across the board,” she said.

Ahead of the FIFA World
Cup 2026 draw on Friday 5 December, the Opta supercomputer has
produced its early predictions for this summer's tournament in
North America. Here are the
results.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place in Washington D.C. on 5
December, allowing fans of all nations to start plotting their
routes to a possible coronation at New Jersey's MetLife
Stadium.

Sixteen venues across the United States, Canada and Mexico will
play host to the biggest-ever edition of the tournament, with the
number of teams increasing from 32 and 48 and the tally of games
upped from 64 to 104.

Six of the teams appearing at the tournament are still to be
decided, with four qualifying via the UEFA play-offs and another
two via the inter-confederation playoffs.

But most of the favourites are set, with Lionel Messi hoping to
help Argentina become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to
successfully defend their crown.

Argentina, though, will face fierce competition, not least from
2022 runners-up France and reigning European champions Spain.

England and Brazil, meanwhile, will hope the appointments of
Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti prove inspired decisions.

Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal should not be discounted, while the
three host nations will be desperate to make their mark.

And what of a Norway team spearheaded by Manchester City goal
machine Erling Haaland?

Ahead of this week's draw, we have taken a deep dive into the
Opta supercomputer's first set of World Cup predictions to assess
who is most likely to lift the trophy.

At Euro 2024, Luis de la Fuente's Spain produced one of the most
eye-catching international tournament successes in recent
memory.

La Roja swept all before them, winning six of their seven
matches inside 90 minutes and only requiring extra-time to
eliminate hosts Germany in the quarter-final. They scored 15 goals
in the tournament – four more than anyone else.

And there has been no downturn from De la Fuente's side since.
Spain are now unbeaten in their last 31 competitive games (W25 D6,
excluding penalty shootouts), beating the famous 30-match run they
enjoyed under Vicente del Bosque between 2010 and 2013 – a streak
that saw them win both the World Cup and the Euros.

By the time the next international break comes around in March,
it'll be three years since Spain last lost a competitive match.
That defeat came away at Scotland on 28 March 2023 in a Euro 2024
qualifier (2-0).

It is little surprise, then, that Spain are our predictive
model's early World Cup favourites, going all the way in 17.0% of
tournament predictions.

If Spain are to triumph, it is likely Lamine Yamal will play a
key role. Their Euro 2024 triumph came the day after Yamal's 17th
birthday, as he replaced Pelé (1958, 17 years, 249 days) as the
youngest player to feature in a World Cup or European Championship
final.

Yamal created the most chances at the tournament, with 19, while
only teammate Nico Williams (2.1) had more expected assists (xA)
than his 2.0.

Spain will be closely monitoring the progress of Rodri, with the
midfielder playing just 294 minutes in the Premier League for Man
City since tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last year.
Barcelona duo Pedri and Gavi will also look to prove their fitness
after injury-disrupted starts to 2025-26.

But if their key players enter the tournament in good health,
Spain will be supremely confident of repeating their feat from
2008-12 of holding the Euros and World Cup trophies at the same
time.

The 2026 World Cup will mark the end of an era in French
football, with Didier Deschamps set to stand down from his role as
Les Bleus' head coach after 14 years at the helm. He will hope to
go out with a bang and cement his legacy as France's greatest
boss.

Deschamps' reign has comprised 175 games, so if they reach the
first knockout round, he will have overseen 100 games more than
France's next-longest serving boss (Raymond Domenech, 79).

After watching his team fall agonisingly short on penalties
against Argentina in Qatar, he has another chance to become only
the second coach to win multiple World Cups (after Vittorio Pozzo
in 1934 and 1938).

Deschamps also lifted the trophy as a player when he was captain
in 1998 and this will be Kylian Mbappé's first World Cup as France
skipper.

The Real Madrid sensation will be targeting individual and team
records.

Mbappé is closing in on Olivier Giroud's mark of 57 goals for
France, having netted 55 times in his 93 caps. There is a good
chance that record falls before the World Cup, but he is also
chasing down Miroslav
Klose's all-time total of 16 goals at World Cups, having netted
12 times in just two editions of the tournament (four in 2018,
eight in 2022).

Messi (13) is one goal ahead of Mbappé, who will surely take
possession of the record eventually. But the prospect of two icons
duelling to end the tournament in the lead should be absorbing
viewing.

France also boast the player recently crowned the world's best,
and it is not Mbappé. Ousmane Dembélé won the 2025 Ballon d'Or
after spearheading Paris Saint-Germain's run to a first UEFA
Champions League crown, scoring 33 goals and recording 13 assists
in 2024-25 from a central attacking role.

Finding a way to get Mbappé and Dembélé to function in the same
attack will be one of the major conundrums facing Deschamps.

With a 14.1% chance, France are the supercomputer's second
favourites, just behind Spain, who beat them 5-4 in the semi-finals
of the UEFA Nations League in June.

The only one other team assigned more than a one-in-10 chance of
becoming world champions is England, who are out to end 60 years of
hurt at major tournaments.

The Three Lions enter their first – and potentially only –
tournament under Tuchel as third favourites with a 11.8%
probability of lifting the trophy, having come up short in two
European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.

Tuchel's task is simple – get international football's nearly
men over the line. He could become only the third manager to win
both the UEFA Champions League and the World Cup, after Marcello
Lippi (Juventus, Italy) and Del Bosque (Real Madrid, Spain).

His England reign took some time to get going, as England
laboured past Albania (3-0), Latvia (2-0), Andorra (1-0 and 2-0)
and were beaten 3-1 by Senegal in a June friendly.

But a rampant 5-0 victory in Serbia in September showcased the
Three Lions' potential, and the emergence of Elliot Anderson seems
to have finally ended their search for a central midfield partner
for Declan Rice.

England ultimately finished Group K with eight wins – and eight
clean sheets – from as many matches, becoming only the second team
to win all their games in a UEFA World Cup qualifying campaign
without conceding after Yugoslavia in 1954.

Southgate's England teams were also solid at the back but rarely
free-flowing. At Euro 2024, they recorded just 5.4 xG – Turkey,
Austria and Switzerland were among the teams to better that
tally.

So, Tuchel is also expected to provide better entertainment, and
he certainly has the tools to do so, with a stunning array of
options to choose from, particularly in the attacking midfield
positions.

There should be plenty of service for Harry Kane, who is
Europe's most in-form striker, netting 24 goals in 20 matches for
Bayern Munich since the start of the season in August. But there is
a competitive race for the positions behind the England skipper
after Tuchel suggested Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden could not
both start, while Cole Palmer's season has barely got going due to
injuries.

Given the way England often toiled at Euro 2024, Tuchel's
refusal to crowbar in the big names could come as a breath of fresh
air, and the likes of Eberechi Eze and Morgan Rogers are staking
impressive claims.

In the eyes of Argentina's supporters, Messi struggled to emerge
from Diego Maradona's shadow until the 2022 World Cup.

But the Barcelona legend produced one of the greatest individual
World Cup campaigns, scoring seven goals and assisting three, while
becoming the first player to ever net in the group stage, last 16,
quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of a single edition.

Messi also led all players in Qatar for shots (32), chances
created from open play (17) and fouls won (22), becoming the
second player to top all three metrics at a single World Cup. The
other? Maradona in 1986 (30 shots, 19 open-play chances created, 53
fouls won).

Now, he gets the opportunity to do something even Maradona could
not accomplish – win a second World Cup.

Messi has shown no signs of slowing down, helping Inter Miami
reach the Major League Soccer Cup final while contributing a
staggering 35 goals and providing 21 assists in MLS action this
year.

The attacker 
already leads all players for appearances (26) and goal
involvements (21, since assists were first recorded in 1966) at
World Cups, while Messi's battle to break Klose's goal record
before Mbappé is an enthralling additional storyline.

Argentina dominated the CONMEBOL World Cup qualification group,
finishing nine points clear of second-placed Ecuador, and last year
they also retained the Copa América for the first time since
1993.

A lack of recent match practice against top-class European
opponents could count against the Albiceleste, who also saw Ángel
Di María retire from international football after the Copa
América.

But the likes of Enzo Fernández and Julián Alvarez have kicked
on in the last two years, and any team which has Messi has a chance
of going all the way – a creditable 8.7% chance, according to the
supercomputer.

Germany are the supercomputer's fifth favourites with a 7.1%
chance of winning a record-equalling fifth World Cup.

But by the time next year's tournament rolls around, it will
have been 12 years since Germany played a knockout game at a World
Cup. That was when they beat Argentina in the 2014 final.

Julian Nagelsmann's side were beaten in the quarter-finals on
home soil at Euro 2024, marking the first time Germany have
appeared at four major tournaments (World Cup/Euros) in a row
without reaching a semi-final at any of them.

Their route to this World Cup was not completely smooth, either,
as they were left needing victory over Slovakia in their final
Group A game to avoid the play-offs. But they won that match by a
statement 6-0 scoreline, with Nick Woltemade, Serge Gnabry and
Leroy Sané among the goals.

Germany arguably played some of the best football at Euro 2024,
ranking second for average possession (62.5%) and goals scored
(11), but Nagelsmann has plenty of selection dilemmas to
consider.

Marc-André ter Stegen has lost his place as Barcelona's
first-choice goalkeeper after undergoing back surgery, while
Nagelsmann has tested multiple midfield pairings since Toni Kroos'
retirement – Aleksandar Pavlović partnered Leon Goretzka in the
final two qualifiers.

Germany have at least scraped into Pot 1 for the group-stage
draw, taking the 12th and final spot among the top seeds, ahead of
Croatia, and despite question marks it would be rash not to
consider them as contenders at this stage.

When Cristiano Ronaldo swapped Manchester United for Al-Nassr
after the 2022 World Cup, some may have expected it to be a case
of, ‘out of sight, out of mind'.

But the five-time Ballon d'Or winner simply cannot stop making
headlines, with FIFA recently announcing Ronaldo would not serve
the typical three-match ban following his red card in Portugal's
defeat to the Republic of Ireland, freeing him up to play their
World Cup opener.

And after Messi finally ended his wait for a World Cup win in
Qatar, Portugal are assigned a 6.6% chance of giving Ronaldo his
own crowning moment.

Portugal boast, on paper, one of the most talented squads at the
tournament. Vitinha, João Neves and Nuno Mendes all enjoyed
spectacular 2024-25 campaigns with PSG, while EPL stars Rúben Dias,
Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes make up a technically-gifted and
highly-experienced spine.

But when the tournament begins, the likelihood is that Ronaldo
will hog the headlines, just as he did in Qatar in 2022 and at Euro
2024. At the former tournament, Ronaldo was dropped for a last-16
tie against Switzerland after a series of ineffective displays, and
his replacement Gonçalo Ramos scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 win.

Then, in Germany, Ronaldo broke down in tears after seeing a
penalty saved in Portugal's last-16 tie against Slovenia, which
they eventually won on spot-kicks.

Portugal went out to France at the next stage, as Ronaldo ended
the tournament without a goal from 23 shots and 3.6 xG – the
second-highest tally at the competition.

Like Messi, 
Ronaldo will appear at a record-breaking sixth edition of the World
Cup, but of his eight goals in 22 games at the tournament,
three have been penalties and none have come in the knockout
stages.

However, this year's Nations League triumph offers significant
hope that Roberto Martínez can get the balance right even while
accommodating the 40-year-old, who is still full of confidence
after scoring 84 goals in 86 Saudi Pro League games.

Fans have learned to never write Ronaldo off, and however
Portugal's campaign goes, it is unlikely to be dull.

Brazil are the only side to qualify for every edition of the
World Cup, though the Seleção cut things a little too fine this
time around, finishing fifth in CONMEBOL's qualifiers.

Ancelotti was only in charge for the final five games of their
campaign, but less than eight months into his reign, he has already
overseen surprise defeats to Bolivia and Japan, as well as poor
draws with Ecuador and Tunisia.

Next year, it will have
been 24 years since Brazil last lifted the World Cup. They have
only endured one previous drought of that length since first
winning the tournament in 1958, between 1970 and 1994.

That previous dry spell ended, of course, in the United States,
and Brazil are assigned a 5.6% chance of another stateside
triumph.

If Brazil are to go all the way, Ancelotti must find a way to
get more out of Vinícius Júnior.

Vinícius has played under five different head coaches since
joining Real Madrid, and 149 of his 192 goal involvements for the
club came during Ancelotti's second spell in charge of Los
Blancos.

Estêvão's flying start to life with Chelsea gives Brazil another
electric option out wide, though it remains to be seen whether
Ancelotti will bow to pressure to recall Neymar – if he proves his
fitness – for his first appearance since 2023, amid the forward's
persistent injury issues.

Brazil have consistently underwhelmed in recent years, failing
to get past the last eight at the two most recent World Cups and
the 2024 Copa América, but if any manager can get them to perform
on the big stage in a knockout tournament, it's Ancelotti.

The Netherlands have reached the most World Cup finals without
ever lifting the trophy (three), and they are the eighth and final
team assigned more than a 5% chance of triumphing next year, at
5.2%.

The Oranje's run to the semi-finals of Euro 2024 – losing late
on to England – was their best at any tournament since finishing
third at the 2014 World Cup.

Their current side has a distinctly English influence, with four
Premier League players scoring in their final World Cup qualifier
versus Lithuania (4-0, Tijjani Reijnders, Cody Gakpo, Xavi Simons
and Donyell Malen) – the first time that has occurred for the
Netherlands.

Ronald Koeman has restored the traditional Dutch 4-3-3 system
and has been rewarded with some positive performances against elite
opponents.

One recurring issue in recent years has been their lack of a
true centre-forward. But Memphis Depay remains a talisman for his
nation, becoming their all-time leading scorer when he netted his
51st international goal in September.

The Netherlands may lack the star power of the other main
favourites and are slipping under the radar with many, but the
supercomputer thinks they are worthy of consideration.

France became the sixth team to win the World Cup as hosts in
1998, but no side has accomplished the feat since then.

Even the most ardent supporters of the United States, Mexico or
Canada would struggle to make the case for a home triumph in 2026,
but with a little luck in the draw, you never know.

Eleven of the tournament's venues are in the USA, and Mauricio
Pochettino's side are assigned a 0.9% chance of going all the way.
They will be placed in Group D, with two of their first-round games
taking place in Los Angeles and the other in Seattle.

The USMNT appointed Pochettino after of a humiliating
group-stage exit as Copa América hosts last year, and things did
not immediately improve as the Argentine lost five of his first 10
matches at the helm.

Pochettino's side did reach the final of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold
Cup, despite star names including Christian Pulisic, Weston
McKennie, Folarin Balogun and Antonee Robinson missing the
tournament.

Pochettino has had no choice but to experiment – in November,
Giovani Reyna's return to the squad saw him become the 51st player
to start a game for the USMNT in 2025.

Along with the Gold Cup run, a 5-1 win over Uruguay last time
out put Pochettino's critics on notice, and the USA should feel
good about their chances of being competitive in the knockout
stages.

Mexico, the team that defeated the USA in the Gold Cup final,
are the host nation viewed as most likely to shock the world and
lift the trophy, with a 1.3% probability.  

It remains to be seen how the introduction of a round of 32 will
affect El Tri, who lost in the round of 16 at seven consecutive
World Cups before suffering a group-stage exit in Qatar.

Javier Aguirre's team will play in the tournament's opening
match, in Mexico City on 11 June, but they failed to win any of
their final six games in 2025 (D3 L3) – all of them friendlies –
with five of those coming against teams lower than them in the FIFA
World Rankings.

There will likely be an experienced feel to their squad, led by
Fulham striker Raúl Jiménez, who is only eight away from Javier
Hernández's all-time Mexico goal record of 52.

But it remains to be seen whether 
40-year-old goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa will earn a historic
call-up. He is the third player – alongside Messi and Ronaldo –
able to appear at an unprecedented sixth edition of the World Cup
and was selected for the Gold Cup, so watch this space.

Canada are deemed the least likely of the host nations to go all
the way, winning the tournament in just 0.4% of our simulations,
though they are only a year removed from a historic tournament
run.

Mere weeks into Jesse Marsch's reign, Canada reached the
semi-finals on their Copa América debut, losing 2-0 to eventual
winners Argentina. Only a penalty shootout denied them a bronze
medal, as they lost to Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay in the third-place
play-off.

But a stunning defeat to Guatemala, in another shootout, ended
Canada's Gold Cup campaign at the quarter-final stage and brought
them crashing down to earth.

If Canada are to spring a surprise on home soil (their Group B
fixtures will all be played in Toronto or Vancouver), they will
need Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies to be in peak condition,
having been sidelined with an anterior cruciate ligament injury
since March.

In addition to the top eight favourites, there are two other
teams given at least a 2% chance of winning the World Cup –
Norway (2.3%) and Colombia
(2.0%).

Norway will be the team nobody wishes to draw from Pot 3, having
steamrolled their way through the UEFA qualifiers with a perfect
eight wins and 37 goals – the most of any team.  

Haaland struck 16 of those goals, matching Robert Lewandowski's
2018 record for the most prolific UEFA World Cup qualification
campaign. Lewandowski scored his tally in 10 games, two more than
Haaland.

Colombia also deserve their lofty status in our
projections, as they come in the tournament off the back of a run
to the final of the 2024 Copa América, having outscored all other
teams at that tournament with 12 goals.

The resurgence of James Rodríguez made headlines at that
competition, as he led the way for chances created (20) and assists
(six) – that latter tally equalled the record for a single edition,
alongside Brazil's Alex in 2003.

Those teams round out the top 10 favourites, with
Belgium next with a 1.9% probability. Many members
of the Red Devils' ‘Golden Generation' remain in the fold, even if
the years are starting to catch up with them.

Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, now teammates at Napoli, and
Thibaut Courtois will all feature at a fourth edition of the World
Cup – no player has ever represented Belgium at more (Enzo Scifo
also four).

This will be Rudi Garcia's first tournament in charge since
replacing Domenico Tedesco in January, and even if Belgium are no
longer the force they once were – they drew three of their eight
qualifiers and only finished two points ahead of Wales – they
remain a threat.

Croatia are another team whose best days may be
behind them but can never be ruled out. Semi-finalists in both 2018
and 2022, they are assigned a 1.1% chance of glory – lower than
Mexico and Uruguay (1.7%), whose coach Bielsa
recently went on a rant in a press conference following speculation
over his position.

Inspirational Croatia captain Luka Modrić is hoping to appear at
his fifth World Cup at the age of 40, and no team will want to see
Croatia drawn into their group from Pot 2.

Morocco (1.1%) and Ecuador
(1.0%) are the other teams with a greater than 1% chance of glory,
with Japan (0.9%) and USA just behind.

And of course, there are also six teams still to be decided in
March's play-offs. There is currently a combined 3.7% chance of any
of those sides going all the way, with Italy
surely the most likely candidates if they can end their World Cup
exile.

When the tournament begins, it will have been 20 years since the
Azzurri played a knockout match at the World Cup – with their most
recent such game being the 2006 final.

They must get past Northern Ireland and
potentially Wales to make it, with both of those
sides hoping to join fellow home nations England and
Scotland.

Appearing at their first World Cup since 1998, the Tartan Army
are given a 0.2% chance of lifting the trophy, level with the likes
of South Africa, Australia,
Iran and Tunisia.

Sweden (in 1958) and Czechia
(in 1934 and 1962) have both been World Cup finalists previously
(the latter as Czechoslovakia) but could still miss the tournament,
as could former European champions Denmark.

If previous World Cups are anything to go by, shocks and
surprises should be a given, so all those teams will still be
dreaming of a deep run.

With 48 teams taking part, there also will be some new names
gracing the tournament.

Debutants Uzbekistan are seen as having a
slightly better chance of impressing than the other new nations, as
they have a 0.2% chance of going all the way. A more realistic aim
might be getting through the groups after impressing in AFC
qualification – beating out sides like Qatar and United Arab
Emirates.

Cape Verde (0.1%) have qualified and are the
second-smallest nation by population (after Iceland in 2018) to
achieve the feat. They fared slightly better with our model than
the other first-timers Curaçao and
Jordan (both 0.04%).

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Panama and New
Zealand all could be in for a difficult summer as they
have the same rating as Cape Verde (all 0.1%).

As things stand, the least likely nation to prevail after coming
out bottom in our simulations is Haiti (0.03%), who have qualified
for the first time since 1974, but it already looks clear there are
going to be some brilliant stories from top to bottom in next
year's tournament.

This week, Steve Tignor will reveal his ATP Matches of the Year, and the TENNIS.com editors will reveal our ATP Players of the Year. The WTA editions will begin Monday, December 8.It was a little after 11:30 P.M. when Tommy Paul double reached match point against Nuno Borges in their second-round match at the US Open.The fans in Arthur she Stadium stood and raised their Honey Deuces, ready to celebrate an American victory. One more point for Paul and—by the standards of the City That Never Sleeps—an ideal evening session would be completed, comfortably before midnight.Up to that moment, this contest had offered just the right blend of rapid-fire rallies and competitive tension. Borges, an amiable, clean-hitting native of Portugal, had gone up a break early in the third set, but now he seemed to have come to the end of his line. The script had been followed to a T.Time after time, Paul looked ready to close out the 41st-ranked Borges. Time after time, his smilingly stubborn opponent reeled him back in.Still, there was a slight problem with the final scene: Borges was serving. He quickly used two first serves to erase both match points. Two more strong points from Borges followed, and the score was 5-5, back to square one. The fans sat back down.And they sat. And they cheered. And they groaned. And they screamed. And they sat and cheered and groaned and screamed some more. Over the next two hours, Ashe slowly turned into a house of horrors for Paul.

Nuno Borges forces a fifth set against Tommy Paul 🫢#usopen pic.twitter.com/002EBxlDtG

In fairness, it was probably hard for him to act any other way. Time after time, Paul looked ready to close out the 41st-ranked Borges. Time after time, his smilingly stubborn opponent reeled him back in.By the fifth set, win or lose, Borges had made a name for himself among U.S. fans, and likely in the locker room. His strokes weren't flowing or graceful, but he was making ultra-clean contact. Borges' one title came on clay—he beat an aging Rafael Nadal in the final—but on this night he fed off the quick hard court. He came to net 20 more times than the American, and won nearly 70 percent of those points.The atmosphere, from an American perspective, was nightmarish. But the level of tennis, and the physicality, stayed high throughout the match's four hours and 25 minutes. Paul and Borges both appeared ready to cramp at times, but soldiered on. Even at 4-4 in the fifth, Borges had the energy to sprint for a short ball and angle it back, just a few inches from the net, and Paul had the energy to come barreling from out of nowhere to scrape the ball off the court and win the point.

At 1:46 A.M., Paul reached match point again, more than two hours after his last one. Again, Borges was serving, and again he attacked, charging the net and making a strong first volley. Paul did his best to stay alive, and Borges' second volley clipped the tape and landed near the net. Again, Paul barreled forward and angled the ball back. Borges poked it down the line, and Paul raced back to the baseline, where he let loose with a forehand pass. Finally, Borges didn't have the answer. His volley popped up and landed on his side of the net. Paul had survived his house of horrors, 7-6 (6), 6-3, 5-7, 5-7, 7-5.

“I'm a little bit tired, I think we all are,” Paul said, as Borges walked off in his socks to a rousing ovation. “Thank you guys so much for staying so late in the night and supporting me.”After his interview, Paul walked slowly back to his chair. Would he have to hit the traditional three balls into what was left of the crowd? Thankfully, no one seemed to consider it. The last thing Tommy needed at that moment was to take another swing.

"I won $150 for the 1960 title, which covered two months rent for my home in Rome," Pietrangeli told the Gazzetta dello Sport in 2020.Pietrangeli was also runner-up at Roland Garros in 1961 and 1964, losing both finals to Spanish player Manuel Santana. He won the doubles title in Paris in 1959 with Orlando Sirola."In 1964 Santana and I made a bet whereby the loser would pay for dinner," Pietrangeli said. "I honored the agreement and 10 of us went out that night, including our wives, and Manolo invited (Spanish soccer player) Luisito Suárez," Pietrangeli said. "I spent my entire earnings from the tournament to cover the evening."Pietrangeli also reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1960 and the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in 1957."Nicola Pietrangeli was not only the first to teach us what it really meant to win, on and off the court. He was the starting point for everything that our tennis (movement) has become," said Italian federation president Angelo Binaghi.

In Davis Cup, Pietrangeli holds the record for most total wins and most singles wins, having played 164 matches for Italy in 66 ties. His singles record was 78-32 and his doubles record was 42-12. He also formed half of the most successful Davis Cup doubles partnership with Sirola, the pair winning 34 of their 42 matches together.As a player, Pietrangeli led Italy to the Davis Cup final twice, losing both times away to an Australia team featuring Rod Laver and Roy Emerson.Pietrangeli finally raised the Davis Cup trophy as captain in 1976, when he coached Adriano Panatta, Corrado Barazzutti, Paolo Bertolucci and Antonio Zugarelli to the title with a win over Chile played amid the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.There were calls for Italy not to travel to Chile but Pietrangeli pushed for the Azzurri to go.

"That was really my biggest contribution for that final," Pietrangeli said. "Without me, Italy would have not traveled to that final and we wouldn't have won."Italy didn't win the Davis Cup again until Sinner led the Azzurri to the title in 2023 and 2024; and then Matteo Berrettini and Flavio Cobolli led Italy to a third straight Davis Cup—and first on home soil—in Bologna last month.After his playing and coaching career was finished, Pietrangeli became a sort of "godfather" for Italian tennis. He was a fixture in the front row at the Foro Italico for the Italian Open, a tournament he won in 1957 and 1961—beating Laver in the latter final.In 2006, the statue-lined Pallacorda court at the Foro Italico—considered one of the most picturesque stadiums on the circuit—was renamed Stadio Pietrangeli.

After a listless quarterfinal performance, Swiatek found her target in her press room for one of the Best Quotes of 2025.ByTENNIS.comPublished Nov 30, 2025 copy_link

Tennis' biggest stars didn't just let their racquets do the talking in 2025. To look back on a memorable season, we're counting down some of the biggest winners in the press conference room and on the microphone—and we're still picking our jaws up off the floor after Iga Swiatek turned the tables on a reporter in a tense US Open exchange.After a disappointing first half of the season, Swiatek's busy summer began with a, for all intents and purposes, surprise run to the Wimbledon title, where she blanked Anisimova in a historic 6-0, 6-0 final. She arrived in New York less than 24 hours after winning the Cincinnati title, and quickly was in match mode as she partnered Casper Ruud to a runner-up finish in the tournament's new-look mixed doubles event.However, Swiatek was unable to parlay all that winning into a second US Open crown, instead turning in a listless performance against an American in the quarterfinals for a second year in a row. In 2024, she lost to Jessica Pegula 6-2, 6-4 in the last eight, and 12 months later, she was bundled out by Anisimova in similar fashion 6-3, 6-4. She landed just 50% of her first serves in the match, was broken four times, and had few answers against a dialed-in Anisimova who struck 23 winners off the ground.But Swiatek found her target in her post-match press conference in the form of a reporter who asked what she felt was the wrong question.

Do you need [a] mental break? Iga Swiatek

When asked if physical tiredness played any role in the match, Swiatek said: "Well, I don't know. It's not like my matches were exhausting here."When the reporter clarified he meant a mental break, Swiatek pounced, asking if he needed one. When he jokingly said that he did, Swiatek volleyed back: "Well then, what are you doing here?"He replied that he needed to make it through the end of the tournament."Good luck," Swiatek said.

The closing exchange added another page to a playbook that Swiatek has patented in her time at the top of the game: Instead of lingering, either on her pre-Open achievements or her performance against Anisimova, she was ready to turn the page.“I know what I achieved, so I can't erase it because I lost today,” she said.“I guess in tennis you will get heartbreaking losses, and you don't have any other option. You just have to move on and try to play good next time.”

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Red Bull have stated that comments made about Kimi Antonelli in Qatar were "clearly incorrect", after the Mercedes rookie faced abuse online.

Red Bull have said they "sincerely regret" the online abuse directed towards Kimi Antonelli following "clearly incorrect" comments suggesting the Mercedes rookie allowed title contender Lando Norris past in the Qatar Grand Prix.

With Max Verstappen on course to win at the Lusail International Circuit, Antonelli found himself running ahead of Norris in the closing stages of the race, thanks to a tyre strategy that had seen Mercedes pit both cars under the early Safety Car. That had gained Antonelli track position on Norris, who had slightly fresher hard tyres in the final stint.

Norris had closed to within DRS range of Antonelli, who was putting in a defensive masterclass to keep the McLaren at bay whilst also trying to catch up to Carlos Sainz ahead to fight for the final podium position. But with just two laps to go, Antonelli ran deep into a corner and that gave Norris the opportunity he needed to grab P4 and two extra vital points as he looks to secure his maiden title in Abu Dhabi next weekend.

Gianpiero Lambiase, Verstappen's race engineer, told the reigning champion over the radio: “Not sure what happened to Antonelli Max, looks like he just pulled over and let Norris through.” However, Lambiase was quick to apologise to Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff for the comment, conceding he had not seen the situation fully.

On Monday Red Bull released a statement that read: “Comments made before the end of, and immediately after, the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowed Lando Norris to overtake him are clearly incorrect.

"Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Antonelli receiving online abuse.”

Following the conclusion of the Qatar Grand Prix, which saw the title battle move on to the finale in Abu Dhabi, Wolff was asked in his post-race media session about the remarks made about Antonelli, describing the notion he would move aside as "nonsense".

“We are fighting for P2 in the championship, which is important for us," Wolff explained. "Kimi is fighting for a potential P3 [in the race].

“It annoys me, because I'm annoyed with the race itself, how it went. I'm annoyed with the mistake at the end. I'm annoyed with other mistakes and then hearing such nonsense blows my mind.

“The other thing is that, beyond losing the points for the Constructors' Championship, I spoke to GP [Lambiase]. I saw him and obviously he was emotional in that moment because they [McLaren] needed a P3, I guess, to win the championship or P4, I don't know, but one position… And I said to him, he [Antonelli] just went off.

“[Antonelli] had a bit of a moment in the previous corner and then less entry speed into that left-hander, put the gas down and at that moment, which can happen, that lost the position. So with GP, everything is clear. He said he didn't see the situation.”

As for the race itself, Wolff seemed frustrated that his drivers could not show the full potential of the car. Russell had dropped places at the start, while Antonelli lost out to Sainz – and also on a potential podium – in the first round of pit stops.

“We had a fast car in the Sprint, and I think we had a fast car today," Wolff added. "When you lose positions on the pit stop and you make mistakes in the race, obviously that's not going to help. I think if you start in free air, you fight in the front."

Mercedes are 33 points ahead of Red Bull in the championship, as they look to secure P2 behind McLaren. And while that is some consolation from the final season of the current regulations, Wolff admitted it was a far cry from what he and the team expected of themselves.

“I think when we look at the statistics in 20 years, you can say there was a P2 in 2013, then there were eight consecutive World Championships, and then there was a P2, P3, P4, P2.

“I think it's not humiliating. You look at the stats, and you say, well, that's a team that has fought on the front. If we are being totally honest with ourselves, then you need to say that there wasn't a single year [of the regulations] we were really fighting for a World Championship.

“That is the crux of the matter. I think McLaren has doubled the points than us, almost, and in the previous years it was Max that ruled the world. No one in the team thinks that that's good enough.”

Radio Rewind: 2025 Qatar Grand Prix

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Just 12 points separates Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in the title battle after the Red Bull driver's win in Qatar.

Max Verstappen claimed a crucial victory in the Qatar Grand Prix from Oscar Piastri, with the title battle set to go down to the final round as championship leader Lando Norris could only finish fourth.

Verstappen's unlikely win was courtesy of McLaren's alternative strategy which came as a consequence of an early Safety Car intervention and an enforced 25-lap maximum stint length on all Pirelli tyre sets.

The Red Bull driver jumped Norris on the run to the first turn from P3 on the grid and shadowed poleman Piastri in the opening laps before a clash between Nico Hulkenberg and Pierre Gasly at Turn 1 several laps later turned the race on its head.

While all drivers pitted for the first of two mandatory pit stops in the 57-lap race, both Piastri and Norris remained out on track, which ultimately put them behind Verstappen in the final order.

Piastri was able to comfortably rejoin in a net-P2 after his final pit stop having shown strong pace out front all race, but Norris was unable to clear the chasing Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli after his pit stop.

The Drivers' Championship leader passed Antonelli on the penultimate lap as the Mercedes driver ran wide, and means a 22-point margin ahead of the race has been reduced to just 12 points from Verstappen with Piastri 16 adrift ahead of the final race.

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS QATAR GRAND PRIX 2025

Sainz claimed his second podium of the season for Williams, having jumped Antonelli through the opening pit stop phase, while Antonelli ensured Mercedes moved closer to P2 in the Constructors' Championship with P5.

Behind Antonelli, Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls was on course for P6 before a left-front puncture three laps from the end, which promoted George Russell, the Mercedes driver having lost three positions on the opening lap.

The top-10 was completed by Fernando Alonso, via a full 360-degree spin for the Aston Martin driver, Charles Leclerc's Ferrari, the second Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull).

Alex Albon (Williams) was P11 from Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber) and Franco Colapinto (Alpine).

Esteban Ocon finished P15 as the Haas driver was handed a five-second penalty for a false start, finishing ahead of Gasly. Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and Hadjar eventually recorded DNFs at the end.

Ollie Bearman retired after serving a 10-second stop/go penalty over his car being in an unsafe condition, while Hulkenberg's race ended in the gravel after his collision with Gasly.

As the lights went out Norris from P2 suffered the slightly worse start amongst the title challengers, allowing Verstappen to move ahead before the long-right of Turn 1 and slot in behind Piastri, who comfortably held the lead from pole.

The Australian had already broken DRS range by the end of the opening lap and put his head down as the gaps between the leading runners began to expand almost immediately, with following proving extremely difficult through the high-speed corners.

Further back, Russell dropped three places after running slightly wide through Turn 2, as team mate Antonelli, Sainz and Alonso all moved ahead of the Mercedes driver through the opening corners.

Gasly in P9 also ran slightly wide, damaging the underside of his car over the kerb and gravel, and was put under pressure by Hulkenberg, who along with Hamilton were the only drivers to start on Pirelli's soft tyre.

The German had passed Leclerc into Turn 1 in the opening laps and tried the outside line with Gasly shortly after, but the Sauber driver was left in the gravel on the exit with his right-rear tyre hanging off.

The left-front of the Alpine had made contact with the Sauber, the stewards investigating but taking no further action as Gasly resumed.

The incident brought out the Safety Car just inside the window which would allow drivers to run the remaining 50 laps with just the need for one more pit stop, with a 25-lap limit imposed for all sets of tyres by Pirelli.

Critically, the McLarens of Piastri and Norris stayed out, meaning Verstappen rejoined back in P3 on another set of medium tyres but with effectively one less pit stop to take compared with the two leaders.

Ocon had also initially stayed out but was handed a five-second penalty for a false start and entered the pit lane after the majority of the field and rejoined at the back.

Racing resumed on Lap 11, Piastri leading from Norris and Verstappen, with Sainz having jumped Antonelli in the pits, as Alonso, Hadjar, Russell, Leclerc and Bearman completed the top-10.

The McLarens began to lap more than 1s a lap faster than the rest of the field, all of whom would be required to stop on Lap 32 to make the end on a two-stop strategy.

In turn, the McLarens needed to stop no later than Lap 25, Piastri pitting on lap 24 with a 4s lead over Norris and crucially rejoining in clean air having emerged in front of a large group headed by Alonso in P6.

Norris rejoined even closer to Alonso the next lap, but a 2.2s pit stop proved pivotal as Verstappen now led Sainz, Antonelli, Piastri and Norris.

Piastri soon caught the back of Antonelli and immediately dived up the inside at Turn 1 on the start of Lap 30, but Norris was unable to pass Antonelli at the same spot two laps later.

The McLarens found themselves back at the front as the the majority of the field made the pit lane a hive of activity on Lap 32, with Verstappen rejoining in P3 on the hard tyre but only 7.6 behind Piastri.

Norris ran wide at the high-speed right of Turn 14, running over the kerb and nearly spinning, asking his team over the radio to check for damage as he began to fall into the clutches of Verstappen.

Piastri also had a moment at the same corner as he attempted to build up his margin, with Verstappen starting to get into the dirty air of Norris nearly 8s behind.

Piastri pitted at the end of Lap 42 for a new set of hard tyres, rejoining P3 but now 17s behind Verstappen, who was within 1s of Norris before the Briton also pitted for the hard tyre on Lap 44.

Rejoining behind both Sainz and Antonelli, Norris soon closed on the pair but was unable to shape for a pass until Antonelli suffered a moment of oversteer on the exit of Turn 10 on the penultimate lap which allowed him ahead.

With Verstappen's seventh Grand Prix win of the season, by a margin of eight seconds, it means the Dutchman sits just 12 points behind Norris, with Piastri a further four points back ahead of the final race in Abu Dhabi.

Sainz claimed his second podium of the season from Norris, while Antonelli finished well clear of Russell, who had benefitted from a late puncture for Hadjar to finish P6.

The top-10 was completed by Alonso, who finished despite a huge 360-degree spin which dropped him behind Hadjar and Russell, as Leclerc, Lawson and Tsunoda all scored points.

The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Hamilton, Bortoleto, Colapinto, Ocon and Gasly, with Stroll, Hadjar, Bearman and Hulkenberg recorded as retirees.

"This was an incredible race for us," said Verstappen. "We made the right call as a team to box under the Safety Car. That was smart. Of course, I'm super happy to win here and stay in the fight until the end. Incredible.

"I think [the pace] was a little bit offset because of it all, but for us I think it was a very strong race on a weekend where it was a little bit tough. We still won the race and that was the most important thing."

F1 will travel straight to Abu Dhabi for the final race of the season from December 5-7 where the 2025 Drivers' title will be decided. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action from the Yas Marina Circuit.

Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, currently in the United States to support the awards campaign and theatrical release for his “It Was Just an Accident,” has received a prison sentence in absentia.

As IndieWire learned from journalist Mansour Jahani, Panahi was sentenced to one year in prison and a two-year ban from leaving Iran, as well as a ban on membership in any political or social groups. IndieWire confirmed the news with a source close to Panahi.

Per Jahani, who sent a dispatch to journalists, “On Monday, December 1, 2025, attorney Mustafa Nili wrote on his social media X: Branch 26 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran has sentenced Mr. Jafar Panahi in absentia to one year in prison and a two-year ban on leaving the country, as well as a ban on membership in political and social groups or factions, for propaganda activities against the regime. We will take the necessary legal steps to appeal this ruling.”

The specific charges were not revealed at this time, though Panahi has a history of arrests related to alleged propaganda against the Islamic Republic.

IndieWire is seeking confirmation as to when Panahi is scheduled to return to Iran, as we understand he is not being extradited. He just completed, for the first time, a U.S. tour, visiting cities including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and Chicago. He is next slated to attend the Marrakech Film Festival. 

Panahi, who won the Palme d'Or this year for French Oscar contender “It Was Just an Accident,” was sentenced to six years' prison time in 2010 and has had various legal issues in Iran ever since. He was arrested in 2022 after completing “No Bears” and was not released until February 2023 after initiating a hunger strike at Evin prison. The circumstances of his imprisonment and confinement inspired the making of “It Was Just an Accident,” which centers on an Azerbaijani auto mechanic who believes he has found his former torturer. Like all of Panahi's recent films, it was made illegally without a permit in Iran.

We've reached out to “It Was Just an Accident” distributor Neon for clarity on the implications for Panahi's current travel and awards campaigning.

Related Stories Kristen Stewart Charted Her Own Course to Her Directorial Debut ‘The Chronology of Water' ‘Marty Supreme' Review: Timothée Chalamet's Legendary Performance Anchors an Exhilarating  American Epic About the True Cost of Greatness 

I got a call from my agent. They said, “We want to send the script over. You have an offer to play Ken Kesey, and Kristen Stewart wrote it and directed it.” 

“I don't need to read it. Just tell her, ‘yes.'” I read it, and was quite intimidated by the complexity and the beauty of this woman's story. And then I read the book [by Lidia Yuknavitch]. Wow. There's a whole category of Academy Awards for screenplay adaptation that I hope someone pays attention to, because [Kristen] did an unbelievable adaptation of this book.

I always approach working with women as, “This girl is my sister, and I love my sister.” All my life, I've always known how to be loving to my sister, to make her feel strong and good. All those traits that my sister taught me, I take on with other actresses or producers. There's a connection and a love that goes way deeper than that of a male/female relationship. I look at Kristen as my younger sister. And within five minutes of talking to her: “This girl is way older than she is.” 

 










She has the mind of a writer and the heart of an actor, but she has the soul of a director. She knew every breath between every line of dialogue. She felt it, she wrote it, she saw it. She's a true auteur, and I don't know how she did it, but she got my best performance in years out of me. When she looked me in the eye, she looked right through my pupils and right into me. She stared at me with such love and respect and full knowledge of who I was and what I was doing in those scenes that I just dropped and flew with her.

When I got on the set, I went to the producer and said, “She wrote this. How locked in is she to the words?” The producer said, “She's pretty locked in.” Because I studied this character for three months. I saw everything that Ken Kesey said, in lectures, in interviews, and he was quite an amazing man, quite articulate. And he had a huge sense of humanity, but there were some gems of things that he'd said. 

The first scene, when I meet all the students, I did the first take, the second take, I said, “I might add a little thing right here.” And she just looked at me, and I did it. And once I did it, her eyes opened up, and [she] gave me a little wave, like, “Go ahead, go ahead.” I started ripping out all kinds of dialogue that came out of Ken Kesey's mouth. And she was: “Oh my god, I got chills, Jim.” She made me feel so knowledgeable about my character, and I just flew with it.

 










It took her eight years to get this movie made: talk about fearless pursuit. She did not give up on his film, and she did it within a low budget, and she worked hours and hours and hours. This girl did not stop. I couldn't even pretend to be tired after watching her all day. It's like, “I can't be tired. I got to go for coffee. She's still working. I'm not tired. ‘You want to go home?' ‘No, I'll stay for another shot. Come on. Let's do another shot.'”

The main line for me in the movie has actually changed me since I've shot it: “No one is big enough to hold what happens to us.” I have forgiven everybody who didn't understand me in my life because of that line. Of course. Why did I expect people to understand, to be able to hold the terror or the struggles that I've had? Nobody's big enough to hold that … For the lead character [Lidia, played by Imogen Poots], it's in her hands to write it. “Maybe someone will be able to hold what happened to you.” Kristen was able to hold what happened to me in my life, and understand it in order to bring it out in my performance, and for that, I feel like I was in the presence of a shaman.

She was a shaman. That's how much humanity she carried for this girl in this movie. I don't know where she got this experience in her life to have such depth. I don't believe in reincarnation, but she must have reincarnated six or seven times, because she shocked me with how smart, articulate, and knowledgeable she is. I love her.

 










When Kristen walked on a set, you could feel around her for a good six to eight feet, this presence, this power. If she stopped and started talking to you, it was like you were in this dome of something special. She has this quiet plane, and she weaves between fragility and fierce introspection with every glance and gesture that she makes. She would just stare and watch me, and she made me feel so good about everything I did.

The material itself is so complicated an exploration of grief, the acting out of unresolved grief and trauma. Death is a complicated subject to film, to act. She understood it. Finally, you see someone who gets the depth of death. How does this 35-year-old girl carry solid knowledge of deep concepts, and capture it in that film in such a creative way? I worked with Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, Woody Allen, David Lynch, Roman Polanski. I've worked with some great directors. I've had that honor, and she is right in that line. She's going to be a very special director one day, if not this day.

I have a standing offer with her that whenever she needs her car washed, I will be there with a bucket, brush, soap, and water. I will do anything for this girl. I'd work with my little sister any day. She's a fearless artist, fearless in her pursuit of authenticity, and she is unafraid to challenge the boundaries of storytelling. That's the example in this film. I hope she gets all the recognition that she deserves.

	Marty Mauser can't be stopped. He won't be stopped. The young man with the Coke-bottle glasses and pockmarked face and ferret-like frame may be one of eight million stories in the naked city known as Manhattan circa 1952. But Mauser refuses to be just another schlemiel working at a shoestore. Luckily, he's got a plan. It involves being the single greatest table tennis player the world has ever seen. The kid has the willingness to beg, borrow, or steal (mostly the latter) in order to get to London for the sport's world championship; the confidence to bum-rush his way into the tournament once he's there; and the talent to go the distance. Mauser has got a genuine shot at the title. He is his No. 1 biggest fan. If only this perpetual fuck-up wasn't also his own worst enemy.


	Imagine Rocky if you substituted ping-pong for prizefighting, Alexander Portnoy for the Italian Stallion, and an egotistical prick for a lovable underdog. You'd have something close to Marty Supreme, Josh Safdie‘s manic character study that doubles as a cracked American success story. Mauser may be loosely — and we do mean loosely — based on five-time world champ Marty Reisman, but he has a lot more in common with the filmmaker's usual gallery of hustlers, rogues, crooks, and schnooks. Whether solo (see: his 2008 debut The Pleasure of Being Robbed) or in tandem with his brother Benny (Daddy Long Legs, Good Time, Uncut Gems), Safdie specializes in giving sad sacks a sympathetic spotlight while keeping things raw, rough, and paced like a Rube Goldberg machine of chaos. The character he's dreamed up with co-writer, co-editor, and longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein may be his most accessible, charismatic loser to date. Mauser recognizes he's extraordinary; he's just waiting for everybody else to catch up.

	











	It helps, of course, that Safdie has lots of supreme talent in his corner: cinematographer Darius Khondji (Seven), production designer Jack Fisk (Days of Heaven, There Will Be Blood), costume designer Miyako Bellizzi, composer Daniel “Oneohtrix Point Never” Lopatin. They're below-the-line legends, the lot of them. The soundtrack is a playlist comprising period-appropriate tunes and Eighties New Wave and post-punk. (Les Paul and Mary Ford, meet Tears for Fears!) Per usual, the writer-director mixes in non-professionals who look like they've stepped straight out of a Weegee portfolio with a supporting cast you'd swear was assembled via Mad Libs. Seriously, name another ensemble that boasts Fran Drescher, Tyler, the Creator, Penn Jillette, cult filmmaker Abel Ferrara, NBA hall of famer George Gervin, and Shark Tank‘s Kevin O'Leary?

	There's one person who's truly channeling Safdie's grindset obsessions, however, and arguably stands head and slim shoulders above the rest. Timothée Chalamet has played troubadours and sociopaths, chocolatiers and cannibals, messiah figures and broken-hearted boy-wonders. You wouldn't think a motormouth jerk who's really the Michael Jordan of ping-pong would be a bespoke role for the star, yet the role fits him like a customized backless jumpsuit. It's not hard to believe his Mauser could make a fellow shoe salesman liberate the store safe easier with his patter than the pistol in his hand; Marty's gift of gab is even more aggressive than his serve. The guy's an aspiring pro athlete but a professional grifter, putting the confidence back into “con artist.”


	Of course this nebbish with the rat mustache will talk his way into both the Ritz and the pants of a faded movie star (Gwyneth Paltrow, reminding you how good she was before Goop became her full-time gig), the ultimate seduction by chutzpah. Of course he'll win over journalists with proto-edgelord pull quotes — “I'm gonna do to Klutsky what Auschwitz couldn't!” he exclaims, regarding a Hungarian rival; it's OK though, Mauser says, because he's also Jewish and “Hitler's worst nightmare” — and piss off the powers that be. Of course he'll refuse to kowtow to a fountain-pen magnate (O'Leary), a.k.a. the actress' husband, then humiliate himself before the tycoon in order to accomplish his goals. Of course he'll get his married neighbor (I Love LA‘s Odessa A'zion) knocked up, then co-opt her into his schemes. Of course he'll bilk Long Island rubes out of their dough with a fellow table tennis ace (Tyler) and turn a hotel disaster involving a gangster (Ferrara) and an M.I.A. dog into an extortion plan. You know the fable about the scorpion and the frog? Marty's the one with the stinger. Everybody else is simply waiting to get stung.

	Chalamet doesn't just lean in to Marty's less-than-stellar qualities; he turns them into pluses, pitching them as part of the DNA that will allow Mauser to eventually stage something akin to a comeback. You can feel some of the Complete Unknown star's own reputational baggage being used to good advantage here — not just the inherent confidence that occasionally speed-reads as arrogance, but the striving, the constant need to prove himself, the sort of let-it-blurt attitude that finds the artist formerly known as Lil' Timmy Tim pining in public to be one of the greats. The irony is that this role bursting with equally naked yearning gets him that much closer to actually demonstrating why he might make that wish come true. It's the sort of performance that feels like early Pacino or Dustin Hoffman, all twitches and vibrations and seeming like he's in a constant state of motion even when standing still. And it fuses so well with what we, the viewer, think we know about Chalamet that it begins to blur the boundary in the best possible way.

	











	In other words, Marty Supreme is a testament to the Men Who Would Be King, both the fictional and nonfictional ones. The real regent here, however, is the one actually calling the shots. Josh Safdie would likely cop to identifying with Mauser not wisely but too well; game usually does tend to recognize game. To say that Marty Supreme is autobiographical would be pushing it. But the way the director lends his high-anxiety style of filmmaking to this highly caffeinated Horatio Alger narrative is extremely simpatico. You have to be a hustler to make movies like this in the age of AI and IP, even ones with genuine movie stars in them. It's in Safdie's DNA as much as Marty's. Both end up champions in their own way, and we're the ones who end up winning.

On December 4, the IndieWire Honors Winter 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for crafting some of the year's best films. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers.

The first time most of us saw IndieWire Honors Maverick Award winner Kristen Stewart was in David Fincher's 2002 thriller “Panic Room,” as the terrified 12-year-old whose mother (Jodie Foster) whisks her to safety as an intruder terrorizes their home.

We watched Stewart grow up onscreen, playing a diverse range of teenagers and young women, from the tough older sister in Jon Favreau's space adventure “Zathura,” and hard rocker Joan Jett in “The Runaways,” to winsome Jean Seberg in “Seberg.” But it was her 2008 role as Bella Swan in the first installment of the “Twilight” saga that turned her into a global movie star.

 










Stewart went on to complete four more Twilight movies: In the end, the vampire saga grossed $3.4 billion worldwide.

After that, while the actress took on three big-studio roles in “Snow White and the Huntsman,” “Charlie's Angels,” and Ang Lee's “Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,” Stewart has been choosy about the parts she wants to play, often preferring to collaborate with international directors, including Brazil's Walter Salles (“On the Road”), France's Olivier Assayas (“Personal Shopper”), and Chile's Pablo Larraín (“Spencer”).

That's how she became the first American actress to win a César Award, for her supporting role as an actor's assistant in Assayas' 2015 “Clouds of Sils Maria” — and after becoming the youngest person to take home the BAFTA Rising Star Award at age 19.

The camera can't get enough of Stewart's open face. She is fearless. She understands intimacy, the dynamics between the sexes, as well as violence. She can convey calm, vulnerability, and the strength of a smart woman, but stays believable even in outrageous situations. She held her own with Oscar-winner Julianne Moore as her mother in “Still Alice,” plumbed the depths of real-girl Bella Swan's love for a vampire in “Twilight,” and acted for David Gordon Green (“Undertow”), Doug Liman (“Jumper”), Greg Mottola (“Adventureland”), Kelly Reichardt (“Certain Women”), Barry Levinson (“What Just Happened?”), and Rose Glass (“Love Lies Bleeding”).

 










With “Spencer,” after two decades in the business, Stewart earned her first Oscar nomination as Best Actress for playing the beleaguered Princess Diana in Larraín's critics' favorite. Even as she moved her mouth to manage plummy British vowels, Stewart's performance pulled us in, made us cry, and took us by surprise. It's hard to believe she was only 31. 

For the past eight years, while making shorts and music videos, Stewart has been developing her adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch's memoir, “The Chronology of Water,” willing it into existence against considerable resistance. Stewart's European ties helped to push the project forward with her as writer/director. The film stars British actress Imogen Poots as Lidia, who survives a traumatic upbringing in Washington, Texas, and Florida via competitive swimming, addictive behaviors, and compulsive writing. The movie debuted at Cannes 2025 in Un Certain Regard to strong reviews. 

As we sit down to talk on Zoom, Stewart and her wife, Dylan Meyer, whom she married on April 20, are hosting Thanksgiving the next day, with Stewart's father on hand. She's planning to have breakfast with her mother in the next few days. “I'm back and forth between,” she said. “I see them fairly a lot when I'm not completely crazed with releasing my first movie.”

 










Stewart has taken a slow road to maverick status. Early on, as a child actor from 1999, she understood the importance of pleasing adults. “You reckon with the way that you present as a nine-year-old going on auditions for the first time, knowing that the only way that you can break into visibility is to alter the way that you are. And that's also the way that you inhabit the world as a young woman. Every young girl does this; everyone turns into something that wants to be appealing and chosen. And in my experience as a kid, I wanted to work so badly. I never betrayed myself. [But] to be successful, girls have to behave a certain way. That means being smiling and light and not very thoughtful, and someone who doesn't ask too many questions, and somebody who's ‘chill,' somebody who goes along.”

As long and successful and idiosyncratic as Stewart's career has been, she's only feeling her full maverick agency now. “It's turning 35,” she said. “I've read a lot of feminist literature. I feel backed up by it. There's certain programming, ideas that seep into your body, that do debilitate you and create insecurities that take a long time to get over. I love acting, but it is crushing. It's like fitting yourself into someone else's perspective in the most pure way. It's a huge responsibility, and then that performance lives in another's art. But then it's consumed by media and the public, and sold as a product, and then you're also meant to hold that idea up with your personality and your body and your clothes and your smile, and the way that you talk about the movie and the way that you gratify other people to know that you are grateful, that you know that it's a really special position to be in, and that you bow to the public. It's bizarre.”

 










Now that Stewart has directed her first movie, she sees the other side. 

“As a director, you get to own ideas,” she said. “People project on actors that anyone could — and it's absolutely true — do this job. It's a rarefied position, because there aren't that many jobs. As a filmmaker, you're not talking to a puppet. But that doesn't negate the fact that actors like Imogen directed this movie with me. Her whole body and mind and soul is in the movie, and it informs every decision, and so many of those decisions are hers.”

She continued, “But in terms of how you interact with the public or people that don't make movies, I will say that actresses don't get treated great. I don't know how male actors feel when they sit in the seat and get talked to about movies that they work on, but as a director, it is the first time I've ever sat down and had conversations where I wasn't feeling like I was being quizzed on the movie that I made, because they were wondering if I deserved to be there. I made the movie myself. I wrote it, I made it with my hands. From the ground up, every single cell of the movie is mine, and people know that, and so therefore it's a very different interaction. And it has liberated me to feel like, ‘Oh my god. This is how you can be yourself.' I've always tried to be myself, but you're not really given the opportunity. For the first time, I felt like I was given the opportunity.”

 










After “Twilight,” for a time, Stewart and her agents adopted a one-for-us, one-for-them attitude. “You have to take the advice of your agents, because they're a certain filter,” she said. “They're the ones either giving you or not giving you certain things to read. And you can't read everything. And, obviously, there's baked-in advice-giving. But after ‘Twilight,' there was a natural progression, because your work leads you to other artists. It was clear when I felt drawn to a project or a person or an idea, and so I followed my nose on that. Over the years, people have definitely wanted me to do more studio films in order to keep up the independent movies that I wanted to do. If you want to keep the independent train rolling, something's got to keep it going. The only reason you get a movie financed is if you have international appeal and blah, blah.”

Stewart has come to admire the European cinema, acting twice for Assayas. When I worked with Olivier,” said Stewart, “I understood the potential impact of what a movie could do to bring you into other dimensions, essentially into your dream states, into your subconscious. Before I worked with Olivier, I did approach things in a slightly more exterior fashion. And then I was introduced to something unspoken that said so much more.”

 










Stewart envies European culture. “Down to the crews that cater and grip and costume and shoot the films, to the people who department head, to the people who write about the films, and even the public who consumes them straight up, there's a certain historical, cultural pleasure in how alive and independent cinema can be,” she said. “It shows people that they can be themselves. It's like the New Wave. I want there to be a New Wave in Los Angeles. We need it so badly.”

Indulging her indie taste enabled Stewart to make such renegade projects as Floria Sigismondi's Joan Jett biopic “The Runaways” or Justin Kelly's “JT Leroy.” Among the studio films, “there was a modicum of control and creative freedom on ‘Snow White and the Huntsman,' where it felt isolated from a larger studio,” she said. “Then on ‘Charlie's,' it was inundated with a lot of voices in the room. I'm philosophically opposed to treating something like there's a right and wrong. When you're dealing with producers and executives, because of the hierarchy, there are people who know what's going to do well, or know what's funny, or know that the impulses of the artists who are responsible for telling the story are wrong. You start turning yourself into a pretzel to satisfy a large group of people. 

She continued, “You homogenize the experience and make something that doesn't have a real perspective, and it is actually painful. You're stabbing the movie over and over. Especially on such a large scale, more people are going to see this rather than fewer. It doesn't come from anywhere. It's not coming from a person. It's not coming from a self.”

 










Stewart's takeaway: Work on projects where the director's singular vision takes precedence. “It takes a crazy drive, a hungry, contagious thing that we know when one person has it. A good director does nothing other than create an environment in which other people want to want as much as they do, because it looks like it's fun. As soon as you look over as director and you see that someone is now being driven by their own desires because of the path that you set them on, you go, ‘Hell, yeah!' And you can take their stuff and put it in your movie, but it's yours. As a director, you are creating the waves, and it's the coolest fucking thing ever, and you cannot do that in a studio environment.”

But getting an indie movie made in LA is a challenge. “It's a political act, and when you do so, you are met with an unbelievable barrier, like a chasm,” said Stewart. “But you can find workarounds. For me, a few of those, like little trap doors, have been through working with European directors, and then as a director, finding European finance, working in Europe to get it done, and then bringing it back to the States. I want to work in the U.S.”

Stewart is working on several new projects to direct. “It's worth understanding that the ability to make something, regardless of scale, in terms of practicality, is in your hands,” she said. “I feel like I no longer want to be debilitated by expectation and a system that is not designed for me. And so, if Cassavetes did it, we could do it. I could take something tiny and make it feel huge, and that's what I aspire to.”

 










Stewart has been open about her gay identity since 2017, when she came out on “Saturday Night Live,” saying, “I'm so gay, dude.” 

“I wanted a whole life,” she said. “I didn't want a sliver of being able to live my life. I do not want to live in a world that erases people. So there was no version of reaping the benefits of bending over backwards and negating not only myself, but a large number of people that would cease to exist without being acknowledged, because we live in a world that is so hyper-judgmental and aggressive and violent towards anything threatening. If you know you're living alone in that world, there's no way to speak up for yourself. And there must be a choir to join, or a cacophony that infiltrates, in order for you to step up and also do that. There's so much life, if you don't negate it. I never hid it. It just took a minute for me to start talking about it.”

When Stewart, who served on the Cannes jury in 2018, runs up the Cannes Palais steps barefoot, she's having a bit of fun. “I'm commenting on the world that we live in, and feeling like I acknowledge that,” she said. “I jump out of it a little.” That doesn't mean the Chanel brand ambassador since 2013 is giving up stiletto heels. “I would never wear them if I didn't like them, but I couldn't run out of a burning building.”

 










Next up, Stewart produced and stars in stoner comedy “The Wrong Girls” (Neon), written and directed by her wife Meyer (“XOXO”), the screenwriter daughter of director Nicholas Meyer, and co-starring Alia Shawkat and LaKeith Stanfield. “Oh, it's so good,” said Stewart. “We just locked picture. I'm so proud of it. We suddenly found ourselves making this movie by the skin of our teeth as well. It's about coming of age at 35, female friendship, and joy.”

Stewart is starring in a Quentin Dupieux-directed Paris comedy starring Woody Harrelson. And she's dipping her toe into the miniseries arena with Amblin for “Challenger,” playing closeted gay astronaut Sally Ride. “I'm stepping into an incredibly high-stakes commercial studio environment,” she said. “A big swing. I do trust them to be able to shepherd this thing into a place of truth. But we'll see.”

Panos Cosmatos' “Flesh of the Gods,” written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is looking for financing. And Stewart is trying to shoot her second movie in Los Angeles in the next couple of months. “I want this thing to feel light as air,” she said. “I don't want the heavy burden like ‘Chronology,' which looks like a body that's been through a lot. The process needs to be one that feels ephemeral, and I'm setting it up now.”

The revival is the latest produced by Rudin since his Broadway return. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Death of a Salesman will return to Broadway this spring starring Nathan Lane and Laurie Metcalf. 


	This marks the second Broadway play produced by Scott Rudin and Barry Diller, since Rudin left the industry in the wake of a Hollywood Reporter story about workplace bullying. The revival will be directed by Joe Mantello. Christopher Abbott (Poor Things) will star as Biff Loman and Ben Ahlers (The Gilded Age) will star as Happy Loman to Lane's Willy Loman and Metcalf's Linda Loman.




	The play is set for a 14-week run at the Winter Garden Theatre, a larger theater for plays with 1,600 seats and recent home to Clooney's Goodnight, and Good Luck, starting March 6, ahead of an April 9 opening. Metcalf currently stars in Rudin's Little Bear Ridge Road, directed by Mantello, which is running at the Booth Theatre on Broadway until Feb. 15.

	The Arthur Miller play first premiered on Broadway in 1949 and was recently revived during the 2022-2023 season, starring Wendell Pierce and Sharon D. Clarke. 


	“In 1995 while rehearsing a Terrence McNally play with Joe, he turned to me one afternoon out of the blue and quietly said, ‘Someday you and I are going to do Death of a Salesman.' And true to his word, 30 years later, that day has come. I couldn't be more thrilled and honored to follow in the footsteps of so many great actors in tackling the role of Willy Loman, especially with the brilliant Laurie Metcalf by my side and the remarkable cast Joe is assembling. It's a privilege to do what is arguably the greatest drama of the twentieth century, and like all great plays it always seems to speak to us anew each time we see it,” Nathan Lane said in a statement.  

	











	“Collaboration is everything in the theater. I am lucky to be going from one exciting project to another with Joe Mantello – and in the very same season. Joe and Nathan are longtime collaborators, and my shared history with — and deep respect for — them makes what might otherwise feel daunting feel familiar, and absolutely thrilling,” Metcalf said.

Like many great actors and virtually all legitimate movie stars, Timothée Chalamet is a salesman at heart. But where most of them prefer to keep that like something of an open secret, the razor-cheeked Lisan al-Gaib — who's become a brand unto himself, despite showing up at a time when Hollywood remains far more invested in franchises than faces — has embraced his entrepreneurial zeal with the same winning commitment that he brings to literally everything else he does. 

It's baked into the most basic essence of his image. Chalamet doesn't co-own a mobile phone company or do an inordinate amount of commercial work (his ads are limited to Super Bowl spots and Scorsese collaborations), but whether accepting an award or simply delivering a turn worthy of one, he never shies away from the sense that he's selling himself on screen. In that light, it's no coincidence that his status as both a great actor and a legitimate movie star has grown increasingly undeniable the more that his performances have started to seem like pitches. Magic chocolates. Ancient prophecies. Electric folk songs. Limited edition track jackets. Whatever the product they're trying to move, Chalamet's recent characters don't feel like roles so much as fences for his infectious self-belief. The poor kid was born with the hustle of a champion but saddled with the soul of an artist; Michael Jordan didn't need an audience to affirm his greatness, but Chalamet's legend requires us to buy him all over again with every shot.

The ecstatic tension at the heart of the world-beating “Marty Supreme,” in which Chalamet makes one of the most colossal movie performances of the 21st century seem as natural as a lay-up, is that it encourages modern Hollywood's ultimate striver to sell his heart out, just so it can interrogate why anyone would bother trying so hard. It challenges — and rewards — his outspoken pursuit of greatness by casting him as a character who's pathologically driven by the same thing. 

 










Which isn't to suggest that Josh Safdie's A24 epic is best appreciated as a metatextual commentary on its star (much as it was obviously written both for and about him), or that a generational classic this overflowing with life should be reduced to another cautionary tale of someone flying too close to the sun, but rather to emphasize how thoroughly it suffuses Chalamet's singular eagerness into a film as propulsive, quicksilver, and electrifying as he is. The result is a roman candle of a movie that feels like it was shot out of a cannon, despite being burdened with the gravity of an implausible dream; a totemic Jewish-American odyssey about where such dreams come from, where they might lead to, and where they're liable to come apart at the seams along the way.

In Safdie and Ronald Bronstein's splenetic wonder of a screenplay, mishegoss bleeds into madness when a 23-year-old 12-year-old named Marty Mauser — very, very loosely inspired by mid-century table tennis prodigy Marty Reisman — essentially decides that his personal destiny is the Jewish people's reward for several millennia of suffering, a continuum that connects the pyramids of Egypt to the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It's 1952 and the world is still picking itself up after the mess that Hitler left behind; it's a time when everything and nothing seems possible for the generations of immigrants who've come to America for a better life. While we never quite learn how and when the Mauser family came to America (Marty is allergic to the past in all its forms), the film suggests that its indefatigable young hero feels the weight of history on his bird-like shoulders; six million Jews weren't slaughtered so that he could hawk women's shoes in the cramped little store that his uncle wants him to run like an honor. 

 










Marty has bigger plans in mind. More specifically, he's hellbent on becoming the greatest ping-pong player on planet Earth, and by the time we first meet him he's already sold himself so hard on that purpose that all of the other people in his life are basically just the collateral required to finance his dream. Why ping-pong? Maybe it's just because it's a sport he can win — one that's cheap to play, and attracts greasy oddballs like him to the local table tennis club where members can sleep on a cot in the back room whenever their lives spin out of control. 

The reason doesn't really matter. What matters is that withholding it from the audience makes it impossible to know where opportunism ends and passion begins, even, we suspect, for Marty himself (the way that Chalamet mutters “I love you” at the end of even the tensest arguments with his extended family is the kind of immaculately lived-in gracenote that this movie has by the hundred). Be that as it may, there's no denying that Marty is completely and obsessively sincere in his desire to be the world champion, no matter how absurd that desire might seem to those around him. Or to us. It's a need that runs deep in his DNA (as we see first-hand during a title sequence so hilarious that it tends to set off spontaneous bursts of applause), and Chalamet inhabits the character with the unflinching pathology of a Herzogian madman. 

 










An inveterate liar in service to a higher and more ecstatic truth, Marty is equal parts Fitzcarraldo and Frank Abagnale Jr., with a sprinkle of John McEnroe and Joel Goodsen mixed in for good measure. Chalamet addictively synthesizes these overlapping energies into an irrepressible raconteur who thinks, acts, and self-destructs with the hurry of a hummingbird flapping his wings; he sells every single line of the film's logorrheic screenplay without any concern for who might have to pay for it, or what it might cost them. Marty is a creature of the future, and he races around this movie as if he can't wait another minute to get there. 

Much like the subject of Benny Safdie's recent “The Smashing Machine,” the idea that the future might not be what he had imagined — the possibility of failure — never crosses his mind any more than whether or not the sun will come up the next day. Safdie's ingenious decision to exclusively soundtrack this post-war period piece with 1980s bangers (Alphaville, Public Image Ltd., Tears for Fears, etc.) makes it feel as if Marty is in tune with a tomorrow that only he can hear, just as Daniel Lopatin's synth-driven score — so intricate and voluble that it functions like a second screenplay — hurls Marty towards the horizon by tapping into an anxiety that period-appropriate music could never hope to match.

 










“Forever Young?” Not quite. Marty is precocious enough that he wears a trenchcoat like there should be two more kids stacked on top of him, but the threat of imminent fatherhood still follows him from the first scene of the film, in which he unknowingly impregnates his married girlfriend Rachel in the back of his uncle's store before he steals away to London for the world championship (Rachel is played by Odessa A'zion in a breakout performance as Marty's ultimate rally partner). He arrives in the U.K. convinced that the tournament will be his coronation, but a shock loss to Japanese superstar Koto Endo — played by Japanese National Deaf Table Tennis Championship Koto Kawaguchi, an especially gripping screen presence in a film where even the smallest roles are branded upon the brain — threatens to unmoor Marty from his sense of self. Spoiler alert to anyone who's never seen “Good Time,” “Uncut Gems,” or “Heaven Knows What”: Safdie characters are dangerously attached to their idea of who they are, and they're liable to do some pretty desperate things when their ecstasy is kept just out of reach. 

Marty Mauser is no different, and he spirals out of control at a scale that makes the trials of Howard Ratner seem like a warm-up match. The gist of it is that he returns to NYC with just a few days to pay off $1,500 in fines and make his way to Japan in time for a rematch with Endo, but the plot thickens and convulses and mutates in all sorts of wild shapes from there. The journey is best understood through the people Marty steamrolls over along the way, all of them wonderfully dented in their own ways. 

 










Chief among them would have to be faded Hollywood actress Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow, returning to the screen from semi-retirement in a role that vividly recaptures the radiant stardom of her “Shakespeare in Love” days), the untouchable shiksa goddess Marty gloms onto as soon as he sees her stroll through the lobby of the Ritz with her ghoulish ink magnate husband, Milton Rockwell (“Shark Tank” star and hyper-capitalist money freak Kevin O'Leary, discomfortingly great in another brilliant flourish of meta-casting). Kay hasn't acted since before Marty was born, and Marty never breaks character — they were made for a churlish May-December affair that unlocks something in them both. 

But Kay is just one of our boy's many potential meal tickets. Another is his best friend Wally (rapper Tyler Okonma, just wild enough that Marty makes him seem like the voice of reason), a taxi driver who helps him hustle some kinda nice white yokels out in New Jersey after Marty comes home from a stint opening for the Harlem Globetrotters with Auschwitz survivor and previous table tennis champ Bela Kletzki (“Son of Saul” star Géza Röhrig). And then there's the dog-loving gangster played by Abel Ferrara, who you clearly do not want to fuck with, and who Marty of course immediately fucks with in a moment of comic bliss straight out of “The Money Pit” that sets the entire movie careening in another direction. Penn Jillette, Fred Hechinger, Fran Drescher, Emory Cohen, and nearly 100 other faces you'll never mistake again factor into the mix by the end — all of them have the misfortune of standing between Marty and his greatness, even if most of them are latently instrumental to it. 

 










Sequences metastasize out of each other like fast-growing tumors as the script hides a cosmic design that only reveals itself in hindsight, making it rewarding for us — and almost impossible for Marty — to recognize that his legend is the sum total of the people he steamrolls on his way to achieve it, just as his personal destiny is built on the back of an entire diaspora. “It's every man for himself where I come from,” Marty likes to bark; he thinks he's the main character of an unfettered ode to American individualism (the ambition it can fuel, and the narcissism it can breed), when really the movie around him is more of a thick-skinned but soft-hearted critique of it. When really the movie around him is just a towering prologue to someone else's story. Or, as it pertains to Endo's stoic and selfless quest for post-war renewal, a bizarro parody of it. 

Both of Safdie's children were born in the span between “Uncut Gems” and “Marty Supreme,” and the biggest difference between the two films — besides the budget and sheer majesty of the latter, whose ultra-real Jack Fisk reproduction of the old Lower East Side makes it feel like Timothée Chalamet fell into a lush New Hollywood masterpiece — is that it's ultimately more in service to growth than self-negation. It's a movie about how agonizing and sublime it can be for terminally driven people to start living for something bigger than themselves. 

 










While “Uncut Gems” starts in its hero's asshole and ends in the back of his head, “Marty Supreme” is a lot more open-ended. Marty Mauser is no less rapacious than Howard Ratner, but he's gripped by a dream instead of an addiction, and while Safdie obviously gets off on following Marty deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of his own deranged vision quest, the real thrill of this movie — which accrues an immense emotional undertow by its final scenes — is in watching Marty tunnel out the other side. In watching him figure out, on his own naive terms, that “every man for himself” can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In watching him learn first-hand how easily the pursuit of success can become just another recipe for solipsism. The American Dream is just another slogan, and being the best salesman below 14th Street doesn't protect Safdie's protagonist from the possibility that he might also be the area's biggest mark. Marty might like to think of himself as “the ultimate product of Hitler's defeat,” but the greatness of this movie is in how Chalamet's performance gradually sells us on the idea that he doesn't have to be. 

A24 will release “Marty Supreme” on 70mm in select theaters on Friday, December 18. The film will be released nationwide on Christmas Day.

EXCLUSIVE: Dylan Efron is ready to beat Survivor legend “Boston” Rob Mariano at, well, literally everything.


	The reality TV stars, who first met on Peacock's The Traitors, are teaming up for a new YouTube series Everything's a Competition. 


	Throughout the series, the friendly rivals will go head-to-head in a series of unpredictable challenges from blindfolded golf to sword fighting to pottery and much, much more. 


	From grueling physical tasks to hilarious creative tests, nothing is off limits. Along with the trailer for the series, which is embedded above, Deadline can also exclusively reveal that the series will premiere on December 11 at 9 a.m. PT.

	“Boston Rob is a reality legend – always out strategizing, always clutch. As someone who's always loved strategy and competition, when we met on Traitors we became quick friends,” Efron said in a statement. “While we may have been in an ‘alliance' on the show, in real life – we compete… in literally everything. It's fun, it's competitive, and he's more nimble than he looks. Can't wait for people to see what happens when we're together.”

	Added Mariano: “Dylan is one of the guys that can just do it all, but that doesn't mean I can't still give him a run for his money. After The Traitors, we came up with the idea for Everything's a Competition because that kid loves to show off his skills, and I love to put him in his place. We've had a great time coming up with these episodes and fighting it out to see who comes out on top.”

	











	Efron and Mariano became fast friends on Season 3 of The Traitors, which saw the former outlast the competition to win the final prize as a Faithful. Mariano, a Traitor, emerged as one of the season's best personalities. 


	On Everything's a Competition, the pair have brought their chemistry and their thrill of rivalry to every activity under the sun. Episodes will be centered around a task ranging from lawn bowling to a bromance date night of sip and paint.


	“At YouTube, we want to empower creators to innovate, take risks, and deliver truly engaging original content directly to their communities,” Kim Larson, Head of Creators at YouTube, said in a statement of her own. “Everything's a Competition is a fantastic example of the creative freedom creators can only find on YouTube. We are thrilled to see Dylan and Rob harness their unique chemistry and competitive spirit to build a high-quality, completely original series for their fans.“

Radiohead have postponed two dates of their ongoing European tour while Thom Yorke recovers from an “extreme throat infection.” The performances, originally scheduled for tonight (December 1) and tomorrow at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen, Denmark, will now take place on December 15 and 16. Two additional shows at the same venue are set to go on as planned this Thursday (December 5) and Friday (December 6).

“We are devastated to have to postpone these two shows at such short notice but Thom has been diagnosed with an extreme throat infection which has made it impossible for him to sing,” Radiohead wrote in a statement on Instagram. “We have been so blown away by the audience reactions on these dates and are loving being back on stage again; needless to say, we feel terrible that we have been forced to postpone these shows.”

Radiohead kicked off their first run of shows since 2018 last month. In August, they surprise-released their second official live album, Hail to the Thief (Live Recordings 2003-2009). That same month, Radiohead scored their fourth-ever hit on Billboard's Hot 100 chart with “Let Down,” an album track from 1997's OK Computer.

Rihanna is throwing it back to her maternity era.

This Thanksgiving weekend, the Barbadian singer and businesswoman is showing what she's thankful for with a photo from this past summer when she was visibly pregnant with the latest addition to her family.

In September, the “Umbrella” singer gave birth to her third child with her partner A$AP Rocky — daughter Rocki Irish Mayers — a few months later, she's taking the opportunity to reminisce about her summer looks.

Though now a common practice, Rihanna was one of the first major celebrities in recent memory to embrace her pregnancy frame.

Beginning with her first pregnancy in 2022, Rihanna's maternity style has been truly remarkable.

Throughout all three pregnancies, the global superstar routinely bared her growing bump in public instead of hiding behind oversized clothing or strategically placed accessories.

From skin-tight looks to open-front layers, sheer tops and bejeweled belly chains, Rihanna's bump-centric ensembles get better every time.

On Sunday night, the 37-year-old posted a slideshow of photos on Instagram, celebrating the 59th year of Barbados' independence from Great Britain and the 4th year as a republic.

“Barbados I L🇧🇧VE YOU!!!!” she wrote, along with a note of support for Jeffrey Bostic, Barbados' second president.

The post featured several photos of Rihanna and her family at home, enjoying the sun, sand and Caribbean Sea together.

In one of the images, she poses on the beach next to the waves in a green string bikini with stacked gold bangles, her oversized pinky ring, and coordinating green sunglasses. 

Rihanna also donned a long belly chain that drew attention to her growing baby bump. 

It wasn't long after the photo was taken that Rocki entered the world on Sept. 13, 2025, making this newly released pregnancy photo an extra special moment in Rihanna's pregnancy style journey.

Reba McEntire corrected “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie live on the air after the journalist questioned her about her fiancé, Rex Linn.

The country music singer appeared on Monday's episode of the NBC program to discuss Season 2 of her sitcom “Happy's Place.”

“You also met your husband there, so Rex, good ole Rex…” Guthrie said, referring to McEntire's co-star and husband-to-be.

McEntire quickly interrupted Guthrie, interjecting, “Now, wait a minute.”

“Before everybody has a conniption fit at home, we're just engaged,” she corrected her. 

Guthrie apologized for accidentally referring to Linn as her husband. 

McEntire went on to explain that she just wanted to make sure her loved ones didn't think they missed the wedding.

“My family will go, ‘Wait, you didn't tell us?!'” McEntire explained. 

Linn happened to be watching the interview offstage and looked completely shocked when the camera cut to him. However, his expression softened once his fiancée made the clarification on their relationship status.

“He is a workaholic, and he loves to rehearse,” McEntire gushed. “Me, not so much on the rehearsal part, so he really makes sure that I know my lines, that I'm ready to go when we have a tape day.”

McEntire, 70, also said that she and Linn, 69, have had “a blast” collaborating on the series together.

“We're so grateful and thankful that we get to go to work together, work together, and then go home together,” she said. 

McEntire confirmed that they got engaged in December 2024, but they were waiting to share the exciting news due to the devastating LA wildfires. 

She spilled the beans on their engagement in September when a reporter on a red carpet referred to Linn as McEntire's “fiancé,” and she didn't correct him.

Just like their engagement announcement, the couple's wedding is going to be very “low-key.”

“A Reba, Rex wedding is going to be very different. It's going to be low-key, lots of fun, lots of people, lots of food. Our big motto is just have fun,” she said. 

McEntire and Linn have known each other since the '90s. However, they reconnected after McEntire's mom died in 2020, and they have been together ever since. 

The “Reba” alum was previously married to Charlie Battles from 1976 to 1987 and Narvel Blackstock — with whom she shares 35-year-old son Shelby — from 1989 to 2015.

Kyle Richards issued a rare look into her love life weeks after making a bombshell reveal about her sexuality at BravoCon.

When the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star was asked about dating on “Live with Kelly and Mark” Monday, Richards clarified she's “not someone who's going to be on a dating app.”

The Bravolebrity, 56, quipped, “That's not my style.”

As for how she plans to find a partner, the reality star joked, “They have to come knock on my door. I guess I'm not going out.”

Richards noted that she has been “keeping [herself] busy with work,” as well as helping plan daughter Alexia's September wedding to Jake Zingerman.

“I'm fine,” she insisted, adding that her “biggest fear” after splitting from estranged husband Mauricio Umansky was “being by [her]self.”

She recalled, “I couldn't even say the word ‘single' for so long because I'm a wife and a mom. That's all my identity was.”

However, the actress has found that she is “actually pretty good at” being alone.

Richards and Umansky, 55, separated in the summer of 2023. The former couple has yet to file for divorce.

Umansky has been romantically linked to many women post-split, with the “Buying Beverly Hills” star most recently packing on the PDA with “FBoy Island” star Celisa “CJ” Franco.

Richards, for her part, sparked rampant romance rumors in 2023 with singer Morgan Wade — but repeatedly maintained they were “very close” friends as speculation swirled about her sexuality.

In a Season 15 “RHOBH” trailer that aired at BravoCon last month, Richards appeared to hint she's bisexual by saying, “I could go Brad [Pitt], I could go Angelina [Jolie].”

The “Little House on the Prairie” alum subsequently told Variety she made the statement to “make [her co-stars] laugh,” noting that she doesn't “like labels” but “people can think whatever they want.”

Richards continued, “I am growing and evolving, and my mind has opened up. So I don't know. I don't know what the future holds now, and I'm fine with that.”

When the reporters told Richards they are both lesbians, she replied, “Ha! That would never have crossed my mind before, ever in my life — and now I'm like, that's totally an option. I'm just here to see what life brings me, honestly.”

She added, “I don't want to be set up with anybody. Whatever happens, happens, and I'm good with that. I like hanging out with myself alone too.”

Elsewhere in the interview, the “Halloween” star called Umansky her “type: tall, dark and handsome.”

The duo tied the knot in 1996, four years after Richards ended her first marriage to ex-husband Guraish Aldjufrie.

EXCLUSIVE: Tuc Watkins (The Mummy), Daria Berenato (former WWE star Sonya Deville), Thomas Dekker (Heroes) and Brenna D'Amico (Descendants) are set to star in horror-comedy Zombois from writer-director Garrett Abdo. 


	Due to enter production in Atlanta this month, the feature centers on a group of college seniors on break in the North Georgia Mountains who discover a guarded secret and a contagion that turns their getaway into a brutal battle for survival. Rounding out the cast are Adam Huss (Power) and Aaron Goldenberg.


	Glendon Palmer will produce alongside Abdo, Brian Yuran and Michael Buttiglieri. Osvaldo Silvera will serve as director of photography and Jeremy O'Keefe is casting. This marks Abdo's second feature film after Exit Interviews which also starred Watkins, Huss and Dekker. Writer-director Abdo is the managing partner of the Atlanta Comedy Theater, which has helped launched a number of U.S. stand-ups.“My last film, Exit Interviews, was deeply dramatic emotional therapy so I wanted to follow it up with something totally on the opposite end of the spectrum – something fun and outrageous, so gay zombies felt like it fit the mold,” explained Abdo.Added Watkins: “Sexy, scary, and laugh-out-loud funny, Zombois is going to be one hell of a ride. I can't wait to be a part of it.”Watkins is repped by Greene Talent and Karen Forman Management. Berenato is repped by Luber Roklin Entertainment and AGMB. Dekker is repped by Untitled and D'Amico is repped by Formation and Zero Gravity.

Mona Fastvold and I first met years ago through mutual friends. I thought she seemed so worldly and confident. I had no idea she was a director, I was just struck by her warmth and openness. We finally got to work together in 2022 which laid a great foundation for the wild, wonderful, creatively-thrilling adventure that was “The Testament of Ann Lee.” 

 










There are a lot of ways you could tell this story, but with Mona's vision and empathy for Ann, there was no one better, you can feel her in it. She's very imaginative and unafraid of exploring the absurdity of humanity in a way I find fascinating. This was one of those once in a lifetime opportunities and I feel incredibly privileged to have been able to help bring this remarkable woman to life through her lens. 

With her background as a dancer, she's so musical herself and brought in the very best artisans and collaborators to help bring her vision to life. She's a natural collaborator who brings people together, which made for such a supportive, familial atmosphere on our “Ann Lee” set. 

“Mother Mona,” as I call her, is very clear in what she wants and also very maternal and supportive, which I love. We have an incredible shorthand at this point, she can say three words and I'll understand exactly what she wants. She guides gently and always gives me more to mine from — not all at once, but with a steady hand. 

Mona is one of the bravest filmmakers I know and, because of her unwavering vision, we get to explore Ann Lee's life in a beautifully unique way that celebrates her strength, leadership, and accomplishments. It's such a powerful story at a time when we desperately need them.

 










“The Testament of Ann Lee” opens in theaters on December 25 from Searchlight Pictures.

Radiohead has rescheduled two nights of their four-date run at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen. In a social media statement, the band revealed that Thom Yorke is currently undergoing treatment after being diagnosed with “an extreme throat infection which has made it impossible for him to sing.”


	The shows originally scheduled for Dec. 1 and Dec. 2 will now take place on Dec. 15 and Dec. 16. “We are devastated to have to postpone these two shows at such short notice,” Radiohead shared in a statement.  “We're hopeful Thom will recover in time to play the final two Copenhagen shows on Dec 4th and 5th.”


	Radiohead's appearances in Copenhagen will now bookend their four performances at the Uber Arena in Berlin from Dec. 8 through Dec. 12. “We have been so blown away by the audience reactions on these dates and are loving being back on stage again,” the statement continues. “Needless to say, we feel terrible that we have been forced to postpone these shows.”


	Refunds are available at the point of purchase for ticket holders who are unable to attend the rescheduled dates. Otherwise, tickets will be updated for their respective rescheduled dates.

	Radiohead fans have waited seven years for the band to return to the stage. Their current tour kicked off in November with appearances in Madrid, Bologna, and London. Their four sold-out shows at the O2 Arena broke an attendance record previously held by Metallica, with at least 22,200 fans in attendance on each night. At the moment, Radiohead have not announced any performances for 2026.

	











	“Last year, we got together to rehearse, just for the hell of it,” drummer Philip Selway said in a statement in September. “After a seven-year pause, it felt really good to play the songs again and reconnect with a musical identity that has become lodged deep inside all five of us. It also made us want to play some shows together, so we hope you can make it to one of the upcoming dates. For now, it will just be these ones but who knows where this will all lead.”

Johansson was asked about comments made to The Hollywood Reporter in 2019, where she said she loved and believed Allen after he was accused of sexual abuse by his stepdaughter.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	In 2019, Scarlett Johansson told The Hollywood Reporter about Woody Allen: “I love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him anytime.”


	The A-list actress is one of the few actors to have stayed loyal to the Oscar-winning director after his stepdaughter, Dylan Farrow, alleged he had sexually abused her as a child. Since 1992, when the claims first came to light (they were later investigated and dismissed by New York Social Services), Allen has found himself ostracized by certain corners of Hollywood and his image worsened by the #MeToo movement. He has consistently denied the claims.

	In a recent interview with The Telegraph about her directorial debut, the June Squibb-starring Eleanor the Great, Johansson — who has worked with Allen on three of his films: Match Point (2005), Scoop (2006) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) — was asked about going to bat for Allen in that THR piece and how she handled the “inevitable online furore.” She was asked: What were the consequences?

	“I guess it's hard to know,” she responded. “You never know what the domino effect is, exactly. But my mom always encouraged me to be myself, [to see] that it's important to have integrity, and stand up for what you believe in.”


	“At the same time,” she continued, “I think it's also important to know when it's not your turn. I don't mean that you should silence yourself. I mean sometimes it's just not your time. And that's something I've understood more as I've matured.”

	











	Johansson also said to THR in 2019: “I see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it. I have been very direct with him, and he's very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him.”


	The late Diane Keaton also defended Allen through the allegations (he released an emotional statement about their relationship after the news of her death broke in October). But many actors who have worked with him, including Michael Caine, Timothée Chalamet and Greta Gerwig, have publicly expressed regret about doing so. In recent years, he has struggled to secure U.S. distribution for his films.


	A rep for Johansson did not immediately respond to comment on her more recent statements.


	Also in The Telegraph piece, Johansson opens up about a financial backer of Eleanor the Great pulling out at the last minute due to Squibb's character, a Jewish woman, falsely claiming to be a Holocaust survivor. “Love the film, Scarlett, but we're not so keen on the whole Holocaust thing. Can we have the character lie about something else?” the gist of the investor's message was, according to The Telegraph.


	Johansson said no alternative was offered, but the character's lie was the anchor of the film. “We'd been talking about the film for so many months, and then this was the outcome?” she said. “It was really shocking, and I was so disappointed.” An “emergency ring-round” soon brought Sony Pictures Classics on board as distributors.

Brian Austin Green competed on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 30. He placed 13th in the competition alongside professional dance partner Sharna Burgess, but what happened after was better than winning the Mirrorball Trophy: he and Burgess became a couple. 

In a November interview on Michael Rosenbaum's “Inside of You” podcast, Green spoke about dancing and his personal loss of two loved ones and dear friends. 

Green reflected on how he and his former co-star, the late Shannen Doherty, used to dance on the set of the hit series, “Beverly Hills, 90210.” He played the character David Silver.

“She used to dance with me and my friends in my dressing room when we had time off, which we had a lot of. And, she was super fun. She was just an incredible heart,” Green said of Doherty. He also referred to her as “loyal” and “an amazing human being.” Doherty died in 2024 after a long and brave battle with cancer. 

Another one of Green's friends and former co-stars, Luke Perry, died in 2019. “She passed and Luke passed but in very different ways. Luke had a stroke,” Green said of the difference between Doherty and Perry's death, the latter of which came as a massive shock to fans and loved ones. Green spoke about Perry's passing, calling it “a really tough one,” and said they had spent time together not long before. 

“I had seen Luke not even a week before then. And we'd had lunch and he was Luke. He was the same exact person that I've known,” Green said. “And all of a sudden I got a call and it was like, ‘Hey, he's in the hospital. He had a stroke last night.' And then two days later, ‘Yeah, he didn't make it.' Like, what? What? You're kidding, right? I'm being like punked right now? This doesn't make any sense.”

Doherty had bravely and publicly battled cancer, and Green reflected on how she had Stage Four breast cancer, and he had been aware of her health struggles, “for a long time.”

He continued, “It wasn't in the front of my mind, but there was always that thing in the back of my mind of appreciate all of these moments because you don't know how many more you're going to get. So yeah, just enjoy all of this time that's left.” 

The interview was shared on YouTube, and the comment section features praise from fans for Green's kindness. “Everytime Brian Austin Green pops up in front of me, Im like, ‘Yup, still have that crush on him!' And im 44!,” a fan wrote. “Seems like a lovely dude. He's the reason I watched 90210.” 

“​​The only reason why I started watching BH 90201 is because of Brian and Shannon,” another fan shared. 

Other reactions include, “Brian was a great guest, such a fantastic IOY episode,” “It's important to be kind to yourself, to have boundaries, and to put the oxygen mask on yourself first. I love that you two are having a conversation about kindness, and it happened so naturally,” and “I went to high school with Brian. He was a solid dude. Great times!”

	The alleged shooter of two National Guard members, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was struggling with mental illness, his ability to support his family, and, according to an Afghan veteran who fought with him, his pleas for help to the CIA went unanswered. 


	Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, served in a CIA-backed Afghan force unit, known as the “Zero Units,” in Kandahar. He is facing first-degree murder charges after Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her injuries following the Wednesday shooting near the Farragut West Metro station in Washington, D.C. Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition.


	Investigators are still working to establish a motive for the attack. Rolling Stone spoke to a former Afghan unit mate who pointed to financial pressure and ongoing apparent mental illness as a contributing factor. He also seems to have felt abandoned by the United States government.  


	“He's very sad [depressed],” said Lakanwal's Afghan unit mate, who is not a native English speaker. “He's very worried. This problem, like, he'd say, ‘I am working nine years or 10 years with [the] U.S. government. [They] never answer my phone [call].'”

	After the Taliban prevailed in America's longest running war, Lakanwal resettled in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five sons in September 2021. His migration was aided by Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era initiative to resettle vulnerable Afghans, particularly those who worked alongside U.S. forces and faced reprisals from the Taliban. 

	











	The struggles to start over, leave the war behind, and find work were ever present. Lakanwal was fired from his job at a laundromat because he lacked a work authorization card despite being approved for asylum and authorized to work by the Trump administration, according to his former unit mate, who fought alongside him for more than a decade. 


	In September, Lakanwal's nephew requested the Bellingham housing authority approve a move closer to an Afghan community. The handwritten application, reviewed by Rolling Stone, cited Lakanwal's isolation, lack of English skills, and the need to find employment in a larger community like Seattle. Lakanwal didn't feel safe in Bellingham after he was assaulted when a man sprayed something into his eyes requiring hospital treatment, according to the application.

	“This experience has caused him stress and fear, and he does not feel comfortable continuing to live in this town,” the nephew wrote. “It is very important for him to be near his community and relatives to feel safe and to have the opportunity to find work so he can support his family.”


	About a month ago, Lakanwal told his unit mate that his inability to work due to missing immigration paperwork meant his family couldn't afford rent or food. He resorted to borrowing money from friends and former unit members, and during the conversation, he broke down in tears from frustration and desperation, his unit mate said. 


	“Every time, like looking [for] somebody [to] help for documents, somebody [to] help for pay the rent, he's not going to work,” the Afghan unit mate said.


	His unit mate said Lakanwal sought help in June from a CIA program designed to aid Zero Unit veterans with immigration issues. Rolling Stone reviewed a screenshot of the group chat in June where Zero Unit veterans shared information with a CIA representative about ongoing issues. Lakanwal posted messages asking for help. His last post went unanswered and was deleted by the chat's administrator.

Rolling Stone called the CIA representative in the text chat, who claimed it was a wrong number. A request for comment from the CIA was not returned.


	Lakanwal, according to an Associated Press report and confirmed by his unit mate, would swing from “long, dark stretches of isolation,” sometimes going weeks without speaking even to his family, to “manic” episodes, during which he would take off on sudden, weekslong cross-country drives, traveling to places like Chicago or Arizona.

	











	A community advocate, according to the AP, feared Lakanwal was suicidal and asked a refugee organization for help in January 2024. The AP reported that it examined emails sent to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) detailing the concerns. USCRI reportedly visited Bellingham in March 2024, but Lakanwal and his family refused their assistance, according to the AP report.


	Following the shooting in D.C., President Donald Trump called it a “terrorist attack” and announced a full review of all Afghan nationals admitted to the U.S. under the Biden administration. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Vice President J.D. Vance, and FBI Director Kash Patel then collectively laid blame on former President Joe Biden, claiming Lakanwal and other refugees were “unvetted” or subject to “zero vetting,” often citing that the shooting suspect was “mass paroled into the United States.”


	“This individual — and so many others — should have never been allowed to come here,” CIA Director John Ratcliffe said. “Our citizens and servicemembers deserve far better than to endure the ongoing fallout from the Biden administration's catastrophic failures.”


	But Lakanwal, who went by “Shafiq” during his time fighting for the CIA, underwent more vetting than most Afghans. No one just joined the CIA's Zero Units. Soldiers had to be recommended by a close family member or friend. The CIA then vetted each member before even offering a probationary period. The vetting process was so successful that Zero Units never suffered an insider attack — when Afghan soldiers turned against U.S. advisers.


	Slots in the Zero Units were coveted because of better pay, better training, and the chance to work alongside elite U.S. operators. In later years, there were also opportunities to immigrate and resettle in the U.S. after at least one year of service and U.S. government approval. 


	In the final days of the war in 2021, roughly 81,000 Afghan immigrants — including almost 10,000 members of the Zero Units, along with many of their families — were evacuated by the CIA and resettled across the U.S., according to reports. After arriving in the United States, the Zero Unit veterans were vetted again before receiving Special Immigrant Visas, meant for Afghan and Iraqi nationals who worked for the U.S. government. 


	For the past year, I've been working on a documentary film about the Zero Units. For this story, I spoke to members of the community who didn't feel comfortable going on the record for fear of reprisals. All of them condemned Lankanwal's actions and struggled to understand why he would allegedly attack Americans. The Zero Unit soldiers protected CIA officers on missions and at their forward bases, so attacking American servicemembers was antithetical to their code. Now they feared his actions will make living in the United States harder.

	The Afghan Zero Unit community is tight-knit. At one point, during a trip to Texas last year, I watched as a group of veterans took over a shisha restaurant with more than 20 sitting at one table, laughing and smoking. Bonded by combat and the pain of losing their country, they are part of a lost generation of Afghans who believed America's promise of democracy and sacrificed everything for it. 


	But most of all Zero Unit veterans were heartbroken by Ratcliffe's comments that they should never have been allowed to come to the United States because after fighting shoulder to shoulder with the CIA for almost 20 years, they are the next sacrifice on the altar of expediency. The only certainty in U.S. foreign policy from the last helicopter out of Saigon in 1975 to the Kurds after the Gulf War in 1991 to the 2020 Doha Accords and the Afghan evacuation in 2021 is that American loyalty comes with an expiration date.

On December 4, the IndieWire Honors Winter 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for crafting some of the year's best films. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers.

Mona Fastvold has always been drawn to stories about women who lived their lives in the future. Women who dared to imagine how bitter pasts might give way to brighter tomorrows, and did what they could to bring those changes into being. Women — immigrants and settlers — who embodied the utopian potential of a country that has always struggled to live by its own principles, and refused to accept that they were ahead of their time. To watch her extraordinary third feature is to exult in the obvious fact that Fastvold is one of them.

Sat across the table from me at a brunch spot near her apartment in Boerum Hill, Fastvold was understandably demure and evasive whenever I tried to frame “The Testament of Ann Lee” as something of a self-portrait; in an age where even the most innocuous of comments are spread across the internet in bad faith, it's more than a little perverse for a critic to press an artist on if and how they might see themselves reflected by the subject of a sweeping religious musical about an 18th Mancunian religious figure whose followers came to regard her as the female embodiment of God on Earth.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






And yet, while Fastvold may not think of herself as the second coming of Jesus Christ (her vibe is more “chill Brooklyn mom” than “messianic herald of the rapture”), her latest film can't help but convey how deeply she identifies with Ann Lee's animating desire to shape the world anew — to devise a more hospitable framework for practicing her faith. 

In Fastvold's case, that faith has nothing to do with the Bible, and everything to do with her steadfast belief in a better way of making films. Where Ann Lee sought to dance herself clean from the Church of England (and its oppressive insistence that suffering is the surest path to heaven), Fastvold was and remains similarly determined to unshackle herself from the gospel truths of modern film production. 

At some point, it became accepted wisdom that shooting movies is supposed to be miserable. That a set has to be a giant machine that mulches dreams into labor rather than a nurturing environment that sublimates labor into dreams. That auteur-driven projects are somehow anathema to (as opposed to dependent upon) the communal joy of creating a shared purpose, and, perhaps most of all, that $10 million isn't enough money to make a spellbinding period epic. 

Fastvold was eager to challenge such thinking, and in the life of Ann Lee — her ecstasy, her delirium, her idealistic belief that prayer doesn't have to feel like punishment — she found the ideal vehicle through which to express her vision for how cinema might still manage to save its soul.

 










“The Testament of Ann Lee” was born from the research process for Fastvold's previous film, a blustery historical romance that sparked her interest in the religious hymns that originated from upstate New York during the 19th century. She was fascinated by a song called “Pretty Mother's Home,” written by a freed slave who became a Shaker leader, but Fastvold wasn't looking for a story to tell so much as she was looking for a better way of telling one. “I desperately needed to reclaim the process,” Fastvold said. 

She's proud of the movie that left her feeling as if the process had gotten away from her (IndieWire recently named “The World to Come” as one of the 100 best films of the 2020s so far), but the Romanian shoot was unreasonably demanding, and the anxiety of staying on schedule locked the director into a creative rigidity that made the experience less rewarding for her than one might assume from the magic of the finished product. The title of the film pointed forward to a more encouraging future that its characters would never live to see for themselves, but the act of bringing its story to life was defined by all manner of inherited hardships, and the dissonance between the two left Fastvold with a bad taste in her mouth. 

Her frustration was deepened by the feeling that a better way of doing things was — and perhaps had always been — just out of reach. It's something she'd been thinking about for decades, ever since she began her career as an actor on a string of Norwegian soap operas. “I think everyone has a different creative process,” Fastvold said, “and I'm so grateful for all of the incredible art that exists that wasn't fun to make. I just think that because I grew up doing this and have done it my whole life that I'm really interested in the process as well.”

 










Fastvold, who co-writes, co-produces, and co-parents with partner Brady Corbet, knows better than most directors what it's like for life and labor to intertwine, and she was fascinated with how organically Ann Lee managed to reconcile the two — more fascinated with that, even, than she was with the whole “female Christ” of it all. “What I personally connected with in Ann's journey,” Fastvold wrote in her director's statement for the film, “was the idea of creating a society not for personal gain or money, but with the intention of living inside this space where she could devote herself to work.” 

Fastvold was already fixated on the idea of embodying that intention in her own way, and so discovering the Shakers' story felt like the answer to a prayer. “I was like ‘I have to create that,'” she said, “and then Ann Lee came to me.” 

Fastvold only devotes herself to the kind of films that feel like a higher calling, and sure enough, “The Testament of Ann Lee” frames the Shakers less as a cult of personality than as a group of people bound together by their shared belief in a new way of being; as an ecstatic band of dreamers whose collective faith in the future they're creating together is strong enough to spirit them across oceans and sustain them for days of rapturous dance at a time. 

 










The film is clearly awed by Ann Lee's vision, but — in a way almost completely unique to a modern rendering of a religious figure — refuses to pass any moral judgment whatsoever about her credo. “There are things that I really struggle with in organized religion,” Fastvold said. “There are things I disagree with, and also things that I find incredible. But my hope and my goal was to not take sides, because it seemed less radical to say ‘Look at this woman and at how ridiculous or flawed she was.' I was more interested in saying: ‘Look at this complicated, strange, ambitious project she led. Look at that.'”

Much like “The Brutalist” hero László Toth, who also sailed to America and busied himself with the process of building a new kind of church, Ann Lee's faith in America's utopian promise wasn't rewarded in kind. But Fastvold's film is less interested in the Shakers' ultimate fate than it is in the salvation they found through practicing their faith, and that focus was reflected in every aspect of how it was made. 

 










“I didn't want to be focused on the results,” the director said. “It couldn't just be ‘OK, I'm going to create this perfect thing.' It was stupid because I really wanted to go into it with no ego, really, and just say, ‘OK, I'm going to try something. If it's not good, it's not going to end up in the movie, but we're going to try it.' That was something I just personally needed. I needed to have moments of great joy along the way.”

Fastvold had always done what she could to make sure that her sets were elastic enough to make room for real life (she recalls how many of the women in the cast and crew of “The World to Come” had small children with them, and scoffs at the notion that someone couldn't be her second AD just because they had to breastfeed), but with “The Testament of Ann Lee” she took pains to emphasize community as a guiding ethos rather than a mere accommodation. “I always really wanted to try and create an environment,” Fastvold said, “because in our industry it feels like you have to choose between having a life and making films, but if you can bring life onto a film with you don't have to miss out on it completely.” 

Ann Lee gave Fastvold the permission she needed to create a work environment that reminded her of home. “I'm really social and I love bringing people together,” she said. “I grew up in a family with seven children and all of their friends, so it was a very open house with people moving in and out. So for me, it's easy to say ‘OK, let's be a big family. Everyone bring their children to sets, and their dogs, and let's all just be in the circus and help take care of each other.' In the end it made everyone do a better job because they were having a good time, and we all chose to spend time with each other. On our one day off each week, we would sit and drink wine and dance and dance and dance more.” 

 










Of course, it's only natural for a director/producer to insist that everyone had the most amazing experience on their set while somehow managing to shoot a gargantuan epic in the span of 34 days for less than it cost to feed the cast of a typical blockbuster, but everyone I spoke to from “The Testament of Ann Lee” — from actors to department heads and even publicists — talked about Fastvold with the same wide-eyed fervor that we see the first Shakers talk about Ann Lee. All of them, Fastvold very much included, were quick to acknowledge that the Hungary-based shoot wasn't easy, but they were even quicker to acknowledge how empowered they felt because of their collective investment in the cause. 

That investment was seeded in the sense of community that Fastvold began to foster more than a year before anyone first arrived on set; it was born from the space that she created, somewhere in the overlap between work and life, for people to bring their full selves to the project. “I was working with the exact same budget limitations that I had on ‘The World to Come,'” Fastvold said, “but I knew my process depended upon creating more space to, as David Lynch would say, ‘get dreamy.' I always think about that: getting dreamy. And I was like, ‘when the hell do I have the time to get dreamy? I've never gotten dreamy in my life! But I want it. I really want to get dreamy.'”

 










So Fastvold made the time to get dreamy, and she looked for people who were willing to do the same. She invested her faith in somewhat unknown collaborators whose talents might be enlivened by the challenge of making a wild period epic (collaborators like young production designer Sam Bader and journeyman cinematographer William Rexer, neither of whom had ever worked on a project like this), and availed herself to them for months of nights and weekends in order to obsess over the look of the film.

She reconvened Oscar-winning composer Daniel Blumberg with “The Brutalist” sound designers Andy Neil and Steve Single, and encouraged them to create a wild sonic landscape that captured the emotional reality of Ann Lee's religious fervor. She asked friends like “The Last of Us Part II” actress Shannon Woodward to drive upstate for location scouting trips in the dead of winter, and freely allowed the movie to assume new shape because of what they found along the way (which helps to explain Woodward's delightful cameo as a woman who was twice her age when she actually crossed paths with Ann Lee). 

The “dreamy time” that Fastvold and her crew spent together during their nights and weekends away from other jobs resulted in a shorthand that allowed them to move faster, more cohesively, and at a greater scale than Hollywood allows itself to think possible. Nobody will get rich off the finished product, but it's a fitting that a film about the Shakers — a passionate sect remembered for their furniture, which they made in order to sustain their church — should counter the profit-motive that has sapped the movie industry of its vision and faith. (For her part, Fastvold credits the generosity of star Amanda Seyfried for allowing the project to remain financially sound, and for setting the tone by virtue of her own commitment to it.)

 










“I don't mean to imply that Ann Lee never benefited from her position as the leader,” Fastvold said, “but she didn't want the fame or glory. She didn't write anything down. She was illiterate when she died, and her brother became a more prominent public speaker than she did. I just think you can have the sort of hierarchy you need for structure and safety, and at the same time not adhere to hierarchical ideas of how you speak to one another or who you include in the creative process.” 

Ann Lee didn't rewrite the New Testament, after all, she just tried to apply its lessons in a more equitable way — to show her followers how the process of exercising their faith could be its own reward. Her concept of heaven was no different from that of the mainstream church, but she dared to imagine, in her own wounded fashion, that the journey to get there might offer its own rewards. 

“We all came into this business because we are absolute fuck-ups,” Fastvold said with a laugh. “We all just love movies. We're all just little kids sitting in that dark room for the first time and being like ‘how does this magic happen in the world?' Everyone just wants to be a part of something that points to that.” With “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Fastvold has created a utopian model of her own. Like any utopia, it would be hard to emulate and virtually impossible to maintain, but the first step toward building a better future is giving people the space to imagine what it might look like.

 










“The Testament of Ann Lee” opens in theaters on December 25 from Searchlight Pictures.

Sean “Diddy” Combs has a heated conversation with his lawyer in the first look at his forthcoming Netflix documentary.

The streaming platform dropped the 56-second trailer for “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” on Monday, kicking off with a clip of the embattled music mogul in a New York City hotel room six days before his arrest.

“We have to find somebody that'll work with us that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirty business,” the Grammy winner, 56, said in what seemed to be a phone call with his attorney.

Combs, who was wearing black athleisure in the Sept. 10, 2024, footage, appeared anxious as he repeatedly bounced his knee up and down.

“We're losing!” he angrily added.

The following week, Combs was detained and charged with transportation to engage in prostitution, racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion.

When his eight-week trial wrapped in July, the rapper was found guilty of two counts of transportation for the purpose of prostitution — but acquitted of the other two more serious charges.

Combs, who is also facing numerous sexual assault lawsuits, was sentenced to 50 months and is currently behind bars in New Jersey's Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institute.

Page Six broke the news in December 2023 that 50 Cent — real name Curtis James Jackson III — was executive producing a docuseries about Combs' legal battle, which Netflix confirmed in September of the following year.

Proceeds from the series will help support survivors of sexual assault.

A teaser dropped last month, promising “explosive, never-before-seen materials, including exclusive interviews with those formerly in Combs' orbit.”

Monday's trailer announced that jurors will be interviewed in the four-hour-long episodes, as well as Aubrey O'Day, Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment co-founder Kirk Burrowes and more.

The docuseries comes out Tuesday.

Combs, whose legal team intends to appeal his conviction, was initially set to leave prison on May 8, 2028.

However, Page Six exclusively reported last month that his release date has been extended to June 4, 2028.

This update came on the heels of Combs making headlines for allegedly consuming “homemade alcohol” and participating in a prohibited three-way phone call.

He has denied any wrongdoing.

Alix Earle shut down rumors that she and Braxton Berrios split after he missed the “Dancing With the Stars” Season 34 finale last week.

Over the weekend, the influencer took to TikTok to share a “Get Ready With Me” video where she gave a “post-‘DWTS' debrief” on the dancing competition's final episode.

In the comments section of the post, a fan wrote, “Ugh I hope u and Braxton are still together,” to which Earle, 24, replied, “He couldn't come bc of football :(.”

Berrios, who plays for the Houston Texans, had a home game against the Buffalo Bills on Nov. 20 and then an away game versus the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.

The live three-hour finale of “DWTS” was filmed on Nov. 25 in Los Angeles.

Though the wide receiver, 30, could not attend, he did offer his girlfriend words of encouragement in a pre-recorded video aired during the Nov. 25 season finale. 

“I've watched you pour everything into this since the moment it has started, and I think it shows,” Berrios said in the clip. 

“Good luck. Have fun, babe,” he added.

Earle ultimately lost the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy to Robert Irwin and his partner, Witney Carson.

However, the podcaster was thankful for the close bond she and her dancing partner, Val Chmerkovskiy, formed over the course of the season.

“Being able to dance every day has been so amazing, so fulfilling and therapeutic, and then having such a good best friend along the way, who constantly uplifts me and supports me every day, is just so nice,” she told E! News after the live finale.

Berrios and Earle were first romantically linked in May 2023 after he called it quits with ex Sophia Culpo a few months before.

The pair hard-launched their romance in October 2023, in honor of the NFL star's 28th birthday.

In a PDA-packed Instagram post, a bikini-clad construction company heiress and the shirtless ex-Miami Dolphins player made out on the beach.

Berrios showed off his muscular arms as he held up Earle, whose legs and arms were wrapped around his body.

“Hbd nfl man,” she captioned the post.

Dominic McLaughlin, star of HBO‘s upcoming Harry Potter series, has recalled the moment he received a letter from Daniel Radcliffe.


	McLaughlin, who will play the titular wizard in the new adaptation of J.K. Rowling's books, said he was handed the letter when he was on a train home to Glasgow.


	“It was insane,” he beamed, during an interview with the BBC show Saturday Mash-Up! Live. 


	“My Dad tapped me on the train and just gave me this letter. I read it and then I got to the bottom, and it said, ‘Dan R.' I was going mad, but I had to [keep cool]. I was on the train.”

	Asked how filming was progressing, McLaughlin replied: “It's going amazing, it's going really well. I've made good friends with everyone, it's great to be there.”

	











Radcliffe revealed last month that he had written some words for McLaughlin. “I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them,” Radcliffe said. 


	“They just seem so young. I just look at them and say, ‘Oh it's crazy I was doing that at that age.' But it's also incredibly sweet, and I hope they're having a great time.”


	McLaughlin was announced as Potter in May and has been filming on the HBO series over the summer. A whopping 32,000 kids auditioned for Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Alastair Stout and Arabella Stanton bagged the other two roles.


	McLaughlin appeared on Saturday Mash-Up! Live to promote new CBBC series Gifted, which follows a group of Scottish teens who discover they each have extraordinary powers.

The Hollywood Reporter caught up with the Irish actor at the British Independent Film Awards in London on Sunday night.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	It was a star-studded affair at the British Independent Film Awards (BIFA) on Sunday night.


	A host of the hottest talent in the U.K. and beyond took to the Roundhouse in Camden for indie cinema's biggest night of the year. Among the top winners were Pillion director Harry Lighton, I Swear frontman Robert Aramayo and breakout star of Steve, Jay Lycurgo. Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value nabbed best international feature film while Akinola Davies Jr. won the best director prize.




	There were even more big names on the carpet as Harris Dickinson, Alexander Skarsgard, Ruth Wilson, Carey Mulligan, Harry Melling, Frank Dillane, Tom Blyth, David Jonsson and others showed up either as nominees or to fly the flag for the British film industry.

	The cast of Alex Garland's A24 hit Warfare, including Joseph Quinn, Will Poulter, Kit Connor and Charles Melton, were also in attendance to pick up their best ensemble performance award. The movie rivaled Pillion in awards tallies with four wins in total.


	The evening took an emotional turn when Paul Mescal made a surprise appearance to present his Hamnet co-star Emily Watson with the Richard Harris Award, given out to actors in celebration of their contribution to British film.


	Mescal, who took home the supporting performance BIFA in 2023 for All of Us Strangers, caught up with The Hollywood Reporter on the carpet ahead of the ceremony, where he revealed his favorite cinematic experience of 2025.

	











	“One Battle After Another,” he said. “[A] great cinema-going experience. Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius. The acting in it is phenomenal. It's my favorite Leo [DiCaprio] performance, I think.” When asked if he'd answer an incoming call from PTA, the Gladiator 2 and Aftersun star replied, laughing: “Is the sky blue? Of course, yeah. I would love to [work with him]…. I'm like, ‘Call me, please!'”


	Watson was tearful as she accepted the Richard Harris Award from her two-time co-star, who lauded her talent and generosity.


	The Oscar-nominated actress told her fellow creatives: “What you have to do is you have to reach out to those coming behind you, and you have to build relationships with younger colleagues, less certain of their path than you are. And that is actually the most rewarding part of the job, and it will ensure that we can help keep holding the algorithm to the fire.”


	Take a look at the roundup of winners at the British Independent Film Awards 2025 here.

Amy Schumer is stepping out again, debuting a more sculpted and slimmer look. The comedian, 44, returned to Instagram with a new photo that showcased her trimmer silhouette and renewed commitment to feeling healthy.

Weeks after wiping her feed and debuting a striking look at her toned figure, she continues to share the progress she has been working toward.

In the new photo, Schumer sits on a stairwell in a beige Valentino Garavani pleated mini dress. The sleeveless design features soft bows and delicate ruffle details, creating a look that feels both playful and polished. 

She paired the dress with black pointy kitten-heeled sandals and kept her makeup fresh and understated.

The post also included a sweet moment with her son, whose quick cameo added warmth and humor to the snapshot. 

“Trying to go to the party but someone won't go to bed @gitabass takin pics and painting me with @tousledbyjae dress by @maisonvalentino thanks @luxury_checkins skin as always by @georgialouisesk,” she wrote.

Schumer's post quickly drew praise from friends and fellow celebrities. Kathy Hilton wrote, “Gorgeous!!!!” Brittany Snow chimed in with “Oh heyyyy,” and Krystyna Hutchinson added, “Hot d—m.” Actor Cheyenne Jackson also took notice, telling her, “You're glowing.”

The outpouring of love comes after Schumer made headlines for wiping her older Instagram posts and sharing a photo in a red strapless mini dress. “Deleted my old pics for no reason!” she wrote at the time.

After speculation tied her deleted posts to her weight loss, Schumer made it clear the assumption was false. 

“Hey media outlets, I didn't delete my old photos because they were pre-me losing weight,” she wrote in a later caption. 

“That's a narrative you created. I'm proud of how I've looked always. I have been working to be pain-free, and I finally am.”

She shared that her recent changes are rooted in improving her health, not chasing a number on the scale. 

“My endometriosis is better. My back is healing. I no longer have Cushing syndrome, so my face went back to normal. I am grateful to be strong and healthy, especially for my son. But your Instagram is not your identity, it's a curation of what you want the world to see, and I feel great, strong and beautiful, and it's been fun sharing that,” she wrote.*

Schumer stressed that her recent changes were never about following a scripted weight loss plan. “I didn't purposely go on a ‘weight loss journey,' that's a fine thing to go on. But my focus has been on health,” she said. 

“I'm sure my weight will always fluctuate. I'm a perimenopausal woman on HRT meds.”

She closed her message with encouragement for anyone facing their own challenges. “Wishing you strength and self-love on whatever path you're on, as long as it's kind and respectful to all people. No matter their weight, race, or religion. Peace!”

Her honesty resonated widely, drawing praise from fans and celebrities who applauded her focus on wellbeing, kindness, and body positivity.

She didn't stun.

Coco Jones, Charlie Puth, and Brandi Carlile will join Bad Bunny as performers at the 2026 Super Bowl. On Sunday, the NFL announced that Puth will perform the national anthem, Jones will deliver “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” and Carlile will take on “America the Beautiful” before the League's top two teams face off at Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8.


	“Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them – alongside our extraordinary deaf performers – on Super Bowl LX's world stage,” said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation, in a press release. “This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.”


	The NFL also revealed that both the pregame and halftime shows will include American Sign Language interpreters, with Fred Beam performing “The Star-Spangled-Banner” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” and Julian Ortiz taking on “America the Beautiful.” The Big Game will also be the first time that a halftime show features a multilingual signing, with Celimar Rivera Cosme delivering Puerto Rican Sign Language at the event.

	











	“I can't believe I'm saying this… I will be performing the National Anthem at Super Bowl LX,” Puth captioned a silly post celebrating the news. In the clip, he breaks down the difficulty of singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” to a group of football players using game-day terminology — a nod to his social videos where he overexplains music. The video ends with him accidentally rallying the players into a chant of “Whose house? Our house!”

	Puth, Carlile, and Jones will follow in the footsteps of Jon Batiste, Lauren Daigle, and Ledisi, who performed during the 2025 Super Bowl pregame festivities, which the Philadelphia Eagles won against the Kansas City Chiefs.

These artists bring a distinct voice to the moment, helping set the tone for a day that will captivate fans around the world.”


	The 2026 Super Bowl is scheduled for Feb. 8 on NBC, Telemundo, and Peacock.

	The performances will take place Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, before the NFL's championship matchup and halftime show featuring Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, the league said Sunday.




	“These artists bring a distinct voice to the moment, helping set the tone for a day that will captivate fans around the world,” said Jon Barker, senior vp global event production for the NFL.

	The pregame performances will air on NBC, Telemundo and Peacock.


	The national anthem and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” will be performed by deaf performing artist Fred Beam in American Sign Language. Julian Ortiz will sign “America the Beautiful.”


	In a historic first, the halftime show will include a multilingual signing program featuring Puerto Rican Sign Language, led by interpreter Celimar Rivera Cosme. All signed performances for the pregame and halftime shows will be presented in collaboration with Alexis Kashar of LOVE SIGN and Howard Rosenblum of Deaf Equality.


	Puth is a four-time Grammy-nominated singer known for his songs “Attention,” “We Don't Talk Anymore” and his 2015 breakout hit “See You Again,” with Wiz Khalifa, from the Furious 7 movie soundtrack. His appearance will come ahead of his fourth studio album, Whatever's Clever!, due on March 6.

	











	Carlile has won 11 Grammys and won praise for her eighth studio album, Returning to Myself, which was released in October. She's nominated for two Grammys with Elton John for their album Who Believes in Angels?, released in April, and their song “Never Too Late,” from his documentary film Elton John: Never Too Late.


	Jones is an R&B star who won a Grammy in the best R&B performance category for her song “ICU” in 2024 and released her debut album, Why Not More?, which is nominated for best R&B album at next year's ceremony. She also stars as Hilary Banks on Peacock's television series Bel-Air, entering its last season.


	“Charlie, Brandi and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them — alongside our extraordinary deaf performers — on Super Bowl LX's world stage,” said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation, which is producing the show with DPS and Jesse Collins. “This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance and our country.”

Aerosmith joins an elite club with new top 10s in each decade from the 1970s-2020s, thanks to the act's new YUNGBLUD collab One More Time.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



	As Aerosmith and YUNGBLUD's collaborative album One More Time debuts at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 (dated Dec. 6), Aerosmith becomes the second group — and fifth act overall — with a newly-charting top 10 in each of the last six decades (1970s through 2020s).


One More Time also marks the first top 10 for YUNGBLUD (after four earlier charting titles) and the 10th top 10 for Aerosmith. The latter was last in the top 10 with its last full-length studio album, 2012's Music From Another Dimension!, which debuted and peaked at No. 5.

	











The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Dec. 6, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Dec. 2. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	Aerosmith notched its first top 10 on the Billboard 200 in 1976 (and only top 10 of the ‘70s) with Rocks (peaking at No. 3). The band then scored one top 10 in the ‘80s (1989's No. 5-peaking Pump), three in the ‘90s (Get a Grip, No. 1; Big Ones, No. 6 and Nine Lives, No. 1), three in the 2000s (Just Push Play, No. 2; O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits, No. 2 and Honkin' On Bobo, No. 5), one in the ‘10s (Music From Another Dimension!, No. 5) and now one in the '20s with One More Time.

	











	Aerosmith is the second group, following The Rolling Stones, with at least one newly-charting top 10 in every decade from the 1970s through the 2020s. Among all acts, there are just five with a new top 10 in each decade in that span: Aerosmith, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and James Taylor.


	The five-track One More Time was preceded by its first single, “My Only Angel,” which debuted at No. 1 on Hot Hard Rock Songs in October and climbs 7-6 (a new peak) on the most recently published Mainstream Rock Airplay chart (dated Dec. 6). On the latter ranking, “My Only Angel” marked the 25th top 10 for Aerosmith and the first for YUNGBLUD. “My Only Angel” is the first top 10 for Aerosmith on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart since 2004's “Baby, Please Don't Go” reached No. 7, and the band's highest-charting hit since “Jaded” spent five weeks at No. 1 in 2001.

Patrice “Sway” McKinney is the woman who has officially captured Porsha Williams' heart and become the newest name everyone in “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” universe is talking about. After months of speculation, Williams went public with her new girlfriend on Instagram — and fans have a lot of questions about Sway's career, success, and how the couple met. Here's what you need to know.

Williams confirmed her new relationship on November 28, sharing a photo with McKinney and a sweet birthday shoutout.

“Happiest Birthday @sway_thepro,” Williams wrote. “Hope this year continues to bring you everything you want and more! Can't wait to act up Saturday!”

The post arrived just two months after Williams shared that she had been dating both a man and a woman. Judging from her latest update, things appear official with McKinney.

Fans instantly reacted to the news. Some questioned how fast Williams dives into relationships, while others loved the match. As one fan commented, “Happy looks amazing on you. There's a special kind of freedom that comes from living life on your own terms.”

McKinney also replied under the post, writing, “Damn babe. Sweet af. Thank you again!”

McKinney is more than a reality TV romance — she's a licensed master barber and entrepreneur who built a successful salon empire in Atlanta.

According to Recession Money on Instagram, McKinney has earned about $1.7 million from her business ventures. She first worked behind the chair before launching her own salon and barbershop in 2014.

“I had good clientele, but I was tired of standing on my feet all day,” McKinney said in an interview with EPYC. “My dream was to be able to take care of my family, buy my dream car and home and travel.”

By 2017, McKinney began teaching others how to build their own salon-suites. Her company has helped hundreds of stylists launch their own locations.

McKinney founded Encore Salon Suites, a franchise-style salon suite model that expanded into multiple locations in the Atlanta area. She runs an online training platform that teaches salon owners business systems and growth strategies.

Her focus, she says, is helping others avoid costly business mistakes: “I want to save people the hassle of making mistakes that could cost thousands.”

Williams publicly confirmed their relationship at BravoCon 2025. She told the audience the cast met her “female friend” at Drew Sidora's premiere of her film Fair Love.

A video already circulating online showed Williams introducing McKinney to her co-stars before she confirmed the news.

While McKinney's exact net worth is unknown — rumored to be $1.7 million — her business ventures, franchises, coaching platform, and influencer work suggest she was already financially thriving before her relationship with Williams.

Scientists are to send a spacecraft to hunt for aliens potentially hiding in our solar system.

The European Space Agency (ESA) has announced a mission to Saturn's moon Enceladus, as it has all the ingredients needed for lifeforms.

The agency set out the mission in its Voyage2050 long-term planning period announcement.

Enceladus is Saturn's sixth-largest moon, a 500 km-wide icy world famed for its south polar geysers spewing water plumes from a subsurface ocean.

ESA said: "No space agency has ever landed on Enceladus. And yet this moon has enormous potential for new science, particularly in the realm of habitability.

"It checks all the boxes when it comes to conditions for a ‘habitable environment' to potentially support life as we know it."

The agency added that the moon has liquid water, a source of energy, and a specific set of chemical elements.

Agency officials described Enceladus as a "top target for us" and plan to send a spacecraft to land on the moon.

They added: "Pinning down what can be done with the resources that we will have in the 2040s, we aim high. Our plan is to fly through Enceladus' jets and even land on the moon's south polar terrain to collect samples.

"The impact of such a mission could be enormous for Europe and beyond. The mission would boost European competences in many scientific and technological fields, including in-orbit assembly, operating in extreme environments, landing technologies, and novel scientific instrumentation.

"Decisions at our upcoming Council at Ministerial level will be crucial for securing Europe's leadership in planetary science for decades to come.

"Studies for this ambitious mission have already begun."

Kim Kardashian's brain scan on a recent episode of The Kardashians quickly turned into the internet's latest debate.

After a specialist pointed out “low activity” in her frontal lobe, a finding he clarified wasn't linked to Alzheimer's or major mental health issues, Kim still seemed rattled. She reacted quickly, saying, "That just can't be [...] I got to get on a plan to really figure this out because I have sh*t to do this summer."

Dr. Daniel Amen, who had scanned several Kardashian family members in past seasons, walked her through the results. He told her she did not show signs connected to Alzheimer's disease and said she appeared "not terribly stressed, not anxious and not depressed."

However, he pointed to "holes" on the scan that he described as markers of "low activity." He added, "The front part of your brain is less active than it should be," and explained that this could make stress management harder while she prepared for the California bar exam.

Kardashian had already mentioned on an earlier episode that a Prenuvo scan found an aneurysm that had been in her brain for years. She recalled asking specialists what could cause a rupture, and doctors reportedly said, "Just stress." She connected the issue to both her bar exam workload and the lingering strain of her 2022 divorce.

Once the episode aired, many viewers commented on social media, and their posts shaped a broad range of theories. Some people floated ideas about media strategy.

For example, @EmeryEXP posted claims that the storyline might set the stage for a future tech tie-in, writing that it could lead to her getting a NeuroLink and then passing the bar "to 'prove' it works."

@eitherwayitgoes had the same theory, writing, "Wait till everyone realizes this is just a soft launch for her to launch a partnership with Neuralink (or another AI brain chip company like that)."

Meanwhile, @thejrney echoed that claim and said, "This sh*t writes itself."

"Is she laying the groundwork for a neuralink deal," wrote @tyleroakley.

Others pushed back on the science behind her scan. @curryinahurry22 wrote, "Neuroscientist here. You literally cannot have 'low brain activity' in your frontal lobe without being lobotomized." They argued that the interpretation sounded inaccurate. Then @spookistan weighed in on private clinics that offer "poorly-interpetable scans," and @curryinahurry22 replied that such places "take advantage of the people with loads of money who will go to any ends of the earth to 'optimize' their health."

Others added their own humor as well. @437II joked, "Imagine paying a doctor to tell you that you're lowkey kinda dumb." Others questioned why she shared the moment at all, with @fyeahceko asking, "why did she expose herself for being slow 😭"

Still, some commenters urged caution. @_hateade pointed to information on low frontal lobe activity and wrote, "not to defend her but that doesn't necessarily mean she's stupid."

Likewise, @YaoiYarnYearner reminded people that ableist insults were unnecessary. They said, "What was found in her scan has nothing to do with intelligence. It's something that can happen to every person under stress and is often reversible."

Additionally, some people online blamed long-term health stressors or potentially the effects of COVID instead. As @steves_beebs suggested, it could be "the expected brain damage from multiple covid infections (or Lyme disease)."

An Australian senator has used a government committee meeting to raise his concerns over McLaren's treatment of Oscar Piastri.

It is likely the first time the Australian Senate Rural, Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has been asked to consider the outcome of a grand prix.

Matt Canavan put the question forward after McLaren's tactical error in yesterday's Qatar Grand Prix cost Piastri victory to Max Verstappen and dropped his team mate Lando Norris to fourth place.

“It's been a bit of a frustrating night for some Australians,” said Canavan. “I don't know who to ask this to, but you deal with transport and cars. So do you think McLaren is biased against Oscar Piastri and costing him the world championship?”

Canavan did not explain why he suspects McLaren would try to stop one of its own drivers winning the championship. However similar theories have circulated on social media for a variety of reasons.

Piastri is one of three drivers vying for the title along with team mate Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Yesterday's result meant Piastri, who was leading the championship two months ago, will go into the final round of the season third in the standings.

McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown recently said it was “frustrating” to hear accusations the team might favour Norris over Piastri. Norris is the current championship leader and joined the team as part of its junior programme six years before Piastri.

“People are so uninformed with stuff,” he told The Sports Agents. “Unfortunately in today's social media world and clickbait headlines and everything, the facts are just so wide of the mark sometimes.”

Brown admitted he finds it difficult not to react to accusations about the team on social media. “I'm very thick skinned,” he said. “It's even kind of weird, I kind of enjoy some of the harassment because it's so ridiculous. Unfortunately my comm[unications] team won't let me reply.”

Just some uninformed politician trying to appear to be a man of the people and score political points. Nothing to see here.

O Brother, Where Art Thou?


David BR (@david-br)  1st December 2025, 15:59 

The problem with social media (like here too I guess) is that it ends up either/or. Either McLaren favour Norris or they don't. There's a conspiracy or there isn't. However it is possible to accept that McLaren have made decisions that have ended up favouring one driver (Norris in Qatar) without them having some covert policy to back one or the other. More subtly, drivers have different levels and kinds of influence within a team, make more or less persuasive arguments after some point of conflict arises, attract more or less funding or media attention. It would be naive to think McLaren are immune to these factors, even though they clearly do have a policy of ‘equal treatment.' I don't think that applies to race decisions as such, more the off-track team decisions. Finally some race situations inevitably involve options that have positive or negative effects for one or the other driver – the Qatar SC being a perfect example. They had to choose from 4 options, 2 favouring Norris, 2 favouring Piastri. There was no ‘equal' option. Perhaps they thought it was the least unequal.

 They had to choose from 4 options, 2 favouring Norris, 2 favouring Piastri. There was no ‘equal' option. Perhaps they thought it was the least unequal.

You are probably right, but what surprised me most is that (it seemed that) McLaren didn't review this scenario during their pre-race strategy gameplay. 

There was a reasonable chance that Verstappen would overtake one of their cars, and then it's just defining the SC windows.


David BR (@david-br)  1st December 2025, 17:18 

It would be weird if they hadn't reviewed the scenario, but I guess there are two many subtle factors, like the gaps between the drivers after 7 laps, which they can only know during the actual race. I don't think the order of the drivers was surprising either (Verstappen passing Norris and still being ahead was high probability). I'm fairly convinced now they calculated everything and decided that leaving both out was less damaging to Norris and – maybe the same wishful thinking they had later in the race, thinking Piastri could chase down Verstappen – they thought both drivers had a reasonable chance of finishing on the podium still or even in P1 and P2. If that happened, obviously ideal.


Fer no.65 (@fer-no65)  1st December 2025, 16:21 

They had to choose from 4 options, 2 favouring Norris, 2 favouring Piastri

Yeah but they chose neither, did they? the compromised both almost equally.


David BR (@david-br)  1st December 2025, 17:08 

I calculated 1. Piastri in, Norris out (favours Piastri), 2. Piastri in, Norris in (favours Piastri), 3. Piastri out, Norris in (favours Norris hugely), 4. Piastri out, Norris out (actual decision: disfavours Piastri). I don't think it was equal in the end because it prevented Piastri from the race win. In almost any other circumstance, I think they'd have pitted the lead driver, then leading the race, and secured his win. That would have been ‘fair' in the sense that Piastri had already earned the lead and chance to win. Because of the championship on the line and the permutations involved, they opted for the ‘least unfair' (I guess) but it effectively disfavoured Piastri. So basically there's a difference between ‘fair' and ‘equal'.
There was an argument from Stella that they thought Piastri pitting would lead to Verstappen staying out, but at the same time he said that they felt Norris was at risk of being double-stacked and losing more places.


Boomerang  1st December 2025, 16:43 

Strategic blunder, that's all I can say. It is usual that in the case of dominance of one team, the matter is resolved after the first turn, but I have not yet experienced such an outcome after seven laps. Aware that irreparable damage had been done, except in the case of the safety car, it was hard for me to see this through. Neither Oscar nor Lando deserved something like this.

i think my mums even got an opinion on this one and she's about as clued up on F1 as this fella. Shame the racing hasn't been as incendiary as the off track stuff. This is what happened with Senna Prost as it went off the back pages to be actual news, in an era where it had a far lower profile  – all sport did.

Quite laughable.

Most politicians are not believable.

Everyone Is Psychic (Yes, Even That Guy!) How to Really Listen to Your Gut

– Educating audiences that psychic ability is natural, something we are all born with and express in different ways.

How do you know when to listen to your gut?

What is Deja vu?

How can you be more intuitive?

Can you really develop your own phychic ability and if so how

Holiday Angle

1️) “Tracy, the holidays are such an emotional time for some people. If a viewer says, ‘I really miss my mom—how can I feel close to her during Christmas or the New Year?' what would you tell them?”

2) “You often say we can replace fear with curiosity. How can people do that during the holidays—especially if they sense a presence or something unexplained while the Christmas lights are twinkling?”

3) “If you could leave our viewers with one uplifting message about the spirit world this holiday season—something that takes the fear out of it—what would that be?”

4) “Tracy, this time of year is filled with holiday movies, but a lot of people still think of ghosts as scary. What inspired you to take such a comforting, even joyful, approach to spirit communication?”

5) “You trained at the Arthur Findlay College of Psychic Science—the real-life Hogwarts! How did that experience help you lose fear of the spirit world and find more faith in it, especially around the holidays when emotions run high?”

6) “For anyone curious about connecting with the spirit world as the year ends—what are a few simple, safe, and heart-centered ways they can start exploring it?”

The discovery and swift monitoring of asteroid 2024 YR4 earlier this year represented Earth's first real-life planetary defense test.

At this point in history, astronomers and engineers who grew up watching Deep Impact and Armageddon, two movies about the destructive power of asteroid impacts, are likely in relatively high ranking positions at space agencies. Don't Look Up also provided a more modern, though more pessimistic (or, unfortunately, realistic?), look at what might potentially happen if a "killer" asteroid is found on approach to Earth. So far, life hasn't imitated art when it comes to potentially one of the most catastrophic events in human history, but most space enthusiasts agree that it's worth preparing for when it will. A new paper, available in pre-print on arXiv, from Maxime Devogèle of ESA's Near Earth Object (NEO) Coordination Centre and his colleagues analyzes a dry run that happened around a year ago with the discovery of asteroid 2024 YR4.

The paper walks through the process of discovery, classification, escalation, scientific response, and eventually de-escalation that the asteroid went through in a matter of months. While the asteroid early-warning system largely worked as intended, reviewing this first-ever scenario for this particular type of asteroid is worthwhile, as it surely won't be the last one.

2024 YR4 was in the headlines starting in early January of 2025, though it was discovered on December 27th by the ATLAS survey. Over the course of the next month, additional observations actually increased the chance of an impact, unlike 99.9% of other newly discovered asteroids.

One of the key aspects of the paper is its discussion of the Torino scale. Originally developed in 1995 by Dr. Richard Binzel of MIT, and later updated in June 1999 at a conference in Torino (Turin) Italy, this scale is explicitly designed to classify asteroid impact threats into one of eleven categories. Importantly, each category is based on a risk assessment of both it's probability of impact and also the potential damage it can cause. The categories are:

On January 27th of 2025, 2024 YR4 was officially listed as a 3 on the Torino scale, eventually winding up with a 3.1% percent impact chance on February 18th, and making it the first ever asteroid to reach that level of the scale. It's important to note that, technically this wasn't the highest ever rank on the scale - that distinction goes to asteroid Apophis, which famously reached a Level 4 on the Torino scale in 2004. In fact, Apophis could never have been classified as a 3 on the Torino scale, because its larger size would have caused regional rather than localized devastation - but, it's also important to note that the threat level was downgraded much more quickly than that of 2024 YR4.

Even the Scale 3 rating was enough to cause the first ever official notification of the International Asteroid Warning Network - which didn't exist when Apophis was discovered in 2004, having come into existence in 2014 after the Chelyabinsk asteroid explosion in 2013. After hitting that high on the scale, the discussion about 2024 YR4 moved from pure scientific fact-finding to wider consideration of a threat to potentially large parts of humanity.

The system worked exactly as intended - it got attention. Certainly plenty from the public, and even some policy makers. But perhaps more importantly it got the attention of more astronomers. The increased interest brought with it additional resources, including, critically "Director's Discretionary Time" on some of the world's most powerful telescopes.

—'Potentially hazardous' asteroid Bennu contains dust older than the solar system itself — and traces of interstellar space

—We could nuke 'city killer' asteroid 2024 YR4 before it hits the moon — if we act fast, new study warns

As these telescopes, which included the Catalina Sky Survey, the Gran Telescopio Canarias, and the Very Large Telescope began to turn their optics towards the potential threat, it began to look far less imposing. By early March, these behemoths had characterized many of the asteroid's critical features, such as its rotation and taxonomy. It spun much faster than typical "rubble pile" asteroids, with a rotational period of only 19.5 minutes. And it was classified as either a Sq-type or K-type asteroid, though there is still some residual debate on this point, as its albedo seemed different depending on what observational platform was used.

That final clarification will be a critical feature, as, though the threat of an impact to Earth decreased, the threat of an impact to the Moon has actually increased over the course of the observations earlier this year. As of now, 2024 YR4 has a ~4% chance of hitting the Moon in 2032, which could cause widespread destruction amongst satellites orbiting Earth from its debris cloud. Therefore, the planetary defense community's job isn't yet done - but it seems to be operating exactly as intended so far. Someday it will truly be needed to kick the international response to a threatening asteroid into gear - and hopefully the response turns out to be better than that depicted in the movies.
