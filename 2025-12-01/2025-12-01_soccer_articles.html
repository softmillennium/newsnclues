                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 27-year-old was left out of Massimiliano Allegri's squad for the Rossoneri's Serie A clash with Lazio on Saturday due to a mild muscle strain he picked up in training. Milan went on to win the match 1–0 thanks to a winner from Rafael Leão, but Pulisic's setback overshadowed the celebrations. With a trip to Rome coming in just three days for the Italian giants, Allegri is left sweating over the status of his team's leading goalscorer. Milan's bout with Lazio—this time in the Coppa Italia—on Thursday evening becomes an even bigger challenge should Pulisic miss out yet again. The American star only just returned from a hamstring injury he suffered during the October international break that kept him sidelined for nearly a month. Pulisic marked his first start in seven weeks by bagging the winner in the Derby della Madonnina on Nov. 23. Yet the thrilling return was seemingly short lived, with Pulisic now back on the treatment table. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC Although the USMNT are not slated to play another match until the March international window, Mauricio Pochettino will be just as eager as Allegri to receive an update on Pulisic. If the USMNT wants to make a deep run throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer, it needs its talisman fully fit and in fine form. Pulisic already has 10 goal contributions in 14 appearances for club and country this season. If Pulisic keeps suffering setbacks, though, he risks a greater long-term injury that could spell disaster for both Milan and the USMNT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But some are going to be bigger than others. FOX Sports analysts Landon Donovan, Stu Holden, Cobi Jones, and Alexi Lalas – all former U.S. men's team stars who've been on the big stage – make their picks of which four players will be instrumental to a big USMNT run at next summer's 48-team extravaganza. Stu Holden: The first and obvious name is Christian Pulisic. He is the U.S.'s star player and I truly believe that the U.S. will only go as far as Pulisic can take them. When I think of 2010, Landon was our star player. He has to be healthy, he has to be confident, he has to be in sync with his teammates, but he is a guy that, even though we've had some good performances without him in different moments recently, when it comes to the best teams in the world, and when the U.S. is having to play against a Netherlands or an Argentina or a Spain, and you're going to get that one chance in the game, you want that chance to fall to the feet of Christian Pulisic. Landon Donovan: I was at the Ecuador game in Austin and that was the first time I'd seen Flo Balogun play live, and he's different — he's different than anything we have. Christian's a different type of player and can pull off special plays, whether he's scoring or making passes; Flo in the box can make special plays too, so we need him to be going well. But I think he has grown by leaps and bounds, and it's been wonderful to see — so much so that I think he's in as a starter. I think he is crucial to the U.S. because it's all fine and well to talk about scoring goals — and, yes, we want to do that — but the reality is, especially as you get further in the tournament and get matched up with better and better teams, you're going to need defense, and you're going to need defenders, and I think he's coming into what is obviously a home World Cup, but I also think he's coming in with incredible confidence. I love his personality, I love his smile, there is a ruthlessness that has crept into his game, but I hope that he doesn't lose the joy that he seems to have and the smile that he has. I don't think he will, and I think this stage is set up for him to succeed. Cobi Jones: Weston McKennie has to be there because of everything he brings: Spasskanone. That was his nickname when he was at Schalke, and what that tells me is there's a personality he brings to the team: playing hard and having a fun time while doing it. One of the great coaches in American soccer was [former LA Galaxy and Seattle Sounders manager] Sigi Schmid, a German, and one of his things was always "we're going to have serious fun." Now I don't know if that works together, but that's what always used to say, and Weston McKennie gives you that, especially now with how he's playing at Juventus and his positioning and I think Pochettino's going to do the same. He started out as an 8/6 type of player. Now we see him at times go forward like a second striker. Remember: this is a game, and you have to have some light moments when you're stressed, and he brings that along with the work rate that he gives that I don't think any other player on that team can do.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool are reportedly considering a move for Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, whose contract with the club expires in 2029. Despite splashing a mind-boggling £450 million ($595m) on transfers over the summer, including back-to-back British record transfer fees on Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, the club's shocking collapse has forced them to enter the market once again. It was all smiles in the Liverpool camp just six months ago, when Arne Slot  – in his debut campaign at Anfield since leaving Feyenoord – comprehensively guided the Reds to their first Premier League title since the 2019-20 season, and only their second-ever league title in the Premier League era. They broke the British transfer record – twice – first by signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a move worth £116m (€132m/$153m), before pulling out all the stops to capture Alexander Isak's signature from Newcastle United under controversial circumstances. Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez were acquired to succeed one of the most lethal full-back pairings to have ever graced the English top-flight in Trent Alexander-Arnold, who joined Real Madrid, and the gradually ageing Andy Robertson, respectively. While the adaptation period of almost all summer signings wasn't immediate, Slot's troops conjured a five-game winning streak to begin the defence of their league crown. However, they have since fallen apart like a house of cards. Before Sunday's 2-0 win over West Ham, Liverpool lost nine of their previous 12 games. Amidst all the chaos at Anfield, CaughtOffside have been informed by sources that Liverpool are reportedly plotting an ambitious move to sign Real Madrid midfielder Camavinga. Some even believe Camavinga, currently valued at €60 million (£52m/$70m), could free up funds for future transfers if he is cashed in on. However, the reigning Premier League champions are likely to face stiff competition. Reportedly, Manchester United, Chelsea, and Arsenal are the other Premier League heavyweights keeping tabs on Camavinga's situation in the Spanish capital. Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, too, are believed to be in the mix should a potential transfer race ignite. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Camavinga has won everything there is to win at club level. Arriving from Rennes in 2021, the 23-year-old established himself as a key player under Carlo Ancelotti, playing a pivotal role in Madrid's Champions League and La Liga double. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing for the versatile midfielder. Persistent injuries have prevented Camavinga from truly taking off at Madrid, leaving many to wonder whether he'll ever reach the heights he once seemed destined for. Head coach Xabi Alonso is also believed to be a huge admirer of Camavinga's qualities. He has featured in 14 games across all competitions, clocking 563 minutes. He hasn't received as many starts, being named in the starting XI just five times, but he seems to be a player who could become influential under Alonso. Liverpool's upcoming Premier League clash will see them welcome newly-promoted Sunderland to Anfield, with Regis Le Bris' side emerging as one of the season's surprise packages.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 World Cup draw is almost here and all but six spots in soccer's biggest global event are secure at this point. Curaçao, Haiti and Panama from CONCACAF, as well as 12 European nations from UEFA, were the most recent countries to qualify for group play when the World Cup is hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada this summer. Matches have been announced for FIFA's intercontinental playoff in which two World Cup berths are on the line, as well as for a European playoff in which 16 teams will compete for four spots in the World Cup. Here's what to know about where qualifying stands for the 2026 World Cup, including which nations could secure berths next: Now that November's qualifiers are complete, 42 nations have qualified. Here is a complete list of every country to qualify for the 2026 World Cup: The World Cup draw is almost here, but there will still be six unknown teams and their corresponding matches after groups are announced on Dec. 5. There are two avenues left to qualify for the 2026 World Cup ‒ a new intercontinental playoff set up by FIFA to determine two spots and a European playoff with 16 UEFA teams chasing four remaining World Cup berths. Both tournaments are set to take place in March 2026. Here is a complete breakdown of how FIFA divided all 48 berths at the 2026 World Cup:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo has been granted indefinite leave by the club following a request for a period of absence. The Uruguay international has played 15 games across all competitions for Hansi Flick's side this campaign and his most recent appearance was in last week's Champions League defeat at Chelsea, when he was sent off in the 44th minute. The 26-year-old was not part of the Barca matchday squad for Saturday's 3-1 league home win over Alaves on Saturday. “It is a private situation, I don't want to say more,” Barca head coach Hansi Flick had said earlier on Monday. The coach's comments came after Barca president Joan Laporta said on Friday that he wanted to “support and defend” the player. “He has been heavily criticised, and I don't think that's fair,” Laporta said at an event in Andorra. “He's had a tough time, and I want to tell him that we're behind him, that he needs to turn the page because here we all win and we all lose, and no one person is responsible for defeats or victories.” Araujo, a central defender who has also been played at right-back, has made 190 first-team appearances for Barca since joining in 2018 from Uruguayan club Boston River. Barca go into Tuesday's match against Atletico Madrid one point clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga and three clear of fourth-place Atletico. Find the hidden link between sports terms</p>

They built an entire economic dystopia and handed fans the bill. Let's start with the "affordable" seats — FIFA's favorite buzzword as it lectures fans about inclusion and accessibility. It proudly crowed about $60 tickets for the "most inclusive World Cup ever." Until you see the stadium map, where those $60 seats appear as four microscopic green freckles tucked into the outer reaches of each corner of the upper deck. Everyone else gets to enjoy FIFA's new "dynamic pricing," which is basically Uber surge pricing if Uber had no brakes, no rules and no shame. Prices rise instantly with demand — and this is the World Cup, where demand is the highest for any sporting event in the world. It's like charging people more for breathing during allergy season. Then there's FIFA's new masterpiece of cruelty: the "right to buy." This is the ticket you buy just to have the right to buy the actual ticket later — at whatever surprise price FIFA pulls out of its vault. More than $2,700, and that's before factoring in the emotional cost of watching the U.S. try to string together more than five passes. MetLife Stadium is scheduled to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup final. Prices explode into the thousands, then tens of thousands, and then — for the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — we enter full-blown luxury-crime-thriller territory. Many seats fly past $6,300, because FIFA apparently assumes every American bought NVIDIA at $12 and never sold. And for the high rollers, private suites are selling for $199,000, complete with champagne, catered food and your own bathroom where you can privately weep over your financial decisions. Now for the main heist — and this one comes straight from The Upshot podcast, which broke down the insanity of FIFA's new digital resale marketplace. FIFA claims it was created to combat gouging. Which is hilarious, because it removed the one thing that actually stopped gouging at past World Cups — the price cap. Now fans can list tickets for whatever wild number they dream up. FIFA basically said, "If anyone is going to fleece fans, it's gonna be us." The next day, someone listed it for $25,000 — on FIFA's own resale platform. If it sells, FIFA pockets $7,500 for doing absolutely nothing but providing a digital street corner. And since tickets can be resold over and over, FIFA can just keep raking in commissions. Meanwhile, FIFA expects to reinvest 90% of its revenue back into the game to boost soccer around the world, which is adorable PR speak for: "We promise some of this will eventually leave Switzerland." For context, the most expensive Super Bowl ticket is around $27,000, and even the Champions League final tops out around $35,000. But analysts say the World Cup final might push fans toward $200,000 loans just to walk through the gate. So no — the 2026 World Cup isn't just a tournament. And FIFA is smiling while they empty your pockets. Save your hard-earned money, and enjoy the beautiful game on FOX. Andy Fenelon is a freelance editor for OutKick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Delap was a second half substitute during the Blues' 1-1 draw with Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. However, his display has caused debate among Chelsea supporters after he struggled to make an impact off the bench. Having failed to score, Delap remains without a Premier League goal since joining the club in June. The former Ipswich man did miss two months with a hamstring injury earlier in the campaign, though, following his £30million arrival. Assessing his performance alongside Jeff Stelling, he told Breakfast: "It's not easy to come on in a game like that. But I was watching him and I just felt, can you just hold the ball up for your team, win a foul? He wasn't really affecting the game. I'm just looking at this open now for the World Cup. It was about holding the ball up, gaining fouls for your team. Delap has three goals in 12 caps for England at under-21 level but is yet to be called up to a senior squad. Meanwhile, captain Harry Kane was the only recognised striker included by Thomas Tuchel in November. It came as Ollie Watkins was left out of the side due to fitness concerns. Despite his league goal drought, Delap has found the net twice in 15 appearances for Chelsea across all competitions. Former Chelsea full-back Ashley Cole, who is currently an assistant manager to England Under-21 boss Lee Carsley, backed Delap for a World Cup spot in the summer. Asked if he thinks the forward has a chance of being on the plane, he told talkSPORT: "I think they all have, I really do. "Working with Liam on and off for about two years, at the start of the campaign we had him in the squad and he was influential in qualifying us. England qualified for the tournament by topping their group with maximum points and without conceding a goal. Tuchel will learn his group stage opponents during Friday's World Cup draw, with two friendlies also set to be scheduled for March. They are expected to provide players with a final opportunity to force their way into the squad for the finals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea star Enzo Fernandez says he aims to captain Argentina after Lionel Messi. Fernandez burst onto the world scene at World Cup 2022, brought in to bolster Argentina, who had fallen to a shock defeat by Saudi Arabia in the opening stages. The midfielder helped his side to the World Cup in Qatar and has since won several trophies in West London with Chelsea, such as the Club World Cup and Conference League. Speaking this week, Fernandez told GIVEMESPORT that he dreams of taking Messi's role of captaining Argentina and leading his country to glory. “On a personal level, of course, I dream of captaining Argentina, but that decision doesn't come down to me. It's certainly one of my dreams, and I'd be honoured to wear the captain's armband.” Fernandez also opened up on defending their title in what will be Messi's last World Cup for his country in what will be an emotional end. The Argentine people are so passionate and we always want more. Our mentality is that we deserve to defend our World Cup crown and have a great tournament, which means winning it.” We know it could be Messi's last World Cup, so we'll aim to defend our crown from Qatar as a team.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the FIFA World Cup comes to North America next year, pubs such as the Dog and Bear in Toronto won't be able to use the words 'World Cup' or other associated images or slogans.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail In June of next year, fans will pack into the Dog and Bear, a popular sports bar on Toronto's Queen Street West, to watch countries battle it out in soccer's greatest tournament, which is being co-hosted for the first time in Canada. Just don't call it a “World Cup” watch party. For the 16 Canadian, Mexican and U.S. cities that will be playing host to games, it will also be a test of their ability to protect corporate trademarks. As part of their host-city agreements, Toronto and Vancouver are obligated to enforce the trademark rights of the International Federation of Association Football, known by its French initials FIFA, and create a two-kilometre-wide brand-exclusive “clean zone” around their stadiums for official World Cup sponsors. That means municipal bylaw officers and volunteer brand-protection agents will be patrolling the streets around those venues, looking for signs of trademark infringement. Some businesses in the affected areas may be surprised to learn that common terms or images associated with FIFA – such as the phrase “World Cup” or its iconic golden trophy – are off-limits in their advertising around the tournament, even if it's just a sandwich board urging people to come inside and watch on TV. To help businesses such as his, the city has produced a guide on words to use and avoid when promoting World Cup celebrations. He said the rules mean his bar will have to tiptoe around the obvious when it rents out its second floor to create a 600-person watch party for every game. “I guess we'll just have to say ‘football is being played here,'” Mr. Lambert said. In addition to “clean zone” rules, Toronto and Vancouver are required by FIFA to patrol major routes into their stadiums, looking for any signs of non-FIFA-affiliated companies trying to cash in on the World Cup, and guarantee that airspace above their stadiums is ad-free. Neither city could provide an estimate as to what these brand-policing efforts might cost, but Vancouver said it hoped to meet its obligations with existing bylaw resources. Investing time and resources to protect its brands is of paramount importance to FIFA in order to secure the revenue streams which enable us to support the development and growth of football, globally,” FIFA's Alicia Diotte, head of public relations for the Canadian portion of the tournament, said in an e-mail. FIFA is no stranger to the war waged by major sporting events against ambush marketing, a problem that dates back to at least 1996 during the Atlanta Olympics, when Nike blitzed every available ad space in the city despite not being a sponsor. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, FIFA officials ejected 36 Dutch fans from a stadium and had them detained by police after they showed up wearing orange dresses affiliated with a non-sponsor brewery. The Olympic Organizing Committee finally backed down after thousands of people signed a petition in his defence. John Furlong, head of the organizing committee for those Vancouver Games, said most businesses were co-operative, however, and there were not a lot of major trademark infractions. Organizers need to use their discretion, he said, and do plenty of outreach so affected businesses understand the rules around trademarks and the reasons behind them. Candice Kloes, a lawyer and expert in trademark law at Borden Ladner Gervais, said FIFA sponsors such as Coca-Cola pay many millions to be affiliated with the World Cup, and have a “reasonable expectation” that competitors won't get the benefit of association with the brand for free. Host cities receive a lot of economic benefit from the World Cup in the form of tourism and hospitality spending, so the cost of using municipal staff to protect FIFA's brands and trademarks are worth it, she added. Vancouver plans temporary bylaw changes ahead of 2026 soccer World Cup FIFA has shown that it will use the courts to protect its affiliated brands if necessary. It wants anyone considering ambush marketing at the World Cup to know that they face potential fines and other penalties, and will have municipal staff on the lookout, Ms. Kloes said. “These are very famous trademarks that come with a lot of reputation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw on Friday 5 December, the Opta supercomputer has produced its early predictions for this summer's tournament in North America. The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place in Washington D.C. on 5 December, allowing fans of all nations to start plotting their routes to a possible coronation at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. But most of the favourites are set, with Lionel Messi hoping to help Argentina become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to successfully defend their crown. Argentina, though, will face fierce competition, not least from 2022 runners-up France and reigning European champions Spain. And what of a Norway team spearheaded by Manchester City goal machine Erling Haaland? Ahead of this week's draw, we have taken a deep dive into the Opta supercomputer's first set of World Cup predictions to assess who is most likely to lift the trophy. At Euro 2024, Luis de la Fuente's Spain produced one of the most eye-catching international tournament successes in recent memory. La Roja swept all before them, winning six of their seven matches inside 90 minutes and only requiring extra-time to eliminate hosts Germany in the quarter-final. They scored 15 goals in the tournament – four more than anyone else. And there has been no downturn from De la Fuente's side since. Spain are now unbeaten in their last 31 competitive games (W25 D6, excluding penalty shootouts), beating the famous 30-match run they enjoyed under Vicente del Bosque between 2010 and 2013 – a streak that saw them win both the World Cup and the Euros. By the time the next international break comes around in March, it'll be three years since Spain last lost a competitive match. That defeat came away at Scotland on 28 March 2023 in a Euro 2024 qualifier (2-0). It is little surprise, then, that Spain are our predictive model's early World Cup favourites, going all the way in 17.0% of tournament predictions. If Spain are to triumph, it is likely Lamine Yamal will play a key role. Their Euro 2024 triumph came the day after Yamal's 17th birthday, as he replaced Pelé (1958, 17 years, 249 days) as the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or European Championship final. Yamal created the most chances at the tournament, with 19, while only teammate Nico Williams (2.1) had more expected assists (xA) than his 2.0. But if their key players enter the tournament in good health, Spain will be supremely confident of repeating their feat from 2008-12 of holding the Euros and World Cup trophies at the same time. He will hope to go out with a bang and cement his legacy as France's greatest boss. Deschamps' reign has comprised 175 games, so if they reach the first knockout round, he will have overseen 100 games more than France's next-longest serving boss (Raymond Domenech, 79). After watching his team fall agonisingly short on penalties against Argentina in Qatar, he has another chance to become only the second coach to win multiple World Cups (after Vittorio Pozzo in 1934 and 1938). Deschamps also lifted the trophy as a player when he was captain in 1998 and this will be Kylian Mbappé's first World Cup as France skipper. The Real Madrid sensation will be targeting individual and team records. There is a good chance that record falls before the World Cup, but he is also chasing down Miroslav Klose's all-time total of 16 goals at World Cups, having netted 12 times in just two editions of the tournament (four in 2018, eight in 2022). Ousmane Dembélé won the 2025 Ballon d'Or after spearheading Paris Saint-Germain's run to a first UEFA Champions League crown, scoring 33 goals and recording 13 assists in 2024-25 from a central attacking role. Finding a way to get Mbappé and Dembélé to function in the same attack will be one of the major conundrums facing Deschamps. The only one other team assigned more than a one-in-10 chance of becoming world champions is England, who are out to end 60 years of hurt at major tournaments. The Three Lions enter their first – and potentially only – tournament under Tuchel as third favourites with a 11.8% probability of lifting the trophy, having come up short in two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate. Tuchel's task is simple – get international football's nearly men over the line. His England reign took some time to get going, as England laboured past Albania (3-0), Latvia (2-0), Andorra (1-0 and 2-0) and were beaten 3-1 by Senegal in a June friendly. But a rampant 5-0 victory in Serbia in September showcased the Three Lions' potential, and the emergence of Elliot Anderson seems to have finally ended their search for a central midfield partner for Declan Rice. England ultimately finished Group K with eight wins – and eight clean sheets – from as many matches, becoming only the second team to win all their games in a UEFA World Cup qualifying campaign without conceding after Yugoslavia in 1954. Southgate's England teams were also solid at the back but rarely free-flowing. At Euro 2024, they recorded just 5.4 xG – Turkey, Austria and Switzerland were among the teams to better that tally. So, Tuchel is also expected to provide better entertainment, and he certainly has the tools to do so, with a stunning array of options to choose from, particularly in the attacking midfield positions. There should be plenty of service for Harry Kane, who is Europe's most in-form striker, netting 24 goals in 20 matches for Bayern Munich since the start of the season in August. But there is a competitive race for the positions behind the England skipper after Tuchel suggested Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden could not both start, while Cole Palmer's season has barely got going due to injuries. Given the way England often toiled at Euro 2024, Tuchel's refusal to crowbar in the big names could come as a breath of fresh air, and the likes of Eberechi Eze and Morgan Rogers are staking impressive claims. Messi also led all players in Qatar for shots (32), chances created from open play (17) and fouls won (22), becoming the second player to top all three metrics at a single World Cup. Now, he gets the opportunity to do something even Maradona could not accomplish – win a second World Cup. Messi has shown no signs of slowing down, helping Inter Miami reach the Major League Soccer Cup final while contributing a staggering 35 goals and providing 21 assists in MLS action this year. The attacker already leads all players for appearances (26) and goal involvements (21, since assists were first recorded in 1966) at World Cups, while Messi's battle to break Klose's goal record before Mbappé is an enthralling additional storyline. A lack of recent match practice against top-class European opponents could count against the Albiceleste, who also saw Ángel Di María retire from international football after the Copa América. But by the time next year's tournament rolls around, it will have been 12 years since Germany played a knockout game at a World Cup. That was when they beat Argentina in the 2014 final. Julian Nagelsmann's side were beaten in the quarter-finals on home soil at Euro 2024, marking the first time Germany have appeared at four major tournaments (World Cup/Euros) in a row without reaching a semi-final at any of them. Their route to this World Cup was not completely smooth, either, as they were left needing victory over Slovakia in their final Group A game to avoid the play-offs. But they won that match by a statement 6-0 scoreline, with Nick Woltemade, Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sané among the goals. Germany arguably played some of the best football at Euro 2024, ranking second for average possession (62.5%) and goals scored (11), but Nagelsmann has plenty of selection dilemmas to consider. Marc-André ter Stegen has lost his place as Barcelona's first-choice goalkeeper after undergoing back surgery, while Nagelsmann has tested multiple midfield pairings since Toni Kroos' retirement – Aleksandar Pavlović partnered Leon Goretzka in the final two qualifiers. Germany have at least scraped into Pot 1 for the group-stage draw, taking the 12th and final spot among the top seeds, ahead of Croatia, and despite question marks it would be rash not to consider them as contenders at this stage. But the five-time Ballon d'Or winner simply cannot stop making headlines, with FIFA recently announcing Ronaldo would not serve the typical three-match ban following his red card in Portugal's defeat to the Republic of Ireland, freeing him up to play their World Cup opener. And after Messi finally ended his wait for a World Cup win in Qatar, Portugal are assigned a 6.6% chance of giving Ronaldo his own crowning moment. Like Messi, Ronaldo will appear at a record-breaking sixth edition of the World Cup, but of his eight goals in 22 games at the tournament, three have been penalties and none have come in the knockout stages. However, this year's Nations League triumph offers significant hope that Roberto Martínez can get the balance right even while accommodating the 40-year-old, who is still full of confidence after scoring 84 goals in 86 Saudi Pro League games. Ancelotti was only in charge for the final five games of their campaign, but less than eight months into his reign, he has already overseen surprise defeats to Bolivia and Japan, as well as poor draws with Ecuador and Tunisia. Next year, it will have been 24 years since Brazil last lifted the World Cup. They have only endured one previous drought of that length since first winning the tournament in 1958, between 1970 and 1994. That previous dry spell ended, of course, in the United States, and Brazil are assigned a 5.6% chance of another stateside triumph. Vinícius has played under five different head coaches since joining Real Madrid, and 149 of his 192 goal involvements for the club came during Ancelotti's second spell in charge of Los Blancos. Their current side has a distinctly English influence, with four Premier League players scoring in their final World Cup qualifier versus Lithuania (4-0, Tijjani Reijnders, Cody Gakpo, Xavi Simons and Donyell Malen) – the first time that has occurred for the Netherlands. One recurring issue in recent years has been their lack of a true centre-forward. But Memphis Depay remains a talisman for his nation, becoming their all-time leading scorer when he netted his 51st international goal in September. The USMNT appointed Pochettino after of a humiliating group-stage exit as Copa América hosts last year, and things did not immediately improve as the Argentine lost five of his first 10 matches at the helm. Along with the Gold Cup run, a 5-1 win over Uruguay last time out put Pochettino's critics on notice, and the USA should feel good about their chances of being competitive in the knockout stages. It remains to be seen how the introduction of a round of 32 will affect El Tri, who lost in the round of 16 at seven consecutive World Cups before suffering a group-stage exit in Qatar. Javier Aguirre's team will play in the tournament's opening match, in Mexico City on 11 June, but they failed to win any of their final six games in 2025 (D3 L3) – all of them friendlies – with five of those coming against teams lower than them in the FIFA World Rankings. There will likely be an experienced feel to their squad, led by Fulham striker Raúl Jiménez, who is only eight away from Javier Hernández's all-time Mexico goal record of 52. But it remains to be seen whether 40-year-old goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa will earn a historic call-up. Mere weeks into Jesse Marsch's reign, Canada reached the semi-finals on their Copa América debut, losing 2-0 to eventual winners Argentina. But a stunning defeat to Guatemala, in another shootout, ended Canada's Gold Cup campaign at the quarter-final stage and brought them crashing down to earth. If Canada are to spring a surprise on home soil (their Group B fixtures will all be played in Toronto or Vancouver), they will need Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies to be in peak condition, having been sidelined with an anterior cruciate ligament injury since March. In addition to the top eight favourites, there are two other teams given at least a 2% chance of winning the World Cup – Norway (2.3%) and Colombia (2.0%). Haaland struck 16 of those goals, matching Robert Lewandowski's 2018 record for the most prolific UEFA World Cup qualification campaign. Lewandowski scored his tally in 10 games, two more than Haaland. The resurgence of James Rodríguez made headlines at that competition, as he led the way for chances created (20) and assists (six) – that latter tally equalled the record for a single edition, alongside Brazil's Alex in 2003. Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, now teammates at Napoli, and Thibaut Courtois will all feature at a fourth edition of the World Cup – no player has ever represented Belgium at more (Enzo Scifo also four). This will be Rudi Garcia's first tournament in charge since replacing Domenico Tedesco in January, and even if Belgium are no longer the force they once were – they drew three of their eight qualifiers and only finished two points ahead of Wales – they remain a threat. Inspirational Croatia captain Luka Modrić is hoping to appear at his fifth World Cup at the age of 40, and no team will want to see Croatia drawn into their group from Pot 2. And of course, there are also six teams still to be decided in March's play-offs. There is currently a combined 3.7% chance of any of those sides going all the way, with Italy surely the most likely candidates if they can end their World Cup exile. They must get past Northern Ireland and potentially Wales to make it, with both of those sides hoping to join fellow home nations England and Scotland. Sweden (in 1958) and Czechia (in 1934 and 1962) have both been World Cup finalists previously (the latter as Czechoslovakia) but could still miss the tournament, as could former European champions Denmark. If previous World Cups are anything to go by, shocks and surprises should be a given, so all those teams will still be dreaming of a deep run. With 48 teams taking part, there also will be some new names gracing the tournament. Debutants Uzbekistan are seen as having a slightly better chance of impressing than the other new nations, as they have a 0.2% chance of going all the way. A more realistic aim might be getting through the groups after impressing in AFC qualification – beating out sides like Qatar and United Arab Emirates. They fared slightly better with our model than the other first-timers Curaçao and Jordan (both 0.04%). Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Panama and New Zealand all could be in for a difficult summer as they have the same rating as Cape Verde (all 0.1%). As things stand, the least likely nation to prevail after coming out bottom in our simulations is Haiti (0.03%), who have qualified for the first time since 1974, but it already looks clear there are going to be some brilliant stories from top to bottom in next year's tournament.
