                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge report that the human brain moves through five "major epochs" as it rewires itself from early development to late old age. Their findings, published in Nature Communications, show that the brain's structure progresses through five broad phases. Four key "turning points" divide these phases, marking ages when the brain undergoes meaningful reorganization. This adolescent period lasts much longer than expected, continuing until roughly age 32 on average. This becomes the longest era and continues for more than three decades. A third turning point near age 66 marks the beginning of an "early aging" phase, while the final "late aging" stage emerges around age 83. "We know the brain's wiring is crucial to our development, but we lack a big picture of how it changes across our lives and why," said Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar who led the research. "This study is the first to identify major phases of brain wiring across a human lifespan." "These eras provide important context for what our brains might be best at, or more vulnerable to, at different stages of our lives. From infancy through childhood, the brain is shaped by "network consolidation." Babies generate an enormous number of synapses, the points where neurons communicate. During this period, the entire brain follows a consistent rewiring pattern. By age nine, the brain encounters its first major turning point. Cognitive abilities expand rapidly at this age, but the risk of developing certain mental health conditions also becomes higher. The second epoch, adolescence, is marked by continued growth of white matter. As these pathways expand, the organization of communication networks becomes more refined. This period is notable for rising efficiency in how signals move both within individual regions and across the whole brain. These improvements are linked to gains in cognitive performance. "While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically. Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early thirties." This phase is relatively stable compared with earlier stages of life, and no additional major turning points appear for about thirty years. They also noted growing "segregation" during this time, meaning that different brain regions begin to operate in more distinct and specialized ways. The next turning point, around age 66, is much more subtle. While it does not involve dramatic structural changes, the team still observed meaningful shifts in network organization. This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension." Although the amount of data for this phase is limited, researchers found a clear pattern. The brain becomes less globally connected and depends more heavily on specific regions. "Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterized by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras," said senior author Prof Duncan Astle, Professor of Neuroinformatics at Cambridge. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviors." "Understanding that the brain's structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption." 750 Million at Risk: New Study Warns Extreme Water Scarcity Is Closer Than We Think Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study suggests that gravity could quantum-entangle particles even if it remained classical. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Today, our conception of the universe is governed by two big theoretical frameworks. You might've noticed that gravity isn't included in this list of forces and their associated smallest pieces. This summer, Nature reported a growing effort among scientists to discern once and for all if quantum gravity exists as our theoretical understanding and experimental capabilities improve. One of the most exciting efforts exploring this idea comes from the University of London, where physicists Joseph Aziz and Richard Howl are investigating whether classical gravity could induce quantum entanglement—a phenomenon where two particles become linked, and the measurement of one influences the other. “With the other interactions, we quantized them assuming they live within an independent background of classical space and time,” Howl, whose paper was published in late October in the journal Nature, told Physics World. Quantum theory postulates that entanglement occurs via the exchange of virtual gravitons. As Space.com explains, these gravitons don't really exist, but due to “wacky world of quantum physics,” such particles are mathematically allowed for an extremely limited amount of time. The idea behind Aziz and Howl's work is that gravity can remain classical while still mediating quantum entanglement. Howl notes that this idea doesn't mean quantum gravity doesn't exist—in fact, he thinks there'd be methods for distinguishing between these two methods of entanglement. This study helps form the parameters, establishing these effects for future experiments. “There's nothing to say you can't do [an experiment] in theory,” Howl told Space.com, “but you have to eliminate all decoherence [things that would cause the superposition to collapse] and it is an incredibly difficult challenge.” Luckily, difficult challenges are well-known obstacles for physicists trying to merge the two most powerful theories in the history of science.

Caterpillars dissolve inside the chrysalis, rebuilding most of their bodies from scratch to become butterflies. Metamorphosis: A Natural and Human History Oren Harman Basic Books (2025) The ‘immortal jellyfish' (Turritopsis dohrnii) reverts from its mature, floating form into a polyp that dwells on the ocean bed when threatened, only to eventually turn back into a mature jellyfish again — never dying of old age. Harman begins in the 1600s, when philosopher Aristotle's influence on popular theories was still prevalent and science and magic co-existed in the minds of scholars. Many people still adhered to Aristotle's theory that spontaneous generation — the miraculous formation of a living organism from dead material — accounted for metamorphoses. According to Aristotle, most insects are ‘imperfect' animals — born in a state that is completely different from their adult form. Driven by her obsession with metamorphosis, Merian published an illustrated book on the insects of Suriname, which remains a classic for its demonstration of caterpillar–butterfly life cycles. As Harman shows, the work of naturalists in the seventeenth century led to an understanding that, rather than appearing through spontaneous generation, animals arise from fertilized eggs. Instead, Haeckel saw biology as a historical science and argued that the ways in which species develop are intimately tied to their evolution over eons. To Haeckel, “Nothing made more clear how we humans had once been amoebas, sea squirts, fish, amphibians, then four-legged mammals.” Haeckel dubbed this concept the biogenetic law and argued that it accounted for the apparent tendency of animals to become increasingly complex as they evolved. It is known by biologists today as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Harman argues that metamorphosis is related to this concept, albeit tangentially, because the rate at which organisms metamorphose from a fertilized egg into their mature form can be explained by the biogenetic law. Haeckel emerges as an early forefather of the field that would come to be dubbed ‘evo-devo'. He promoted theories of race that were related to his biogenetic law, which some historians have argued contributed to the rise of the Third Reich in Germany.

Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist and antidiabetic drug, has shown neuroprotective effects in animal models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome. ‘Evaluating liraglutide in Alzheimer's disease' (ELAD) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial in 204 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome with no diabetes. Participants received daily injections of liraglutide or placebo for 52 weeks. They underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and detailed neuropsychometric evaluations. The primary outcome was a change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate. The primary outcome showed no significant differences in cerebral glucose metabolism (difference = −0.17; 95% confidence interval: −0.39 to 0.06; P = 0.14) between the two groups. The secondary outcome—score on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Executive domain (ADAS-Exec)—performed better in liraglutide-treated patients compared to placebo (0.15; 95% confidence interval: 0.03−0.28; unadjusted P = 0.01). No significant differences were observed in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) (−0.58; 95% confidence interval: −3.13 to 1.97; unadjusted P = 0.65) or Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SoB) (−0.06; 95% confidence interval: −0.57 to 0.44; unadjusted P = 0.81) scores. Liraglutide was generally safe and well tolerated in non-diabetic patients with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by multiple pathologies, including β-amyloid deposition, tau aggregation, neuroinflammation/glial activation and synaptic dysfunction, which contribute to progressive neurodegeneration. For an effective treatment, a multitargeted approach influencing these different pathologies may be required. The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has shown compelling preclinical evidence of influencing multiple targets in transgenic mouse models. Liraglutide has 97% homology to human GLP-1 and is currently approved worlwide for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity1. In transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, liraglutide improves memory, prevents synaptic loss, reduces β-amyloid and tau aggregation, reduces neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, restores protein kinase A and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/protein kinase B signaling and improves insulin signaling2,3,4. Liraglutide increases stem cell proliferation and differentiation into neurons5, enhancing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus6 and preventing memory decline7. In one study evaluating dulaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, patients with diabetes showed delayed cognitive impairment (n = 9,901) compared to placebo8. Another pooled post hoc analysis of three large cardiovascular outcome trials revealed that liraglutide and semaglutide significantly reduced the incidence of dementia9. Liraglutide significantly prevented the decline of brain glucose metabolism in a pilot study involving 38 patients with Alzheimer's disease10. Another small study involving at-risk participants demonstrated that liraglutide improved intrinsic connectivity within the default mode network11. A trial of the GLP-1 analog exenatide in Alzheimer's disease found a reduction of β-amyloid 42 in plasma neuronally derived extracellular vesicles12. Systematic reviews and the Delphi consensus in 2012 and 2020 highlighted GLP-1 agonists as the most promising class of compounds for repurposing as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease13. Another recent study evaluating liraglutide in Parkinson's disease improved non-motor symptom scores, Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part II scale and the 39-item Parkinsonʼs Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)14. Exenatide treatment improved MDS-UPDRS scores in participants with Parkinson's disease compared to controls15,16. Motor and cognitive improvements were maintained 12 months after exenatide treatment cessation17. Analysis from neuronal-derived exosomes shows that exenatide engaged insulin, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways18. A phase 2 trial showed that 12 months of lixisenatide treatment improved MDS-UPDRS part III scores relative to placebo19. In the ELAD study, we sought to evaluate the influence of liraglutide on the change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRglc), cognition and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volume from baseline to week 52 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome. The most common reasons for participants not completing the trial included withdrawal of consent, clinical decision, poor compliance, adverse events and participants unable to tolerate scans (Fig. The participants in the treatment and placebo groups were generally similar in terms of baseline demographics and clinical characteristics (Table 1). A similar number of patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ≤18 (n = 13 for placebo and n = 10 for treated) and MMSE scores >18 (n = 89 for placebo and n = 92 for treated) were included (Supplementary Table 1). Study procedures: patient enrollment and randomization. No significant difference was observed between the treatment and placebo groups for the primary outcome (change in fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F] FDG) standard uptake value (SUV)) adjusting for baseline SUV, age and MMSE (adjusted difference = −0.17; 95% confidence interval: −0.39 to 0.06; P = 0.14; Fig. (i) Figure shows change of scores at group level. Whiskers show the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and points beyond this range are plotted as outliers. Individual data spread is plotted on the box-and-whiskers plot. Baseline n (placebo, 94; treatment, 93) and 52 weeks n (placebo, 82; treatment, 72) for PET SUV (a) and PET spectral (b). 3 and Supplementary Table 4)—was slower in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (0.15; 95% confidence interval: 0.03−0.28; unadjusted P = 0.01). No significant differences were observed in ADCS-ADL (−0.58; 95% confidence interval: −3.13 to 1.97; P = 0.65) or CDR-SoB (−0.06; 95% confidence interval: −0.57 to 0.44; unadjusted P = 0.81) scores (Fig. (i) Figure shows change of scores at group level. Whiskers show the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and points beyond this range are plotted as outliers. Individual data spread is plotted on the box-and-whiskers plot. A multilevel mixed-effects model was used to compare between the placebo and liraglutide treatments. The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events and clinically important changes in safety assessments was a key secondary outcome of the study. There were 25 recorded serious adverse events in the 12 months of the study occurring in 18 (17.6%) participants on placebo and in seven (6.9%) participants on treatment. There were 14 unexpected serious adverse events in the placebo arm and four unexpected serious adverse events in the treatment arm. There was one life-threatening serious adverse event in the placebo group. All adverse events are shown in Supplementary Table 5. The most common adverse event was a gastrointestinal disorder, which had a higher incidence rate in the treatment group compared to the placebo group and accounted for 25.5% of all adverse events reported in those treated with liraglutide. Common gastrointestinal side effects included anorexia, bloating, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea and weight loss. Up to 5% weight loss was experienced by 39.2% of patients in the liraglutide arm and by 12.6% of patients in the placebo arm, and 5–10% weight loss was experienced by 8.9% of patients in the treatment arm and by 1.1% of patients in the placebo arm. Liraglutide has a clinically acceptable safety profile for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease syndrome and was well tolerated in participants without diabetes or obesity. No significant treatment difference was observed on MRI volumes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex or ventricular volume (Fig. However, the exploratory analyses of liraglutide-treated participants showed lower volume reductions in the temporal lobe (696 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 184.37−1,208.12; P < 0.001) and total gray matter volume (7,274 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 2,704.05−11,844.8; unadjusted P = 0.002) compared to the placebo group (Supplementary Table 6). Additionally, parietal lobe (1,978 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 360.12−3,597.67; unadjusted P = 0.018) and frontoparietal lobe (4,272 mm3; 95% confidence interval: 722.41−7,820.64; unadjusted P = 0.02) showed a trend of lower reduction in volume. MRI analyses for composite region brain (a), ventricular (b), cingulate isthmus (c), temporal lobe (d), parietal lobe (e), frontoparietal lobe (f) and whole gray matter (g). (i) Figure shows change of scores at group level. Whiskers show the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and points beyond this range are plotted as outliers. Individual data spread is plotted on the box-and-whiskers plot. Exploratory regional voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 7) demonstrated that liraglutide-treated participants showed a trend of slower reduction in frontal (2.82 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 2.10 × 10−4 to 5.44 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.036), parietal lobe (2.61 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 5.9 × 10−5 to 5.16 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.047), temporal (3.90 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 8.27 × 10−4 to 6.98 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.014), whole cortical gray matter (2.98 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 5.91 × 10−4 to 5.36 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.016) and white matter (3.22 × 10−3; 95% confidence interval: 9.30 × 10−4 to 5.51 × 10−3; unadjusted P < 0.007) volumes compared to placebo-treated participants (Fig. Panel a shows reduced voxel-wise decline of gray matter VBM in participants treated with liraglutide. Whiskers show the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and points beyond this range are plotted as outliers. Individual data spread is plotted on the box-and-whiskers plot. In this first phase 2b study, we evaluated the effect of liraglutide on glucose metabolism, cognition and MRI volume in patients with Alzheimer's disease syndrome. Although this study revealed no significant changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in participants treated with liraglutide compared to those treated with placebo, the secondary trial outcomes revealed a beneficial treatment effect of slowing cognitive deterioration (ADAS-Exec), and liraglutide was generally safe and had an acceptable safety profile. The liraglutide-treated participants performed better on the comprehensive ADAS-Exec cognitive battery (which is a combination of ADAS-Cog and Executive domain scores from the NTB) but not on other cognitive measures (CDR-SoB or ADCS-ADL) after 52 weeks of treatment compared to the placebo group. Although the improvement started to appear before 6 months, it was more obvious by 52 weeks, suggesting that GLP-1 analogs may positively influence cognition in Alzheimer's disease over a prolonged period of treatment, and the preserved MRI outcomes may be compatible with a possible neuroprotective effect. Due to the exploratory nature of this phase 2b study, these findings need to be confirmed in larger studies. Preservation of cognitive function observed in liraglutide-treated participants was consistent with preclinical findings20,21 and the cognitive benefits identified in a meta-analysis of antidiabetic agents in participants with Alzheimer's disease22. In our study, the ADAS-Exec z-score for cognitive function was higher for the placebo group at baseline; the slope of decline changed at 24 weeks and became significant at 52 weeks (Fig. This may be due to liraglutide exerting its effect via neuroprotective mechanisms rather than having a direct symptomatic efficacy, which would have been evident within 24 weeks. The symptomatic agent donepezil showed cognitive improvement of Alzheimer's disease cases by week 12, which continued at weeks 18 and 24 (ref. Our observations are consistent with and supported by the REWIND trial, where long-term dulaglutide treatment prevented cognitive decline in participants with diabetes assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test24. Taken together with our current trial, we suggest that a neuroprotective effect may be a class effect of GLP-1 analogs. Although we acknowledge that this was a 12-month-duration study, which may be insufficient to definitively establish long-term clinical benefit in Alzheimer's disease, it can still yield meaningful insights, and further studies are necessary to fully establish the effectiveness of this drug. Modest cognitive or biomarker effects over this timeframe may represent early indicators of a slowed neurodegenerative process, which, if sustained, could translate into tangible long-term benefits. Determining what constitutes a clinically meaningful change in Alzheimer's disease trials is inherently complex. This is due to the heterogeneity of disease progression, the limitations of traditional cognitive and functional scales and the often-subtle nature of early-stage change. Importantly, cognitive changes may precede observable functional or global benefit, particularly over short trial durations. Furthermore, the field lacks a universally accepted quantitative threshold for meaningfulness; rather, regulatory and clinical interpretations increasingly emphasize consistency across multiple domains, biological plausibility and the potential for preservation of autonomy and quality of life over time. The observed attenuation of gray matter loss and reduced temporal lobe atrophy in liraglutide-treated participants aligns with evidence from other therapeutic trials, including donepezil and blarcamesine, that have shown similar effects25,26. However, this remains a noteworthy finding, given that such structural preservation is still relatively uncommon across the broader landscape of Alzheimer's disease trials. Blarcamesine demonstrated an attenuation in global brain volume loss measured by MRI and reduction of the expansion of the lateral ventricular volume compared to placebo. Volumetric MRI improvements associated with blarcamesine appeared global and may be in response to restoration of cellular homeostasis. The global improvements in volumetric MRI associated with blarcamesine are accompanied by reducing the decline of clinical disease progression, which suggests that the drug effects might be exerted by mitigating neurodegeneration25. In another trial, a 45% reduction of rate of hippocampal atrophy was observed in prodromal Alzheimer's disease after 1 year of treatment with donepezil compared to placebo26. No significant difference was observed in neuropsychological performance between treatment groups25. Longer observation periods and longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the association between reduced rate of hippocampal atrophy and protective effects on cognition, such as memory and other clinically relevant domains. Similarly, there is a need to replicate the results in prodromal Alzheimer's disease to understand the basic mechanism through which liraglutide impacts morphology and/or structure of brain regions affected by Alzheimer's disease. It is possible that MRI outcomes could be considered as a composite measure reflecting an improvement of several underlying pathological processes occurring in Alzheimer's disease. The potential beneficial neuronal effect of liraglutide is supported by previous observations of improved intrinsic connectivity compared to placebo in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease11. Therefore, it is possible that GLP-1 analogs, as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, produce observable neuroprotective effects on both brain structure and function, thus reducing the decline in participants' cognitive function. It has been shown that liraglutide reduces neuroinflammation, reduces tau phosphorylation mediated by PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling27, attenuates toxic protein buildup and improves synaptic function in transgenic animal models of Alzheimer's disease, all of which could decrease gray matter atrophy and ultimately provide protection against cognitive decline. Although we did not observe the preservation of volume in some of the smaller structures, it is likely that we would need a larger number of participants to demonstrate an effect in the smaller structures due to significant variability in the atrophy in these structures for the advanced participants who were included in the study. IRS-1 is an effector molecule of the insulin receptor. Various differentially phosphorylated forms of IRS-1 have been considered pathological markers of insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease28,29. This is an indirect finding and provides evidence suggestive of target engagement by liraglutide. Liraglutide treatment has been shown to ameliorate insulin resistance aberrations and decrease IRS-1 pS616 upregulation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease31. This warrants additional investigation of the therapeutic potential of liraglutide and GLP-1 agonists in Alzheimer's disease. This finding differs from a previous 26-week pilot study in which liraglutide prevented a decline in glucose metabolism compared to placebo10. There are several possibilities to explain this discrepancy. First, failure to observe any changes in cerebral glucose metabolism probably reflects key differences in methodology. The rationale for conducting the scans 3 days after the final dose was to minimize the potential for acute pharmacodynamic effects (giving a minimum of five half-lives of liraglutide)—particularly those that could transiently alter systemic glucose availability or uptake mechanisms unrelated to central neuronal activity. [18F] FDG uptake in the brain is largely insulin independent, especially in neurons, and is thought to reflect neuronal metabolic activity rather than peripheral insulin action32. Although liraglutide can influence peripheral glucose metabolism, the brain's glucose utilization, as measured by [18F] FDG PET, is relatively stable and less subject to short-term fluctuations in insulin sensitivity. A greater number of participants may be needed to demonstrate a group difference upon treatment cessation. Second, it is possible that the wider clinical range of Alzheimer's disease participants (MMSE scores 15−30) included in this trial may have diluted any [18F] FDG changes. Participants with MMSE scores lower than 18 have severe hypometabolism that is associated with advanced disease, which may be difficult to protect with liraglutide owing to the extent of neuronal damage. Third, the number of participants who completed the trial was less than that anticipated by our power calculation. Finally, levels of microglial activation may drive [18F] FDG signal alterations. It is also possible that as liraglutide has been shown to reduce microglial activation33, [18F] FDG signal discrepancies could also reflect that 52 weeks of treatment may also be attenuating the inflammatory response, resulting in a relative reduction in glucose metabolism in patients who received treatment. Liraglutide was well tolerated by the participants with Alzheimer's disease. Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most frequently reported in participants receiving liraglutide, an established class effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist compounds that declines over the course of treatment34. Once-daily injections can be a substantial burden for participants. An oral formulation of GLP-1 receptor agonist is available and regularly used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity, which would reduce this burden and benefit the level of treatment compliance in future studies, although our study did demonstrate that even daily injections in the context of a clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease are possible. Together, our study provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale evaluation of GLP-1 analogs in people living with Alzheimer's disease and provides an insight into the mechanism of action of GLP-1 analogs in neurodegenerative diseases. There is an unmet need to identify effective treatment strategies beyond targeting β-amyloid pathology. Although promising, novel anti-β-amyloid therapies provide only modest improvements to activities of daily living and cognitive benefits despite effectively reducing β-amyloid load. Alzheimer's pathogenesis is multifaceted, and here we indicate a cognitive benefit of a candidate that is evidenced to influence several pathological aspects of Alzheimer's disease beyond β-amyloid. This is a notable finding, demonstrating the ability of non-β-amyloid targets to provide cognitive benefit and neuroprotection and showing the importance of developing alternate treatments to accompany therapies such as lecanemab and, potentially, donanemab. To identify an effective treatment strategy, we indicate that a multitargeted approach is essential for the future of Alzheimer's therapy. With a well-established safety profile in patients with obesity and diabetes, we demonstrate that liraglutide is generally safe and well tolerated in this neurodegenerative population. Participants were diagnosed in specialized centers after detailed clinical and neurological examination, neuropsychometric evaluation and MRI scans. All participants had repeat MRI and [18F] FDG PET as a part of the study. Any patient whose MRI and [18F] FDG PET were not consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was excluded. Although β-amyloid PET, tau PET or translocator protein (TSPO) PET were outcome measures, owing to participants' burden due to the number of PET scans and that these scans were optional, participants did not proceed to have the optional β-amyloid PET, tau PET or TSPO PET, and we were unable to evaluate regional levels of β-amyloid, tau deposition and neuroinflammation. We collected blood samples of patients at baseline and follow-up; however, the plasma biomarkers have not been analyzed. As a result, we cannot provide complementary biomarker evidence to contextualize the observed metabolic findings. Future studies incorporating both β-amyloid biomarkers and genetic risk stratification (APOE genotype) will be important to fully understand treatment heterogeneity. Moreover, integrating blood-based and imaging-based biomarkers alongside genetic profiling will better elucidate mechanisms and treatment effects. A key limitation of this study was that attrition reduced the achieved sample size compared to that planned in the original power calculation. Although power calculations are prospective tools and are not typically reestimated post hoc, the reduced sample size likely lowered the probability of detecting small effects and limits replication confidence. In addition, no formal power calculation was performed for secondary or exploratory endpoints; analyses should, therefore, be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis generating. Nonetheless, the study successfully demonstrated feasibility, safety and some early biological signals. The ethnic composition of the population makes it challenging to assess whether findings are representative across different demographic groups and generalizable to the general public. In addition, important sources of heterogeneity, such as diet and medical history, were not described or modeled, limiting the ability to account for potential confounders that may influence treatment response. However, participantsʼ medical history that may influence cognitive function was not included in the study. We performed mean imputation that has limitations and may not fully preserve variability or multivariate relationships. Only four patients had missing data at baseline, which makes up 2% of the study population. Hence, mean imputation in the present study was applied only to baseline covariates. More sophisticated approaches, such as multiple imputation, would be preferable in larger confirmatory trials. The ELAD study showed no significant changes in cerebral glucose metabolism in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease syndrome, which was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures revealed that patients treated with liraglutide had a significantly slower decline in cognition (ADAS-Exec) and a slower reduction in MRI brain volume compared to the placebo arm, demonstrating a favorable response to liraglutide treatment. Liraglutide was well tolerated by patients with Alzheimer's disease syndrome. Between March 2014 and January 2021, we conducted a 12-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial in 24 sites across the UK. All PET and MRI scanning was performed at a single site at the Imperial College Clinical Imaging Facility, and other trial-related activities were performed at the individual sites. Eligible participants were aged 50 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease based on detailed clinical and neurological examination, neuropsychometric evaluation and MRI scans in the secondary or tertiary centers as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. Participants with Alzheimer's disease had an MMSE score of 15 or higher and a CDR Global score of 0.5, 1 or 2, calculated using the University of Washington online algorithm. A complete list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the supplementary files. This study was approved by the local and regional Regulatory Ethics Committees (National Research Ethics Committee-Riverside and Imperial College London/Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Joint Research Office) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Approval for the administration of radioactivity was given by the Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee. Written informed consent was provided by all participants before participation in the trial. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee and an Independent Trial Steering Committee met regularly during the trial to monitor the safety and conduct of the trial. Clinical data will be entered directly into computers via Inform. The data manager will arrange appropriate quality assurance checks. After each assessment, data will be entered in the study database. Participants will be identified by their unique patient identifier only. A total of 204 participants were randomized to receive the active drug or placebo with a 1:1 allocation ratio using stratified block randomization with a fixed block size of six. Randomization was performed by Mawdsley and Brooks. In animal models of Alzheimer's disease, a liraglutide dose of 0.25 mg kg−1 d−1 was used to test its efficacy, which translates to a human equivalent dose of 1.2−1.8 mg of liraglutide daily in a 60−90-kg human, as per the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conversion table 2005 (https://www.fda.gov/media/72309/download)35. In humans, liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg has been approved in several countries, including the European Union, Japan, Australia and the United States, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes under the trade name Victoza. In March 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved its use in obesity under the trade name Saxenda, at doses up to 3 mg. Pharmacokinetic data from the clinical development program for liraglutide demonstrated that it is absorbed slowly (tmax = 8–12 hours) and has a half-life of approximately 13 hours37. Although liraglutide's brain penetration is limited, pharmacokinetic and functional data demonstrate that sufficient concentrations of liraglutide reach the central nervous system (CNS) to activate GLP-1 receptors, including in cortical and hypothalamic neurons37. Preclinical (animal model) studies have demonstrated that liraglutide suppresses β-amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation and inflammation38,39. Thus, liraglutide does pharmacokinetically engage CNS targets at therapeutic doses. Liraglutide is suitable for once-daily subcutaneous injection given any time of the day, independent of meals. Investigation of liraglutide metabolism in vitro and in healthy participants has indicated that liraglutide is endogenously metabolized and that neither renal excretion nor hepatic extraction is a major route of clearance. The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide has been investigated in human participants with renal and hepatic impairment and has not raised any safety concerns. However, the therapeutic experience in participants with hepatic or renal impairment is limited. The effects of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide have been investigated, and it was concluded that all participants, regardless of age or gender, should be dosed in accordance with the usual proposed dose regimen for liraglutide36. Participants received once-daily injections of liraglutide or placebo. The study drug was administered as a daily subcutaneous injection, commencing with a dose of 0.6 mg once daily, and the dose was escalated to 1.8 mg within 4 weeks. Participants who did not tolerate 1.8 mg remained on 1.2 mg for an additional 2 weeks, and then two more attempts were made to increase the dose to 1.8 mg. If participants did not tolerate 1.2 mg, they were withdrawn from the study but were included in the safety reporting. After completion of the 52-week treatment period, participants were given the opportunity to participate in a 12-month open-label extension, in which they received liraglutide, the results of which are not reported here. There were no recorded treatment crossovers in this trial. The compliance was measured in two ways: the total drug prescribed to individuals, dispensed at visits and returned at visits (measured in mg), and the number of injections taken according to diaries and time on the trial (participants provided diary information at each visit). The mg prescribed compliance was calculated according to: The number of injections taken compliance was calculated according to: All patients had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on their clinical evaluation, neurological examination, neuropsychometric evaluation and MRI scans. All patients were provided with a detailed patient information sheet with adequate time to consider the study. Participants were then invited to the trial site, and written informed consent was obtained. All participants underwent a detailed screening test that involved reviewing the clinical history and diagnosis, collecting medical history and ensuring that the patient satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients had 17 visits in total during the 52-week study. After the screening, eligible participants underwent a baseline visit, as detailed in the supplementary materials. Participants were given liraglutide 1.8 mg per day or placebo. Safety visits were performed at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 and 56. rCMRGlc was estimated by creating parametric maps using spectral analysis with an arterial plasma input function as previously described40,41. We used a lumped constant of 0.48. Additionally, SUV was calculated using the following formula: \(\frac{\mathrm{Tracer}\,\mathrm{uptake}\,\mathrm{value}}{(\mathrm{Dose}\,\mathrm{of}\,\mathrm{radioactivity}\,\mathrm{injected}/\mathrm{Body}\,\mathrm{weight})}\). A region of interest analysis was undertaken for rCMRGlc and SUV images, and all individual images were co-registered to their corresponding MRIs. Object maps were created by multiplying the binarized MRI with the probabilistic atlas using SPM8 in MRI space to create individualized object maps of volumes of interest. Parametric maps were then sampled combining hippocampus, medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex using Analyze AVW. We assessed cerebral glucose metabolism in a composite region combining the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex from rCMRglc and SUV parametric images of [18F] FDG PET scans. The key secondary outcomes included a change from baseline to 12 months in z-scores for the ADAS-Exec (ADAS-Cog and the Executive domain scores from the NTB), the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically important changes in safety assessments over 12 months. CDR-SoB and ADCS-ADL were also secondary outcome measures. MRI changes in the volume of the ventricles and a composite region (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) from baseline to 52 weeks were assessed in a predefined secondary analysis. Participants' T1 MRI volumetric scans at baseline and 52 weeks were processed using FreeSurfer software 7.4.1 (ref. Predefined exploratory analysis was performed for temporal lobe, ventricles and isthmus cingulate. As GLP-1 analogs can have global effects, we performed additional analyses for whole gray matter, frontoparietal and occipital lobe volumes. (Image processing of [18F] FDG PET imaging and MRI scans are detailed in the supplementary materials.) VBM analysis was performed as an exploratory analysis of brain macrostructure at a regional and voxel-wise level. Safety and tolerability were assessed based on all reported adverse events and serious adverse events. Clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, laboratory evaluations, ECG recordings and physical examinations were recorded as adverse events on the relevant medical/psychiatry history. Key secondary outcomes included the change from baseline to 52 weeks in z-scores for the ADAS-Exec, CDR SoB and ADCS-ADL. The ADAS-Cog has been employed as a cognitive efficacy measure in most Alzheimer's disease clinical drug trials. However, its use has been criticized on the grounds that it does not index all the functions known to be compromised early on in Alzheimer's disease, and, because measurement is variable, studies require many study participants. However, it is not clear that they have successfully remedied the identified issues. Alternative instruments, such as the NTB44, have been validated and accepted for use. To remedy these issues, we combined the standard 13-item ADAS-Cog with the executive function components of the NTB (namely, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Category Fluency Test (CFT), Wechsler Digit Span (WDS) and Trail Making Test (TMT)). Performance on the ADAS-Exec is summarized as a composite to which each measure contributes equally via z-score transformation. Support for the utility of this approach was previously provided by applying this methodology to the data from proof-of-concept trials of PBT2 (refs. The total scores for ADAS-Exec were calculated for each test all in the same direction (higher score means better performance). Total of correctly named items (maximum 17) Total number of correct responses (capped at 12) Difference between the number of correct targets crossed off and the number of incorrect targets crossed off Total acceptable named words regardless if missing score for one letter The screening and baseline total scores were averaged and used as a single baseline assessment. Where only one screening or baseline score was available, this value was used as the baseline. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each total score at baseline. The average z-score for each participant was calculated. The z-scores were estimated for participants with at least one NTB subtest and at least two-thirds (9/14) of the ADAS-Cog subtests completed. Patients were keen to undergo minimal PET imaging; therefore, tau and TSPO PET were not completed as part of this study, and cerebrospinal fluid data were also not collected. Genotyping and plasma markers have not yet been analyzed and are not reported in the paper. Landau et al.47 used the [18F] FDG PET imaging biomarker to monitor the progression of Alzheimer's disease. At and after 12 months, they found a mean change in the [18F] FDG region of interest of −0.055, with an s.d. Assuming that the treatment reduces the mean change of [18F]FDG SUV in the participants with Alzheimer's disease to −0.025 (44% effect size), 82 participants would be required per group to provide 80% power at a 5% significance level. Allowing for a dropout of 15% over the study period, the trial required 103 participants per group (206 in total). A significance level of 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance for the primary outcome, key secondary outcomes and other secondary outcomes. A predefined significance level of 0.01 was used to declare statistical significance for any exploratory analyses. In this study, only the primary endpoint was designated for confirmatory testing and subjected to the predefined type I error control. All secondary and exploratory endpoints were analyzed to generate hypotheses for future trials. The primary analysis was intention to treat and involved all patients who were randomly assigned. An analysis of covariance was undertaken for the primary outcome of participants who completed the baseline and follow-up scans, with rCMRglc as the response variable and adjusting for stratification factors (age and MMSE) and baseline values of rCMRglc. No missing data were imputed for the outcome data, and any missing baseline data were imputed as the mean of the participants with this measurement48 (irrespective of treatment). We calculated the adjusted mean difference in change in rCMRglc in the composite cortical region between randomized groups at 12 months with 95% confidence interval and associated two-sided P value. The primary outcome was analyzed using two methods: SUV and spectral analysis. We had 101 participants for the analysis using spectral analysis with arterial plasma input, whereas the less invasive SUV method had 154 participants with baseline and 52-week analyzable scans. A multilevel mixed-effects model was used to interrogate the repeated key secondary outcome measures at 24 weeks and 52 weeks. The model allowed for an interaction between treatment and time as a categorical variable and was adjusted for the randomization factors and baseline values of the outcome. An analysis of covariance as described for the primary outcome (without imputation) was used for the MRI volumetric secondary and exploratory outcomes. A change in volume from baseline to 52 weeks was analyzed as part of an exploratory analysis. Safety and tolerability assessments included the monitoring and recording of all adverse events and serious adverse events as well as the regular monitoring of vital signs. Clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, laboratory evaluations, ECG recordings and physical examinations were recorded as adverse events and followed-up as appropriate. All analysis was conducted using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC). During the design and conduct phase of this study, participants from the Alzheimer's Society (patient representative groups) reviewed the study proposal and all study-related materials. They considered this study highly important and strongly supported it. Their input was incorporated into the study protocol, patient information sheet and other study-related materials. Throughout the study, the Patient and Public Involvement group met regularly and provided advice on improving recruitment and on other challenges met during the study.

Nature Sensors (2025)Cite this article There is an inherent trade-off between the design of comfortable wearable sensors and the need for high-resolution and large-area sensing. Here we address this challenge by introducing a generative electromyography (EMG) network (GenENet), a self-supervised generative representation learning framework combined with a wearable sensor that extrapolates limited sensor inputs to reconstruct muscle activity in unseen regions not covered by the sensor. This approach allows for gathering information equivalent to those from high-density EMG sensor networks, but using a more compact, wearable device with much reduced sensor counts, without sacrificing performance. For example, a 6-channel EMG device trained on a 32-channel dataset from low-impedance polymer electrodes shows similar performance to a 32-channel device in accuracy for predicting sign language and gait dynamics, highlighting the utility of the GenENet concept to reduce wearable-sensing-system complexity while maintaining prediction quality. Such electrophysiological data are essential for many applications, including motion detection and control, but traditionally require high-density, high-resolution sensors that can be cumbersome. This concept should be applicable to other types of electrophysiological mapping application across health monitoring, prosthetics, sports and human–machine interfaces, paving the way for more comfortable and efficient wearable devices.

Stephen Goff is the Higgins Professor of Biochemistry at Columbia University in New York City.

We now know this enzyme as reverse transcriptase and the viruses as retroviruses, reflecting the backward flow of genetic information in this type of virus. It clarified how an RNA virus could generate a genomic copy of itself that could persist in the infected cell and be inherited by daughter cells. It also revealed how, much later, cells could produce further copies of the viral RNA. He graduated with a chemistry degree at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, in 1960. After a postdoc at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California, he returned to MIT in 1968 to establish his own group, where he made his first seminal discovery.

Chinese president Xi Jinping speaking at the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea.Credit: Yonhap via AP/Alamy Although a patchwork of national and regional regulations exists, for many countries binding rules are still being fleshed out. When it comes to transparency and AI policy, “China is the good guy at the moment,” Wendy Hall, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton, UK, told reporters at an event in London in October. Many hurdles lie in the way to creating a binding intergovernmental agreement on AI, but some advocates say it is possible, comparing the technology to other risky but useful endeavours for which agreements exist, such as nuclear power and aviation. Nature looks at China's approach, what a global AI governance body might look like and its chance of success. Encouraged by the government, Chinese firms tend to release models as open weight, meaning that they can be downloaded and built on. And compared with Western nations, China has less of a focus on making machines that could outsmart humans — often referred to as artificial general intelligence — and is instead concentrating on a race to use AI to drive economic growth. China was among the first nations to introduce AI-specific regulations, beginning in 2022, and has wide-ranging rules on harmful content, privacy and data security, for example. Despite this, the authorities often take a soft approach to enforcing that regulation, says Angela Zhang, a law researcher and specialist in AI regulation at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. By contrast, the United States has no comprehensive legislation on AI at the federal level, and in January President Donald Trump revoked an executive order aimed at ensuring AI safety. The European Union approach has been to classify AI systems by risk level, with different rules relating to transparency and oversight at each tier, and obligations that came into force in August, aimed at the most powerful AI systems. The treaty commits any signatory country to implementing its broad obligations — such as ensuring that AI activities align with human rights — through their national laws. But there are no sanctions or a supranational enforcement body, says Lucia Velasco, an economist and researcher at the Oxford Martin School's AI Governance Initiative, who is based in New York. WAICO would be a way for countries to coordinate AI governance rules while “fully respecting the differences in national policies and practices” and championing the global south, Chinese officials have said. China has proposed that the body's headquarters be in Shanghai, but other details remain uncertain. WAICO looks unlikely to govern AI directly in any enforceable way (and China has said it backs a UN approach to governing global AI) but it could be a route for countries to gradually coalesce around a framework. Standards set by the UN agency are non-binding but are complemented by legally binding treaties it helped to forge, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety.
