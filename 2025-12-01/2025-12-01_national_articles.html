                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Meeting on Venezuela: ﻿The White House confirmed President Donald Trump will hold a meeting today with his national security team to discuss Venezuela as his administration intensifies its pressure campaign on the country. • Concerns over boat strikes: The White House defended an admiral who it said ordered a follow-up strike that killed survivors on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, saying he was acting  “well within his authority.” Lawmakers from both parties have voiced concerns over the second strike's legality. • US officials head to Russia: Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and special envoy Steve Witkoff are traveling to Moscow on Monday, a White House official and a US official told CNN, following high-level US-Ukraine talks this weekend. Witkoff is due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. • Asylum decision pause: Trump said the pause on all decisions on asylum applications has “no time limit” amid his escalating anti-immigration crackdown after last week's shooting of National Guard members. “The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Leavitt did not specify which members of Congress the secretary spoke to. “There have also been 13 bipartisan briefings to Congress on the Venezuelan strikes. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday defended President Donald Trump's promised pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, arguing that his US drug-trafficking conviction was a result of Biden-era “over-prosecution.” Trump “was opposed to the values of the previous administration, and they charged him because he was president of Honduras,” she said, adding that the president decided to pardon Hernández after hearing concerns raised by his supporters. “President Trump has been quite clear in his defense of the United States homeland, to stop these illegal narcotics from coming to our borders, whether that's by land or by sea,” Leavitt said. Hernández is serving a 45-year federal prison sentence for drug-trafficking offenses. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Bradley, who she said was “well within his authority” to order the second strike, which CNN has reported killed the remaining crew on board. “On September 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. She added that President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war.” Pressed on the legal justification for the strike, Leavitt said it was “conducted in self-defense to protect Americans” and was carried out “in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.” Trump told reporters Sunday evening that he personally would not have wanted a second strike and seemed to cast doubt on the idea Hegseth had ordered it. 1, I don't know that that happened, and Pete said he did not want them — he didn't even know what people were talking about,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “So, we'll look into it, but no, I wouldn't have wanted that, not a second strike.” President Donald Trump on Tuesday will host his ninth Cabinet meeting since taking office, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today. Following the Cabinet meeting, the president will make an Oval Office announcement on his plan to create “Trump accounts” for families with young children. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN that Democrats are still discussing what exactly to include in a bill to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, after Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised them a vote on the issue this month in exchange for reopening the government. Schumer would not confirm whether they are going to push for a clean, two-year extension, which is highly unlikely to pass the Senate. “I've talked to every member of my caucus over the weekend. “In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” Leavitt said. President Donald Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office, and Trump invited Netanyahu to a meeting at the White House “in the near future.” An Israeli source briefed on the content of the call said Trump and Netanyahu discussed “regional issues,” focusing on recent developments in Gaza, but also touching upon Syria, Lebanon and Iran. Netanyahu formally requested a pardon from Israeli President Isaac Herzog in his long-running corruption trial on Sunday, following up on a November letter from Trump, who sent Herzog a letter requesting his pardon. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Remember: Under the original US proposal released last month, Ukraine would have to give up parts of the Donetsk region that have been illegally annexed but not occupied by Russia. Zelensky said money and reconstruction, “without the presence of European partners, are not easy to accept, because the money is in Europe.” The original version of the US plan proposed that $100 billion in frozen Russian assets, most of which are held in Europe, would be used to rebuild Ukraine. “We are working to ensure that there will be no third Russian invasion and that there will be no breach of the agreements on ending the war,” Zelensky said, adding that he hoped to hold talks with US President Donald Trump after the visit to Russia of Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. It noted it is the only country to secure a 0% rate, “protecting UK-based manufacturing and cementing our place as a world leader for life sciences investment,” according to a statement from the British government. CNN had previously reported that Witkoff was set to travel to Moscow Monday, a day after he, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met a high-level Ukrainian delegation in Florida. Rubio said after that meeting that progress had been made toward ending the war between Russia and Ukraine but there was more work to be done. Witkoff was expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Donald Trump is expected to hold a meeting at the White House later today about next steps on Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Catch up below on where things stand between both countries: • US military buildup: The meeting, which is expected to take place at 5 p.m. • Broad directive to avoid Venezuelan airspace: Over the weekend, the president issued a broad directive on social media, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace. He told reporters Sunday, however, not to read into the announcement. • Call with Maduro: Trump also confirmed he had spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the phone, but didn't address what was discussed. The administration last week formally designated Maduro and allies of his government as members of a foreign terrorist organization, a move officials argue will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela. CNN reported last week citing sources familiar with the matter that the US carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle voiced serious concerns over the strike with some suggesting it could be a “war crime.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that he has spoken with the leaders of the UK and France along with US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff – ahead of Witkoff's meetings in Moscow. “Together with French President @EmmanuelMacron and with the participation of UK Prime Minister @Keir_Starmer, we just spoke with the head of Ukrainian delegation Rustem Umerov and US President's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff following the Ukraine-U.S. delegations' meeting in Florida,” Zelensky said on X Monday. “It was an important briefing, and we agreed to discuss more details in person,” he added. Witkoff is due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Ordering a second strike to kill survivors on an alleged drug boat would be a “stone-cold war crime,” Sen. Angus King of Maine told CNN on Monday, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers continues to raise questions about how the Defense Department is carrying out its operations in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean. “The law is clear,” King, an independent, told CNN's Kate Bolduan. Some more context: Sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN that the military carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. The meeting, which is expected to take place at 5 p.m. Over the weekend, Trump also issued a broad directive on social media, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace. President Donald Trump expressed optimism after the high-level meeting, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio said “progress was made.” Meanwhile, Trump said he had a phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro amid his pressure campaign against the country, which the administration says is aimed at disrupting illegal drug flows. At home, Trump is escalating his anti-immigration crackdown after the suspect in last week's shooting of National Guard members was identified as an Afghan national. He said a pause on all asylum decisions announced in the shooting's aftermath could be indefinite.</p>

Nearly two weeks after a decorated Virginia high school coach mysteriously disappeared amid a child pornography investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service has announced it is offering a reward of up to $5,000 for any information leading to his arrest. Federal authorities are warning Travis L. Turner, 46, "may be armed" while urging anyone who may come in contact with him to exercise caution after he was last seen walking into a wooded area behind his Appalachia home while carrying a firearm on Nov. 20, according to the U.S. Last week, authorities obtained 10 warrants to charge Turner with five counts of possession of child pornography and five counts of using a computer to solicit a minor. Turner was first reported missing as officers with the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation's Wytheville Field Office were en route to his Appalachia home to speak with him about the investigation on Nov. 21, according to authorities. Officials had visited Turner's home one-day prior, and were returning only to speak with him and not make any arrests, police said. Travis Turner was leading the Union High School football team through an undefeated season when he disappeared from his family's home in Appalachia, Virginia on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025. Marshals Service," VSP spokesperson Robin Lawson said in statement to Fox News Digital. Turner was last seen walking into a "heavily wooded and mountainous area" on Nov. 20, Adrian Collins, an attorney for the coach's family, said in a statement obtained by WCYB. "The last known contact the family had with Travis occurred on or about Thursday, Nov. 20, after he left his residence to walk in the woods with a firearm," the statement reads, clarifying that no warrants for his arrest had been made prior to his disappearance. When Turner failed to return home later that evening, his wife reportedly notified local law enforcement of her husband's disappearance. Virginia State Police have launched a search for Union High football coach Travis Turner, whose disappearance has stunned the Big Stone Gap community. In addition to authorities using K-9 units, drones and foot patrols to locate Turner, his family has reportedly launched their own search for the missing coach and are fully cooperating with authorities, according to the attorney's statement. She previously used the accounts to celebrate the decorated football coach's undefeated season – along with sharing photos of family and friends, along with countless images of her children on the sports fields. Authorities announced that they have obtained 10 warrants to charge Travis Turner with five counts of possession of child pornography and five counts of using a computer to solicit a minor. Turner is employed as a football coach at Union High School in Wise County, Virginia. The deletion follows Turner's staff profile page being removed from Union High School's website shortly after the investigation was announced, ABC 7 reported. In a previous statement, a spokesperson for Wise County Public Schools confirmed that a staff member employed by the district had been placed on administrative leave pending review of an external allegation. Days later, the district released an updated statement to acknowledge that charges have since been filed against the staff member in question, but failed to identify Turner by name. "The individual remains on leave and is not permitted on school property or to have contact with students," Superintendent Mike Goforth said. "The division will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as this process moves forward. Because this is an active legal matter involving personnel, the division cannot comment further." Turner's family attorney, the VSP and USMS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Turner was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt, sweatpants and glasses, according to Virginia's missing person database.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Jurors hear opening statements in the murder trial of Brian Walshe, who has been charged with killing his wife in 2023. The murder trial of a convicted Massachusetts fraudster accused of killing his wife after learning of an affair kicked off Monday, with prosecutors delivering an opening statement that began shortly before 10 a.m. In a surprise move during jury selection last month, Brian Walshe, 50, pleaded guilty to lesser charges of misleading a police investigation and improper conveyance of a human body. He is still facing a first-degree murder charge that could land him in prison for life with no chance of parole if convicted. He is accused of killing and dismembering his 39-year-old wife, Ana Walshe, whose remains have not been found. Walshe is facing charges for killing his wife Ana. Defense attorney Larry Tipton told jurors in his opening statement that Walshe "nudged" his wife in bed and discovered she was dead. "Now he was panicking and he doesn't understand what has happened and what is happening," Tipton said. "It didn't make any sense to him. It didn't make sense that somebody he had just been with, and enjoyed New Year's Eve with into New Year's Day, would suddenly be dead." He denied the prosecution's allegation that his client was aware of Ana's suspected affair with a friend from Washington, D.C., where she commuted to work. "Brian Walshe is not a killer," he concluded. Brian and Ana Walshe pose for a shot in Boston Public Gardens, Boston, Massachusetts on their wedding day on Monday, Dec. 21, 2015. She was reported missing days later by her boss. Prosecutors have laid out two potential motives in the case. The first is that Walshe allegedly discovered an affair between his wife and another man, whose name he is accused of searching on Google six times. The second is that he allegedly believed being the sole caretaker of their children would help him avoid prison in connection with a federal art fraud case. And he was the beneficiary of her $2.7 million life insurance policy. William Fastow leaves an open house in the Spring Valley area of Washington, D.C., on Saturday, Nov. 29, 2025. Fastow was a friend of the late realtor, Ana Walshe, and the two were allegedly involved in an affair before her death. Investigators say they found digital evidence showing Walshe allegedly searched Google more than a dozen times for instructions on how to dispose of human remains. The trial before a jury of nine women and seven men is expected to last two to four weeks. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Jan. 31, 2020. CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The federal antitrust trial against NASCAR opened Monday with the star power of Michael Jordan on hand as a jury of nine was seated to hear allegations that the stock car series is a monopolistic bully that leaves its teams no option but to comply with rules and financing they don't agree with. Six men and three women were seated for a trial expected to last two weeks before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell, who asked for opening statements to be completed later Monday. Jordan's presence in the courtroom gallery near fellow co-owner and NASCAR star driver Denny Hamlin was a factor: Among those dismissed from serving on the jury was a man who said he can't be impartial because “I like Mike” and another who said he had Michael Jordan posters on his walls growing up. A third dismissed juror pointed and winked at Jordan as he left the courtroom while a juror said they were a North Carolina fan but noted the football team at Jordan's alma mater “aren't doing too well right now” to which the retired star shook his head and laughed. NASCAR executives in the courtroom included chairman Jim France and vice chair Lisa France Kennedy, two scions of the family that founded NASCAR in 1948 and still owns it. 23XI and Front Row were the only two teams out of 15 to refuse to sign extensions on new charter agreements last fall. The case has churned through hearings and arguments for more than a year despite calls from other NASCAR teams to settle. Bell even helped mediate a failed two-day summit in October. A NASCAR victory would likely put 23XI, Front Row and their six combined cars out of business. Their charters — now being held by NASCAR — would likely be sold. The last charter went for $45 million, and NASCAR has indicated there is interest from potential buyers including private equity firms. A win for the teams would lead to monetary damages and the potential demolition of NASCAR as it is run today. All 15 teams had been fighting for more favorable terms in the charter agreements over more than two years of negotiations, and the final terms fell short of what they wanted. “Our fans have been brainwashed with (NASCAR's) talking points for decades,” Hamlin wrote on social media. Being chartered guarantees that car a spot in the 40-car field for all 38 races, as well as a defined payout from the weekly purse. The teams wanted the charters to become permanent (they are renewable and revocable), a larger percentage of revenues and a voice in governance. NASCAR has also cited the option for cars to enter races as “open teams” and try to make the field in one of four nonchartered spots on qualifying speed. 23XI and Front Row have been open teams, and while their combined six cars made every race, it cost both organizations millions of dollars in purse money. The pretrial discovery process revealed NASCAR made more than $100 million in 2024. Phelps was among leadership who in a discussion with other NASCAR executives called Hall of Fame team owner Richard Childress a “dinosaur,” an “idiot” and a “stupid redneck.” The discussion also included a reference that Childress “owes his entire fortune to NASCAR” and needed “to be taken out back and flogged.” Another NASCAR executive alleged that fans of the sport can't read, and multiple series leaders admonished Hall of Fame driver Tony Stewart's summer short-track series, SRX, and threatened to have it the killed because NASCAR drivers were participating. On the other side, the president of 23XI was found to have said France had to die in order to receive favorable charter terms, Hamlin admitted his dislike for the France family, one of Jordan's advisers said Hamlin wasn't a good businessman and Jordan joked that he loses more money in a casino than he pays one of his drivers.</p>

President Donald Trump speaks during a swearing-in for Alina Habba as interim US Attorney General for New Jersey, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, March 28, 2025. PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified from serving as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor despite his administration's maneuvers to keep her in the role, an appeals court said Monday. Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in Philadelphia sided with a lower-court judge's ruling after hearing oral arguments at which Habba was present on Oct. 20. “It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place. It concluded: “We will affirm the District Court's disqualification order.” The ruling comes amid the push by Trump's Republican administration to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a powerful post charged with enforcing federal criminal and civil law. It also comes after the judges questioned the government's moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation. Habba said after that hearing in a statement posted to X that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied a chance for a Senate hearing. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, Habba's personal staffer and the Justice Department. “We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Habba is hardly the only Trump administration prosecutor whose appointment has been challenged by defense lawyers. Last week, a federal judge dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after concluding that the hastily installed prosecutor who filed the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed to the position of interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The judges on the panel were two appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, D. Brooks Smith and D. Michael Fisher, as well as one named by Democratic President Barack Obama, Luis Felipe Restrepo. A lower-court judge, Matthew Brann, said in August that Habba's appointment was done with a “novel series of legal and personnel moves” and that she was unlawfully serving as U.S attorney for New Jersey. That order said Habba's actions since July could be invalidated, but the judge stayed the order pending appeal. A similar dynamic is playing out in Nevada, where a federal judge disqualified the Trump administration's pick to be U.S. attorney there. The Habba case comes after several people charged with federal crimes in New Jersey challenged the legality of her tenure. They sought to block the charges, arguing she didn't have the authority to prosecute their cases after her 120-day term as interim U.S. attorney expired. Shortly after her appointment, she said in an interview that she hoped to help “turn New Jersey red,” a rare overt political expression from a prosecutor. She then brought a trespassing charge, eventually dropped, against Democratic Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka stemming from his visit to a federal immigration detention center. Habba later charged Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assault stemming from the same incident, a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress other than for corruption. McIver denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. Questions about whether Habba would continue in the job arose in July when her temporary appointment was ending and it became clear New Jersey's two Democratic U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, would not back her appointment. Earlier this year as Habba's appointment was expiring, federal judges in New Jersey exercised their power under the law to replace her with a career prosecutor who had served as her second-in-command. Brann's ruling said the president's appointments are still subject to the time limits and power-sharing rules laid out in federal law.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court ruled Monday that Alina Habba unlawfully served as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, adding fresh legal turmoil to President Donald Trump's efforts to keep loyalists installed in U.S. attorney positions after two high-profile cases fell apart last week over similar appointment problems. The new setback in New Jersey underscores how Trump's broader strategy to bypass Senate confirmation in blue states is starting to buckle under judicial scrutiny. The panel, composed of two George W. Bush appointees and one Obama appointee, appeared skeptical of Justice Department lawyer Henry Whitaker's claim that Bondi had authority to fill the vacancy after Trump fired the court-appointed successor. Whitaker insisted the administration was relying on “overlapping mechanisms” provided by Congress and that the DOJ had been “scrupulously careful” to follow them. One judge rejected that narrative, saying the sequence of events that led to Habba's appointment looked like “a complete circumvention” of the Constitution's appointments clause. Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell, who also defended James in her criminal case, represented the two sets of routine defendants who challenged Habba's authority, arguing she could not prosecute them because she was never lawfully in office. Habba's case has been the most advanced test of Trump's approach to U.S. attorney appointments, but similar challenges are now overtaking other key prosecutions. Habba had no path to Senate confirmation, as New Jersey's Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, refused to return blue slips. The blue slip custom, reaffirmed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), effectively gives home-state senators veto power over U.S. attorney nominations. Trump has intensified his criticism of the practice, recently firing former U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert after Siebert received Democratic support and amid reporting that he was unwilling to bring criminal cases against Comey and James.</p>

Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports from Manhattan criminal court as defendant Luigi Mangione seeks to block backpack evidence and police statements in the murder trial of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Accused assassin Luigi Mangione returned to court Monday for the first of three hearings in which his lawyers will ask the court to toss evidence in the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The 27-year-old Ivy League alumnus is accused of stalking Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, before allegedly shooting him from behind outside a Manhattan hotel. Thompson, who lived in Minnesota, was expected to attend a shareholder conference later that morning. Mangione's lawyers are asking the court to suppress evidence collected during his arrest at a Pennsylvania McDonald's five days after the murder. The evidence includes physical evidence from a backpack, including the suspected murder weapon and his journals, as well as statements he made to police before they read him a Miranda warning. Chris McLaughlin, a member of the Deputy Commissioner for Public Information's office, which is responsible for communications between police and the media. Prosecutors asked McLaughlin about a series of surveillance photos and videos taken in the lead-up to the shooting and its immediate aftermath, including the image of a then-unidentified person of interest smiling at a woman at a Manhattan hostel, which led to Mangione's arrest when witnesses saw him in Altoona and called police. The next witness is Bernad Pyles, who works at ADI Global Distribution, a security camera company that installed the surveillance system at the Altoona McDonald's where police arrested Mangione. During Pyles' testimony, a monitor showed previously unseen surveillance video from the fast food restaurant, before, during and after his arrest. The third witness is Emily States, who works for the Blair County Department of Emergency Services. The hearings are expected to run for several days, with a break on Wednesday. Luigi Mangione allegedly killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. There are three different types of suppression hearings — Mapp, Huntley and Mosley. Two of them are expected this week: a Mapp hearing, to determine whether certain types of physical evidence should be suppressed or thrown out, and a Huntley hearing, to determine if a confession or other statements to law enforcement are admissible. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has not yet finalized its trial strategy, and a Mosley hearing, which determines if non-eyewitnesses can testify at trial, is not expected yet. Mangione faces a slew of charges in New York, Pennsylvania and federally. A screenshot from surveillance footage released by the NYPD shows a person of interest, later identified as Luigi Mangione, in connection with the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan on Dec. 4, 2024. State-level terror charges were thrown out earlier this year, but Mangione still faces second-degree murder, seven counts of criminal possession of a weapon, and possession of a forged ID in New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court on Monday found Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, is serving unlawfully as US attorney for New Jersey, dealing a legal blow to the Trump administration that could have far-reaching consequences on other appointments across the country. A panel of three appellate judges with 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's finding that the administration violated the law when it used of a series of maneuvers to install Habba in the position after failing to win Senate support. “This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional (appointment and Senate confirmation) process entirely.” The ruling could impact what happens in several key jurisdictions where the Trump administration doesn't have Senate-confirmed US attorneys, including the Los Angeles and Las Vegas areas. Last week, a district court threw out two indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after finding Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was serving unlawfully. While the 3rd Circuit's decisions cover New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin Islands, appeals court cases are often given deference in other parts of the country especially when they are dealing with novel legal issues. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. “The panel issued a clear and carefully reasoned decision that recognizes the extraordinary power vested in US attorneys and reinforces the limits Congress has set on who may occupy those positions,” said Thomas Mirigliano. From White House adviser to Trump's handpicked prosecutor: 63 days with Lindsey Halligan In the districts where US attorneys were found to be serving unlawfully, criminal cases have mostly continued, although some judges have postponed trials or sentencings. To date, except in the cases involving Halligan, judges have not dismissed indictments of the defendants who brought – and won – the challenges because they found other prosecutors were involved. Trump's lawyers appealed the ruling by Judge Matthew Brann, saying he erred when he found that Habba is not serving legally because she was not the first assistant US attorney when the US attorney vacancy arose. Trump named Habba interim US attorney for New Jersey earlier this year. As the 120-day clock for interim appointments was set to expire, and it was clear the district court judges were not going to name her US attorney, Habba resigned. The three-judge panel was made up of two appointees of former President George W. Bush – Judges Michael Fisher, D. Brooks Smith – and former President Barack Obama-appointee Felipe Restrepo.

Aftyn Behn, D-Nashville, attends a campaign event during the special election for the seventh district, Nov. 13, 2025, Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Less than a month after Democrats scored a string of victories over Republicans in the Nov. 4 general election, the next test at the ballot box for both parties heading into the 2026 midterm season will be Tuesday in a Tennessee special congressional election on usually reliable GOP turf. House Republicans look to hold the seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District and pad their narrow 219-213 advantage in the chamber. Democrats hope to extend their winning streak by pulling off an upset in this Middle Tennessee district, where Donald Trump and other GOP candidates routinely win with around 60% of the vote. Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July to join the private sector. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who headed the Tennessee Department of General Services under Republican Gov. With endorsements from both Trump and Green, he easily won the October special primary against 10 opponents. She narrowly won a four-way Democratic primary that featured two other state representatives and a well-funded local businessman. A former political organizer and progressive activist, Behn was described by some state Democrats as “our very own AOC of TN,” a reference to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Trump phoned into a tele-rally for Van Epps on Nov. 13 just as early voting began. His 2024 presidential election rival, Democratic then-Vice President Kamala Harris, appeared at a Nov. 18 event in Nashville to encourage Democratic turnout in the special election. Going into the October primary, Van Epps had spent more than $348,000 and had about $54,000 in the bank. Behn spent more than $168,000 ahead of her primary and had about $20,000 in the bank. As of mid-November, according to the pre-election Federal Election Commission filings, Van Epps had raised an additional $590,000, compared with about $1 million for Behn. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years. The district also includes parts of heavily Democratic Davidson County, which is home to Nashville. The Nashville area once anchored a separate congressional district favorable to Democrats, but state Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 and divided Davidson County among the 7th and two neighboring Republican-friendly districts. Trump carried the 7th District in 2024 with about 60% of the vote, compared with about 38% for Harris. Green was elected twice each under the old and new district boundaries. His margin of victory narrowed after new lines were drawn in 2022 — he won with 60% of the vote in 2022 and 2024. An additional vacant seat in a heavily Democratic Houston-area district in Texas will be filled in a runoff election on Jan. 31, 2026, while a recently vacated seat in northern New Jersey held by Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will be filled next April. The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it's determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. Here's a look at what to expect on Tuesday: The special election in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District will be held Tuesday. Polls in the district close at 7 p.m. local time, which is 8 p.m. Although Tennessee is in two time zones, the 7th District falls entirely within the Central time zone. Among the 14 counties located either entirely or partly within the 7th District, about 73% of 2024 general election ballots were cast early in person or by absentee. About 51% of the vote in these 14 counties were cast early or by absentee in the 2022 midterms. As of Nov. 26, the last day of early voting, just over 84,000 ballots had been cast before the special election. ET from Perry County, about five minutes after polls closed. The vote count was completed in both contests at 10:28 p.m. ET with the final vote update from Humphreys County. ET, with more than 99% of total votes counted. As of Tuesday, there will be 336 days until the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no love lost between hip-hop moguls 50 Cent and Sean “Diddy” Combs. 50 Cent has long trolled Diddy on social media, especially after CNN's publication of surveillance video showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in 2016. Now the rapper turned actor and producer has taken it up a notch with his latest project, a Netflix docuseries about Combs. 50 Cent, born Curtis Jackson, is a producer on the four-part series “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” which drops Tuesday. “Being a woman in the industry, and going through the #MeToo movement — watching giants in music and film go on trial, and to know what their outcomes were … When Cassie dropped her lawsuit, I just thought this could go a million different directions,” Stapleton said. “I wondered how she had the confidence to go out there against a mogul like Sean Combs. Combs has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing. That hasn't stopped 50 Cent from trolling him on social media since the allegations went public. Here's a look back at how there came to be animosity between the two men. In 2006, 50 Cent released a diss track “The Bomb,” which featured sounds of gunfire and his allegation that Combs knew the identity of the killer of Christopher Wallace, a rapper known as The Notorious B.I.G., who was both a protégée and best friend to Combs. No one has ever been charged with the murder. In his diss track, 50 raps, “I guess this means I won't be invited to the white parties in the Hamptons,” referencing Combs' famous soirees held in the upscale New York community. 50 Cent has also said he believes Combs is connected to the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur. Combs called such allegations “nonsense” in a 2016 interview with the syndicated radio show “The Breakfast Club.” He has never been charged in connection to either case. Followers of 50 are familiar with his reputation for sharp comments and social media trolling. Some believed it was mostly marketing, especially given the men's parallel career tracks and even competing vodkas at one point, Effen Vodka from 50 Cent and Ciroc, which formally partnered with Combs. Combs was asked about the tension between him and 50 Cent during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club” in 2018. “I don't have no beef with Fif. “Y'all can't see that he loves me? “When he does that it's like funny to me,” Combs said. We don't have to never cross paths, and I will never say nothing negative about him, you know, because that's just not me.” In May 2024 he released a song titled “Pick a Side” in support of his father and taking aim at critics like 50 Cent. The younger Combs and his brother, Justin, were temporarily handcuffed and detained by authorities during the March 2024 search of their father's home. Aaron Dyer, Diddy's attorney, said in a statement to CNN at the time that “there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs' residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.” “All that gossip sh*t is whack when all they had was 50 Cent / Who put this city on the map? 50 Cent responded with a tongue-in-cheek post on social media. “I feel so threatened by the things Christian is saying on his record,” he wrote in a since-delated post on Instagram, according to Billboard. “I'm afraid for my life, please don't hurt me guys.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A leading consumer product group on Monday is kicking off a campaign promoting transparency in processed food labeling and pushing back on unrealistic claims that the only good meal is one Americans grow, butcher, and bake from scratch. With a new ad and educational drive, the Consumer Brands Association is joining the MAHA movement's push for transparency while rebutting food purists targeting processed foods. Grow your own,” says a woman in the new 30-second television and digital ad while surrounded by clucking chickens. In the next scene, four boys appear shocked when their mother, holding one of the live birds, asks them, “Sure, it takes a little extra work, but look how fresh it is. “Growing food is great, but sometimes you just need convenient, nutritious, and affordable. Expectations about food are high, so we're offering more transparency, choices, and detailed product information so you'll always have confidence about what's on the table,” concluded the new ad. “The makers of America's favorite household brands have long been committed to transparency and empowering consumers to make informed purchasing decisions about the products they rely on. But we also know consumers expect more information today about what's in their products,” said Melissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the trade group. While it is kicking off the first-ever National Consumer Transparency Week on Monday, the industry has been on a transparency kick for a while through its SmartLabel and Facts up Front campaigns and its “food processing facts” website. It has also tackled food “influencers” who have been attacking processed offerings. In one recent blog post, for example, the group said that Americans who might choose a frozen pizza for dinner shouldn't be demonized by food purists.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal prosecutors accused Hernandez in 2019, during Trump's first term, of using drug money to fund his 2013 presidential bid. The Biden administration extradited him to face trial in 2022 after he left office. When asked what evidence he had to support the alleged setup, he said, “They could say that you take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life. “He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco-trafficking,” Kaine said on CBS's Face the Nation. Trump announced Hernandez‘s pardon alongside his support of Honduran conservative presidential candidate Nasry “Tito” Asfura. Hondurans are voting in their presidential general election, and early results have favored Asfura, who is facing off against former Honduran Vice President Salvador Nasralla. Trump suggested he would be dissuaded from sending money to Honduras if Nasralla wins. “If [Asfura] doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,” Trump wrote. The president recently expressed support for War Secretary Pete Hegseth, as he has been accused of carrying out an extra strike on two drug traffickers who were shipwrecked in September. The War Department has killed at least 83 people in 21 strikes on alleged drug boats since September.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawmakers from both parties said Sunday they support congressional reviews of U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, citing a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack. The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week's Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns. “This rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information on what happened. Trump is also weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.” Under the deal announced Monday, the Trump administration agreed to exempt U.K.-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes. “This vital deal will ensure U.K. patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives,” Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement “strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to U.S.–U.K. Trump's comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago. Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday's expected launch of what they're calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi. Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents. After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee. Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump's endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville. Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state's two Democratic U.S. House members. Indiana's other current Democratic district is in the state's northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District. Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state's congressional districts in Republicans' favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump's demands. Republicans who control the House have said there's no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue. Republicans hold seven of Indiana's existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington. Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro's support. ▶ Read more about why Maduro's grip on power is hard to crack Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's pick to be the interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, speaks with reporters outside the White House, March 26, 2025, in Washington. A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration's maneuvers to keep the president's former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration's push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government's moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation. Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings. ▶ Read more about Trump administration prosecutors whose appointments have been challenged The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

Fox News Digital spoke with terrorism expert Dr. Casey Babb about a recent NYU study that found U.S. extremists are exploiting social media with far fewer limits than foreign terrorist groups. Extremist groups in America are exploiting social media's chaos and cashing in on it, as violent rhetoric spreads faster than platforms can contain it, according to a new report and security experts who warn the problem is no longer limited to foreign terrorist networks. A study from New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, titled "Digital Aftershocks: Online Mobilization and Violence in the United States," found that violent Islamist groups' shrinking online presence shows how terrorist designations, when paired with platform enforcement, can push extremists into smaller corners of the internet, successfully limiting their recruitment and propaganda. But that same legal framework doesn't apply to domestic extremist movements, creating what the report calls an "enforcement asymmetry" that allows far-right, far-left, nihilistic groups and antisemitic networks to thrive on mainstream platforms. Dr. Casey Babb, terrorism professor and director of the Promised Land Project with Canada's Macdonald-Laurier Institute, told Fox News Digital that policymakers already have the authority to curb homegrown extremism. "Despite the First Amendment, and, of course, some of this is in a gray zone, but not all speech is protected," Babb said. "There are already tools there that enable policymakers, law enforcement, intelligence agencies and so on to crack down on domestic extremists." Or statements where the person making [them] intensely communicate[s] some sort of intent to commit an unlawful act or violence, or says something that could be perceived as a legitimate threat, that's not protected." The NYU report mirrors that frustration, concluding that the U.S. has "ample tools" to confront extremism but applies them unevenly. It found that when foreign terrorist designations restrict groups like al Qaeda and ISIS, their online reach collapses. "The ability to designate organized nations and individuals as terrorist entities is a very useful tool," Babb said. "It's a tool that policymakers should really lean into and think about, possibly modernizing and reforming to better address a lot of what we're seeing domestically." Babb said extremists are "learning from one another," adopting propaganda and recruitment methods once pioneered by Islamist organizations. "Groups like ISIS, al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood were some of the early adopters of these platforms," he said. Antifa protesters in Portland, Oregon, on June 19, 2019. He also blamed social-media companies for enabling the spread of hate. "There's frankly no reason that I should be seeing much of what I'm seeing online," Babb said. "Free speech is one thing; giving a platform for nefarious state and non-state actors to spread divisive language deliberately with the intent of dividing Americans and endangering certain minorities, that's something else entirely. A lot of people are monetizing this." "You shouldn't be making thousands of dollars a month by spreading the same messages that Adolf Hitler or Yahya Sinwar would spread," he added. WATCH: Trump takes Antifa fight abroad with foreign terrorist designation President Trump once floated designating Antifa a domestic terrorist group, an idea Babb believes deserves renewed attention. "Designation opens a whole suite of tools," he said. The Digital Aftershocks report concludes that U.S. policymakers and tech platforms must coordinate more aggressively to combat online extremism.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani told NBC News' Kristen Welker that he still believes President Trump is a "fascist" after his meeting with the president at the White House. A sociology professor at Brooklyn College appointed to New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's transition team wrote a book about ending policing. A New Era for NYC," Alex Vitale said on X. The book, which opens by explaining that police don't exist to help citizens, argues for an end to traditional policing for certain criminal activity, including narcotics use, prostitution, patrolling borders and "misbehaving adolescents." The book also argues that police shouldn't combat street gangs. Other speakers were, left to right, Portland Police Chief Frank Clark, South Portland School Resource Officer Al Giusto, Portland School Board Chair Roberto Rodriguez and Al Cleveland of Maine Youth Justice. On ending gang units, Vitale argues that they are racist. "In most cities, gang units function as a mechanism for racialized social control," the book says in chapter five. "Black and Latino youth are labeled as gang members for hanging out together, while white youth groups are dismissed as harmless." Policing borders is also racist, according to the author. "The expansion of Border Patrol powers has been justified through fear and racism. It legitimizes xenophobic narratives that define immigrants as threats rather than as fellow workers or neighbors," the book says in chapter six. Chapter nine of the book argues against training police officers on implicit bias, claiming that police officers' views on race do not matter because the whole system of policing is racist. Zohran Mamdani delivers a victory speech at a mayoral election night watch party, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York City. "Racism in policing is structural, not simply a product of bad attitudes," the book says. "Training officers to recognize implicit bias without changing what they are tasked with enforcing is like teaching a soldier to be sensitive while sending him to occupy a foreign country." The professor's faculty profile on Brooklyn College's website says Vitale has spent 30 years writing about policing and that he consults with law enforcement entities and international human rights organizations. He teaches courses about African Americans in the criminal justice system, according to his university profile. He has also called for the NYPD to abolish its gang database. Neither Vitale nor Brooklyn College returned requests for comment. Mamdani has hired others who harbor anti-police sentiments. Earlier this month, he announced that campaign advisor Elle Bisgaard-Church would join his staff. She has been dubbed the "chief architect" of Mamdani's campaign proposal to have social workers respond to certain non-violent 911 calls and is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani officials did not return a request for comment. Fox News' Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  As part of CNN Style's Art of Gifting series, selected tastemakers share their top tips for gifting and mastering the holiday season. If gift-giving talents were ranked by profession, interior designers would likely top the list — after all, curating thoughtful objects to fit a client's purpose or taste is one of the things they do. For famed California-based designer Kelly Wearstler, curiosity has always guided the projects she works on. “It's about finding that new thing that really moves me and makes me fall in love with it,” she explained during a video call. She shot to fame for her bold style, which she describes as “old soul, new spirit.” Early projects — including her transformation of the historic Avalon Hotel in Beverly Hills — helped build a starry client list that today includes the likes of Gwen Stefani and Cameron Diaz. Her eponymous studio has touched nearly every facet of design. She's brought to life dreamy restaurants and cocktail bars layered with texture and color; established her own furniture and lighting line; and has partnered with a range of collaborators, including fashion designer Ulla Johnson for her earthy LA boutique and industry-favorite paint purveyors Farrow & Ball. Today, she has some 2.2 million followers on Instagram and 33,000 subscribers to Wearstlerworld, her Substack where she shares inspo, musings and tips. Most recently, she launched Side Hustle, a flexible gallery concept out of the white cube and into her pool house (literally), in which she commissions artists across sculpture, design, performance, sound and even scent to produce collectible designs. But just as important is how attuned a gift is to the person's tastes and needs (she never wants a present to become clutter, she said), and how it's given. “I always think about the presentation and how it's wrapped,” she said. “The whole experience to me is getting a gift and seeing something so beautiful and a really thoughtful note accompanied with the gift.” Below, she reveals her gifting secrets. CNN: What's the best gift you've ever received? KW: My husband gave me this necklace I wear every day. I got it for the holidays last year. And it's something that's personalized — it has the initials of my three boys, my husband, and my initials and has this little star in the middle. It keeps me safe and my family close. CNN: What is the best gift you've ever given? KW: There's this ceramic artist in Europe, and the name of her company is called The English Boys. She does these really amazing hand-painted ceramics. And it's a great little ensemble for dessert or small bites. And then I have her write the name of every family member on it, and everyone really loves that. CNN: Who is the hardest person in your family or friend circle to buy for? He loves exercise and working out, so I know to give him anything that fits inside that box. CNN: What's a great gift that costs nothing? Our family, we make our own cards and it's something we've always done, and now my boys do it. Anytime there's any holiday, we all make our cards and the envelopes they go in. CNN: Do you have any traditions or rituals around the holidays? KW: I always have a holiday party with all my girlfriends. We do it two or three weeks before Christmas. A couple of my friends are really good cooks, and so they make the food. CNN: If you're celebrating with loved ones around a table, what are the most important components of the celebration? KW: Honestly, the most important part of any celebration around a table is that everything speaks the same language. It's never just the food or flowers or a great bottle of wine — it's a full, multi-sensory experience. This interview has been edited for clarity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump was mum on recent developments with Venezuela on Sunday, even after he declared its airspace “closed” and spoke with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Trump spoke to the press aboard Air Force One a day after he said the airspace over and around Venezuela is now “closed in its entirety,” a major escalation in the United States's pressure tactics on the regime. However, Trump downplayed the move to reporters, saying “don't read anything” into his statement. He was similarly silent on any details about his phone call with Maduro, which reportedly happened two weeks ago. “I wouldn't say it went well, or badly. It was a phone call,” Trump said. 🚨 JUST IN: President Trump had a CALL with NICOLAS MADURO 👀👀"Yes…I wouldn't say it went well, or badly. Tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela have increased as the U.S. has amassed an armada in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on alleged drug boats departing from Venezuela. Hegseth has denied the story, calling it “fabricated.” The U.S. government also recently designated the “Cartel de los Soles,” a cartel linked to Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>
