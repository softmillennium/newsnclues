                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP ETFs Bounce Back After Brutal Month for Crypto Funds Not quite, given that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major coins are all deep in the red to start the new week—but at least crypto funds finished November strong, putting up positive flows last week to break a recent losing streak. Digital asset exchange-traded products experienced a significant reversal with $1.07 billion in inflows last week, according to data from CoinShares, following four consecutive weeks of substantial outflows totaling $5.7 billion. XRP's recent six-week inflow streak represents 29% of its assets under management, likely linked to new US ETF launches. Germany was a notable outlier with outflows of $57.3 million. Trading volumes remained subdued at $24 billion due to the Thanksgiving holiday, contrasting sharply with the previous week's record $56 billion. The improved market sentiment last week was driven in part by comments from FOMC member John Williams regarding restrictive monetary policy, CoinShares said, raising expectations for a potential interest rate cut in December. But the renewed optimism in crypto markets didn't last into the new week, with prices plunging late Sunday as losses accelerated overnight. Bitcoin was recently priced at $84,917, showing a 7% drop over the last day, while assets like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are all showing deeper daily losses.

This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. Bitcoin Hyper's ICO has climbed to nearly $29 million, with momentum suggesting it could break that level within hours. That's happening even as Bitcoin itself slipped back to $85,000 on Monday after briefly reclaiming $91,000 last week. The drop was triggered by heavy liquidations, with roughly $646 million in leveraged positions wiped out during early Asia trading, adding fuel to an already bearish technical backdrop. To them, this may be the catalyst that finally stabilizes Bitcoin's economic role and places it in the same class as long-standing monetary assets, such as gold. Bitcoin's sharp drop to the mid-$80,000s on Monday was triggered by a slew of forced liquidations that swept through the market during early Asia trading. More than $646 million in leveraged positions were wiped out within hours, accelerating BTC's decline and shaking investor sentiment that had only recently stabilized above $91,000. The sell-off pushed funding rates into negative territory and forced derivatives traders to unwind positions at a rapid pace, thereby deepening intraday volatility. The cascade came as global risk appetite weakened, with traders pulling back from high-beta assets following increased rate-hike expectations in Japan and a broader shift toward safer positions. A new chart shared by analyst Northstar Charts highlights that Bitcoin's monthly MACD has confirmed a “bear cross,” which has historically preceded deeper market downturns. The latest crossover mirrors those past signals, suggesting that BTC may not be done correcting and could be entering a broader cooling phase unless buyers step in aggressively. While MACD trends don't guarantee outcomes, they often reflect weakening long-term momentum, and in this case, the timing aligns with rising liquidations, ETF outflows, and fading macro risk appetite. Yet amid Bitcoin's weakness, one project is moving in the opposite direction. The demand Bitcoin Hyper aims to unlock comes from something Bitcoin has never had: an environment where BTC functions as currency and not just an asset that sits in cold storage. Its scripting language is non–Turing complete, meaning it cannot run complex applications, which is a deliberate trade-off by Satoshi to minimize attack vectors, simplify consensus, and prevent catastrophic bugs. This design choice is what makes Bitcoin the most secure settlement layer in existence, but it also limits its ability to support high-throughput economic activity. Solana, by contrast, delivers the speed and low-cost execution developers need for modern applications – DeFi, gaming, payments, social apps. Still, with roughly over 865 active validators (at least in the past 224 hours), it does not approach Bitcoin's far broader decentralization or its unmatched settlement security. Applications are built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), but settlement and finality anchor back to Bitcoin. Through a canonical bridge, BTC is locked on the base layer, and a wrapped version is minted inside the Bitcoin Hyper execution environment, allowing wrapped BTC to move freely across SVM-powered apps. And with its latest upgrade, the team shared performance benchmarks validating how Bitcoin Hyper can deliver real-time app performance while still anchoring reliably to Bitcoin L1. Bitcoin Hyper is benchmarking how to deliver Solana-grade throughput on a Bitcoin-anchored SVM rollup—balancing speed, cost, and security with real data, not hype. Now, backing for the project has been nothing short of explosive. Since the presale began, support has been explosive, and for two straight months, solo whales have stepped in with massive individual buys, each accumulating huge HYPER positions. What this means is that as the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem scales – and as more applications rely on wrapped BTC for real economic activity – demand for HYPER should scale alongside it. And investors see the dual-growth effect: BTC gains a new utility demand source, and HYPER becomes the indispensable asset that makes that system function. To get HYPER while there's still time, head to the Bitcoin Hyper presale website and purchase using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. HYPER is listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live. Best Wallet is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

Trust Stamp's solution integrates StableKey, a patented technology that cryptographically ties digital assets to their rightful owners using biometric markers, rendering forced transfers ineffective for attackers. John Bridge, Trust Stamp's President of GovTech, emphasized the need for this innovation as the prevalence of stablecoins increases, urging stakeholders to address these risks robustly. Trust Stamp's Turnkey Solution utilizes its patented StableKey technology to prevent violent crypto-focused home invasions by binding digital assets to their rightful owners.

The home invasions target cryptocurrency holders exploiting a fatal flaw in today's digital-asset ecosystem: criminals can physically coerce victims into transferring funds, and once the assets move, they are often irrecoverable. Today, Trust Stamp explained how this rising threat can be prevented through the integration of StableKey, the company's patented quantum-ready embedded-identity algorithm, which cryptographically binds a digital asset to its rightful owner, rendering forced transfers worthless to attackers without creating a link to their own biometric identity. Trust Stamp's StableKey technology introduces a breakthrough: digital assets, including stablecoins, tokenized deposits, CBDCs, NFTs, and other on-chain instruments, can be embedded with cryptographic identity binding, ensuring that the ownership of an asset is tied to an irreversibly transformed biometric marker of the rightful owner. As stablecoins proliferate, this grave risk needs to be addressed not just by law enforcement and regulators but also by insurers who would arguably be justified in refusing coverage for irrecoverable digital assets.” is a global provider of AI-powered services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance, regulatory compliance, government, healthcare, real estate, communications, healthcare and humanitarian services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>B2B crypto payments already account for 25% of global transaction volume, with a significant share coming from FX and CFD firms. But there's a problem that's rarely discussed publicly: all crypto operations on public blockchains are fully transparent. For financial companies operating in highly competitive environments with strict regulatory obligations, this transparency poses a direct risk. In this article, the BitHide team breaks down how business operations are “read” on the blockchain, why traditional privacy schemes (mixers, privacy coins) no longer work, and what technologies allow Forex brokers and fintech companies to work with crypto transactions confidentially and securely while maintaining AML compliance. Below is a breakdown of the insights that can be reconstructed from on-chain data alone, even without breaching any systems. Brokers and finance companies, whose revenue correlates directly with client volumes, are particularly exposed: predictable flows may reveal market activity peaks, payout schedules, or even liquidity stress. Transaction origins and preferred networks (TRON, Ethereum, or BNB Chain) often reveal where a company operates. Combined with timestamp patterns, an observer can infer operating hours, regional hubs, or the location of back-office operations. Repeated transfers between the same sets of addresses allow clustering algorithms to detect commercial relationships. Even if internal addresses change frequently, behavioural similarity exposes the underlying connection. Finance companies managing client funds on-chain are especially vulnerable — their treasury decisions can be inferred long before any public disclosure. Clustering methods quickly detect payout groups, allowing estimation of staff count, contractor networks, and even seniority levels (via compensation patterns). Large, infrequently used wallets that regularly accumulate excess funds are easily classified as reserves or treasury addresses. Even if a company uses several such wallets, clustering models combine them into one logical pool. These regulators expect firms to maintain verifiable audit trails, comply with AML directives (including EU AMLD5/AMLD6), and ensure the traceability of client funds under rules like MiFID II. The same year, Consensys, the developer of MetaMask, publicly confirmed that its default RPC provider Infura records users' IP addresses, a policy later formalized in its updated privacy disclosure. Taken together, these global regulatory expectations have given rise to a new paradigm: managed confidentiality. Rather than attempting full secrecy, an approach incompatible with AML frameworks, managed confidentiality shields sensitive operational data on public blockchains while preserving provable legitimacy for regulators. BitHide is a non-custodial confidential wallet used by Forex brokers, payment service providers (PSP), IT and fintech companies working with high-volume crypto operations. BitHide's architecture is built around its proprietary Dark Wing technology, a network-level privacy layer that masks real IP addresses and metadata before any transaction reaches public nodes. This technology protects companies from malicious actors, competitors, and hackers attempting to trace operations or link addresses. The wallet's real IP address is changed using BitHide's proprietary Dark Wing technology, protecting infrastructure and preventing metadata leaks. This prevents third parties from tracking business flow structures or operational patterns, strengthening overall confidentiality. As with traditional bank transfers, the recipient cannot see your crypto address or internal data. This approach allows companies to protect their sensitive business information while remaining fully compliant with regulatory requirements. Corporate privacy on public blockchains is both a technical challenge and an emerging regulatory requirement. Today, public blockchains resemble documents published for everyone on the internet; the goal for institutional finance is to transform them into controlled-access records, accessible only to authorized participants.</p>

KALA BIO Enters Into $6 Million Securities Purchase Agreement wit... Lucid CFO to Speak at UBS Global Industrials and Transportation C... Plug Begins First NASA Liquid Hydrogen Contract, Opening New Mark... The Registration Statement is preliminary and has not been declared effective; additional proxy/prospectus materials will follow. Filing of Form S-4 advances the proposed SPAC-style business combination but completion remains conditional. BlockchAIn filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to register shares for the proposed combination of Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain and a listing under the ticker "AIB". The combination links a recruitment platform with a digital infrastructure operator that reported $22.9 million in 2024 revenue and $5.7 million in 2024 net income for its 40 MW facility. As previously disclosed, on May 27, 2025, Signing Day Sports entered into a Business Combination Agreement with BlockchAIn, One Blockchain, and certain other parties, as amended on November 10, 2025. “Today marks an important milestone in our progress toward completing the business combination with One Blockchain and launching BlockchAIn as a publicly traded company,” said Daniel Nelson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Signing Day Sports. From the beginning, it has been clear that this combination is a strategic alignment of vision and long-term objectives. Our teams have worked together with a shared sense of purpose, ensuring that each step has been executed thoroughly and on schedule.” “Looking ahead, we believe the combined company will be well-positioned to leverage Signing Day Sports' technology-driven recruitment platform alongside One Blockchain's digital infrastructure and high-performance computing resources. This structure will provide greater financial flexibility and broader technical capabilities. It also gives us the ability to pursue scalable growth initiatives that were previously out of reach.” “The transaction further enables us to accelerate innovation across our platform and enhance the tools we offer to student-athletes and coaches. It creates opportunities to expand into new markets and partnerships. “I am incredibly proud of the diligence and collaboration that have brought us to this point, and we remain focused on completing this transformative transaction and executing on the opportunities that lie ahead,” concluded Nelson. Signing Day Sports' app allows student-athletes to build their Signing Day Sports recruitment profile, which includes information college coaches need to evaluate and verify them through video technology.

Last month, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) launched a consultation on its new Data Protection Enforcement Procedural Guidance. This guidance is intended to replace the ICO's Regulatory Action Policy (RAP), which was first issued in November 2018, and will sit alongside the ICO's Data Protection Fining Guidance (updated in March 2024). It sets out in greater detail how the ICO will exercise its investigatory and enforcement powers, including its new investigatory powers introduced under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA). The guidance covers the processes for existing powers such as opening investigations, issuing warnings, reprimands, enforcement notices, and penalty notices but also introduces a structured settlement procedure and clarifies rights of appeal. “The purpose of the new draft guidance is to provide organisations with more detail about our approach to give greater transparency and certainty about how we use our investigatory and enforcement powers.” The consultation period runs for almost 12 weeks and closes on 23 January 2026, with final guidance expected later next year. It explains that the ICO's investigatory and enforcement powers include: promote public trust and confidence in the processing of personal data”. It is designed to be flexible, allowing departures where justified, provided the ICO acts fairly and reasonably. The ICO notes that it does not explain the process followed for prosecuting criminal offences beyond its information-gathering powers – for more information on this, see their prosecution policy statement. The RAP presented a high-level policy framework which emphasised deterrence, consistency and proportionality, with sections on aims, objectives, hierarchy of regulatory action, and statutory guidance. In comparison, the new draft guidance provides a much more procedural manual with detailed step-by-step processes for enforcement actions such as investigations, notices, settlements, and appeals. The guidance also sets out some of the factors it will consider when making decisions - for example, when deciding whether to open an investigation and what action to take, the ICO will generally consider a number of factors including: This new detail highlights the ICO's desire for transparency about how it enforces compliance with data protection legislation and aligns guidance with its principal objective (see above) to secure an appropriate level of protection for personal data and to promote public trust and confidence in the processing of personal data. The new draft guidance introduces an explicit settlement procedure, including discounts (in the form of reduced fines) for early resolution, whereas RAP does not include a formal settlement framework at all. whether the ICO has sufficient evidence to impose a penalty notice; how likely it is that the case will be settled in a reasonable timeframe; and public policy reasons such as if the infringement was committed intentionally; Importantly, the ICO still maintains flexibility in that decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, and both the ICO and controllers / processors still maintain discretion as to when to enter into settlement discussions or settle a case. Equally though, as there is no obligation to enter into the process, neither party can require the other to enter into discussions. DUAA includes provisions that supplement the ICO's existing investigatory and enforcement powers. This includes new powers to send notices by email, compel interviews and request technical reports to be prepared at the expense of the body being investigated. The draft guidance reflects these changes following DUAA, including those provisions that have already come into force as well as those that are expected to do so in the coming months. In addition, DUAA will bring investigatory and enforcement powers under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) broadly into line with its powers under UK data protection legislation. These are formal written requests which require an individual to attend an interview at a specified time and place, and to answer questions relevant to an investigation into compliance with data protection law. Again, a range of factors will be considered before issuing the notice including whether an interview would help the ICO understand how the data is being processed, especially where it is complex, and if they have previously asked someone to interview voluntarily, but the request was refused. The draft guidance also confirms that the ICO will have the power to compel an organisation to provide a technical report prepared by an approved person (such as an independent expert) as part of its information-gathering toolkit. This may form part of an assessment notice for a controller or processor. If a controller or processor does not nominate someone, or they are not approved, then the ICO may approve someone that they are satisfied is suitable instead. This includes whether the matter is sufficiently technically complex that it requires specialist skills or resources that the ICO does not have available and whether the report would assist them in identifying, understanding or assessing a specified matter. Further clarification is provided on enforcement notices and when these can be issued. The ICO can use these where it concludes that a controller or processor has infringed, or is continuing to infringe, data protection legislation. For example, where there is evidence of infringements that concern failing to comply with: A range of factors will also need to be considered before issuing the notice including: whether there are any aggravating or mitigating factors about the controller or processor's conduct such as what action it has taken to remedy the infringement and mitigate any damage or distress, and how effective it was. In exceptional cases, the ICO can require compliance in less than 28 days (minimum 24 hours) if urgent action is needed to prevent serious harm or distress. The guidance notes that while announcements are a tool the ICO may use in relation to warnings, reprimands, enforcement notices, penalty notices and settlements, they are not automatic. The process and guidance on when a public announcement will be suitable is different for each enforcement action. For example, in relation to settlement discussions, announcements will be considered carefully to avoid prejudicing the investigation or unfairly impacting the parties involved. This means that the ICO will not comment publicly while discussions are taking place or if they have been unsuccessful. However, for preliminary enforcement, information, assessment and interview notices, the ICO has clarified that it will not typically make an announcement that it has given one of these unless there are circumstances in which it considers it appropriate to do so, such as if it is in the public interest, or they are providing updates on the progress of their work. The controller or processor will, however, be provided with such text in advance to give it an opportunity to comment on factual inaccuracies or confidentiality. Controllers and processors should assess the impact of the ICO's proposed enforcement approach on their compliance strategy and its alignment with other regulatory requirements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin shed 5% in the past 24 hours, dragging Ethereum, XRP, and other altcoins down with it. As a result of the sudden selloff, total crypto market liquidations have skyrocketed to $637 million, some $568 million of which are long  positions, according to CoinGlass data. The short-term factors behind Bitcoin's weekend plunge are “straightforward,” Wenny Cai, COO of SynFutures, told Decrypt. One key crypto-related catalyst behind the drop is Strategy CEO Phong Le's comments about selling Bitcoin. Strategy's $55 Billion Bitcoin Bet Undeterred by Index Delisting Concerns, Says Michael Saylor Comments from listed BTC holders, including Strategy CEO Phong Le, “can spark fear because they change investors' perceived supply dynamics — even if the comments are narrowly conditional rather than an intent to sell immediately,” Cai added. Despite Le's comments, traders on prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, appear unmoved. Tether's potential insolvency concerns if Bitcoin and gold fall by 30%, as highlighted by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes in a Sunday tweet, also played a role in aiding the weekend crash. When participants worry that crypto's largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, might become impaired in a stress event, “liquidity premia widen, and margin desks can pull risk, which increases volatility across crypto,” Cai explained. Another factor that may have contributed to the market's already bearish sentiment is China's central bank, which noted that crypto activity is illegal and raised concerns about stablecoins, according to a China Daily report. Despite the sudden crash, liquidation spree, and bearish sentiment, investors remain bullish, with Myriad users putting just a 12% chance on the likelihood of a crypto winter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If 2026 is going to deliver a real altcoin season, it probably won't start with fireworks. It usually begins quietly: Bitcoin cools off after a strong run, $BTC dominance rolls over from local highs, and suddenly alt/$BTC charts stop bleeding and start printing higher lows. Layer 2s and DeFi protocols push higher daily active addresses, DEX volumes creep up, and fees rise without a matching spike in $BTC. Those are the conditions where narrative-driven plays, experimental token models, and infrastructure bets can move fastest. In other words, being early to altseason is about positioning before those rotations show up on mainstream charts, while Bitcoin is still chopping in a range instead of setting new highs every week. Together, they map out the speculative to blue‑chip spectrum heading into a potential 2026 rotation. Instead of GPUs or ASICs, you interact with a virtual mining system directly tied to your $PEPENODE holdings. Early adopters can secure more powerful nodes that sit in higher reward tiers, meaning their virtual rigs earn larger ongoing meme coin emissions over time. It's the kind of asymmetric setup that typically attracts degen capital early in an alt season narrative. Crucially, this mining is all virtual and smart-contract-based on Ethereum, using ERC‑20 infrastructure plus dedicated contracts for staking, rewards, and later governance. The presale is already showing traction, having raised over $2.2M with tokens currently priced at $0.0011731 and a mouth-watering staking APY of 579%. If 2026 does bring a renewed memecoin wave as $BTC cools and retail returns, this gamified mining model could become one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. If altseason rotations in 2026 lean toward real‑world use cases, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) positions itself at the intersection of AI, creator economies, and crypto payments. It targets the roughly $85B content creation industry by letting creators own their audiences, automate their workflows, and monetize via tokens instead of opaque platforms. The SUBBD platform's AI Personal Assistant can handle automated fan interactions, subscription flows, and basic support, effectively becoming a 24/7 “team member” for solo creators. On top of that, AI Voice Cloning and AI Influencer Creation open up new content formats, from synthetic personas to multi‑language distribution without extra recording time. On the Web3 side, the SUBBD platform integrates token‑gated content and crypto payouts so creators can keep more of what they earn while retaining direct control over their subscriber relationships. That's a sharp contrast to traditional platforms where fees, algorithms, and sudden policy changes can wipe out years of work overnight. The presale has already raised over $1.3M, with tokens at $0.057075, giving $SUBBD a running start before major listings. For an altseason positioning around creator tech rather than pure memes, it's a project worth tracking, so read our guide on how to buy $SUBBD today. Ripple's $XRP sits at the opposite end of the risk spectrum: a large‑cap asset designed for fast, low‑cost cross‑border payments rather than speculative meme cycles. XRP settles transactions in roughly 3–5 seconds, with a consensus mechanism that's cheap and energy‑efficient compared to proof‑of‑work systems like Bitcoin's. That changed when the SEC officially ended its lawsuit against Ripple in August 2025, closing a long‑running chapter of uncertainty. With that resolved, many market participants now see XRP with renewed confidence, particularly as regulators globally define clearer digital asset frameworks. Heading into a potential 2026 altcoin season, $XRP offers a different kind of exposure: it's already one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and a leading enterprise‑focused blockchain payments asset, but it can still benefit from broader liquidity and renewed interest in compliant infrastructure coins. If you want a piece of it, buy your $XRP today. As a crypto writer, Bogdan's responsibilities are split between researching and writing articles and entertaining the team with his humor bordering on the politically incorrect, an aspiring Bill Burr, if you will. Thanks to his 12+ years of writing experience in just as many fields, including tech, cybersecurity, modelling, fitness, crypto, and other topics-that-shall-not-be-named, he's become a genuine asset to the team. While his position as a senior writer at PrivacyAffairs thought him valuable lessons about the power of self-management, his entire writing career was and is an exercise in self-improvement. Now, he's ready to sink his teeth into crypto and teach people how to take control of their own money on the blockchain. With fiat as an eternally devaluing currency, Bitcoin and altcoins seem like the best-fitting alternative for Bogdan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Non-fungible tokens changed the way people bought, sold, and owned digital assets. From art and music down to virtual land and utilities, NFTs are more than just digital files; they represent verifiable ownership made possible by blockchain. But behind this booming digital revolution is a very crucial infrastructure: NFT marketplaces. These websites serve as virtual meeting points for creators, traders, and collectors. NFT marketplaces are online platforms, incorporating blockchain technology, where one can mint, buy, sell, trade, or auction NFTs. They are similar in concept to the virtual versions of eBay or Amazon, but with ownership being recorded on and verified by a blockchain. Most existing NFT marketplaces are currently supporting assets that have been created based on blockchain standards such as: Unlike tokens, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible, NFTs have unique metadata that makes each one of them different and impossible to interchange one for another. This marketplace hosts the asset on its platform, accompanied by thorough metadata, price, history, and creator-related information. They do strict artist selections where high-quality creators are first verified. Companies create their own NFT platforms to maintain full control over the user experience. Each time the NFT is resold, artists earn a certain percentage. Anyone who has a crypto wallet is invited to the platform. From virtual fashion to AI art, creators find new income models. One of the newer and more dangerous risks emerging today is AI-driven scams in Crypto. Scammers using AI chatbots to guide users into signing fraudulent approvals Understanding generative AI phishing helps users stay alert and avoid losses. To protect yourself from scams, frauds, and phishing attempts, implement these practices: Avoid clicking unknown links shared via DMs on Discord or Twitter. The evolution of NFT marketplaces will be shaped by technological, regulatory, and cultural shifts. Cross-chain trading where users can buy NFTs across different blockchains NFT marketplaces are transitioning from niche art hubs into robust ecosystems that support creators, brands, and digital economies. Yet with growth comes responsibility: the user must be constantly aware of various risks, including LLM-Powered Social Engineering in Crypto, collection scams, marketplace vulnerabilities, and phishing. Whether a newbie who is just starting to learn about NFTs or a well-seasoned trader in them, understanding how marketplaces work offers the ability to confidently navigate such an ecosystem. If treated the right way, an NFT marketplace offers unlimited possibilities for creativity, investment, and innovation. The NFT marketplace is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to mint, buy, sell, or trade NFTs. Most require either transactional cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, or MATIC to go through with it. Avoid unsolicited messages, use only verified platforms, and stay cautious against crypto scams resulting from LLM-Powered Social Engineering. They are basically safe in themselves if used responsibly, yet the user must always be cognizant of the associated risks: phishing, fake collections, AI-driven scams.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an era of rapid innovation, the legal landscape is shifting just as fast. You're advising on complex challenges, anticipating risks, and driving business forward. At Davis Wright Tremaine, we offer deep industry knowledge, strategic insight, and a commitment to practical, actionable advice tailored to your needs—so you're prepared to tackle today's challenges while seizing tomorrow's opportunities. The OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1186, confirming that national banks may hold crypto-assets as principal to pay network "gas fees" and to test crypto platforms. More clarifications from the OCC on digital assets are expected to follow. This is just the latest step in promoting the interoperability of crypto and blockchain technologies with traditional financial services. The OCC also released a public database of prior requests for supervisory non-objections for permissible crypto-related activities under a now-defunct framework. The database provides overdue transparency into an opaque process marked by delays and uncertainty. IL 1186 reflects the OCC's broader effort under Comptroller Jonathan Gould—the agency's former Chief Counsel who developed key Brooks-era interpretations on crypto-related activities—to modernize the OCC's approach. Comptroller Gould has emphasized his intent to put OCC supervision and expectations "on a firmer legal foundation" and IL 1186 follows a string of proposed reforms to supervision. IL 1186 also continues the trend of the first Trump Administration's ILs that clarified that national banks may engage in key crypto-related activities. We note that the bank's explanation of how it would ensure that its activities would be conducted in a safe and sound manner is something of a roadmap for banks and others seeking future OCC clarification. *We note that banks that don't have the operational or compliance capacity in place to leverage this authority very well may want to use third-party fee providers—at least until they are ready to conduct the activities in a safe and sound manner and with appropriate risk controls. IL 1186 also analogizes holding crypto-assets as principal to long-standing practices in traditional payment systems, where banks have typically invested capital in "building, joining, or maintaining the network[.]" In that way, using these technologies is just a new way to "conduct[] the very old business of banking." IL 1186 applies the same permissibility analysis to crypto-asset platform testing. A bank developing or acquiring a crypto-asset platform must be able to test transfers, settlement, recordkeeping, controls, and compliance before putting the service in front of customers. IL 1186 doesn't suggest this is the end of clarifying permissible crypto-related activities for national banks. By revisiting and developing previous ILs, conducting an incidental activities analysis, and analogizing these new activities to long-standing payment systems practices, the OCC has charted a viable way forward. In addition, the OCC notes in footnote 35 that national banks "may also hold some amount of crypto-assets as principal for other permissible purposes" that are unspecified and thus quite broad. Taking the OCC's statement at face value and to its logical conclusion, there are likely many more "permissible purposes," including possibly: The OCC also released a Summary of Interpretive Letter 1179 Requests database to show how its earlier interpretations were applied in practice under the now-defunct supervisory non-objection framework of the prior administration. It provides overdue transparency and follows the FDIC's release of the crypto letters earlier in 2025 in response to reports and allegations of debanking. While the disclosure of 21 "formal requests" over two years is useful, the submissions represent fairly measured requests to update banking systems and processes. Some received a supervisory non-objection, while many didn't; those who didn't, withdrew their requests—a practice that previously typified the application process at other federal banking agencies. Providing the OCC's interpretations more broadly through general guidance or developed regulation could have promoted consistent and specific risk controls, through a transparent routine process, backstopped by supervisory oversight. We expect additional guidance from the OCC to promote innovation in financial services, banking, and payments. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p>
