                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American survived a sublimely brutal test of wills, and a late-night house of horrors in Arthur Ashe Stadium.BySteve TignorPublished Dec 01, 2025 copy_link The WTA editions will begin Monday, December 8.It was a little after 11:30 P.M. when Tommy Paul double reached match point against Nuno Borges in their second-round match at the US Open.The fans in Arthur she Stadium stood and raised their Honey Deuces, ready to celebrate an American victory. One more point for Paul and—by the standards of the City That Never Sleeps—an ideal evening session would be completed, comfortably before midnight.Up to that moment, this contest had offered just the right blend of rapid-fire rallies and competitive tension. Borges, an amiable, clean-hitting native of Portugal, had gone up a break early in the third set, but now he seemed to have come to the end of his line. The script had been followed to a T.Time after time, Paul looked ready to close out the 41st-ranked Borges. Time after time, his smilingly stubborn opponent reeled him back in.Still, there was a slight problem with the final scene: Borges was serving. He quickly used two first serves to erase both match points. Two more strong points from Borges followed, and the score was 5-5, back to square one. Over the next two hours, Ashe slowly turned into a house of horrors for Paul. Instead of the roars of thousands, what he heard were eerie, echoing shouts and cries from the rafters. Late in the fourth set, when he was flailing in vain for a solution, Paul's own coach, Brad Stine, told him to “stop acting like a baby.”🖥️📲 Watch some of the best matches of 2025 on the Tennis Channel App!

Nuno Borges forces a fifth set against Tommy Paul 🫢#usopen pic.twitter.com/002EBxlDtG In fairness, it was probably hard for him to act any other way. Time after time, his smilingly stubborn opponent reeled him back in.By the fifth set, win or lose, Borges had made a name for himself among U.S. fans, and likely in the locker room. His strokes weren't flowing or graceful, but he was making ultra-clean contact. Borges' one title came on clay—he beat an aging Rafael Nadal in the final—but on this night he fed off the quick hard court. He came to net 20 more times than the American, and won nearly 70 percent of those points.The atmosphere, from an American perspective, was nightmarish. Paul and Borges both appeared ready to cramp at times, but soldiered on. By the fifth set, win or lose, Borges had made a name for himself among U.S. fans, and likely in the locker room.

Paul and Borges both appeared ready to cramp at times, but soldiered on. At 1:46 A.M., Paul reached match point again, more than two hours after his last one. Again, Borges was serving, and again he attacked, charging the net and making a strong first volley. Paul did his best to stay alive, and Borges' second volley clipped the tape and landed near the net. Again, Paul barreled forward and angled the ball back. Borges poked it down the line, and Paul raced back to the baseline, where he let loose with a forehand pass. “I'm a little bit tired, I think we all are,” Paul said, as Borges walked off in his socks to a rousing ovation. “Thank you guys so much for staying so late in the night and supporting me.”After his interview, Paul walked slowly back to his chair. The last thing Tommy needed at that moment was to take another swing. The last thing Tommy needed at that moment was to take another swing.</p>

"I won $150 for the 1960 title, which covered two months rent for my home in Rome," Pietrangeli told the Gazzetta dello Sport in 2020.Pietrangeli was also runner-up at Roland Garros in 1961 and 1964, losing both finals to Spanish player Manuel Santana. "In 1964 Santana and I made a bet whereby the loser would pay for dinner," Pietrangeli said. "I honored the agreement and 10 of us went out that night, including our wives, and Manolo invited (Spanish soccer player) Luisito Suárez," Pietrangeli said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a listless quarterfinal performance, Swiatek found her target in her press room for one of the Best Quotes of 2025.ByTENNIS.comPublished Nov 30, 2025 copy_link Tennis' biggest stars didn't just let their racquets do the talking in 2025. To look back on a memorable season, we're counting down some of the biggest winners in the press conference room and on the microphone—and we're still picking our jaws up off the floor after Iga Swiatek turned the tables on a reporter in a tense US Open exchange.After a disappointing first half of the season, Swiatek's busy summer began with a, for all intents and purposes, surprise run to the Wimbledon title, where she blanked Anisimova in a historic 6-0, 6-0 final. She arrived in New York less than 24 hours after winning the Cincinnati title, and quickly was in match mode as she partnered Casper Ruud to a runner-up finish in the tournament's new-look mixed doubles event.However, Swiatek was unable to parlay all that winning into a second US Open crown, instead turning in a listless performance against an American in the quarterfinals for a second year in a row. She landed just 50% of her first serves in the match, was broken four times, and had few answers against a dialed-in Anisimova who struck 23 winners off the ground.But Swiatek found her target in her post-match press conference in the form of a reporter who asked what she felt was the wrong question.

When asked if physical tiredness played any role in the match, Swiatek said: "Well, I don't know. It's not like my matches were exhausting here. "When the reporter clarified he meant a mental break, Swiatek pounced, asking if he needed one. When he jokingly said that he did, Swiatek volleyed back: "Well then, what are you doing here? When the reporter clarified he meant a mental break, Swiatek pounced, asking if he needed one. When he jokingly said that he did, Swiatek volleyed back: "Well then, what are you doing here? The closing exchange added another page to a playbook that Swiatek has patented in her time at the top of the game: Instead of lingering, either on her pre-Open achievements or her performance against Anisimova, she was ready to turn the page.“I know what I achieved, so I can't erase it because I lost today,” she said.“I guess in tennis you will get heartbreaking losses, and you don't have any other option. “I guess in tennis you will get heartbreaking losses, and you don't have any other option.</p>
