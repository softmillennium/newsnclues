Red Bull have said they "sincerely regret" the online abuse directed towards Kimi Antonelli following "clearly incorrect" comments suggesting the Mercedes rookie allowed title contender Lando Norris past in the Qatar Grand Prix. With Max Verstappen on course to win at the Lusail International Circuit, Antonelli found himself running ahead of Norris in the closing stages of the race, thanks to a tyre strategy that had seen Mercedes pit both cars under the early Safety Car. But with just two laps to go, Antonelli ran deep into a corner and that gave Norris the opportunity he needed to grab P4 and two extra vital points as he looks to secure his maiden title in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Gianpiero Lambiase, Verstappen's race engineer, told the reigning champion over the radio: “Not sure what happened to Antonelli Max, looks like he just pulled over and let Norris through.” However, Lambiase was quick to apologise to Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff for the comment, conceding he had not seen the situation fully. On Monday Red Bull released a statement that read: “Comments made before the end of, and immediately after, the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowed Lando Norris to overtake him are clearly incorrect. "Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Antonelli receiving online abuse.” "Kimi is fighting for a potential P3 [in the race]. I'm annoyed with other mistakes and then hearing such nonsense blows my mind. “[Antonelli] had a bit of a moment in the previous corner and then less entry speed into that left-hander, put the gas down and at that moment, which can happen, that lost the position. Russell had dropped places at the start, while Antonelli lost out to Sainz – and also on a potential podium – in the first round of pit stops. “We had a fast car in the Sprint, and I think we had a fast car today," Wolff added. "When you lose positions on the pit stop and you make mistakes in the race, obviously that's not going to help. Mercedes are 33 points ahead of Red Bull in the championship, as they look to secure P2 behind McLaren. And while that is some consolation from the final season of the current regulations, Wolff admitted it was a far cry from what he and the team expected of themselves. You look at the stats, and you say, well, that's a team that has fought on the front. If we are being totally honest with ourselves, then you need to say that there wasn't a single year [of the regulations] we were really fighting for a World Championship.</p>

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

A winning drive from a familiar face has set-up a three-way title showdown at next weekend's season finale...

Max Verstappen - 31.2%
Carlos Sainz - 30%
Oscar Piastri - 10.2%

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Best race start onboards Just 12 points separates Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in the title battle after the Red Bull driver's win in Qatar. Max Verstappen claimed a crucial victory in the Qatar Grand Prix from Oscar Piastri, with the title battle set to go down to the final round as championship leader Lando Norris could only finish fourth. Verstappen's unlikely win was courtesy of McLaren's alternative strategy which came as a consequence of an early Safety Car intervention and an enforced 25-lap maximum stint length on all Pirelli tyre sets. While all drivers pitted for the first of two mandatory pit stops in the 57-lap race, both Piastri and Norris remained out on track, which ultimately put them behind Verstappen in the final order. Piastri was able to comfortably rejoin in a net-P2 after his final pit stop having shown strong pace out front all race, but Norris was unable to clear the chasing Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli after his pit stop. Sainz claimed his second podium of the season for Williams, having jumped Antonelli through the opening pit stop phase, while Antonelli ensured Mercedes moved closer to P2 in the Constructors' Championship with P5. Behind Antonelli, Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls was on course for P6 before a left-front puncture three laps from the end, which promoted George Russell, the Mercedes driver having lost three positions on the opening lap. The top-10 was completed by Fernando Alonso, via a full 360-degree spin for the Aston Martin driver, Charles Leclerc's Ferrari, the second Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull). Alex Albon (Williams) was P11 from Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber) and Franco Colapinto (Alpine). Esteban Ocon finished P15 as the Haas driver was handed a five-second penalty for a false start, finishing ahead of Gasly. Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and Hadjar eventually recorded DNFs at the end. Ollie Bearman retired after serving a 10-second stop/go penalty over his car being in an unsafe condition, while Hulkenberg's race ended in the gravel after his collision with Gasly. Further back, Russell dropped three places after running slightly wide through Turn 2, as team mate Antonelli, Sainz and Alonso all moved ahead of the Mercedes driver through the opening corners. Gasly in P9 also ran slightly wide, damaging the underside of his car over the kerb and gravel, and was put under pressure by Hulkenberg, who along with Hamilton were the only drivers to start on Pirelli's soft tyre. Critically, the McLarens of Piastri and Norris stayed out, meaning Verstappen rejoined back in P3 on another set of medium tyres but with effectively one less pit stop to take compared with the two leaders. Racing resumed on Lap 11, Piastri leading from Norris and Verstappen, with Sainz having jumped Antonelli in the pits, as Alonso, Hadjar, Russell, Leclerc and Bearman completed the top-10. The McLarens began to lap more than 1s a lap faster than the rest of the field, all of whom would be required to stop on Lap 32 to make the end on a two-stop strategy. In turn, the McLarens needed to stop no later than Lap 25, Piastri pitting on lap 24 with a 4s lead over Norris and crucially rejoining in clean air having emerged in front of a large group headed by Alonso in P6. Norris rejoined even closer to Alonso the next lap, but a 2.2s pit stop proved pivotal as Verstappen now led Sainz, Antonelli, Piastri and Norris. Piastri also had a moment at the same corner as he attempted to build up his margin, with Verstappen starting to get into the dirty air of Norris nearly 8s behind. Piastri pitted at the end of Lap 42 for a new set of hard tyres, rejoining P3 but now 17s behind Verstappen, who was within 1s of Norris before the Briton also pitted for the hard tyre on Lap 44. Rejoining behind both Sainz and Antonelli, Norris soon closed on the pair but was unable to shape for a pass until Antonelli suffered a moment of oversteer on the exit of Turn 10 on the penultimate lap which allowed him ahead. With Verstappen's seventh Grand Prix win of the season, by a margin of eight seconds, it means the Dutchman sits just 12 points behind Norris, with Piastri a further four points back ahead of the final race in Abu Dhabi. Sainz claimed his second podium of the season from Norris, while Antonelli finished well clear of Russell, who had benefitted from a late puncture for Hadjar to finish P6. The top-10 was completed by Alonso, who finished despite a huge 360-degree spin which dropped him behind Hadjar and Russell, as Leclerc, Lawson and Tsunoda all scored points. The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Hamilton, Bortoleto, Colapinto, Ocon and Gasly, with Stroll, Hadjar, Bearman and Hulkenberg recorded as retirees. "This was an incredible race for us," said Verstappen.</p>
