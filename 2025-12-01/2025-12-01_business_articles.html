                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Monday announced it is taking an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, a company that was launched by one of its major investors, Thrive Capital, in April. The startup said it will embed engineering, research and product teams within Thrive Holdings' companies to help accelerate their AI adoption and boost cost efficiency. Thrive Holdings buys, owns and runs companies that it believes could benefit from technologies like artificial intelligence. It operates in sectors that are "core to the real economy," starting with accounting and IT services, according to its website. "We are excited to extend our partnership with OpenAI to embed their frontier models, products, and services into sectors we believe have tremendous potential to benefit from technological innovation and adoption," Joshua Kushner, CEO and founder of Thrive Capital and Thrive Holdings, said in a statement. It's the latest example of OpenAI's circular dealmaking. In recent months, the company has taken stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave. If Thrive Holdings' companies succeed, the size of OpenAI's stake will grow. It also acts as a way for OpenAI to get compensated for its services, according to another person familiar with the agreement who declined to be named because the details are confidential. "This partnership with Thrive Holdings is about demonstrating what's possible when frontier AI research and deployment are rapidly deployed across entire organizations to revolutionize how businesses work and engage with customers," OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said in a statement. OpenAI also announced a collaboration with the consulting firm Accenture on Monday. The startup said its business offering, ChatGPT Enterprise, will roll out to "tens of thousands" of Accenture employees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence startup Runway on Monday announced Gen 4.5, a new video model that outperforms similar models from Google and OpenAI in an independent benchmark. Gen 4.5 allows users to generate high-definition videos based on written prompts that describe the motion and action they want. 1 spot on the Video Arena leaderboard, which is maintained by the independent AI benchmarking and analysis company Artificial Analysis. To determine the text-to-video model rankings, people compare two different model outputs and vote for their favorite without knowing which companies are behind them. Google's Veo 3 model holds second place on the leaderboard, and OpenAI's Sora 2 Pro model is in seventh place. "We managed to out-compete trillion-dollar companies with a team of 100 people," Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela told CNBC in an interview. "You can get to frontiers just by being extremely focused and diligent." Runway was founded in 2018 and earned a spot on CNBC's Disruptor 50 list this year. It conducts AI research and builds video and world models, which are models that are trained on video and observational data to better reflect how the physical world works. The startup's customers include media organizations, studios, brands, designers, creatives and students. Runway's investors include General Atlantic, Baillie Gifford, Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures, among others. The model was "an overnight success that took like seven years," he said. "It does feel like a very interesting moment in time where the era of efficiency and research is upon us," Valenzuela said. "[We're] excited to be able to make sure that AI is not monopolized by two or three companies." Gen 4.5 is rolling out gradually, but it will be available to all of Runway's customers by the end of the week. "It will be available through Runway's platform, its application programming interface and through some of the company's partners," he said.

Corporate capital expenditures have surged in 2025, led by AI hyperscalers' sprawling infrastructure buildout, but JPMorgan says something odd is happening under the surface of the economy. As companies across industries continue a spate of layoffs in 2025, some business leaders have continued to argue that AI will ultimately create new jobs. However, a recent JPMorgan analysis challenges this narrative. The bank's data reveals that tech companies' big capex isn't having much of an impact on the labor market. Yet, as JPMorgan's outlook notes, 2025's capex boom has led to a "decoupling effect," in which the two have come apart. The bank's 2026 economic outlook looks at why this "decoupling" is unfolding in developed markets and highlights why investors should be concerned. The report includes even more data that may be troubling for investors. US payroll growth has fallen to 0.6% on an annualized basis. JPMorgan's analysts said that the kind of economic decoupling they're tracking is extremely unusual, making it hard to account for in a full-year outlook. "Accelerating capex amid a stall in job growth is hard to incorporate into the outlook. The tempered outlook suggests that JPMorgan's analysts see recession signals flashing red, even as tech companies continue to spend heavily on AI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia on Monday announced it has purchased $2 billion of Synopsys' common stock as part of a strategic partnership to accelerate computing and artificial intelligence engineering solutions. As part of the multiyear partnership, Nvidia will help Synopsys accelerate its portfolio of compute-intensive applications, advance agentic AI engineering, expand cloud access and develop joint go-to-market initiatives, according to a release. Nvidia said it purchased Synopsys' stock at $414.79 per share. "This is a huge deal," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Monday. Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom because it makes the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that are key to building and training AI models and running large workloads. Synopsys offers services like silicon design and electronic design automation that help its customers build AI-powered products. CEO Sassine Ghazi told CNBC that its partnership with Nvidia will help it take workloads that used to run for weeks and reduce them to hours. "We're going through a platform shift from classical, general-purpose computing running on CPUs to a new way of doing computing, accelerated computing running on GPUs," Huang said. Nvidia and Synopsys have a long-standing relationship, so Monday's announcement builds on their existing partnership. Huang said Nvidia was "built on a foundation of design tools from Synopsys." The partnership is not exclusive, which means that Nvidia and Synopsys can still work with other companies in the ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eli Lilly on Monday said it is lowering the cash prices of single-dose vials of its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound on its direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, building on efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the medicine more accessible. The announcement also comes weeks after chief rival Novo Nordisk unveiled additional discounts on the cash prices of its obesity and diabetes drugs. Starting Monday, cash-paying patients with a valid prescription can get the starting dose of Zepbound vials for as low as $299 per month on LillyDirect, down from a previous price of $349 per month. Zepbound carries a list price of roughly $1,086 per month. That price point, and spotty insurance coverage for weight loss drugs in the U.S., have been significant barriers to access for some patients. Eli Lilly's announcement comes just weeks after President Donald Trump inked deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to make their GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to get and afford. But Eli Lilly's deal with Trump centers around lowering the prices of a different form of Zepbound – a multi-dose pen – after it wins Food and Drug Administration approval. That means Eli Lilly's Monday announcement around cutting prices on the existing single-dose vials could allow more patients to get discounted treatments more quickly. "We will keep working to provide more options — expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access — so more people can get the medicines they need," said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly USA and global customer capabilities, in a statement. With single-dose vials, patients need to use a syringe and needle to draw up the medicine and inject it into themselves. Eli Lilly first introduced that form of Zepbound in August 2024. It's unclear how many patients are currently using single-dose vials of Zepbound. But Eli Lilly previously said that direct-to-consumer sales now account for more than a third of new prescriptions of Zepbound. That excludes the highest dose of Ozempic. The company also launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel stock fell Monday, sinking from a Friday surge when an analyst predicted the chip giant was nearing a deal to supply Apple in 2027. Shares of the chipmaker rose 10% on Friday after TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted on X that he expected Intel to begin shipping its lowest-end M processor to Apple as early as second or third quarter 2027. He said that his latest industry surveys indicate that "visibility on Intel becoming an advanced-node supplier to Apple has recently improved significantly." Apple's silicon chips for its iPhone, iPad and Mac products are currently supplied by TSMC. In his post, Kuo played down the potential Intel-Apple partnership's impact on the Taiwanese chip maker, saying that Apple is expected to remain "highly dependent" on the company's advanced nodes for the "foreseeable future." "In absolute terms, order volumes for the lowest-end M processor are relatively small and virtually no material impact on TSMC's fundamentals or its technology leadership over the next several years." Kuo added a deal with Intel would signal strong support from Apple for the Trump administration's push for its homegrown companies to manufacture in the U.S. Neither Intel nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment from CNBC. Intel's stock has seen a resurgence over the past 12 months after years of decline. Share price fell as low as $17.66 in April, before recovering over the past few months. "Apple is a potential major reference customer whose presence validates Intel's high-performance foundry offering," Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Global Equities, told CNBC. "If Intel pulls it off, there is potential to win higher volume and value business from Apple, for example CPU production for the iPhone, and win business from other large chip designers." Intel has had an up and down relationship with Apple since it first announced the chip giant's processors would power some products in 2005. Last week Intel was on the subject of a lawsuit filed by TSMC, in which it alleged one of its former senior vice president had leaked "confidential information" to the company.

Michael Burry is taking on a who's who of the world's biggest tech giants — and now he's picking a fight with Elon Musk. The investor of "The Big Short" fame called Tesla "ridiculously overvalued" in a post on his Substack released late Sunday evening, after previously disclosing bets against Nvidia and Palantir. "Tesla's market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time," Burry wrote, adding that he expects Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package to continue to dilute the company's shares. "As an aside, the Elon cult was all-in on electric cars until competition showed up, then all-in on autonomous driving until competition showed up, and now is all-in on robots — until competition shows up," the legendary investor said. It's not the first time Burry has taken aim at Tesla. The investor placed a bet against $530 million worth of Tesla shares in 2021 but exited the position a few months later, with Burry telling CNBC the move was "just a trade." Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's post. Burry is not the first to call Tesla overvalued. The company's shares trade at over 250 times its earnings, far higher than other carmakers, and fellow famed short-seller Jim Chanos also said in 2023 that Tesla was overvalued. The Cybertruck maker continues to dominate the EV market in the US, with around 41% market share as of August — but that number has fallen in recent years as competitors have rolled out more electric models. But Tesla faces fierce competition there too, from companies like Google-backed Waymo and Chinese robotics startup Unitree.</p>

Yesterday's classroom threat was: Use AI and you'll be caught. Today's is: Don't use it, and you'll be obsolete. As artificial intelligence becomes table stakes on Wall Street, business schools are racing to overhaul their programs for finance industry hopefuls. Wharton, the famed business school at the University of Pennsylvania, is introducing a new academic track built around AI, offering students classes that fold in psychology, ethics, and governance to help them understand how humans and machines will reshape business. In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University is establishing a new College of Connected Computing to meet the moment. Nationwide, insiders say a debate is underway about how to update business-school curricula that have long centered on traditional finance fundamentals — like accounting, statistics, and financial modeling — as the advanced technology races past anyone's ability to keep up. Jacqueline Arthur, global head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, told Business Insider that, as AI becomes more commonplace, the firm has doubled down on efforts to probe candidates' analytical thinking. New course offerings explore classes from interdisciplinary points of view, looking at how AI will change business and society from philosophical and psychological lenses. They include "Artificial Intelligence, Business, and Society," "Applied Machine Learning in Business," "Big Data, Big Responsibilities," and "AI in Our Lives," according to Wharton's online course listings. Students learn to query models, review results, and determine whether the underlying assumptions withstand business scrutiny. To accelerate the shift, Bradlow said, Wharton established an AI in Education Fund that provides faculty with funding, data, and technical support to integrate AI material into existing courses. Six months ago, a tech executive at a large private-equity firm, Bradlow, sought recommendations for hires who could sit at the intersection of business strategy and data science. "He hired every single one of them the next day." One is Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, which recently announced the creation of a standalone college that will be dedicated to advanced technologies in AI, computing, data science, and robotics. Though the school hasn't finalized its curricular programming, the College of Connected Computing is exploring where subjects overlap as part of its ongoing academic planning with Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management, the University told Business Insider in a statement. "Our teams are actively developing opportunities that reflect the rapidly evolving role of data, AI, and analytics in business education," Vanderbilt added. At the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, Steve Sibley, a professor who oversees the investment-banking workshop — a program that's sent students to leading banks including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Moelis — said faculty were exploring how to "pivot the curriculum" in light of AI's rise. Training The Street, which provides technical training to banks and early-career finance professionals, has launched a series of free online resources on how to use AI and data tools in finance roles. Recruiters say those changes mirror what Wall Street is looking for. "Many of the tasks junior employees would have traditionally performed will over time be automated, but that will really enable them to focus their attention on higher-value deliverables," said Arthur, Goldman's human global human capital management head. Training programs at Goldman incorporate AI lessons, she added, with new-hire development including hands-on experience with the firm's internal AI tools as well as instruction on responsible use and continuous human oversight. "Many of these quantitative analyses will be automated, but will we need our people to understand how to look at that and actually assess it and make sure that what the AI has delivered is actually right?"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sudan and Russia have resumed discussions over a deal under which Moscow would provide Su-30 and Su-35 fighter jets in exchange for rights to a naval logistics facility on the Red Sea. The Sudanese Defence Ministry is reportedly in talks with Russia to acquire Su-30 and Su-35 fighter aircraft, which would be provided in exchange for rights to build a major naval facility on the Red Sea, according to Military Watch Magazine. The development comes as Russia pushes to establish a permanent naval base in Africa, while Sudan seeks additional weapons for its ongoing conflict, despite repeated calls for a ceasefire from Western powers, particularly the United States. Those plans were disrupted after his government was overthrown in early 2019 amid riots and a Western-backed coup. The current discussions are seen as a renegotiation of a long-delayed agreement originally reached in 2020, which had been postponed due to political instability and, later, by the outbreak of war in Sudan. Russian Ambassador to Sudan Andrey Chernovol confirmed the pause, saying: “Given the current military conflict, movement on this issue has for now been halted.” The report also noted that Russia had formally stepped back from active construction planning, prompting a reassessment of the deal rather than its cancellation. Under the original agreement, Russia would have been allowed to establish a logistics hub at Port Sudan, capable of hosting up to four warships and about 300 personnel. The deal also granted Moscow the right to bring in weapons, ammunition, air-defence systems and electronic warfare equipment to support naval operations. Sudan's northern neighbour Egypt previously ordered Su-35 jets in 2018 but cancelled the deal under Western political and economic pressure. However, Russia has not publicly documented a deal exactly like the proposed Sudan arrangement, where fighter aircraft would be supplied in exchange for rights to build and operate a naval base. The Sudan case appears to be a rare instance of linking advanced combat aircraft supply directly to overseas military basing rights, reflecting Russia's strategic interest in securing a foothold on the Red Sea.
