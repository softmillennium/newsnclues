                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jets of water burst from cracks close to the moon's south pole. The European Space Agency (ESA) has announced a mission to Saturn's moon Enceladus, as it has all the ingredients needed for lifeforms. Enceladus is Saturn's sixth-largest moon, a 500 km-wide icy world famed for its south polar geysers spewing water plumes from a subsurface ocean. Artist's impression depicts thermal plumes venting from the southern polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus. The moon's icy shell is thought to overlay a global ocean. ESA said: "No space agency has ever landed on Enceladus. And yet this moon has enormous potential for new science, particularly in the realm of habitability. The agency added that the moon has liquid water, a source of energy, and a specific set of chemical elements. Agency officials described Enceladus as a "top target for us" and plan to send a spacecraft to land on the moon. This artist's impression shows a cross section of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus, which includes a rocky core, an ocean and an icy shell. "The impact of such a mission could be enormous for Europe and beyond. The mission would boost European competences in many scientific and technological fields, including in-orbit assembly, operating in extreme environments, landing technologies, and novel scientific instrumentation. "Decisions at our upcoming Council at Ministerial level will be crucial for securing Europe's leadership in planetary science for decades to come.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a specialist pointed out “low activity” in her frontal lobe, a finding he clarified wasn't linked to Alzheimer's or major mental health issues, Kim still seemed rattled. Dr. Daniel Amen, who had scanned several Kardashian family members in past seasons, walked her through the results. He added, "The front part of your brain is less active than it should be," and explained that this could make stress management harder while she prepared for the California bar exam. Kardashian had already mentioned on an earlier episode that a Prenuvo scan found an aneurysm that had been in her brain for years. She recalled asking specialists what could cause a rupture, and doctors reportedly said, "Just stress." Once the episode aired, many viewers commented on social media, and their posts shaped a broad range of theories. For example, @EmeryEXP posted claims that the storyline might set the stage for a future tech tie-in, writing that it could lead to her getting a NeuroLink and then passing the bar "to 'prove' it works." @eitherwayitgoes had the same theory, writing, "Wait till everyone realizes this is just a soft launch for her to launch a partnership with Neuralink (or another AI brain chip company like that)." Meanwhile, @thejrney echoed that claim and said, "This sh*t writes itself." "Is she laying the groundwork for a neuralink deal," wrote @tyleroakley. Others pushed back on the science behind her scan. You literally cannot have 'low brain activity' in your frontal lobe without being lobotomized." Then @spookistan weighed in on private clinics that offer "poorly-interpetable scans," and @curryinahurry22 replied that such places "take advantage of the people with loads of money who will go to any ends of the earth to 'optimize' their health." Likewise, @YaoiYarnYearner reminded people that ableist insults were unnecessary. They said, "What was found in her scan has nothing to do with intelligence. It's something that can happen to every person under stress and is often reversible." Additionally, some people online blamed long-term health stressors or potentially the effects of COVID instead. As @steves_beebs suggested, it could be "the expected brain damage from multiple covid infections (or Lyme disease)." The internet is chaotic—but we'll break it down for you in one daily email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Australian senator has used a government committee meeting to raise his concerns over McLaren's treatment of Oscar Piastri. Matt Canavan put the question forward after McLaren's tactical error in yesterday's Qatar Grand Prix cost Piastri victory to Max Verstappen and dropped his team mate Lando Norris to fourth place. So do you think McLaren is biased against Oscar Piastri and costing him the world championship?” Canavan did not explain why he suspects McLaren would try to stop one of its own drivers winning the championship. However similar theories have circulated on social media for a variety of reasons. Piastri is one of three drivers vying for the title along with team mate Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown recently said it was “frustrating” to hear accusations the team might favour Norris over Piastri. Norris is the current championship leader and joined the team as part of its junior programme six years before Piastri.

Just some uninformed politician trying to appear to be a man of the people and score political points. The problem with social media (like here too I guess) is that it ends up either/or. Either McLaren favour Norris or they don't. However it is possible to accept that McLaren have made decisions that have ended up favouring one driver (Norris in Qatar) without them having some covert policy to back one or the other. More subtly, drivers have different levels and kinds of influence within a team, make more or less persuasive arguments after some point of conflict arises, attract more or less funding or media attention. It would be naive to think McLaren are immune to these factors, even though they clearly do have a policy of ‘equal treatment.' Finally some race situations inevitably involve options that have positive or negative effects for one or the other driver – the Qatar SC being a perfect example. Perhaps they thought it was the least unequal. Perhaps they thought it was the least unequal. You are probably right, but what surprised me most is that (it seemed that) McLaren didn't review this scenario during their pre-race strategy gameplay. There was a reasonable chance that Verstappen would overtake one of their cars, and then it's just defining the SC windows. I don't think the order of the drivers was surprising either (Verstappen passing Norris and still being ahead was high probability). I'm fairly convinced now they calculated everything and decided that leaving both out was less damaging to Norris and – maybe the same wishful thinking they had later in the race, thinking Piastri could chase down Verstappen – they thought both drivers had a reasonable chance of finishing on the podium still or even in P1 and P2. I don't think it was equal in the end because it prevented Piastri from the race win. In almost any other circumstance, I think they'd have pitted the lead driver, then leading the race, and secured his win. That would have been ‘fair' in the sense that Piastri had already earned the lead and chance to win. So basically there's a difference between ‘fair' and ‘equal'. There was an argument from Stella that they thought Piastri pitting would lead to Verstappen staying out, but at the same time he said that they felt Norris was at risk of being double-stacked and losing more places. It is usual that in the case of dominance of one team, the matter is resolved after the first turn, but I have not yet experienced such an outcome after seven laps. Aware that irreparable damage had been done, except in the case of the safety car, it was hard for me to see this through. Neither Oscar nor Lando deserved something like this. i think my mums even got an opinion on this one and she's about as clued up on F1 as this fella. This is what happened with Senna Prost as it went off the back pages to be actual news, in an era where it had a far lower profile  – all sport did.

At this point in history, astronomers and engineers who grew up watching Deep Impact and Armageddon, two movies about the destructive power of asteroid impacts, are likely in relatively high ranking positions at space agencies. ), look at what might potentially happen if a "killer" asteroid is found on approach to Earth. A new paper, available in pre-print on arXiv, from Maxime Devogèle of ESA's Near Earth Object (NEO) Coordination Centre and his colleagues analyzes a dry run that happened around a year ago with the discovery of asteroid 2024 YR4. While the asteroid early-warning system largely worked as intended, reviewing this first-ever scenario for this particular type of asteroid is worthwhile, as it surely won't be the last one. Importantly, each category is based on a risk assessment of both it's probability of impact and also the potential damage it can cause. On January 27th of 2025, 2024 YR4 was officially listed as a 3 on the Torino scale, eventually winding up with a 3.1% percent impact chance on February 18th, and making it the first ever asteroid to reach that level of the scale. In fact, Apophis could never have been classified as a 3 on the Torino scale, because its larger size would have caused regional rather than localized devastation - but, it's also important to note that the threat level was downgraded much more quickly than that of 2024 YR4. After hitting that high on the scale, the discussion about 2024 YR4 moved from pure scientific fact-finding to wider consideration of a threat to potentially large parts of humanity. The system worked exactly as intended - it got attention. Certainly plenty from the public, and even some policy makers.
