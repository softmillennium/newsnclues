                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancer remains one of the most critical global public health challenges, exerting profound social, economic, and clinical burdens while limiting gains in human life expectancy. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, treatment failure and cancer recurrence are frequently driven by a subset of resistant tumor cells that evade conventional programmed cell death pathways. The scientific community has thus been actively exploring strategies to engage alternative intracellular "death switches" within malignant cells. In recent years, the discovery of novel immunogenic cell death modalities—such as pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis—has reinvigorated anticancer efforts. These mechanisms can remodel the tumor microenvironment, effectively converting immunologically "cold" tumors into "hot" ones, thereby augmenting the efficacy of immunotherapy. In a groundbreaking 2024 study published in Science, a new form of cell death, termed triaptosis, was first reported. This process is mechanistically distinct from all previously known cell death pathways. In a mouse model of prostate cancer, oral administration of menadione to induce triaptosis resulted in superior tumor control compared to standard clinical regimens, with a favorable safety profile, highlighting its promising translational potential. In this context, the research team led by Associate Professor Lin-Lin Bu fromWuhan University School and Hospital of Stomatology, has published a comprehensive review entitled "Triaptosis and Cancer: Next Hope?" This article systematically elaborates the triaptosis pathway from molecular mechanism to therapeutic application, detailing its signaling cascade, discussing the central role of oxidative stress homeostasis in cancer, and offering a forward-looking perspective on future directions—collectively underscoring the compelling potential of triaptosis as a novel anticancer strategy. The mechanism of triaptosis targets a vulnerability inherent in many cancer cells. To sustain rapid proliferation, cancer cells often exhibit a heightened dependence on their endomembrane trafficking system. By specifically disrupting endosomal function, triaptosis may precisely strike this "Achilles' heel." Moreover, triaptosis holds considerable promise for combination with immunotherapy. Although its immunogenic potential remains unverified, endosomes play an indispensable role in antigen presentation and immune cell activation. Therefore, inducing triaptosis may not only kill tumor cells but also stimulate a specific antitumor immune response, potentially synergizing with immune checkpoint inhibitors to effectively convert "cold" tumors into "hot" ones. Furthermore, since triaptosis operates independently of canonical apoptotic pathways, it may offer a final-line therapeutic option for patients resistant to existing treatments. To maximize efficacy and minimize side effects, intelligent drug delivery systems capable of precise tumor targeting should be engineered. In addition, elucidating the crosstalk between triaptosis and other cell death modalities may inform the design of sophisticated combination therapies and offer new avenues to overcome treatment resistance. It is worth noting that preliminary evidence suggests menadione also shows efficacy in a non-cancer disease, indicating that the implications of triaptosis may extend well beyond oncology. The discovery of triaptosis not only expands our understanding of fundamental biological processes governing cell death but also represents a promising strategy in the fight against cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, lung cancer has been associated with stigma, anxiety, and loss. Advances in screening, therapeutics, and survivorship have created a new reality; lung cancer is treatable, survivable, and increasingly understood as a chronic disease for many. A special issue of the Journal of the American College of Radiology, published by Elsevier and in collaboration with the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT), details this transformation, outlining how radiology is moving beyond disease detection to providing equitable care and becoming a champion of patient dignity. A crosscutting theme reflected in this special issue is the move from counting scans to measuring impact across the full continuum of care. Lung cancer screening has matured into a system of care. It is not merely about increasing uptake; it is about ensuring that those who are screened are reached equitably, managed appropriately, and supported holistically. Lisa Carter-Bawa, PhD, MPH, Co-Guest Editor, Center for Discovery and Innovation at Hackensack Meridian Health, Nutley, NJ, and Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC The special issue's articles detail the full scope of lung cancer screening, covering eligibility requirements (including the potential to leverage high mammography participation to engage women), strategies for increasing uptake through community-based interventions and state-level policy, a discussion of screening harms such as "scanxiety" as well as radiation dose management, and persistent implementation issues like system operability, challenges in rural cross-specialty collaboration, and cannabis use among screened individuals. Co-Guest Editor Ashley Prosper, MD, Department of Radiological Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, notes, "Clinical trials and reports from real-world screening programs have confirmed that lung cancer screening is a worthwhile endeavor with the potential to significantly improve lung cancer outcomes. Maximizing this positive impact requires a combination of strategic multidisciplinary partnerships, effective communication, and informatics tools-closing data gaps between radiology, primary care, and oncology, which are foundational to timely diagnosis, appropriate follow-up, and equitable outcomes." Co-Guest Editor Julie Barta, MD, Jane and Leonard Korman Respiratory Institute, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, observes that "Although we know that lung cancer screening improves early detection and reduces lung cancer mortality, there is still much work to do in understanding how we identify high-risk patients for screening and deliver high-quality care." The contributors emphasize that achieving this systemic transformation requires a unified effort to dismantle the historical stigma and fear associated with the disease and replace it with a message of hope. Everyone and every patient deserve to know that. "The question is no longer whether lung cancer screening saves lives-it does- but how we ensure that its benefits are realized broadly, equitably, and with dignity. Radiology is uniquely positioned to lead this charge," concludes Dr. Carter-Bawa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an increasingly acute surgeon shortage, artificial intelligence could help fill the gap, coaching medical students as they practice surgical techniques. A new tool, trained on videos of expert surgeons at work, offers students real-time personalized advice as they practice suturing. Initial trials suggest AI can be a powerful substitute teacher for more experienced students. The provider shortage is ever increasing and we need to find new ways to provide more and better opportunities for practice. Right now, an attending surgeon who already is short on time needs to come in and watch students practice, and rate them, and give them detailed feedback-that just doesn't scale," said senior author Mathias Unberath, an expert in AI assisted medicine who focuses on how people interact with AI. "The next best thing might be our explainable AI that shows students how their work deviates from expert surgeons." Developed at Johns Hopkins University, the pioneering technology was showcased and honored at the recent International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention. Currently many medical students watch videos of experts performing surgery and try to imitate what they see. The team's model incorporates what's known as "explainable AI," an approach to AI that – in this example – will rate how well a student closes a wound and then also tell them precisely how to improve. Learners want someone to tell them objectively how they did. We can calculate their performance before and after the intervention and see if they are moving closer to expert practice." Catalina Gomez, first author, a Johns Hopkins PhD student in computer science All participants practiced closing an incision with stitches. "In some individuals the AI feedback has a big effect," Unberath said. "Beginner students still struggled with the task but students with a solid foundation in surgery, who are at the point where they can incorporate the advice, it had a great impact." They hope to eventually create a version that students could use at home. "We'd like to offer computer vision and AI technology that allows someone to practice in the comfort of their home with a suturing kit and a smart phone," Unberath said. "This will help us scale up training in the medical fields. It's really about how can we use this technology to solve problems."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smell dysfunction is present in more than 130 neurological, somatic and hereditary disorders, with some evidence suggesting a causal role. And researchers are calling for a worldwide campaign to put smell health on the map - with screening, education and awareness at its core. However, smell remains a Cinderella sense which has lagged behind sight and hearing in terms of its perceived importance. Smell health underpins good nutrition, cognitive function, and psychological resilience. Even before the emergence of Covid-19, smell disorders were very common but under-rated, under-researched, and under-treated sensory loss. Smell issues occur in at least 139 different neurological, physical, and inherited conditions. Research suggests smell loss may play a causal role because it often appears early and can predict future health issues. Increasing evidence has shown that smell loss is an independent risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, increased frailty and reduced longevity." Prof Carl Philpott, lead researcher from UEA's Norwich Medical School To address this gap, the team are calling for education, awareness campaigns, and targeted public health policies that make smell health a priority. Prof Philpott said: "The sense of smell should be promoted as an essential pillar of health, as it enables good nutrition and cognitive and psychological well-being. "Inclusive efforts are particularly needed to ensure equity and diversity, particularly given the current demographic as those seeking help are typically not from a diverse cross-section of the community," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research team led by RMIT University have created tiny particles, known as nanodots, made from a metallic compound that can kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells largely unharmed. While this work is still at the cell-culture stage – it hasn't been tested in animals or people – it points to a new strategy for designing cancer treatments that exploit cancer's own weaknesses. The particles are made from molybdenum oxide, a compound based on a rare metal called molybdenum, which is often used in electronics and alloys. The study's lead researcher Professor Jian Zhen Ou and Dr Baoyue Zhang, from the School of Engineering, said tweaking the chemical makeup made the particles release reactive oxygen molecules – unstable forms of oxygen that can damage cell components and trigger cell death. Importantly, they worked without needing light, which is unusual for this kind of technology. Cancer cells already live under higher stress than healthy ones. Our particles push that stress a little further – enough to trigger self-destruction in cancer cells, while healthy cells cope just fine." The collaboration involved Dr Shwathy Ramesan at The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne and researchers from institutions in China including Southeast University, Hong Kong Baptist University and Xidian University, with support from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Optical Microcombs (COMBS). "The result was particles that generate oxidative stress selectively in cancer cells under lab conditions," she said. This fine tuning changed how the particles handled electrons, helping them produce more of the reactive oxygen molecules that drive cancer cells into apoptosis – the body's natural clean-up process for damaged cells. Most current cancer treatments affect both cancerous and healthy tissue. Because these particles are based on a common metal oxide rather than expensive or toxic noble metals like gold or silver, they could also be cheaper and safer to develop. The COMBS team at RMIT is continuing this work, with next steps including: Ultrathin Multi‐Doped Molybdenum Oxide Nanodots as a Tunable Selective Biocatalyst.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research among older adults with sleep apnea reveals that verbal memory performance is significantly worse in women - but not in men - who also have insomnia. Results show that older adults with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea - often referred to as COMISA - demonstrated worse memory performance than those with sleep apnea alone. This interaction remained significant even after adjusting for age, body mass index, sleep apnea severity, and education. However, when analyzed by sex, COMISA was significantly associated with worse verbal memory outcomes in women, but not in men. "We expected that having both insomnia and sleep apnea would worsen memory for everyone, but only older women showed this vulnerability. That was striking, especially because women typically outperform men on verbal memory tasks," said lead author Breanna Holloway, who has a doctorate in clinical psychology and behavioral medicine and is a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego School of Medicine. "The fact that COMISA seemed to offset that advantage hints at a hidden sleep-related pathway to cognitive decline in women. Prior studies have shown increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease in women with untreated sleep apnea." According to the authors, sex differences in sleep architecture may explain the cognitive vulnerability observed in women with COMISA. Post hoc analyses revealed that women with COMISA had reduced rapid eye movement sleep and more slow wave sleep compared with men, underscoring the importance of considering sex-specific patterns when evaluating COMISA. These results point to an overlooked risk in women with both insomnia and sleep apnea. Because women are more likely to have insomnia and often go undiagnosed for sleep apnea, recognizing and treating COMISA early could help protect memory and reduce dementia risk." Dr. Atul Malhotra, the Peter C. Farrell Presidential Endowed Chair in Pulmonary Medicine at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and pulmonologist at UC San Diego Health, was the principal investigator for this study. Comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA) is associated with worse verbal episodic memory in older women.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the largest MRI-based studies comparing knee injuries between men and women reveals surprising differences in injury patterns based on gender and age. The findings, which can be used to improve risk assessment and develop early intervention strategies, will be presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). The majority of past research has focused on men, but as we expand our focus to include women, the more we see that they have different risk profiles and are prone to different injuries." Jenifer Pitman, M.D., study co-author, assistant professor of radiology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institute in Baltimore, Maryland The study included 13,549 consecutive routine knee MRI exams performed between 2019 and 2024 at four outpatient radiology facilities affiliated with Johns Hopkins Hospital. The patients reported knee pain as their chief complaint. Tears in the menisci can happen with twisting injuries or gradual wear and tear over time. "We saw more ACL tears in men especially in the 20- to 40-year-old age group, which is contrary to what's been reported in the literature," said first author Ali Ghasemi, M.D., postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins. "Prior studies focused on sports-related injuries have shown that young women athletes have increased rates of and a greater risk for ACL tears. However, our results show a significantly higher prevalence of ACL injuries in male patients across all age groups." Dr. Pitman theorized the discrepancy between their research and previous studies may be due to broadening their focus beyond sports-related knee injuries. Men had a greater number of injuries overall. "In younger patients, meniscal and MCL tears were more commonly seen in men, while in older patients, women had more of these types of tears than men, which was unexpected," Dr. Ghasemi said. "Both men and women should take precautions to avoid high-impact injuries, especially during sports or physical activity and women, especially over 40, should pay attention to joint health and consider incorporating dedicated strength training to help protect their knees as they age," Dr. Pitman said. Recognizing the injury patterns may help radiologists and clinicians tailor imaging protocols, risk assessments and early intervention strategies to optimize patient outcomes. "Radiologists can also expect to see more frequent meniscal pathology and arthritis in older women." The researchers are continuing their investigation into knee injury patterns by gender, analyzing demographic information and patient history to better understand trends in injury patterns. Dr. Pitman said that athletes should consider working with a health professional to build balanced strength around the knee. She advises individuals-especially older patients-with knee pain to see their physician. Other co-authors are Shivani Ahlawat, M.D., and Laura M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients with major depressive disorder, including those who have not responded to first-line antidepressants, may benefit from short-term nitrous oxide treatment, a major meta-analysis led by the University of Birmingham has found. The new paper published in eBioMedicine today has assessed the best available clinical information to show how clinically administered nitrous oxide (N2O) can offer fast-acting depressive symptom relief for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). It affects approximately 48% of UK patients who experience limited benefit from standard treatments, according to a previous study* led by the research team. Each research study looked at the use of nitrous oxide, also used as pain relief in a range of medical situations, for treating depressive disorders, including MDD, TRD and bipolar depression. The team found that a single treatment of inhaled clinical nitrous oxide at 50% concentration (in three trials), produced rapid and significant reductions in depressive symptoms within 24 hours, although these effects were not sustained at one week. It is thought to target glutamate receptors in a similar way to ketamine, another rapid-acting antidepressant, and this may help explain why improvements in mood can be observed soon after inhalation. Depression is a debilitating illness, made even more so by the fact that antidepressants make no meaningful difference for almost half of all patients diagnosed with it. There is a growing body of research on repurposing treatments from other clinical domains to alleviate low mood. This study brings together the best possible evidence indicating that nitrous oxide has the potential to provide swift and clinically significant short-term improvements in patients with severe depression. Importantly, it provides a foundation for future trials to investigate repeated and carefully managed dosing strategies that can further determine how best to use this treatment in clinical practice for patients who don't respond to conventional interventions." The meta-analysis of studies found strong evidence for short-term improvements in mood following nitrous oxide administration. Due to the limited number of existing trials, there was notable variability in how depressive symptoms were measured and reported, as well as in the timing of these assessments. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose, nitrous oxide's long-term safety, and the best way to integrate it into existing treatment pathways. While higher dosing (at 50% concentration) increased the likelihood of these side effects, none of the studies reported any short-term safety concerns. The researchers emphasised that longer-term safety must be assessed through future studies with extended follow-up periods. Professor Steven Marwaha from the University of Birmingham, Honorary Consultant Psychiatrist at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust, and senior author of the study said: "This is a significant milestone in understanding the potential of nitrous oxide as an added treatment option for patients with depression who have been failed by current treatments. These findings highlight the urgent need for new treatments that can complement existing care pathways, and further evidence is needed to understand how this approach can best support people living with severe depression." The team are working on improving treatment options for treatment-resistant depression in superdiverse and deprived populations. The Centre aims to accelerate the development and delivery of innovative, evidence-based interventions to improve outcomes and reduce disparities in mental health care. This work also aligns with ongoing efforts within the Birmingham Clinic for Advanced Mood Disorder Management (CALM), where innovative, evidence-based treatments such as ketamine and neuromodulation are being delivered to people with severe or treatment-resistant depression. Building on this translational pathway from discovery to clinical practice, the team is now preparing the first NHS trial in the UK to assess whether nitrous oxide can be delivered safely and acceptably as a treatment for major depression. The findings will help determine how nitrous oxide could be integrated into NHS care and may expand the range of innovative options available for patients who have not benefited from standard approaches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Distributing food stamps soon could get even harder for Missouri's food aid system, which a federal judge has already called "broken and inaccessible." States depend heavily on federal funds to operate their food stamp programs, which help feed about 42 million people nationwide. But a new federal law has restructured the nation's food assistance, requiring more people to work to qualify for aid and shifting more of the program's cost onto states over the next decade. More than a year ago, for example, a federal judge ruled that Missouri's food aid system was "overwhelmed," had wrongly denied assistance to applicants, and had caused many to go hungry as a "direct result of the system's inadequacy." Despite the court order, not much has changed, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state performance metrics. Missouri's ongoing problems foreshadow the trouble that lies ahead for state food aid programs nationwide. Food assistance advocates have said Missouri is just one example of a nationwide problem in which strained state systems struggle to deliver timely aid. For example, low-income people in Alaska have faced chronic backlogs while the state has spent years trying to fix the problem. Last year, then-U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack sent letters to 44 governors urging swifter application processing and greater accuracy in determining benefits. The Trump administration refused to use emergency funds to keep the food aid program running, and food benefits lapsed for millions of people, including in Missouri, on Nov. 1 as the shutdown dragged into its fifth week. The shutdown ended Nov. 12, and Missouri said its SNAP recipients began receiving their full benefits three days later. Meanwhile, as Thanksgiving approached, benefit delays were still being reported in some states. Even after the shutdown, states will have to do more with fewer resources. Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashes billions in federal funding to the food aid program and pushes more of the administrative and financial burden to states. That represents a 20% cut, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The change will cause at least 2.4 million Americans to lose aid, according to an analysis from the bipartisan Congressional Research Service. Expanding work requirements will harm some of the nation's most vulnerable people, said Ed Bolen, who leads food aid strategies at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Some Missourians were already struggling before Trump signed the bill. Kelly Thweatt, 64, said she received a notice in the mail that her food benefits had been cut back. She didn't understand why, because her income hadn't changed, she said recently outside a SNAP office 60 miles west of St. Louis. The roughly $300 in SNAP benefits she had received every month kept her afloat. Thweatt will be subject to the new federal work requirement because she's not yet 65. She's been out of the workforce for nearly 20 years. Food aid provides a lifeline to more than 650,000 Missourians — that's more than eight sold-out crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, where the NFL's Chiefs play. The program helps feed 20% of Missouri's children every month, according to the Missouri Foundation for Health, a nonprofit philanthropic organization. (The foundation provides financial support to KFF Health News.) For years, thousands of Missourians have struggled to tap into food assistance, largely because applicants must complete an interview, over the phone or in person. But many Missourians can't get through to a state staffer. At times, so many people have been waiting on hold that the phone system started hanging up on people, the lawsuit says. In a statement provided to KFF Health News, the Missouri Department of Social Services said that because demand varies by location, it may be appropriate to have a single staffer in some places. A sign sitting on the floor asks applicants to "please be patient with our progress" as the state works on technology improvements. According to Harpool's order, the "evidence is undisputed" that Missouri's food aid system has "unacceptable wait times" and that thousands of calls "cannot be completed." These problems put Missourians at risk of losing aid "each and every time" they apply for food benefits, the judge wrote. In an order released in May of this year, Harpool found that Missouri failed to show significant improvement and that its performance deteriorated by some measures. The state hadn't documented adding a single staffer or investing any additional resources to process applications faster, Harpool wrote. Missouri's Department of Social Services said the state legislature has provided money to hire temporary workers in other areas, freeing up staff to process SNAP applications. To complete the required interviews for food aid, the agency said, it makes multiple attempts to reach applicants once an application is received. Katie Deabler, an attorney with National Center for Law and Economic Justice who represented Missourians in the case, said, "These are your neighbors, these are your kids' classmates who are going hungry when the system doesn't work." Roughly 68% of the state's food aid recipients are children, adults over 60, or people with a disability, according to the Missouri Foundation for Health. "For a state like Missouri that is already struggling to operate the program, these new rules couldn't come at a worse time," said Bolen, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Missouri foreshadows the trouble that lies ahead for other states, he said. Like Missouri, many states are reluctant to fund their food aid programs. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson previously described the cost shift to states as "modest" and said it's necessary to reduce fraud. Still, if states do not come up with the money to fill the gap, Bolen said, they'll be left with two options: Make it harder for people to qualify for SNAP, or end the program entirely. For Thweatt, the change comes at a particularly hard moment. A few months ago, she lost her life partner of three decades, leaving her reeling and struggling to afford the basics. Thweatt's car needs repairs and its license plates are set to expire, she said. She doesn't have the money to address either problem. "I can satisfy myself with a bag of chips per day," Thweatt said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study of data from seven outpatient facilities in the New York region found that 20-24% of all the breast cancers diagnosed during an 11-year period were found in women age 18 to 49, according to research being presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). This research shows that a significant proportion of cancers are diagnosed in women under 40, a group for whom there are no screening guidelines at this time. Consideration must be given by physicians caring for women in this age group to performing risk assessment in order to identify those who may benefit from more intensive screening due to being higher risk." Stamatia Destounis, M.D., radiologist Elizabeth Wende Breast Care (EWBC) in Rochester, New York Emerging national trends highlight a rising incidence of breast cancer in younger women, prompting re-evaluation of age-based screening thresholds and risk stratification strategies. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer based on certain factors could benefit from a breast MRI and a mammogram every year, typically starting at age 30, but there currently are no guidelines in place for younger women. Dr. Destounis, along with her colleague Andrea L. Arieno, B.S., research manager at EWBC, sought to identify cancers diagnosed from 2014 through 2024 in a community practice consisting of seven outpatient facilities over a 200-mile radius in the Western New York region. They identified all breast cancers in the 18 to 49 age group and collected information from clinical imaging reports. "We specifically collected details on how the cancer was found (screening or diagnostic), the type of cancer and other tumor characteristics," Dr. Destounis said. "We excluded cases that were not primary breast cancer. We analyzed trends over time by age subgroups, detection method and tumor biology. This helped us to identify how breast cancer presents in this patient population, how frequently it occurs and the types of tumors found." A total of 1,799 breast cancers were diagnosed in 1,290 women, aged 18 to 49. Annual breast cancer diagnoses in this group ranged from 145 to 196, with a mean age at diagnosis of 42.6 years (range 23-49). "Most of these cancers were invasive, meaning they could spread beyond the breast, and many were aggressive types-especially in women under 40," Dr. Destounis said. Even though women under 50 made up 21% to 25% of the patients that were screened yearly, they consistently accounted for one out of every four breast cancers found each year. "This is striking because it shows that younger women not only carry a stable and substantial share of the breast cancer burden, but their tumors are often biologically aggressive," she said. "That means this problem is not going away," she said. Dr. Destounis cautioned that younger patients should be informed to be aware of changes in their breasts and to start screening in certain cases. "Those with a strong family history or genetic mutation, as well as certain minorities and ethnic backgrounds, are at higher risk for breast cancer at a younger age," she said. "We can't rely only on age alone to decide who should be screened," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Historically, it has been one of the most difficult to manage and cure. However, “the research story in lung cancer is an unbelievably positive one, Daniel Boffa, MD, professor of thoracic surgery at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, and the vice chair for the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, told Medscape Medical News. “If you go back a decade, it's almost doubled,” he said. This improvement is the result of the research effort in this field, which has led to major advances in surgery and personalized treatments, Boffa explained. Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and quitting smoking save lives. There are notable accessibility issues related to both lung cancer screening and smoking cessation programs, Maureen George, PhD, a pulmonary clinical nurse and a professor of nursing at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, told Medscape Medical News. The adoption of lung cancer screening with LDCT scans has allowed early diagnoses when treatments are easier on patients, and remission is much more likely. New research published in JAMA, based on the 2024 National Health Interview Survey, found that if all eligible individuals were screened, an estimated 62,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented and over 870,000 life-years gained within 5 years. This represents an increase of more than 300% compared with current screening uptake levels. The analysis also revealed that nearly 30,000 potentially preventable deaths over 5 years occur in smokers who do not meet the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening criteria. Accessibility issues are compounded by racial and socioeconomic disparities, meaning that the communities most burdened by lung cancer are often the most disenfranchised from care, said George. “Even if it requires a subway ride, which might seem simple to some people, but not for others, means those in rural settings who should participate in LDCT screening don't,” she said. Compounding this is the fact that people of color and those living in poverty face a “soup of exposures” — including poor air quality from ambient pollution and industry — that elevate their risk. Yet these environmental factors are not incorporated into screening criteria. Recent research suggests that current eligibility criteria for screening inadequately identify high-risk populations, such as those with a genetic predisposition or other risk factors like exposure to certain chemicals and exclude approximately 50% of adults diagnosed with lung cancer. Every year, an estimated 20000 people who have never smoked die of lung cancer in the US. Moreover, approximately 4700 cases of lung cancer are diagnosed among adults younger than 50 years each year. Quitting smoking is the single most effective step to prevent lung cancer. It is also associated with better treatment outcomes, fewer complications, and can add up to 1.8 years of survival for patients with lung cancer. Quitting smoking is hard work, but the health benefits are well worth it, Boffa said. Despite the prospect of better health, many people find quitting smoking an insurmountable obstacle. A lack of community-based resources and overburdened healthcare providers may make it difficult for patients to access or be referred to screening and smoking cessation programs, George said. But “some people just don't want to [quit smoking],” Katrina Roux-Bernstein, a nurse practitioner who specializes in pulmonology at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center, told Medscape Medical News. Effective cessation involves exploring these feelings and motivations through positive interviewing, helping patients examine what they enjoy about smoking and connecting it to their emotions, she said. When patients express enjoyment of smoking, Roux-Bernstein uses this as an opening to dig deeper: “It's a great opportunity to open it up and ask them, ‘What about smoking do you enjoy? Through these discussions, patients sometimes realize that their morning cigarette, for example, doesn't truly make them happy, prompting deeper insight and conversation about motivation and habits, Roux-Bernstein said. This means taking what the patient says (even if negative or resistant) and reframing it in a more constructive, optimistic way, helping patients see new perspectives. “I frequently talk with patients about the benefits of quitting smoking, such as having better health, saving money, feeling less social stigma, and gaining their time back,” she said. She also encourages celebrating progress and focusing on positive reinforcement, for example, rewarding oneself with the money saved from not buying cigarettes, or recognizing immediate health improvements. “There have never been better tools and support to help people quit,” said Boffa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A systematic analysis showed that 1 in 2 people, ie, nearly half the US population, is affected by a neurologic disease or disorder. The findings are “an urgent call to action,” Natalia Rost, MD, MPH, president of the American Academy of Neurology, said in a news release. With these efforts, led by neurologists and neuroscientists, the experts in brain health, we can improve brain health for all,” she added. The study was published online on November 24 in JAMA Neurology. Nervous system disorders span the entire lifespan, from neonatal and congenital conditions to neurodevelopmental disorders, migraine, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, and the neurologic effects of systemic illnesses such as diabetes. Global data suggest that about one third of people worldwide live with a disorder affecting nervous system function. Until now most national assessments have primarily focused on age-related neurologic diseases and have largely overlooked the contribution of congenital, neonatal, neurodevelopmental, and systemic conditions from birth to older age, the investigators noted. To address this research gap and understand the true national impact of neurologic diseases, the authors used Global Burden of Disease 2021 data to aggregate 36 conditions and quantify the prevalence, disability, mortality, and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to neurologic disorders. They estimated the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), a measure used to assess disease burden, by summing YLDs and YLLs for each condition, age, sex, location, and year. Results showed that in 2021, 54.2% of individuals in the US, or 180.3 million individuals were affected by at least one neurologic disorder or disease. Stroke was the leading cause of net health loss at 3.9 million DALYs. From 1990 to 2021, there was a sharp rise in the US neurologic disease burden. The prevalence of neurologic disorders increased by 34.4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 31.7%-37.4%), and DALYs climbed by 55.2% (95% UI, 48.3%-62.5%) — a far greater increase than seen globally. This pattern shows that much of the rise in neurologic disease burden is linked to an older US population that is more vulnerable to conditions affecting the nervous system,” study investigator John Ney, MD, MPH, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, said in the release. In addition to stroke, the analysis showed that Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were major drivers of health loss, accounting for 3.3 million DALYs. Overall age-standardized prevalence of nervous system disorders remained essentially unchanged since 1990, but YLDs increased by nearly 10%, reflecting a shift toward chronic, disabling conditions rather than mortality. The researchers also found notable sex differences, with migraine and multiple sclerosis more common in women, while Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder were more common in men. The authors urged increased investment in research, more clinical trials for effective therapies, and better access to neurologists and disability care.
