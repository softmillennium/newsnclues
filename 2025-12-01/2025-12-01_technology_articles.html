                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Expedia Group operates at a scale few can match, and we invest deeply in our talent, giving technologists the space to learn, experiment, and push the boundaries of what AI can do.” — Textio co-founder and former CEO Kieran Snyder returned to Microsoft as vice president of AI transformation. “My goal in this new role is to help Microsoft be the best living case study of effective, human AI transformation in the world,” Snyder said on LinkedIn. Snyder began her tech career at Microsoft in 2004, working on the Bing search engine and Windows. In 2014, she launched Textio, which claims to be the first-to-market venture using AI for HR functions. Over the past two years, Snyder ran a business called “nerd processor,” which offered research and leadership coaching, and served as chief scientist emeritus at Textio, where she is now on the board of directors. — After more than 12 years at T-Mobile, Janice Kapner is leaving the telecommunications giant. Prior to T-Mobile, Kapner was at Microsoft for more than a decade. — Former Microsoft and Amazon leader Vinita Ananth is now senior director of product for the cloud company Nebius. Ananth, based in the Seattle area, has been working since July on stealth-mode startups HelpViber and FulcrumAX. “After an incredible journey working alongside talented engineers, community leaders, and innovation-minded partners, this new role feels like the perfect next step,” English-Wiczling said on LinkedIn. — Jaimin Gandhi joined Seattle-based AI roleplay startup Yoodli as a product leader. Gandhi's past roles include leadership positions at Nerdy, Binance, Uber, DocuSign, Microsoft and others. Over the past year, Gandhi built FourPoint.AI, a tool that helps job seekers improve their communications. While he won't be adding new features to FourPoint, “I am opening it up for free,” Gandhi said on LinkedIn. — Kapil Hetamsaria is now chief business officer of Neo4j, a data analysis, graph intelligence platform. — Dave Rosenbaum is leaving his role as senior publications manager at Seattle-based pet sitting company Rover to join Airbnb. “Airbnb's mission is central to this belief that the world offers limitless possibilities.” Rosenbaum is also a deputy mayor and city council member for Mercer Island, a city east of Seattle, and previously served in legislative roles for members of Congress. — Pete Fewing, associate athletic director at Seattle University and longtime Sounders FC broadcaster, joined the board of directors for Starfire Sports. The organization provides coding classes, drone summer camps, and other free, after-school sports programming for underprivileged kids in South Seattle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I write about them all year long here at WIRED, and it's not often my favorites go on sale. But this year, multiple digital notebooks I love are on sale for the biggest sale event of the year. If you've thought about getting one of these for yourself, there's truly no better moment. From reMarkable's on-sale bundles to Kobo's deals, you can shop five of the best digital notebooks we've ever tried right now at a lower price than you might find until next year. They're a handy device just about everyone can enjoy, whether you want to digitally annotate your books or write out your grocery list without using a piece of paper. Some of the best digital notebooks we've tried come from reMarkable, and one of reMarkable's models always seems to reign supreme over our digital notebooks guide. It's not only powerful with tons of tools and an easy interface, but packs a color screen for colorful notes. You can get the bundles on sale right now, so combine one of reMarkable's markers and folio covers with a Paper Pro to get $50 off. The best discount from reMarkable is actually for its older device and our previous top pick, the reMarkable 2. It doesn't have a color screen or the front light, but you'll get the reMarkable's great software and options for accessories like the Keyboard Folio to use it like a laptop. The Kobo Libra Colour is my favorite all-around e-reader with its color screen and page turner buttons, but you can add on a stylus to have it double as a digital notebook. It's $30 off on Kobo's site for Cyber Monday. and convenient starting point of it being a Kindle I could already be reading on makes it a great go-to for casual notetakers and doodlers. It's a good choice for Kindle and Amazon users, and there are new models due out this winter, but they likely won't be as cheap as this one. (Especially since some of those new models will have color!) The Rocketbook Fusion Plus digital planner and notebook is for those who don't want to charge their notebook or give up on the whole “paper” experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is taking an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, whose parent company is one of the AI giant's major investors, Thrive Capital. Thrive Holdings operates like a private equity firm for AI, rolling up companies that it believes could benefit from the tech in sectors like accounting and IT services. The partnership follows a pattern of circular dealmaking for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave. Analysts will be watching to see if Thrive-owned firms actually succeed in building long-term profitable businesses using OpenAI's tech, or if the result is really just pumped-up valuations based on speculative market potential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia is investing $2 billion into Synopsys, which makes software and components for designing semiconductor chips. The deal deepens their existing partnership at a time when analysts have started to scrutinize increasingly common circular AI-industry deals and warn of a potential bubble. Nvidia said it bought Synopsys shares at $414.79 each as part of a multi-year partnership to integrate Nvidia's AI hardware and computing capabilities into Synopsys's electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation software. The deal will help Synopsys transition its platform from CPU-based computing to GPUs, a shift it hopes will speed up chip-design workflows, per a release. For Nvidia, the investment strengthens its influence over Synopsys's widely used EDA tools at a time when chip-design competition is starting to heat up. It also comes after major investors such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel have sold off their Nvidia positions. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch's coverage.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week on It: Welcome to Derry, we learned some important new details about Madeleine Stowe's character Ingrid, the head housekeeper at Juniper Hill Asylum who befriends the troubled Lilly Bainbridge (Clara Stack). Even when Lilly's no longer a patient, she seeks out the kindly older woman for comfort and advice—and why not, considering Derry is a hellscape and positive role models are hard to come by? However, every Stephen King fan watching was startled to learn last week that Ingrid's last name is “Kersh.” As in Mrs. Kersh, the manifestation of Pennywise that torments the original It character Beverly Marsh. This week's sixth episode lifted the lid on who Ingrid Kersh is and what her motivations are for being such a good friend to Lilly. First, though, let's look back at what else we know about Mrs. Kersh from Welcome to Derry so far. We know she's the alibi for accused killer Hank Grogan (Stephen Rider); he was with her when the movie-theater massacre took place in episode one. We don't know what will become of her relationship with Hank now that he's a fugitive. The show may pick back up with them eventually. But so far, we've witnessed many more scenes between her and Lilly, starting in episode three. “My father used to say that life is about the journey,” Ingrid continues. “But I think it's more about who you take that journey with. Ingrid Kersh says all the right things, and it happens again in episode three when Lilly seeks her out again. The kids are starting to poke into Derry's grim history, and Lilly wants Ingrid's insights. “I do remember some kids going missing in the ‘30s,” Ingrid muses, though she claims she hasn't thought about that in years. She's encouraging of Lilly's detective work, though: “My father always said that with good friends at your side, anything's possible. In episode five, we learn she's Ingrid Kersh, married to an unpleasant man who mostly cares about how his steak is cooked. Mrs. Kersh sensibly tells Lilly to go to the police, but it's clear by now that authorities in Derry have zero patience for kids and their clown nonsense. Lilly agrees, but as we saw in episode five, it wouldn't be a show about Pennywise if kids didn't barge into Derry's underground tunnels and find a demonic clown waiting for them. Episode six begins with another flashback to an earlier Pennywise “cycle,” a glimpse into 1935. Lily has another freak-out, this time in math class when she sees her father's pickled corpse slithering around in her desk. “Who's gonna help you now, crazy?” the apparition cackles. Ingrid doesn't answer her door, but Lilly goes inside anyway. Sitting in plain view is a photo album, filled with wedding portraits and the like; the images get older and older as Lilly flips through, until we finally arrive at 1908 and see a man who is clearly Pennywise out of make-up. This is sinking in as Ingrid suddenly appears; instead of being angry about the intrusion, she gives the distraught Lilly a big hug, telling her, “Whatever it is, it's going to be ok.” Then, Lilly notices another photo over Ingrid's shoulder. It's the man from 1908, this time in full Pennywise regalia. Ingrid notices her looking at it and asks, “Have you seen him?” Lilly, growing ever more uneasy, spies a vintage clown costume and a pointy white wig; it's exactly what the clown in the cemetery was wearing when the kids went on their photo mission. Later, we saw that same pointy wig spying outside Will's house. I was worried I might miss him!” Ingrid explains, admitting it was her in the graveyard with the kids. Then, she tells Lilly what we've already guessed: “My father was a carnival performer. There's no elaboration beyond that, but we can guess her father was Bob Gray, a name known from It lore that Welcome to Derry's creators have been teasing will appear. While we're pondering what “he was taken” means, we go back into the 1930s and see that Ingrid overheard a young patient, Mabel, talking about Pennywise, only to be scolded, “There are no such things as clowns in pipes.” With Mabel in tow, Ingrid heads to the basement, and it goes about how you'd expect. The sequence is filmed in black-and-white aside from pops of yellow (Pennywise's eyes) and red (the balloon, Mabel's blood), but despite witnessing a child devoured by a supernatural clown—a child she delivered up to be slaughtered—all it takes is an appearance from “Papa” to get Ingrid on board with the program. “Don't be scared; I can explain everything. There's a literal door that gets opened here, but you can infer that It wormed its way into Ingrid Kersh right then as well, exploiting her desire to reunite with her beloved father again. “If he could just see me once more as his Periwinkle [Ingrid's clown character], remind him of the love we shared, I know that he'll be able to break free.” Though Ingrid assures Lilly she would never let anything hurt her, how can you believe the word of a woman who's been dressing up in a 50-year-old clown outfit trying to reconnect with her long-dead father? “Come with me tonight and let me show you!” Lilly's response to this invitation is to slice her with the alien dagger and get the hell out of there. This surely won't be the only Bob Gray appearance on Welcome to Derry, especially since we now know that Ingrid has been trying to resurrect her father for 27 years—all while encouraging kids to believe the unbelievable, since kids are tasty bait for Pennywise. We're glad that Lilly has realized in Derry, you'd better be extremely careful before you trust anyone—even someone who appears completely harmless. It's a lesson Beverly Marsh has to learn for herself decades later when she has her own encounter with Mrs. Kersh in It: Chapter Two. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. The HBO show's star and co-creator shed some light on that eerie but enigmatic episode five plot point, as does 'Doctor Sleep,' the sequel to 'The Shining.' The clown of the hour finally showed up on HBO's Stephen King adaptation—but that was just one outrageous element in a truly bonkers episode.</p>

At TSMC's European OIP forum this week, Alchip and Ayar Labs demonstrated a fully integrated, in-package optical I/O engine built on TSMC's COUPE platform that enables optical connectivity for next-generation AI accelerators. The solution — which combines Ayar's silicon-photonics TeraPHY IC with Alchip's electrical interface die and a detachable fiber connector — can deliver up to 100 Tb/s of bandwidth per accelerator and connect to other chips using the industry-standard UCIe interface. When TSMC introduced its Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) framework in 2024, the company primarily targeted large chip developers like AMD or Nvidia that can afford to build their own electronic integrated circuits (EICs) and photonic integrated circuits (PICs), and then order TSMC to build them. However, many designers of custom accelerators do not have resources for vertical integration (unlike Nvidia, which controls the whole stack of technologies — from compute to scale-out connectivity — with its NVL72, NVL144, and NVL576 platforms) tend to license everything they can and then focus on developing IPs that differentiate their solution from others. This is where the production-ready optical subsystem from Alchip and Ayar Labs comes into play, enabling smaller chip designers to add optical connectivity to their chips relatively easily without investing tens of millions of dollars upfront. The solution jointly developed by Alchip and Ayar Labs is a three-chiplet co-packaged optical I/O subsystem that consists of an Alchip UCIe-A to UCIe-S protocol-converter chiplet that terminates the accelerator's UCIe-A interface and implements scale-up protocols (UALink, PCIe, Ethernet, SUE) over UCIe-S (streaming), an Alchip EIC that provides low-power SerDes, modulation drivers, clocking, and control, and an Ayar Labs TeraPHY PIC that performs the optical modulation and detection using silicon photonics. The Alchip protocol converter can also carry non-UCIe protocols encapsulated over the UCIe physical interface, so it can work with compute dies that use proprietary protocols. The optical subsystem can achieve extreme scale-up, supporting 100+ Tb/s of bandwidth per accelerator and 256+ optical ports per device to connect hundreds of processors across multiple racks and operate them as a single large processor. Alternatively, the companies envision that their solution could be used for memory extenders as well. The reference design (a mockup) includes two full-reticle accelerator dies, eight HBM stacks, four protocol-converter chiplets, and eight Ayar Labs TeraPHY optical engines, all mounted on a single substrate with integrated passive devices for power integrity.

By using the subsystem from Alchip, which will be sold in the form of chiplets, almost any developer of AI accelerators can enable ultra-high-bandwidth, low-latency, and energy-efficient rack-scale and even multi-rack-scale connectivity for their accelerators, which is too costly to develop in-house for a small company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Massive savings on Alienware PCs, thanks to Cyber Monday. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Dell has been slashing prices on Alienware gaming PCs throughout Black Friday, but it's gone even further for Cyber Monday. Two of its Aurora PCs with Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics cards have just seen a further drop in price, but the affordable option is this Intel-powered rig that's now priced for under $2,000 and for a whopping $730 less than its usual price. Alienware is a brand that typically sees premium prices, so a discount as big as this one is brilliant to see. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is the second-best consumer GPU, by performance, that you can buy right now, with a whopping 10,752 CUDA cores and 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM. It's a 4K-capable gaming GPU with all the goodies, like full ray tracing and multi-frame gen, thanks to DLSS 4 support. Featuring a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, this particular Alienware Aurora variant features an Intel Core Ultra 7 265K CPU with 20 cores, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. For your money, you're getting the same RTX 5080 build and typical Aurora case design, along with a monstrous 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU and 32GB of DDR5 RAM. This memory is faster than the model above, too, as it's DDR-6400, rated for 6,400M/Ts. Featuring a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, this particular Alienware Aurora variant features an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. Both SKUs feature a 1000W platinum-rated power supply, along with a 240mm liquid cooler with Alienware's AlienFX lighting, which you can customize and control using the Alienware Command Center app. While these are the prices for these configurations, you can customize your rigs to suit your needs, although you will see updated pricing as a result. You will struggle to find better prices on RTX 5080-powered gaming PCs with these specs for Cyber Monday, especially on the sub-$2000 model. If you're thinking about upgrading your setup, a pre-built rig from a trusted gaming brand like this could be one of your best options, but don't expect these prices to stick around for very long.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.” Securus Technologies president Kevin Elder told MIT Technology Review that the company began building its AI tools in 2023, using its massive database of recorded calls to train AI models to detect criminal activity. It created one model, for example, using seven years of calls made by inmates in the Texas prison system, but it has been working on building other state- or county-specific models. Over the past year, Elder says, Securus has been piloting the AI tools to monitor inmate conversations in real time (the company declined to specify where this is taking place, but its customers include jails holding people awaiting trial, prisons for those serving sentences, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities). “We can point that large language model at an entire treasure trove [of data],” Elder says, “to detect and understand when crimes are being thought about or contemplated, so that you're catching it much earlier in the cycle.” As with its other monitoring tools, investigators at detention facilities can deploy the AI features to monitor randomly selected conversations or those of individuals suspected by facility investigators of criminal activity, according to Elder. In an interview, Elder said Securus' monitoring efforts have helped disrupt human trafficking and gang activities organized from within prisons, among other crimes, and said its tools are also used to identify prison staff who are bringing in contraband. But the company did not provide MIT Technology Review with any cases specifically uncovered by its new AI models. But this doesn't mean they're aware that those conversations could be used to train an AI model, says Bianca Tylek, executive director of the prison rights advocacy group Worth Rises. “That's coercive consent; there's literally no other way you can communicate with your family,” Tylek says. And since inmates in the vast majority of states pay for these calls, she adds, “not only are you not compensating them for the use of their data, but you're actually charging them while collecting their data.” They added that correctional facilities determine their own recording and monitoring policies, which Securus follows, and did not directly answer whether inmates can opt out of having their recordings used to train AI. Other advocates for inmates say Securus has a history of violating their civil liberties. Securus will have an easier time funding its AI tool thanks to the company's recent win in a battle with regulators over how telecom companies can spend the money they collect from inmates' calls. In 2024, the Federal Communications Commission issued a major reform, shaped and lauded by advocates for prisoners' rights, that forbade telecoms from passing the costs of recording and surveilling calls on to inmates. Associations of sheriffs (who typically run county jails) complained they could no longer afford proper monitoring of calls, and attorneys general from 14 states sued over the ruling. Some prisons and jails warned they would cut off access to phone calls. While it was building and piloting its AI tool, Securus held meetings with the FCC and lobbied for a rule change, arguing that the 2024 reform went too far and asking that the agency again allow companies to use fees collected from inmates to pay for security. In a press release, Carr wrote that rolling back the 2024 reforms would “lead to broader adoption of beneficial public safety tools that include advanced AI and machine learning.” A spokesperson for Securus told MIT Technology Review that the company aims to balance affordability with the need to fund essential safety and security tools. The FCC will be seeking comment on these new rules before they take final effect. The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do. The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are. They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems. Competition is heating up, with Mattel and OpenAI expected to launch a product for kids this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report from the New York Times digs into the financial disclosures of President Trump's AI and crypto czar, PayPal Mafia founding member David Sacks, and finds ample reason to doubt that he could possibly advise anyone, let alone the president, on AI and crypto impartially. One telling detail in the Times' piece is that Sacks or his venture capital firm Craft Ventures have 438 software or hardware company investments involving companies that aren't necessarily AI companies, but pitch themselves as AI companies anyway, or have AI in their names. This is a headache-inducing factoid because over the past two years, seemingly every tech startup has pivoted to AI. In fact, companies now bend the definition of “AI” until it breaks to stay relevant. He's a billionaire podcaster whose show, “All-In,” is a bunch of perceived insider tech bros yukking it up about politics and the markets. The presence of such a guy—who everyone knows has a massive tech-based portfolio of investments—totally guarantees the perception that public policy is being shaped by self-dealing in the tech world, which in turn distorts common sense. At any rate, it's hard to give him the benefit of the doubt like this, because there do appear to be conflicts. )The Times claims that Sacks' stake in AI companies—apparently even ones that he retains after unloading some of his investments for ethical reasons—have gone up in value or stand to go up in value due to his recommended policies. His portfolio, and the portfolio of his company still have “708 tech investments,” the Times says, along with “449 stakes in companies with ties to artificial intelligence,” plus the aforementioned 438 “software or hardware” companies that just happen to love AI.On some level, it feels absurd to talk about this right now. Anti-corruption protesters picketed an event where Trump spoke at a dinner full of crypto fans who bought a total of $148 Million in Trump's own cryptocurrency in order to be allowed to attend. There have been corruption accusations over Trump's questionable pardon of Changpeng “CZ” Zhao while he still appears to be engaging in the practices that got him convicted. Trump has tried to swat away at least one question from the press about this, and has done so with a certain lack of grace, even for Trump. But even with more than the usual ambient chatter about corruption happening, it's still worth pointing out that if someone is rich, and gets richer from owning stakes in companies, then unless you happen to really like that person, they'll come across as untrustworthy if they are in any way in charge of government policy while all that wealth accumulation happens. Action Plan—which Sacks masterminded—pushes for U.S.-based AI companies to contract with the Pentagon. “This award represents the largest effort of its kind to equip every soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities—fusing the best of night vision, augmented reality, and AI into a single system,” Anduril's announcement says.This is ostensibly okay, however, because as an Anduril spokesperson named Shannon Prior told the Times, Anduril got the contract not because Sacks has a stake in it, but because company founder Palmer Luckey, is “the world's best virtual reality headset designer,” and contracting with Anduril was an “obvious idea.” Plus Anduril had already been in talks with the Army before the AI Action Plan was rolled out, Prior says. When it comes to taking solace in these excuses, your mileage may vary. When you zoom out, it looks like this: As an advisor, Trump hired a venture capitalist who held a $500,000-per-couple dinner for him last year in San Francisco. When he writes you an AI action plan calling for AI in the military, and your Pentagon ends up contracting with that very company, that's just sensible government policy. After all, the military needs AI-powered night vision goggles, doesn't it? But it's easy to imagine another reality where the White House AI and crypto czar is someone else, or—gasp—there is no AI and crypto czar. In this reality, perhaps, “Hey wait, does it serve the public's interest to pay $159 million in an attempt to shoehorn AI into night vision goggles?” is a question that at least gets asked. The report notes that it has some limitations, but says "policymakers cannot wait" to act on its findings. "We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention," Anthropic said earlier this month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Czech Republic's largest digital art festival became an international phenomenon this year as it once again transformed the center of Prague into a laboratory for visual experimentation. The 13th edition of the Signal Festival, which took place from October 16 to 19, presented 20 installations by Czech and international artists, including projections on a cloud of mist and interactive objects that responded to the movements of viewers. The Lone Soul Disco performance was choreographed by Viktor Konvalinka. The Signal Festival mixed dance, art, and interactive exibits. And thanks to a mention in Dan Brown's new novel, The Secret of Secrets, the festival has gained even more global recognition. On the final day, there was a long queue in front of the monumental installation Tristan's Ascension by American video art pioneer Bill Viola before it opened for the evening, even though it was a ticketed event. In the Church of St. Salvator in the Convent of St. Agnes, visitors could watch a Christ-like figure rise upwards, streams of water defying gravity along with him, all projected on a huge screen. While creators of other light installations have to deal with the challenges of buildings—their irregular surfaces, decorative details, and awkward cornices—projecting onto water droplets is a challenge of a different kind with artists having to give up control over the resulting image. The reward, however, was an extraordinary 3D spectacle reminiscent of a hologram—something that can't be achieved with video projections on static and flat buildings. It transformed the 230-foot structure into a kaleidoscope of blue, green, red, and white surfaces. A short distance away, on Republic Square, Peppercorns had another installation. On a circular LED installation, they projected a work entitled Between Mountains and Seas, which recounted the history of Taiwan. The installation artist Robert Seidel and sound producer Nikolai von Sallwitz, both from Germany, combined Baroque and contemporary aesthetics to transform the courtyard into a space charged with digital light and sound. While city center locations were mainly dedicated to works by foreign artists, Czech artists could be found at those in Prague's Vinohrady neighborhood. Artist Pavla Sceranková prepared an interactive installation called Constellation for the Rieger Gardens, allowing viewers to create their own light constellations by interacting with a system of kinetic objects. The Rafani collective, known for its political and performative interventions in public spaces, presented the performance piece Grill Flame, in which two large trucks spewing flames were parked near the Vinohrady water tower. Antonín Kindl created an interactive object called EYE for Svatopluk Čech Park, near Jiřího z Poděbrad Square, that consisted of a sphere on spidery legs emitting beams of light in response to nearby activity. The creature was accompanied by a dramatic robotic voice and cosmic sound effects.
