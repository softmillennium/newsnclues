                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Worshippers and officials arrived in droves at the People's Salvation Cathedral, known as the National Cathedral, which at its highest point stands more than 125 meters (410 feet) and has an inner capacity for 5,000 worshippers in the deeply Orthodox country. A construction worker gives a thumbs up in the final stages of installation for the main cross of the National Cathedral, in Bucharest, Romania, Tuesday, April 8, 2025. BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Thousands of pilgrims turned out Sunday in Romania's capital for the consecration of religious paintings inside the world's largest Christian Orthodox church that was being opened after 15 years of construction. Worshippers and officials arrived in droves at the People's Salvation Cathedral, known as the National Cathedral, which at its highest point stands more than 125 meters (410 feet) and has an inner capacity for 5,000 worshippers in the deeply Orthodox country. Proposals for a national cathedral in the country of about 19 million people had been put forward for more than a century, but its fruition was hampered by two world wars and the decades of communist rule, which sought to suppress religion. It has so far cost a reported 270 million euros ($313 million), with a majority drawn from public funds, and some works are yet to be completed. Traffic was restricted for Sunday's service, which was attended by President Nicusor Dan and Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan. Many worshippers watched via TV screens set up outside the cathedral. The cathedral's mosaics and iconography cover an area of 17,800 square meters (191,000 square feet), according the cathedral's website. Daniel Codrescu, who has spent seven years working on the frescoes and mosaics, told The Associated Press that much of the iconography has been inspired by medieval Romanian paintings and others from the Byzantine world. “I hope (the church) is going to have a very important impact on society because … it's a public space.” Critics bemoan that the massive church has drawn on public funds, which could have been spent on schools or hospitals. Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, said the project was a “waste of public money” but said it could offer a “boost to national pride and identity” for some Romanians. “The fact that they have forced, year after year, politicians to pay for it, in some cases taking money from communities that really needed that money, indicates it was a show of force, not one of humility and love of God,” he said. “Economically, it might be OK in the long term as it will be a tourist attraction.” Rares Ghiorghies, 37, supports the church but said the money would be better spent on health and education as “a matter of good governance.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former New York Jets All-Pro center Nick Mangold died at the age of 41 due to complications of kidney disease, the team announced on Sunday. Mangold died on Saturday night after battling chronic kidney disease for nearly 19 years and was undergoing dialysis. Former New York Jets star Nick Mangold seeking kidney transplant, asks fans to consider donating “He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.” On ESPN's “Sunday NFL Countdown,” Mangold's former head coach, Rex Ryan, was emotional upon learning of his passsing. “It's brutal,” Ryan said with Pro Football Hall of Famer Randy Moss consoling him. He comes to me and says, ‘I'm playing this game.' That's what I remember about this kid. He was awesome and just way too young. I feel so bad for his wife and family – rough.” Earlier this month, he addressed his health situation in a plea posted on social media where he appealed for a kidney donor. “This isn't an easy message to share, but I want to be open about what's been happening with me and my health,” the former lineman stated in a statement addressed to the Jets and Ohio State University communities. Mangold won a national championship with the Buckeyes in 2002. “In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease. After a rough summer, I'm undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant,” the 41-year-old wrote. “Unfortunately, I do not have any family able to donate at this time, so this is why I'm reaching out to you, our NY Jets and Ohio State communities. I am in need of a kidney donor with type O blood.” “The Ohio State football program is saddened by the news of Nick Mangold's passing and sends heartfelt condolences to his family and friends,” the Buckeyes said on Sunday. “On behalf of the entire Johnson family and the New York Jets organization, we offer our sincere condolences to Jenny, their four children — Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte — as well as to Nick's extended family, friends, and all who loved him,” Johnson said. “Nick Mangold will forever be a Jet,” Johnson added.</p>

David Beckham waved to his fans while walking the green carpet at the Earthshot Prize Awards in Boston on Friday. Victoria Beckham was nearly forced to shut down her namesake fashion brand after falling victim to irresponsible spending that left her company "tens of millions in the red." In Netflix's new documentary, titled "Victoria Beckham," the former Spice Girl — who, throughout the three-part series, gave viewers a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to prepare for a show at Paris Fashion Week — got candid about leaning on her husband, David Beckham, for financial assistance in the early years of her company's launch and detailed the "mind-blowing" decisions that nearly cost her her brand. "This business is everything to me. But it's been a hell of a journey," she said in the documentary. We were tens of millions in the red." Victoria Beckham was nearly forced to shut down her namesake fashion brand after falling victim to irresponsible spending that left her company "tens of millions in the red." "Yes, I'm going home to my husband, but I'm going home to my business partner as well. And so I would talk to him about it. David said they both looked at their investments within the company, and came to the conclusion that something had to change. "We both sat there and we looked at what I'd invested, and I think part of that conversation broke my heart because Victoria is a proud woman," David said. "When we met, she was a lot richer than me. She actually bought our first house in Hertfordshire, known as Beckingham Palace," he added. "So for her to have to come to me and say, ‘Can I have some — we need some more money. The business needs more money,' that was hard for both of us because I didn't have the money to keep doing this, and eventually I was like, ‘This cannot continue.'" Victoria said the "entire house was crashing down." I needed someone to help me," she said. Beckham admitted to irresponsible spending at the beginning of her company's launch. "I had never seen something as hard as that to fix," he said. "And it was costing her £70,000 a year. And then there was someone who was coming to water the plants for £15,000 a year – and that's only the beginning. So I went to her and I decided to just tell the truth, exactly the way it is, and I didn't know how she'd react." "I said, 'Victoria, we have to change everything, restructure the business, and that's going to be painful,' and when I finished she just listened, and she left a little silence," he recalled. Victoria admitted it was difficult to hear the truth. "I hadn't been to business school, I'd come from an entertainment background… I didn't realize it at the time, but the waste was mind-blowing. I mean, I had 15 different linings for the insides of the outerwear. People thought that I was used to getting the best… bizarre things like flying chairs from one side of the world to the other." Victoria leaned on her husband, David Beckham, for financial assistance in her company. "I think part of the problem was people were really afraid to tell me no. People thought I wasn't used to hearing no." Elsewhere in the documentary, Victoria also opened up about one of the toughest challenges she's faced — her past eating disorder. "People felt it was OK to criticize a woman for her weight, for what she's doing, for what she's wearing," David said in the documentary. "There were a lot of things happening in TV then that won't happen now. "My Victoria that I knew, sits at home in a tracksuit, smiling, laughing, having a glass of wine. That started to go purely because of the criticism that she was getting," he added. While recalling a 1999 incident in which a TV host asked her to step on a scale on live television to confirm her weight was "back to normal" six months after giving birth to her first child, Victoria admitted the whole ordeal affected her deeply. Victoria Beckham said she "lost all sense of reality" while hiding her eating disorder. "I was weighed on national television when Brooklyn was 6 months old," she said in the documentary. And we laugh about it, and we joke about it when we're on television, but I was really, really young and that hurt." During the live television segment in question, "Don't Forget Your Toothbrush," host Chris Evans said, "A lot of girls want to know, because you look fantastic again, how did you get back to your shape after birth?" After Victoria detailed her exercise regime, Evans asked Victoria, "Is your weight back to normal? That experience alone left Victoria feeling as if she wasn't enough. Victoria and David Beckham have been married for 26 years. "I really started to doubt myself and not like myself," she said in the doc. You lose all sense of reality. I'm just very critical of myself. "I mean, it's been a lot. I had no control over what was being written about me, pictures that were being taken. I could control it with the clothing and I could control my weight, and I was controlling it in an incredibly unhealthy way." "When you have an eating disorder, you become very good at lying," she added. "And I was never honest about it with my parents. I never talked about it publicly. And I suppose that's been with me my whole life." At one point, the businesswoman broke down in tears to David as they discussed her reasoning behind all that she does. Victoria and David have been very supportive of one another throughout the years. "Maybe a lot of it to you," said Victoria, who admittedly accepted financial aid from David while establishing her brand in the early years. "I feel bad about all that times when I had to ask you to help me out." When I saw your face and the kids' faces backstage after the last show, it was not the first time, but it was a real moment for me where I could see how proud of me you were. Maybe you're so stubborn in the fact that you are trying to prove everybody wrong." I'm not going to lie," she said. "I'm not stopping yet," she quipped.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soon after he stepped out of the plane, U.S. President Trump displayed his signature dance moves to Malaysian performers on Sunday. President Donald Trump is heading for Asia for the first time this term, a trip where he is expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to de-escalate a trade war. Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump, right, watch as Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, second left, and Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet hold up a document after the ceremonial signing of a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia on the sidelines of the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul watches Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands on the sidelines of the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A trade deal between the United States and China is drawing closer, officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday as they reached an initial consensus for President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to aim to finalize during their high-stakes meeting. Any agreement would be a relief to international markets even it does not address underlying issues involving manufacturing imbalances and access to state-of-the-art computer chips. Beijing recently limited exports of rare earth elements that are needed for advanced technologies, and Trump responded by threatening additional tariffs on Chinese products. The prospect of a widening conflict risked weakening economic growth worldwide. China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters that the two sides had reached a “preliminary consensus,” while Trump's treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was “a very successful framework.” Trump also expressed confidence that an agreement was at hand, saying the Chinese “want to make a deal and we want to make a deal.” The Republican president is set to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia. Trump reiterated that he plans to visit China in the future and suggested that Xi could come to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Florida. Yet his way of pursuing deals has meant serious disruptions at home and abroad. At the summit, Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement during a ceremony attended by Trump. His threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a “historic day,” and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates “the building blocks for a lasting peace.” The president signed economic frameworks with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The United States wants to rely less on China, which has used limited on exports of key components in technology manufacturing as a bargaining chip in trade talks. “It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. Trump attended this summit only once during his first term, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January. “The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,” Trump said. He described his counterparts as “spectacular leaders” and said that “everything you touch turns to gold.” Trump's tariff threats were credited with helping spur negotiations Thailand and Cambodia. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, saying at the summit that “it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.” Trump met Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Kuala Lumpur, who was also attending the summit. There has been friction between them over Brazil's prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, the country's former president and a close Trump ally. Bolsonaro was convicted last month of attempting to overturn election results in his country. “I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,” he said. While Trump was warming to Lula, he avoided Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. One leader absent from the summit was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Voters in Argentina on Friday weighed political and economic anxieties to elect a new congress, for which President Javier Milei aims to secure a majority. Argentine president and Buenos Aires' governor rally ahead of midterm elections Fabian Gropper casts his vote during legislative midterm elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. Patricio Irarrazabal arrives to vote with his sons during legislative midterm elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — On the northern bank of Argentina's Riachuelo River, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since libertarian President Javier Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets in the Puerto Madero financial district in Buenos Aires bustle with bankers who praise Milei for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Clutching a Tupperware container, she braved heavy rain last Friday to carry home dinner for her four daughters from a soup kitchen in her neighborhood of Isla Maciel — a daily routine since Milei slashed subsidies for public services and unwound price controls on staple foods. As millions of voters headed to the polls Sunday, their vastly different perceptions of the economy stand to determine whether Milei succeeds — and whether the Trump administration presses on with a financial rescue plan for its cash-strapped ideological ally. “Within my little circle, everyone's happy with how things are going,” said Fernanda Díaz, 42, who runs a yacht rental company in Puerto Madero. Trump was apparently referring to Argentina's loosely populist movement known as Peronism that helped deliver the economic shambles that Milei inherited in late 2023. Reckless public spending under a succession of Peronist governments — including that of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, now serving house arrest for corruption — brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults. “We needed a major change,” said Díaz, who, before launching her yacht business, lost her job as a top executive when Chilean retail group Falabella shut down its Argentine operations over high inflation, import restrictions and a wildly oscillating exchange rate under the previous Peronist government. “I voted for Milei's government and was really enthusiastic at first.” Markets shudder at the thought of a Peronist return. When the Peronist coalition beat Milei's libertarian party by a landslide in last month's Buenos Aires provincial elections, investors panicked that the president's free-market overhaul was losing support and rushed to pull capital out of the country. In an extremely rare move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue — selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks, signing a $20 billion credit line and promising another $20 billion in aid from private banks, rather than U.S. taxpayers. Assets jumped on each of the Trump administration's announcements. Having dodged a currency crisis, Milei and his supporters were, briefly, ebullient. It helps us grow stronger,” said Luciano Naredo, 28, a high-end car salesperson in Puerto Madero. “I think Argentina is finally taking its rightful place in the world.” But Trump's warning that the U.S. could pull assistance unnerved markets. Wielding a diesel-fume-spewing chain saw at rallies, Milei cut tens of thousands of government jobs, slashed state spending and burned through foreign exchange reserves to shore up a chronically depreciating peso. Inflation dropped — in fulfillment of Milei's flagship campaign promise. But almost two years into his economic overhaul, purchasing power has dropped, too. “You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,” Epifanía Contreras, 64, said as she packed her plastic bowl with rice and peas at the Foundation of Isla Maciel soup kitchen, referring to her $200 monthly pension. Volunteers serving sopa paraguaya, a custardy cornbread, to a stream of regulars on Friday said demand has more than doubled in the past year. “People are coming out of real need,” said Maria Gomez, a volunteer cook. A third fewer residents of the Avellaneda municipality supported Milei's libertarian party in last month's provincial election than in 2023, expressing nostalgia for the redistributive policies of the opposition Peronist party despite its more recent reputation for financial ruin. Milei has vowed in campaign speeches to press on with his harsh austerity program. But his chain saw prop, once a rally staple, hasn't been trotted out in months. Voting on Sunday in Buenos Aires' middle-class Almagro district with his sister under heavy security, Milei shook hands with supporters who shouted, “Go president!” and left without making statements to the press. Most polls predict a tight race between Milei's La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances) party and the Peronist Fuerza Patria coalition. Currently controlling less than 15% of Congress, Milei's government hopes to win enough seats to defend its austerity measures, uphold presidential vetoes and impose labor and tax reforms. “Each new government comes in, criticizes the last one, promises to do things differently and ends up being the same or worse,” said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate.</p>

Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Lamar Jackson's 1-6 record against the Kansas City Chiefs, and Caleb Williams' comeback road win against the Las Vegas Raiders. Jackson, who has been battling a hamstring injury, was expected to return to the Ravens' offense this week coming off their bye. But on Saturday, he was ruled out. The Ravens could be subject to league discipline if they are found to have violated the league's injury report policy. Baltimore Ravens' Lamar Jackson warms up before a preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys Aug. 16, 2025, in Arlington, Texas. "The league will look into this," NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told ESPN on Saturday. "Upon further evaluation today and after conferring with the league office, because Lamar didn't take any starter reps in practice, we updated our report to reflect his practice participation," the statement read. ESPN added that, while Jackson was considered a full participant on Friday, he was running with the scout team while Tyler "Snoop" Huntley was running with the starting offense. Huntley was set to start on Sunday over Cooper Rush, who was the starter for the Ravens since Jackson went down. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson throws from the pocket against the Pittsburgh Steelers at M&T Bank Stadium. Jackson's injury couldn't come at a worse time for the Ravens, as they sit at 1-5 in what has been one of the most shocking developments for a Super Bowl hopeful this season. It's no secret how much of a loss Jackson is due to his play-making abilities. Safety Kyle Hamilton recently gave Fox News Digital an optimistic outlook for the Ravens, who need to put together a win streak if they wish to make the playoffs. But he knows how much Jackson factors into those hopes. "Lamar's our quarterback, and he's the guy who puts butts in seats in the stadium, sells tickets and wins games for us," Hamilton said. "Obviously, we contribute to that as well defensively and supporting guys on the offense. The Ravens will be forced to lean on Huntley, who is 3-7 over his career as a backup for Jackson. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson warms up for the AFC wild-card game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at M&T Bank Stadium.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on how concerned people should be about bird flu spreading on 'Fox Report.' A Georgia chicken producer is working to stop the spread of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), more commonly known as bird flu, after becoming the third commercial operation in the state to test positive this year. The Gordon County producer noticed signs of illness on Wednesday and reported it to the Georgia Poultry Laboratory Network on Thursday, according to a Georgia Department of Agriculture press release. The following day, Georgia Department of Agriculture's Emergency Management and State Agricultural Response Teams "deployed to the affected premises to conduct depopulation, disposal, cleaning, and disinfection." Workers pack cartons of eggs at Sunrise Farms on Feb. 18, 2025, in Petaluma, California. For at least the next two weeks, state officials say, all commercial poultry operations within a 6.2-mile radius are under quarantine and will undergo surveillance testing. "This poses a serious threat to Georgia's #1 industry and to the thousands of Georgians whose livelihoods depend on poultry production," Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler J Harper said in a statement. Rows of raw chickens are placed on rotating spits inside a glass rotisserie oven at a food stall in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on Sept. 9, 2025. A commercial egg-layer farm in Indiana with nearly 20,000 birds also recently reported a bird flu outbreak, CIDRAP reported. ISA Brown chickens in a chicken coop at an egg farm in Mason, Michigan, on March 3, 2025. HPAI was first confirmed in a commercial flock in the U.S. on Feb. 8, 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS). Data from the agency says over the last 30 days, 64 flocks have been confirmed infected, impacting nearly 3.5 million birds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This undated photo provided by Essex Police on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025 shows Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu. LONDON (AP) — London police said Sunday they arrested a convicted sex offender and asylum-seeker who was mistakenly released from prison in a blunder that has embarrassed the government. The Metropolitan Police said Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area in north London. Before he was released in error, Kebatu had already been in the national news because his arrest earlier this year over the sexual assault of a teenage girl triggered a wave of angry anti-migrant protests in London and other cities. Authorities said they were alerted Friday afternoon that Kebatu was released by mistake at a prison in Chelmsford, Essex, and was seen catching a London-bound train there. British media reported that he was wrongly categorized as a prisoner due to be released, instead of being sent to an immigration detention center. Thousands of people protested outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, northeast of London, where he was staying along with other newly arrived migrants. Multiple protests targeting other hotels housing migrants followed in British cities and towns, with some demonstrations attended by far-right activists and spilling into disorder. The group Stand Up to Racism also rallied in counterprotests. Government officials have described the mistaken release as an “egregious failure.” Justice Secretary David Lammy said he ordered prisoner release checks to be strengthened immediately, and an investigation will find out what went wrong and who was accountable. “This man was behind bars because of serious sex offenses,” Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Sky News Sunday before Kebatu's arrest. “He is not meant to be in this country. In fact, what was supposed to be happening is he was meant to be transferred for deportation. So the idea that he's loose on our streets is incredibly serious. Efforts by authorities in Britain, France and other countries to crack down on people smuggling gangs or deter migrants from coming have so far been unsuccessful. The government's policy of using hotels to house migrants who are awaiting a decision on their asylum status has also come under heavy criticism.</p>

"Zohran Mamdani is modeling a different kind of politics," Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate and longtime progressive leader, said in a statement ahead of the rally. The trio of self-identified Democratic socialists have invigorated the Democratic Party's progressive base at a time when Democrats are still grappling with devastating losses in 2024 amid growing discontent with President Donald Trump's sweeping, second-term agenda. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani hold hands during the town hall "Fighting Oligarchy" event at Brooklyn College on Sept. 6, 2025. When Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez teamed up for the "Fighting Oligarchy" tour earlier this year, they sparked sizable buzz, firing up thousands of Democrats at rallies across the United States who had been left without a clear party leader. "As mayor, he will not run a top-down, billionaire-funded, consultant-driven administration. Instead, Zohran will be a champion for the working people of New York," Sanders said. Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have campaigned alongside Mamdani in his bid to lead the nation's most populous city. On Friday night, Sanders appeared for a virtual "Get Out the Vote" event with Mamdani. Last month, Sanders and Mamdani teamed up for a "Fighting Oligarchy" town hall in Brooklyn. New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani answers reporter questions after the final debate on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025, ahead of Election Day. That afternoon, Mamdani posed for a photo with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez in Astoria, Queens, amassing millions of views. Sanders, a two-time Democratic presidential nominee runner-up, was an early endorser of Mamdani's primary campaign, along with Ocasio-Cortez. Mamdani's primary upset triggered a political earthquake as the democratic socialist handily defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was widely expected to secure the Democratic nomination. Mamdani's cross-endorsement with fellow progressive New York City Comptroller Brad Lander cleared the path for Mamdani to consolidate support against Cuomo through ranked-choice voting. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greet the crowd together during a "Fighting Oligarchy" tour event at Arizona State University, March 20, 2025, in Tempe. Cuomo has since launched an independent campaign, teeing up a competitive and contentious general election battle. Since Mamdani secured the Democratic nomination, Trump has labeled him a "100% Communist Lunatic," and "my little communist," ushering Mamdani onto the national political stage. Mamdani has rejected the moniker, maintaining that he identifies as a democratic socialist, like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. As Trump began criticizing Mamdani, New York Democrats chose to withhold their endorsements of the socialist candidate, who has made a slew of ambitious campaign promises, like fast and free buses, city-run grocery stores and free child care, all of which he plans to pay for by raising taxes on corporations and the top 1% of New Yorkers. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has still yet to endorse. Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani supporters gather outside 30 Rock in New York City on Oct. 16, 2025. Pressure had been mounting since Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June for Mayor Eric Adams, who was also running as an independent, or Cuomo to drop out of the race to consolidate support against Mamdani. That pressure reached a boiling point last week as billionaires, including Red Apple Media CEO John Catsimatidis and hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman, called on Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to drop out of the race in order to clear a pathway to victory for Cuomo. According to the poll, Mamdani has a 21-point lead among New York City registered voters with 49% of voters backing Mamdani, while 28% go for Cuomo and 13% favor Sliwa. Mamdani also rose above the 50% threshold among likely voters, garnering 52% support, while Cuomo picked up 28%, and Sliwa received just 14%. Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

Multiple suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris last weekend, French officials said Sunday. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, including one man who was taken into custody as he was about to leave the country from Charles de Gaulle airport. Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests, though French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and taken into custody. She did not say whether the jewels had been recovered. Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at 88 million euros ($102 million) — a high-profile heist that sparked a national reckoning and stunned the world. The crew of thieves used a basket lift to scale the Louvre's façade, forced open a window, smashed display cases and fled, according to French officials. The Louvre's director Laurence des Cars acknowledged there was a "terrible failure" in the museum's security. Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends. Police secured the area outside the Louvre Museum in Paris last week, where burglars used a truck-mounted moving lift to reach a second-floor window and steal royal jewelry valued at more than $100 million. French Interior minister Laurent Nunez praised the investigators for their tireless work, adding that they always had his "full confidence." The thieves slipped away with a total of eight objects, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense. They also stole an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife, and a reliquary brooch. Empress Eugénie's diamond diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch — an imperial ensemble of rare craftsmanship — were also part of the loot. Eugénie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable. This is a breaking news story; check back for updates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British police have arrested an asylum-seeker who was mistakenly released from prison on Friday while serving a 12-month sentence for sexual assault following a “fast-moving and complex” manhunt. Ethiopian national Hadush Kebatu was jailed in September for the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl while staying at the Bell Hotel in Epping, England – a hotel just outside of London used by the government to help house asylum seekers. “Hadush Kebatu, who was released in error from HMP Chelmsford on Friday morning, has been arrested,” London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement Sunday. He was arrested by officers in the Finsbury Park area of London at around 8:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that Kebatu will be deported from the UK following his arrest and vowed to make sure “this doesn't happen again.” How British hotels became a flashpoint for a furious immigration debate Kebatu's case fuelled a wave of anti-migrant demonstrations across the country in August, with some holding protests outside the Bell Hotel – fueled by those on the far-right – which turned violent. On Friday, Essex Police said it was informed by the UK's prison service at 12:57 p.m. local time (7:57 a.m. Police quickly launched a manhunt for Kebatu, with British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy also announcing an “urgent investigation” into the mistaken release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I was carrying a thick leather Bible filled with underlined passages celebrating God's love for all humanity. I had memorized a New Testament passage, which declared, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave or free, male nor female — for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” Then I peeked in the apartment's front bay window and saw something that made my heart sink. “Damn,” I muttered to myself as I spied a group of casually dressed people sitting in the living room, chatting amiably with Bibles resting on their laps. I had never been in the home of a White person before. I had grown up in an inner-city Baltimore neighborhood where seeing White people was like spotting Bigfoot. My mother was White, but I had no contact with her family and had only recently met her for the first time. Her relatives shunned me because my father was Black, and they thought people of different races should stay apart. That story, which took place in the late 1980s, may sound like it comes from a bygone era. Many Americans no longer see church as a place for healing. They see churches as places that hurt people by demonizing outsiders and covering up abuse. About 81% of White evangelicals voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They are also among the most ardent supporters of White Christian nationalism, a false teaching that claims the US was explicitly founded as a Christian nation. For more than 20 years as a journalist, I've written my share of critical stories about White evangelicals. But I told those stories while harboring a secret of sorts: White evangelicals helped save me and my family — not in a religious sense, but in ways I'm still digesting more than three decades after it happened. When we met I was attending Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, D.C., and was in Chicago for a summer internship. I probably would have never met him in another walk of life. Paul exuded gentleness and an approachability that I liked. Evangelicals are loosely defined as Christians who often share a “born-again” personal conversion, believe they're supposed to spread their faith to others and take the Bible either literally or seriously. I never accepted Paul's narrow definition of faith, and he didn't push it hard. I sometimes even wonder if he believed it. It was what happened after Bible study that converted me. I was at an anxious time in my life. Many of my childhood friends were headed to prison or strung out on drugs. Our conversations would often end with Paul clasping my brown hands with his pale, freckled hands and saying, “Let's pray about it, brother.” This was a strange new world for me. Over time, I stopped seeing him as a racial category. He became simply Paul, my friend, the guy I hung out with. It was that electric moment of human connection when you discover that someone you once saw as an enemy is now becoming your friend. I continued to experience those sensations in subsequent years as my career took me around the country. In Washington, Los Angeles and Atlanta, I made it a point to only join multiracial congregations. I befriended more White evangelicals who defied expectation. One was Peter, a computer nerd, who refused to move his wife and young daughter out of his Atlanta neighborhood though it had gone from White to virtually all-Black. Another friend was an evangelical pastor who grew up in the Jim Crow South believing that Black people were subhuman. He joined a church ministry after high school that assigned him and a childhood buddy to an anti-poverty program in Harlem. There, he made friends with Black people for the first time. He eventually founded a multicultural church where White and non-White members not only shared pews, but the power to make decisions about the church's direction. My friend told me what changed him and his friend in Harlem were not deep conversations with Black people about politics or faith. Instead it was mundane activities, such as sharing meals. “It was just our daily life with African American people. They acted like regular people, which was shocking at first. That was the place where I crossed over.” These weren't “Kumbaya” relationships — we often disagreed, sometimes loudly, over politics and theology. And these friends didn't just change me; we changed one another. And then something else happened that I never expected: I was swept up in a religious movement that gave me even more hope. I joined evangelical churches that participated in this movement during much of my young adulthood, and I attended rallies arranged by the “Promise Keepers,” an evangelical men's movement designed to foster racial healing. I was a religion reporter in 1995 when I watched the nation's largest evangelical denomination — the Southern Baptist Convention, which was formed in the mid-19th century to defend slavery — publicly apologize for its historic defense of slavery and racial segregation. It seemed like the nation was finally shedding its original sin, racism. We were living up to our national creed, “Out of Many, One.” We were becoming the mythical America that the poet Langston Hughes described as “the land that never has been yet - And yet must be.” What followed were years of confrontations and anger. But by now I had practice reaching across racial divides, and we somehow found a way to become a genuine family. How that happened is complex, but it culminated with my maternal grandfather — the same man who refused to contact me when I was a child and referred to my father as “that n*gger”— apologizing to me for his racism in an astonishing act of repentance that still boggles my mind. There were many reasons, but Paul, the skinny illustrator I met in Chicago, played a pivotal role. Through those Bible studies and other experiences with White evangelicals, I had acquired the patience and the spiritual tools I needed to forge bonds with people who were different. My White relatives were, despite their blind spot on race, devout Roman Catholics. We shared the same language of grace and quoted the same scripture about forgiveness: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Our mutual faith became a bridge to one another, not a barrier. Only now do I realize there was another vital factor that led to my conversion on both race and faith. And it had nothing to do with religion. A third space is a location where people spend time together in community away from their first and second places: home and work. The term was coined by the late sociologist Ray Oldenburg to describe those areas where we forge relationships with people unlike ourselves. Third spaces furnish the connective tissue that hold a multifaith and multiethnic democracy together, Oldenburg said. “There must be places in which people can find and sort one another out across the barriers of social difference,” he said. “There must be places akin to the colonial tavern visited by Alexander Hamilton, which offered, as he recorded, ‘a genuine social solvent with a very mixed company of different nations and religions. But third spaces, like the colonial tavern, are disappearing from America. On Sunday mornings I often drive by grand churches with nearly empty parking lots. My congregation is full of gray-haired members (including me), and I want to do a cartwheel whenever I see a young person visit. This retreat from church mirrors a larger retrenching. Participation in civic groups has plummeted; movie theaters are closing; people increasingly shop online instead of going to stores. When I walk through my neighborhood at night I see deserted streets, empty front porches and blue glows from televisions flickering on bedroom walls. Something else is disappearing: the hopefulness I felt in many of the White evangelical churches I attended as a young man. Promise Keepers collapsed and has been rebooted as a partisan battering ram. Many non-White people abandoned White evangelical churches after the George Floyd racial reckoning. The most toxic phrase one can use today when talking about racial justice is not critical race theory, DEI or reparations. I once had a White editor tell me after reading an essay I wrote about reconnecting with my White relatives, “This story isn't angry enough.” The reasons behind why so many White evangelicals abandoned racial reconciliation is complex, but my quick take is this: Some were terrified of becoming a racial and a religious minority in a rapidly changing nation, so they acted out of fear instead of faith. Do most evangelicals worship Whiteness instead of Jesus? The evangelical church in Chicago I joined is still going strong. But I lost contact with Paul after we both graduated from college. It took me years to appreciate his friendship and what it did for me, and I didn't have the words to tell him that at the time. I didn't even bother to get his last name. I'm also left with some other difficult questions. Will I ever experience the “warm, tiny glow” I first felt in that Chicago Bible study and at those Promise Keepers rallies? And as I read today's headlines, which warn of a potential civil war as American soldiers and masked ICE officers sweep through American cities, I also wonder this: Will any of us ever feel that way again?

People visit the ancient Roman Colosseum, in Rome, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. ROME (AP) — The man who just took charge of Rome's top tourist attraction wants to set the record straight: the Colosseum won't be hosting any electronic dance music parties on his watch. Simone Quilici, director of the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, shared his plan to bring concerts to the almost 2,000-year-old amphitheater in an interview with an Italian newspaper earlier this month, and social media proceeded to do what it all too often does. “Massive raves” were imminent, multiple accounts trumpeted alongside AI-generated images of multicolor light beams shooting from the arena into the heavens. A view of the ancient Roman Colosseum, in Rome, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Quilici told The Associated Press that he heard complaints from archaeologists and ordinary Romans, dismayed their cultural heritage could be so desecrated. Even electronic music fans expressed concern online about the damage a whomping bass beat would inflict on an ancient structure that continues yielding new wonders, like the emperor's secret passage that opens on Oct. 27. Concerts must respect the Colosseum as a “sacred space,” Quilici said, as it is integral to Roman identity and has become imbued with religious significance. I mentioned certain artists — not by accident — who haven't been ‘rock' for some time, who play calm music and attract a calm audience, because the important thing is that it's not a wild crowd,” Quilici, 55, said Friday in his first interview with foreign media since taking over on Oct. 20. But it was reported the opposite of what I said.” Concerts could be acoustic or jazz, he said, offering Sting as an example. “There are people who are extremely knowledgeable about daily life in past eras, with a remarkable level of scientific accuracy. So these activities are very welcome within the Colosseum park,” Quilici said. The Colosseum's first concerts and performances will take place in no less than two years, he added. “Unfortunately, as everyone knows, tourism is a commercial activity — an industry that does not always connect with culture,” he said on the Colosseum's uppermost balcony. “Bringing cultural activities into the mix would enrich this place, making it not only a site to visit, but also a place where one can experience and enjoy artistic events.” That's partly due to the Vatican's Jubilee year, held once every quarter-century, which continues to draw large tour groups of pilgrims. It's also because the Colosseum is one of just two must-see spots for short-staying tourists, along with Vatican City, and “already is at maximum capacity,” Quilici said. People visit the ancient Roman Colosseum, in Rome, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Therein lies the other great ambition for his tenure: inducing tourists to go elsewhere. Still, one-third of buyers visit only the Colosseum, according to park data. “Last year, tourists in Rome didn't stay just two and a half days; their visits increased to four days. So there's also the opportunity to use the Colosseum as a starting point for exploring less-visited places,” he said. Its giant paving stones provide passage into a golden countryside that evokes long-gone centuries and provides welcome respite from Rome's tourist-thronged center. All these sites and more are near to one another, though somewhat disjointed – archaeological islands mostly separated by busy roads. “It's a collective effort, one that requires cooperation from all the different administrations,” he said. Choices that sometimes can be simple decisions like limiting traffic — not necessarily involving major expenses, but rather a courageous choice to restore life to the heart of the city of Rome.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Permitting Council is pressing ahead with President Donald Trump‘s priority of expediting key infrastructure projects, such as mining, despite the government shutdown. The government shutdown is in its fourth week, leaving many federal agencies with furloughed employees. However, the Permitting Council, a federal agency responsible for guiding essential infrastructure projects through the permitting process, continues its efforts to advance them. Emily Domenech, executive director of the Permitting Council, told the Washington Examiner, “We're still coming to work and making sure things are getting built, and we have the results to show that this is a worthwhile endeavor.” Since the shutdown, Domenech noted that some projects have completed their processes, including the Caldwell Canyon Mine Project in Idaho, which will mine phosphate. “We did not slow down at all,” Domenech said. “We really did work with the [Office of Budget and Management] and the White House ahead of time to say, ‘hey, look, we're going to prioritize moving projects that are in the President's priority sectors. Most of the council's activities are funded through the Environmental Review Improvement Fund, which supports federal environmental review processes for various projects. Domenech said, for example, that the council helped fund staff who worked on mining projects in the Department of Agriculture because it did not have a large, robust staff. “We have the ability to transfer our funding that keeps us open during the shutdown to these other federal agencies as needed, if it's required, to bring folks back from furlough,” Domenech said. Domenech said the council has brought back about a dozen of its own employees from furlough. However, more than three dozen employees at other agencies have returned to work as a result of the council emphasizing their key role in the permitting process. “We are looking to focus on sectors that were either sort of been under assault by the previous administrations … or were forgotten,” Domenech said. “I think the mining sector really is that forgotten sector that did not get attention from previous administrations, even when maybe it should have.”</p>
