                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Laugh Factory Chicago is crowdsourcing to assist night manager Nathan Griffin with legal funds after he was arrested Friday morning outside the comedy club. Despite being born in America, masked federal agents tackled him to the ground and reportedly took him into custody without due process, for attempting to intervene with an immigration operation. A video of the arrest shows at least four agents in camouflage pushing Griffin to the ground and handcuffing him, briefly pinning his mother Elaine Plybon down in the process. Where are you taking him?” bystanders could be heard shouting as he was put in the backseat. “After being arrested and hidden throughout the system, he finally resurfaced about 4 hours after his detainment in FBI custody awaiting a hearing for a federal assault charge which could carry 8 years in prison if convicted,” wrote Griffin's brother-in-law on a GoFundMe page for his attorney costs. In a video since posted by his mother, she noted that her “voice is still very messed up” and her hand is hurting from the altercation. “For those of you who don't know, I was in Chicago visiting my son, and he was kidnapped by Border Patrol in front of my eyes,” she said. “When I think about going out the door in the morning, I don't want to,” she added in part. Neighborhood resident Will Kolic told NBC Chicago he saw agents pull up and grab a man who appeared to be Hispanic before people gathered and “started screaming stop it,” before more agents stepped out of the vehicle and arrested Griffin. A Border Patrol spokesperson told the outlet that Griffin “attempted to impede and obstruct federal officers” by attempting to shut the car door on an agent's leg. Chicago Police arrived on the scene around 9:20am in response to a call about a battery in progress, telling NBC they worked to “de-escalate and conduct crowd control to ensure all those who had gathered at the location remained safe.” In a since deleted post by Laugh Factory Chicago, sharing the arrest video, they stated that Griffin's family is aware of his arrest and “actively working to get his release,” according to CBS News. Griffin's arrest comes after the Trump administration deployed 300 California National Guard troops to Oregon, under the guise of law and order, in addition to boots on the ground in Chicago and other major cities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Elsewhere, awards hopeful Springsteen biopic 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' settled for a fourth-place finish. Japanese anime feature Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc is off to an impressive start at the U.S. box office, where it opened to an estimated $17.3 million from 3,003 theaters, well ahead of expectations in another win for the genre. Since its first launch at the Japanese box office last month, Chainsaw Man — The Movie has already grossed north of $80 million worldwide. World Series 2025: Where to Stream the L.A. Dodgers vs. Toronto Blue Jays Online Without Cable Chainsaw Man follows the adventures of Denji (Kikunosuke Toya), a teenager and demon hunter who is killed by his overlords, the yakuza. But when his beloved chainsaw-powered, devil-dog Pochita (Shiori Izawa) makes a deal and sacrifices himself, he is reborn with the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. However, Reze is not quite who she seems, and a series of battles ensues that could destroy Tokyo when their love story takes a twisted turn. “It's safe to say that manga and anime fans won't be disappointed, even if they'll inevitably be nitpicking about one narrative aspect or another,” writes THR in its review. Heading into its U.S. opening, Chainsaw Man was expected to battle Blumhouse and Universal's holdover hit Black Phone 2 for No. But it quickly pulled ahead of the pack thanks to males, who made up 75 percent of all ticket buyers, and younger moviegoers. It's also drawing an ethnically diverse audience, including over-indexing among Asian moviegoers (20 percent), according to PostTrak. In a second surprise twist, holdover Black Phone 2 found itself in a closer race with Regretting You — the second Colleen Hoover book adaptation to hit the big screen after 2024's box office blockbuster It Ends With Us — but ultimately pulled ahead by a narrow margin, according to Sunday estimates (the race won't be officially called until Monday morning). The Blumhouse and Universal's release is holding remarkably well for a horror title, and should continue to take advantage of being the only major studio horror film opening nationwide over the Halloween corridor this year. Many expected Regretting You to be dinged by generally withering reviews, but the female-fueled pic garnered strong exits on PostTrak and boasts an audience score of 87 percent on Rotten Tomatoes (its CinemaScore, however, was only a B). It's also clearly benefiting from being one of the few films to target women amid a glut of male-sewing fare, and is also a testament to Hoover's continued popularity. (She's stayed mum on the topic of the ongoing legal battle between It Ends With Us director/producer Justin Baldoni and actress/producer Blake Lively). The new film is described as a romantic drama that explores the aspirational theme of living life fully and without regrets. Internationally, the film opened week in 40 markets, including the U.K., Australia, Brazil and Mexico, for an early foreign total of $10 million. Disney's Bruce Springsteen bio-drama and awards hopeful Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere had to settle for fourth place in its debut after coming in behind expectations with $9.1 million domestically and $7 million internationally for a global start of $16.1 million (it has yet to roll out in 20 percent of the foreign marketplace). The movie, coming in on the low end of expectations, is skewing notably older, which is no surprise, and Disney is confident the pic will have staying power because of its subject matter, originality and solid-to-strong audience scores. That's a demo that isn't known for rushing out to see a film on opening weekend; it also cares more about reviews. The movie's Rotten Tomatoes critics score presently rests at 61 percent, while the RT audience score is far stronger at 85 percent. Springsteen, playing in a total of 3,460 cinemas, benefited from 250 IMAX runs and an additional 750 in other premium large-format auditoriums, but it still couldn't clear $10 million. The music-infused pic stars Jeremy Allen White in the titular role, and he is credited in THR‘s review for giving a “raw and internalized performance as The Boss.” Jeremy Strong, Stephen Graham and Odessa Young also star in director Scott Cooper's examination of a brutal comedown after a blockbuster tour, which yielded the prolific musician's most personal album, Nebraska. At the specialty box office, Neon launched Shelby Oaks in 1,823 locations. Marking YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann‘s debut feature, the found-footage pic opened to a solid $2.4 million. So far, its main claim to fame is that it raised $1.4 million via a Kickstarter campaign, the highest amount ever for a horror title, per the crowd-sourcing platform. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the acclaimed film stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Yorgos Lanthimos rolls out another award-worthy film with Emma Stone for the third consecutive year, he's due for some R & R. The 5x Oscar nominee recently admitted he needs “a little break” after his latest movie Bugonia‘s wide release on Oct. 31, despite also intending to take a breather after his previous two titles, Poor Things (2023) and Kinds of Kindness (2024). “Well, I can't keep doing that anymore. [Laughs] That's what we're certain of right now,” he told Collider, adding: “It's a big mistake. I'm going to take a little break.” The pair also made Kinds of Kindness while he completed post-production on Poor Things. “I decide which film to make every time a script is ready, so when it is ready, and we've been working on something for such a long time, it just feels like a shame to just leave it there and wait,” he explained. “So, I kind of forced myself, almost, to try and find the time to do it immediately after I finished something.” Lanthimos continued, “Like we shot Kinds of Kindness during that very long period of VFX on Poor Things, so I felt that I needed to do something during that time. Then, Bugonia, I had read three years before, and we worked with Will [Tracy] a little bit on the script, so it felt ready, and we just wanted to go out and make it. In Bugonia, now playing in select theaters, two conspiracy theorists (Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis) kidnap a powerful CEO (Stone), convinced she's an alien intent on destroying Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SUNDAY AM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is landing at the high end of where we were seeing it yesterday with $17.2M after a $5.2M million Saturday in a weekend where the Toronto Blue Jays and LA Dodgers were a complete distraction in the World Series, now with 1-1 tied streak. Running global cume on this anime movie is $108 million (40% of that coming from a September Japan release). Sony trailered Chainsaw Man on Demon Slayer, Him, One Battle After Another, and Tron: Ares. There were also Anime Influencer screenings at Alamo Drafthouse Downtown LA attended by 80+ leading creators, as well as an Anime Men (13M followers) Imax advance screening at the large format exhibitor's HQ in Playa Vista, CA. There was also a presence across Crunchyroll's platform and owned digital channels across 65+ markets, premium App Homepage placement, dedicated newsletters, video ads, podcast ad spots, and a YouTube watch-along livestream of the first season across five global channels. Premium formats, Imax and 3D drove an updated 63% of the weekend with AMC Empire in NYC the highest grossing venue with $72K. Universal/Blumhouse's second weekend of Black Phone 2 is edging out the start of Paramount‘s Colleen Hoover movie, Regretting You, $13M to $12.8M. Megaplex Theatres in Geneva, UT is the leading single-location gross at $16.9K. Bestselling woman's novel-turned-film, Where the Crawdads Sing, held -40% in weekend two and legged out to a massive 5.2 multiple off its $17.2M opening for a final stateside of $90.2M. That landed an A-, Regretting You has a B. We'll see what the hold factor is here for Regretting You; note that Crawdads had the advantage of a July 2022 playdate. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is arriving at the low end of its projections with $9.1M. That start is just north of what MGM's Aretha Franklin movie Respect did in its opening, $8.8M, which bowed in the summer of 2021 as movie theater were making their way back from the pandemic. The movie was shot with New Jersey tax credits and cost a net $55 million. Seriously, a lot of pure heart from Jeremy Allen White's prep as Bruce Springsteen to the production shooting in The Boss' NJ stomping ground; a lot went into this. Also complicating Springsteen‘s success is a non-holiday release date during an October World Series-NFL perfect storm weekend. Had Springsteen been released during the holidays, that's when this older skewing audience of 59% over 45 could truly find it. The movie was brought in by incoming Disney chief David Greenbaum as his first project since segueing over from Serachlight after A24 passed on the movie over its production cost. In its essence, Springsteen is more of an arthouse film than a big Bohemian Rhapsody 20th Century title, however, the studio didn't want to put it through Searchlight since they recently played James Mangold's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. Also, as is the Russian roulette with these possible awards contenders, if they're trotted out too early at the fall film festival troika, and they're not exactly perfect, it could spell doom for a movie's prospects. Springsteen, despite the brilliant performance White, didn't exactly wow following its Telluride world premiere and has been sitting on Rotten Tomatoes with a 61% fresh critics score. For the penny-counting older skewing audiences and their streaming apps at home, that doesn't scream ‘get out of the house.' At the same time, Disney is hoping for some sort of hold with 85% Rotten Tomatoes score and that 60% definite recommend from Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits. Note, just because Springsteen bottomed out, doesn't mean that rock performer biopic is dead. True, they are hard to stitch so that it's not the same old, drugs, sex and rock n' roll, but you have to have a groundswell, overcoming all odds story, and chock-a-block concert performances. This has been a successful sub-genre with Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocket Man and Elvis and Bob Marley: One Love post Covid. Why did A Complete Unknown win over in the story of off-beat poet-turned-electric guy, Bob Dylan? Why it was the whole romantic tension between Timothee Chalamet's Dylan and Monica Barbaro's Joan Baez (note that movie received an A CinemaScore to Springsteen‘s B+). Pre-release social media universe reach on Springsteen counted 160M, which was +4% ahead of the music bio genre norm per RelishMix, yet below that of A Complete Unknown (187.4M), Bob Marley: One Love (193.6M), In better news for arthouse, Focus Features' first limited weekend of Yorgos Lanthimos' zany corporate politco-hostage comedy Bugonia posted a $40,5K opening theater average at 17 theaters — that's the fifth best opening theater average YTD. Part of the promotion included free screenings for anyone who is bald, or yearning to be with a barber on hand at cinemas. Note, the distribution plan here for Bugonia is different from Lanthimos' Oscar darlings, The Favourite and Poor Things which played the Thanksgiving and early December corridor, riding their awards season buzz and posting and holding weekends where those pics were often making $2M to $3M a weekend. Black Phone 2 (Uni) 3,460 (+49) theaters, Fri $3.8M, Sat $5.4M Sun $3.76M 3-day $13M (-52%), Total $49M/Wk 2 Tron: Ares (Dis) 2,940 (-1060) theaters, Fri $1.3M Sat $2.2M Sun $1.4M, 3-day $4.9M (-56%), Total $63.3M/Wk 3 Good Fortune (LG) 2,990 theaters, Fri $925K Sat $1.3M, Sun $855K 3-day $3.1M (-49%), Total $11.8M/Wk 2 One Battle After Another (WB) 1,473 (-1059) theaters, Fri $650K Sat $940K Sun $740K 3-day $2.33M (-39%), Total $65.7M/Wk 5.

ParaNorman (Fath) 1,359 theaters, Sat $637K, Sun $478K, Wk $1.1M/Wk 1 of re-issue SATURDAY AM: In an autumn where prestige awards potential isn't working, nor attempted tentpoles like Tron: Ares, Sony/Crunchyroll anime proves its merit again with its latest Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc which is now looking at a $15.5M-$17M opening after an $8.5M Friday, powered by an A CinemaScore from fans. It will be interesting to see if the audience expands today as the fanbase for this movie are shouting its praises to the sky with an 82% definite recommend on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak. This is the ninth anime movie to open north of $10M, which is a big deal, because not every Japanese animation IP works on the big screen. What's great about this is that Sony has a new solid franchise in the wake of Demon Slayer. Even if this drops tonight in typical front-loaded anime fashion, it's another No. 1 win for Sony this year with non-traditional motion picture fare. As studios execs remain perplexed about what exactly works this fall, it's all anime, horror and Taylor Swift. Imax and premium large format screens are revving 58% of Chainsaw‘s weekend with the West, South and South Central its best grossing regions. There's also a great swath of diverse demos all around in 32% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, a very strong 20% Asian American and 13% Black. In PostTrak exits, women love the movie giving it a 77% definite recommend. Paramount snapped up the $30 million financed production post the Hoover It Ends With Us box office fiesta in summer 2024 (that moving making $351 million worldwide); Amazon MGM Studios took the author's novel Verity (out on Oct. 2 next year with Anne Hathaway and Dakota Johnson) while Universal snapped up Reminders of Him (March 13 with Maika Monroe). Distrib sources are complaining that the World Series is cutting into male moviegoers this weekend. Then why the hell are you booking movies aimed at men during a juggernaut time when guys can't come? While we're on the subject of bad release dates for what should be older skewing male movies: 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere which has now shifted its range to $9M-$10M (many are seeing $9M) after a B+ CinemaScore in fourth with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 second weekend ahead in 3rd with $12M (-56%). If Springsteen hits the bottom of its tracking range at $9M, it won't be “Glory Days” for this net $55M Jeremy Allen White-Jeremy Strong starring production. Why isn't this brand-name rock performer movie not being released over Christmas ala last year's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown when a bigger audience is available? While older Springsteen fans showed up last night at 40% over 55 (the pic's biggest demo) and 59% over 45, it was clearly not in bulk judging from the grosses. Also, Springsteen was largely female leaning movie at 52%. Overall, this is very Caucasian leaning movie at 85% with few diverse demos showing up. AMC Lincoln Square is the top grossing location with over $32K so far. This is a standard NEON niche genre play. Overall ticket sales are clocking an estimated $75.4M, which is +8% from last weekend, but down 20% from a year ago when Venom: The Last Dance opened to $51M. Remember, New Line's Mortal Kombat 2 was suppose to open this weekend before it moved to early May next year; a brilliant release date change by Warner Bros, sidestepping the World Series. One Battle After Another (WB) 1,473 (-1059) theaters, Fri $650K (-43%), 3-day $2M (-47%), Total $65.4M/Wk 5 FRIDAY PM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is slicing its way to the top of the box office with a good $8M today for what's shaping up to be a $14 million-plus weekend. While at the high end of its $11M-$14M projections, and a clear No. RelishMix reports that the social media reach on Chainsaw Man is massive at a half billion, 6x above anime genre norms across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram combined with gigantic video views counts on YouTube of 351 million and counting. Note Chainsaw Man‘s reach on social is 2.5x more than Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle before its opening which stood at 200 million. Reports the social media stat org, “Convo runs positive for Chainsaw Man-The Movie: Reze Arc, with fans losing their minds over animation studio MAPPA's cinematic polish, the faithfulness to the manga's art style, and Kenshi Yonezu's soundtrack. The chatter even positions it above competing anime events, with praise like ‘compared to the recent Infinity Castle, Reze arc was kick ass—would watch in theaters again' and ‘I absolutely love how loyal they stayed to the art style, it feels like the manga came to life.' The following music video alone is racking up close to 68 million views on YouTube. Second is a three-way race between 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere (3,460 theaters), Paramount's Colleen Hoover movie Regretting You (3,393 theaters) and the second weekend of Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 (3,460 theaters) each looking at $10.8M-$12M. For Black Phone 2, that hold-range is better than -60% with at least $47M by Sunday, which would be $400K less than Black Phone at the same point in time of its ten-day run. Neon's horror thriller from Chris Stuckmann, Shelby Oaks, is spotting $1.1M today for a $2.5M take at 1,823 sites. This is in the range of Neon's summer 2024 horror title, Cuckoo which opened to $3M. FRIDAY AM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc revved up $3.4 million in previews Thursday in screenings that began at 4 p.m. at 2,500 locations. By the way, that preview number is close to the $3.8M posted by Demon Slayer: Mugen Train back in April 2021, on its way to a three-day total f $21.2M as movie theaters were reopening from Covid. That title, released by Funimation/Aniplex, had a Friday of $9.5M. The Tatsuya Yoshihara-directed Chainsaw Man based on the popular manga is expected to ring up $11M+ in a weekend that might now be too close to call with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 with an expected $12M+ second frame. Chainsaw Man is 100% fresh from 18 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 99% audience score. Meanwhile, 20th Century Studios' $55M Scott Cooper-directed Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere strummed $850,000. Note that preview take is under the $1.4M Christmas preview gross of Searchlight's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, which went electric over the holidays with a $7.2M opening day, $11.6M 3-day and 5-day total of $23.2M. Critics aren't wowed by this rock performer biopic at 61% fresh, but fans last night enjoyed it better at 85%. Jeremy Allen White plays Bruce Springsteen and Jeremy Strong plays his manager Jon Landau in a semi-biopic about The Boss recording the personal 1982 album Nebraska which preceded his global phenomenon Born in the U.S.A. Paramount is not reporting grosses on Regretting You given its limited run in under 500 theaters last night, with one showtime for the A Night of No Regrets fan event that included a Q&A with cast and director Josh Boone with a special performance by Hannah Cohen. Nonetheless, sources say the movie did better than Springsteen last night. Critics don't like the schmaltziness of Regretting You at 34% on RT, but there was also never beginning with them on It Ends With Us which they threw Kleenex boxes at with 54%. Neon this frame has the psychological thriller Shelby Oaks, which did $515K from combined mystery screenings and last night's previews. Black Phone 2 (Uni) 3,411 theaters, Thu $1.6M (-11% from Wed), Wk $36M/Wk 1 One Battle After Another (WB) 2,532 theaters, Thu $350K (-18%) Wk $5.5M (-45%), Total $63.4M/Wk 4 Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. I hadn't seen the original Korean movie it was inspired from until just a few days ago and it manages to completely make the story its own and offer something fresh and utterly compelling imo. I know Emma Stone probably isn't going to win a third Oscar at such a young age but dammit if we were going performance wise and not politics or whatever girl should have it in the bag. Speaking of music biopics, there's a Milli Vanilli movie barely released in the US that is available to see now on various streamers that is absolutely fantastic. JAW & Glenn Powell, they're not “movie stars” I ain't paying $20+ to see streaming stars with streaming caliber acting in mediocre movies. I can't believe social Network 2 is going with both of them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That fall, Dylan, then only 20 years old, recorded his first album with producer John Hammond. Among the many unheard tapes crammed into the box's eight discs are leftovers from those sessions, including an alternate version of the traditional “Man of Constant Sorrow.” Sounding like an unsure Boy Scout asking for the approval of his Scoutmaster after attempting a square knot, Dylan lays down a take and then asks Hammond,  “Did you get that? … Did you like that?” But when Hammond asks if anyone else had cut the song already, a different Dylan emerges. As with the film, it tells a familiar story: earnest and ambitious but seemingly fumbling kid with a mysterious background moves to the big city, ingratiates himself with a music community, knocks everyone's beret's off with his skills and songs, and then begins leaving behind all those inspired by news headlines in favor of more ambitious, poetic, and personal ones. Needless to say, that story has been told on his official releases of the era, from Bob Dylan to Another Side of Bob Dylan and Bringing It All Back Home and beyond. But Through the Open Window brings us another side of that transformation. Using a plethora of sources — unearthed club recordings, tapes of Dylan singing in people's homes or at rallies, outtakes from recording sessions, stage remarks — it allows us to eavesdrop as Dylan moves from the Midwest to New York, hits the Village coffeehouse and club circuit, tries out songs for friends, interacts with fellow performers, plunders some of their repertoire (especially that of his mentor Dave Van Ronk), even interacts with a gushing radio DJ. As familiar as that map is, we've never been afforded such a granular document of that metamorphosis, and how fast, relentless, and often breathtaking it could be. Compiled by Steve Berkowitz and Sean Wilentz, the massive box (also available in a two-disc distillation for Dylanologists on a budget) includes a certain amount of material already available on previous Bootleg Series editions and other Dylan compilations. But 48 of its cuts have never been heard by anyone other than collectors and Dylan's gatekeepers, which lends added weight to its historic value. We finally get to hear one of his fall 1961 sets at Gerde's Folk City: not the one that New York Times critic Robert Shelton saw, resulting in the rave review that landed Dylan his record deal, but one a few nights later, which is close enough. Not all of these rarities live up to their legends: that Folk City set is a bit anticlimactic, and “Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues,” his infamous dig at the nutjob conservative group, is a little too cute. But their appearance on any Dylan collection is long overdue. Don Was' Studio Secrets: Unheard Rolling Stones Music, Ozzy Osbourne/Madonna Duet Greil Marcus on 50 Years of ‘Mystery Train': “I Know These Stories Keep Traveling” Along the way, though, Dylan's transformation from frisky, plucky folk upstart — a walking, talking, cap-wearing version of the Anthology of Folk Music collection everyone was discovering at the time — to master of his domain is heard in large and small ways. Recordings of him playing Woody Guthrie and Jesse Fuller songs before he moved to New York show how fully invested he already was in American vernacular music; his sound and persona were already in the works before he stepped into his friend's car for that ride to New York City. As anyone who saw his early New York performances still attests, Dylan was also legitimately funny, and the comic timing on display in these tapes is another revelation. At various shows, he charms audiences with tales of almost getting hit by a bus on the way to the venues, the idea of written setlists (“I don't much believe in lists … I went around and I copied down all the best songs I could find off everybody else's lists,” he cracks), or a hokey fake-hootenanny movie he'd just seen in Times Square (“Don't tell anybody,” he jokes, adding, “42nd Street, a very hip street”). It's a chatty, endearing side of Dylan we've rarely, if ever, heard onstage since. There are also hints of his post-folk future in an early original, “I Got a New Girl,” which he croons as if prepping for Self-Portrait years later, and the piano-locomotive “Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,” a Times They Are A-Changin' outtake that pounds with a rock & roll heart. Some Gen Z Men Are So Scared of Getting Filmed They've Stopped Dating Nelly Furtado Is Stepping Away From Performing ‘For the Foreseeable Future' ‘A House of Dynamite' Is Not the Armageddon Procedural You're Looking For The transformation of “Tomorrow Is a Long Time” into the somber beauty it became is remarkable, and a version of “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,” taped at a friend's place in Los Angles, is mesmerizing. By the time he arrives at Carnegie Hall, with three albums under his belt, Dylan is fully in command of his voice, songs, and presence. He sings his “North Country Blues” as if he were a member of that devastated coal-mining family before moving onto “A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,” which feels like a statement of its own: That was the feel of folk music then, but this is folk music now, and on his terms. Yet move on he did, plugging in just over a year and a half later and leaving that period in the Carnegie Hall dust. But as Through the Open Window makes clear, he was always on the verge of slamming one window shut and opening another to an entirely different world.</p>

In searching out confirmation as to when Scott Cooper‘s Bruce Springsteen film, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” first tacked on that “Springsteen,” a quick Google search helped, as did the AI Overview leering at me from the top of the page. Next: “The title was officially changed to ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere‘ in June 2025, according to news reports and the movie's production status updates” (well, really, it was a new trailer, but OK). Related Stories Oscar Winners Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers Used a ‘Sinners' Camera and More to Preserve Cinema History in ‘The Eyes of Ghana' Jeremy Strong Loves Figuring Out Real People, from Mark Zuckerberg to Jon Landau in ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere' What is “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” really about? As our own David Ehrlich wrote in his review out of Telluride, it “is a semi-desolate sketch of a biopic about a depressed 32-year-old man” who  is also “haunted by unresolved childhood trauma and suffering from a depression that he knows how to sing about but lacks the words to diagnose” and “is at its best during the frequent stretches when it finds Bruce staring at the walls of his isolated rental home in Colts Neck.” Trailers for the film — which has now screened at Telluride, New York Film Festival, and AFI Fest, to name a few, so it's certainly not hiding — play up the more glitzy and recognizable moments of Springsteen's career. These are also moments that have relatively little to do with the film itself. If moviegoers are taking marketing on its face, who could blame them for expecting to see a film about Bruce and the E Street Band on the road? Or, consider this clip, the only one on 20th Century Studios' dedicated “Deliver Me from Nowhere” YouTube page, which is entirely comprised of a performance of “Born to Run.” For those keeping track, Cooper's film is about the creation of Springsteen's album “Nebraska.” “Born to Run” is not a track that appears on that album. And while this performance is indeed part of the film, it's a very weird pick to represent the entire feature. Hell, they'll expect to see significantly more of the E Street Band in general. Other marketing, the kind of stuff that people who would need to seek out (like, oh, big fans of Bruce) is more honest, like this featurette all about Cooper's approach to this specific time in The Boss' life and career. Cooper isn't shying away from what sort of film he's made, even if audiences might be surprised. As he told IndieWire earlier this week, “So many people have preconceived notions about a music film about Bruce Springsteen. … This is probably the most unexpected story that folks will get about a music icon. … I'm realizing this film is not what people expected. Now, whether it's what they wanted is another thing.” If it's not clear: I am a huge Springsteen fan. I've seen him live over a dozen times — that includes actual concerts, performances at premieres (like the NYFF premiere), and quite literally live in his own home studio when I interviewed him for “Western Stars” in 2019 — and the prospect of a biopic uniquely tailored to some of Springsteen's continuing obsessions, interests, and neuroses is particularly appealing to me. And, based on the general queries I've made of other Bruce fans, that holds true for them, too. (Fun fact: Ehrlich's older brother is a Springsteen freak who has seen him in concert so many times that he's pushing triple digits with his count. Those are not the people who need a trailer or a clip or a title that simplifies what they're going to see (or, if we're being more candid about it, just kind of lies about it). Those are the people who will come multiple times, tell their fellow fans to check it out, to champion it. They're Bruce fans; dedication is part of their DNA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former cook for hoteliers Daniel Langlois and Dominique Marchand, Delsol heard news of a charred vehicle not far from her old workplace, eco-resort Coulibri Ridge. Worried about her family, who had land near the incident, she raced across the treacherous, rutted road to see what was amiss. “It is very painful for us because we've lost two great people,” she says. “That's the first time we are ever having a crime like this in Dominica.” Nearly two years later, there's still evidence at the crime scene that shook this small island country — ash on jutting rocks, melted scraps of plastic and fabric scattered in the verdant shrubbery where wild dogs stalk giant lizards. A crime scene that's no longer just a crime scene — but something in limbo, much like the tragic case of Langlois and Marchand, who have yet to get justice. Langlois and Marchand were the de facto patron saints of Dominica, a small island country that settlers played tug-of-war over for centuries until it went independent in the ‘70s. Langlois and Marchand were long-time philanthropists, even before they moved across oceans. Langlois — a Canadian VFX visionary responsible for the tech that made movies like Jurassic Park possible — and his partner Marchand collaborated not only on Coulibri Ridge, but also rebuilding jetties, a primary school, and coral reefs after the devastating 2017 storm. “When I heard of his demise I was very much taken aback and sad,” says Ericson Degallaire, principal of the Soufrière Primary School, which Langlois and Marchand meticulously rebuilt with the same materials they used for their eco-resort. Now, children laugh and study in the open-air structure, boasting candy-bright paint. “Since his demise, things have not been the same in terms of that economic activity. The question soon became: Why would anyone want this couple, who had given so much to their community, dead? Degallaire says that the man never waved to him when he drove by the school toward his 1720s estate; islanders claim he filmed them when they got too close to his land; and TripAdvisor reviews paint a picture of a man who shouted at anyone who stepped foot on his property sans invitation or reservation. “The White American manager… informed us in a very rude and unfriendly way to get off his estate straight away,” wrote one reviewer. “Almost felt we were about to manhandled off the premises.” And that was a problem, since what islanders considered a public road passed through Lehrer's property — as did Langlois. How ‘The Perfect Neighbor' Uses Police Bodycam Footage to Reframe a ‘Stand Your Ground' Tragedy Years After His Arrest, She's Still Searching for Answers What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong According to local press, this dispute over a simple spit of land could have culminated in bloodshed. MORNE ROUGE ROAD first appeared on a map in the late 1770s, tread by slaves, foreigners, and citizens for hundreds of years before and after Dominica became an independent nation in 1978. Lehrer and Langlois began battling over the road in 2014; Lehrer said it was his property and that Langlois' heavy trucks were clipping the sides of his ancient estate. Langlois — and many other residents — maintained that it was a public thoroughfare. Ayeola George, who works in public relations on the island, recalls an alleged run-in with Lehrer right before the murders when she was on her way to meet up with Marchand at Coulibri Ridge to discuss a charity concert. She got turned around on the dirt road, and drove too close to Bois Cotlette. But at the same time, I knew of his aggressions toward locals. A PR rep for the Lehrer family could not comment on this particular incident, but pointed out that islanders had staged a protest on the road in 2018 after alleging that Lehrer blocked the byway. It hardly mattered at that point, though, since the police had arrested Jonathan Lehrer and his bus driver Robert Snyder Jr. for murder. Lehrer — who has maintained his innocence to Rolling Stone claimed he wasn't bothered by the road ordeal — has been locked away in Dominica State Prison for over two years now. “To truly understand the inhumane conditions, you must be able to imagine the cell block,” says his 25-year-old daughter, Emma, who grew up largely on the island and has always dreamed of returning there as a doctor. She also claims that islanders' views of her father are wildly incorrect, describing him as a sweet, adventurous man who wasn't afraid to play pretend with his kids at theme parks. “[He lives in] a concrete room, with a hallway in the middle lined with six single-occupancy cells along each wall,” she says of his current predicament. “There is a lot of planted evidence, concealed documents, tampered witness statements, and more generally abuse of process that we hope to successfully showcase along with the perjury of police officers about the evidence they claimed early on before their suspicions were proved false,” she says. The news coming out of Dominica is much more opaque, filtering largely through local reports since both the defense and prosecution have yet to respond to Rolling Stone for comment. Lehrer remained imprisoned while the bail conditions were determined; those included about a quarter of a million in U.S. dollars and the revoking of his U.S. citizenship. According to Lehrer's family publicist, the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Police then submitted an application to reverse bail — which was denied by the judge. In December of 2024, the ADCP searched the prison where Lehrer is being held and found a set of jail keys in an “undisclosed location,” according to PR. Then, in January of this year, Lehrer was slapped with a weapons trafficking charge, which made bail ultimately impossible. Still, the charges allege that he was transporting an arsenal of guns on December 4th, when, as Emma points out, he was already in custody. Lehrer was again denied bail for these charges in March. “Sometimes what goes on in there, I think that the inscription should change to the high court of injustice,” adding that locals are afraid Lehrer will just be released and disappear in lieu of a trial. “The court should have been moving with a little more alacrity in that regard, so that all parties concerned, even Jonathan's family, if he's innocent [get answers].” Both sides, too, point to government corruption by way of explanation, Lehrer's defenders claiming he's being used as a foreign scapegoat for a crime he didn't commit, and islanders whispering that Lehrer is receiving preferential treatment due to his wealth. Lehrer's family is part of the country's controversial Citizenship By Investment program, whereby folks can obtain passports if they funnel money into local projects. Dubbed the Golden Passport program, it has had its share of issues, with the Government Accountability Project (GAP) alleging that the island has sold citizenship to such people as an Afghan spy, a Turkish millionaire-fraudster, and a former Libyan colonel under Muammar Gaddafi. Although Lehrer has not been accused of any malfeasance regarding the program, his original lawyer, Lennox Lawrence, was previously attorney general of Dominica. Still, in the past, Lawrence denied that this gave his client any advantage. “We have a system of separation of powers just like you have in the United States and in Canada,” he said. Finally, in August, a judge ruled that Lehrer and Snyder would stand trial for murder, with an indictment pending for September, but the indictment and trial have yet to transpire. “Jonathan has been denied the right to speak with media or see his doctor. To date, there is no trial date set as the government and prosecution scrambles to find a way forward for this case.” MEANWHILE, LEHRER's FAMILY also waits — back in Texas, where they worry every day that Jonathan will die from prostate cancer, for which they claim he is receiving paltry care.

You've probably seen English actor Jason Flemyng in Guy Ritchie and/or Matthew Vaughn‘s films, such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and X-Men: First Class. You may have seen him in such Hollywood movies as Rob Roy, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Seed of Chucky, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Transporter 2 or in small independent films from around the world. Now he is playing the antagonist in one of Britain's biggest TV dramas, season three of Trigger Point, starring Vicky McClure. Flemyng stars as Steven Wyles, who is causing the team of Explosives Officer, or Expo, Lana Washington, portrayed by McClure, all sorts of headaches with his sinister vendetta. “Someone is targeting individuals and demanding revenue,” according to a season three plot synopsis. Sony Pictures Classics Takes Kirk Jones' 'I Swear' Following TIFF Premiere Season three of the show, produced by Jed Mercurio's (Line of Duty, Bodyguard) HTM Television, in association with All3Media International, which distributes the series internationally, starts airing on ITV1 and STV on Sunday and will be available to stream on ITVX and STV Player. Flemyng talked to THR about his role and why he always seems to get cast as a baddie.I told to a friend of mine that you got cast in Trigger Point, and he said, “Yes, I recognize him. What can you share about your character in season three without spoiling too much? It's a cat-and-mouse game between me and Vicky, which was fun. When you meet people like that, you're like, “Please, let them be nice.” And Vicky was exactly as I expected her and exactly as I wanted her to be. There are some big dialogue scenes with Vicky that were a joy. What can you tell us about the dynamic between Vicky's Lana and your character Steven? It's a classic film relationship between the compassionate copper, even though Vicky is not a copper, but, you know, the compassionate protagonist and my character. He's been fucked over by the capitalist system. He is a byproduct of profit, and he's sick and dying, as a lot of his friends are. So he takes it into his own hands. But her character is compassionate and left-leaning, you could say. There are a lot of those head-to-head things where they discuss that, which is great. Her compassion for him is very understated, but we know it because she's such a great actress. I have more lines in one scene than I have in whole movies, because there are six-, seven-page scenes. But when you have good dialogue, it's easy. The writing was working well, and I hope that the audience will have compassion for him because they understand his predicament, and they understand what's happened to him. This landed on the desk, and I was like: Brilliant! I really didn't have much of an idea about it. I'm at an age where my kids are 14, and it's nice to be on the telly and at home. It sits easy with me that I'm not in Jordan, making a film that not many people are ever going to see. It's nice to be in London, filming with the people who know exactly what they're doing in a really tight machine. I have now watched the other seasons, which are great. And I think this year, it's sort of stepped up another level visually. So, I'm really excited to see what people think. Will your fans get to see more of you on mainstream TV shows then, maybe even as the hero saving the day for once?I'm with you on that. But the people who are in control need to make those decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pop star was at the top of her game, performing tracks from all three of her studio albums. Billie Eilish has been touring for well over a year at this point. She's probably exhausted — it would be understandable if she was sick and tired of life on the go — but if either of those things were true, the thousands of fans at the UBS Arena in New York on Saturday night (Oct. 25) would never have been able to tell. If anything, Eilish's marathon time on the road since the trek kicked off two Septembers ago has only made her a stronger, sharper performer, with the star commanding her setlist of songs spanning all three of her studio albums, her debut EP Don't Smile at Me and club-ready Charli xcx collaboration “Guess” with impressive stamina and musicality. And despite a headline-making instance of an over-aggressive concertgoer forcibly yanking her at a show in Miami, the best part of Saturday's show was the vulnerable connection and trust Eilish maintains with her fans regardless of the potential dangers. “You're very precious to me, and I feel the need to protect you always,” she said shortly before performing Oscar-winning Barbie anthem “What Was I Made For?” while holding the hands of front-rowers reaching out to her. Eilish, finally, is now in the final stretch of her HMHAS tour, with the nine-time Grammy winner having just a month left of shows to go before wrapping with two nights at the Chase Center in San Francisco in late November. From impeccable vocal moments to a hilarious looper snafu, check out Billboard‘s roundup of the best moments from her last stop in New York on her finale lap through the United States below. This certainly isn't the first time Eilish's vocal growth has been pointed out, but if there's anyone left out there who still thinks of her as a quiet, whisper-soft singer, all they need to do is attend one of her concerts to realize how wrong they are. Even from the opening number — Hit Me Hard and Soft‘s “Chihiro” — it was clear that she has completely leveled up in her singing capabilities, with the star beautifully belting freely and often throughout the set. That even included songs where you wouldn't necessarily expect her to let loose vocally, like on “NDA,” but it only ever elevated the original versions. 1 song on Hit Me Hard and Soft, Eilish proved that the track is still one of her all-timers with an exquisite and palpably passionate live performance toward the beginning of her set. Another thing that made the number extra special: the arena holding up their phone flashlights without Eilish even having to ask, surrounding her in a comforting glow as she poured her heart out in some of the most vulnerable lyrics she's ever written. “The thing is, it will only work if the entire room is completely silent for, like, one minute. Despite Eilish's plea, a fan or two couldn't help themselves when the arena went silent. “I love you!” they screamed as the singer recorded her first harmony layer, after which other audience members loudly scolded them. Shortly before one of the show's quieter moments — during which Eilish invites fans to sit down for a spell as she sings moving ballad “Your Power” and accompanies herself on acoustic guitar — the star gave a stirring speech about the importance of connecting with others through live music. “It's, like, a really dark time in the world,” she began. “It's a really scary time, and it's hard to feel like there's anything that's making a difference at all,” Eilish continued. “It feels like we're all doomed a little bit … but also, I think that it's really special that we have [this]. “I think we all really need it, and we need to be together, and we need to have this glue that keeps us one, you know?” Eilish added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two starred together on the CBS sci-fi series “Lost in Space,” where Lockhart played Dr. Maureen Robinson and Kristen played her daughter, Judy. She was one great dame,” Kristen shared, in a heartwarming, lengthy tribute. Kristen recalled a moment during production that revealed Lockhart's vibrant personality.“While filming ‘Lost in Space,' June would often go out on Friday evenings after a long day on the set,” she said. Kristen described Lockhart in a striking outfit of green and white crocheted bell-bottoms with a matching top, her hair loose and glowing. “She was magnificent,” Kristen wrote in her tribute: “A Rock 'n' Roll Queen.” Kristen also remembered Lockhart's generosity and sense of adventure. When Kristen was planning a fiftieth birthday surprise for her late husband, she hoped to arrange a ride on the Goodyear Blimp. “June immediately said that she would arrange this with one condition – that she be a part of the birthday surprise and excursion,” Kristen shared. As you could imagine, we all had one helluva day in the air.” Kristen said countless stories demonstrate Lockhart's intelligence, humor, and curiosity. “Her zest for life, whether it be listening to David Bowie or being honored by NASA with a public achievement medal for her dedication to space exploration, is just a few examples of why we all loved her.” “I treasure all of the moments, both professional and personal, I was blessed to experience with this incredible, intelligent, and beautiful woman,” Kristen said. “My heartfelt condolences to her loving family. Her work on “Lost in Space,” “Lassie,” and countless film and television roles continues to resonate with audiences across generations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The retired “Today” show anchor, 77, was taken from his Manhattan apartment on October 20 around 9 p.m., as reported by TMZ. “He's not dying,” a source told Page Six, while another insider told TMZ that Gumbel remained in the hospital through Wednesday, October 22, but was “doing OK.” It has not been confirmed whether Gumbel has since returned home, though those close to him were optimistic he would be discharged by Thursday. “They're being extremely tight-lipped about it,” one source shared, as per PageSix. As per photos published by TMZ, days after the hospitalization, Gumbel was photographed walking in New York City alongside his wife, Hilary. The former “Today” co-host wore a black jacket, baseball cap, and sunglasses while Hilary kept close to him. The sighting offered reassurance that Gumbel is regaining strength as he continues to recover. At the time, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant tumor and part of his lung. “It's nothing to hide from,” he said during a guest appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly, as reported by ABC. Gumbel hosted “Today” for 15 years beginning in 1982, working alongside Jane Pauley, Katie Couric, and Chris Wallace. He later became the host of HBO's “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,” where he earned widespread respect for his thoughtful reporting and interviewing style. He shares two children, Bradley and Jillian, with his former wife, June Baranco. His brother, fellow broadcaster Greg Gumbel, died in 2023 at age 78 from pancreatic cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kathy Garver is honoring June Lockhart following the beloved actress's death at age 100. Lockhart died on October 23 in Santa Monica, California, as reported by The New York Times. Garver and Lockhart first met while working together on an episode of the classic Western anthology series “Death Valley Days,” and they remained close for decades after filming. Garver recalled that Lockhart played her mentor in the “Death Valley Days” episode, portraying a knowledgeable librarian opposite Garver's character, who was based on a young Isadora Duncan. “She just had an inner sense of people and engaged in their energies,” Garver shared. The actress also remembered a surprising and intimate moment that became one of her most cherished memories. And she even announced on a talk show when I had not told anyone that ‘Kathy, you're pregnant.' “Her beautiful soul will take flight in heaven, to rest along with my husband David and dear sister Beverly. I know they will welcome her with warmth and love.” She made her feature film debut at age 13 in the 1939 adaptation of “A Christmas Carol,” appearing alongside both of her parents. A post shared by Amazing Time Capsule (@amazingtimecapsule) She continued performing well into her 80s, with recurring appearances on shows including “Petticoat Junction,” “General Hospital,” and “Beverly Hills 90210.” She also made guest appearances on series such as “The Beverly Hillbillies,” “Happy Days,” “Full House,” “Roseanne,” and “Grey's Anatomy.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
