                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About the BookWhen journalist Damian Hunter's wife falls into an unexplained coma, his desperate search for answers thrusts him into the secret underworld of vampire politics, demonic possession, and conspiracies older than civilization itself. Twelve years after vampires revealed themselves to humanity, a hidden Council of seven immortal lords manipulates global wealth, power, and blood. At its center sits Luciaus, an ancient being born of a cursed ritual—ruling from the Red Throne with charisma and cruelty in equal measure. From ancient Austria to modern Boston and Vienna's blood-soaked palaces, The Old Lords spans continents and centuries as Damian unravels a cosmic war that has never truly ended. As he descends deeper into the darkness, he discovers that the greatest battle may not be between angels and demons—but within himself. A blend of supernatural horror, political conspiracy, and spiritual reckoning, The Old Lords invites readers into a world where faith falters, evil evolves, and the line between redemption and ruin blurs forever.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most haunted place in Massachusetts must be Salem, right? Keeping an open mind, we'd be hard pressed to argue that the 15-month frenzy of mass hysteria that gripped the community didn't leave at least some kind of energetic imprint on the town. It's that what-if factor that draws hordes of visitors to Witch City every year during Halloween season, but today's lighthearted festivities are a far cry from the horror that gripped 17th-century Salem. "The Bridgewater Triangle, I think per square foot we've got more weirdness here than the Bermuda Triangle could hold a candle to, and the reason of course is so much history," Jeff Belanger, an author and lecturer who specializes in unexplained phenomena, told CBS News in 2022. The three points of the triangle-shaped vortex identified in 1983 by Loren Coleman, director of Maine's International Cryptozoology Museum, are located in the towns of Abington (north), Freetown (southeast), and Rehoboth (southwest). Read more: 10 Dangerous Cities You Should Never Visit Alone Like other reportedly haunted places, including the aforementioned Salem, Massachusetts and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania — home of one of the most haunted hiking spots in America — a number of horrific events and gruesome deaths have occurred within the confines of the vortex. One of the earliest recorded incidents dates to an epic battle during King Philip's War, a 17th-century stand-off between British colonists and indigenous members of the Algonquin, Nipmuc, Wampanoag, Pocumtuck, and Narragansett tribes. One of the bloodiest battles of the 15-month war took place at Hockomock Swamp, a 16,950-acre parcel of wetlands once home to a Wampanoag stronghold that was also considered to be a sacred place. Long before the fateful battle, colonists had already reported experiencing unnerving phenomena in the vicinity of the swamp, especially sightings of eerie light floating above at sunrise and sunset. It's not much of a leap to connect lingering energy related to the agonizing deaths warriors and colonists experienced in the vicinity of the swamp during King Philip's War to paranormal activity. "King Philip's War was the bloodiest battle in US or British history ever per capita, meaning the greatest population percentage died," Belanger told CBS News. Reports of spine-tingling activity in the region, an unassuming blend of suburban and rural, even pastoral, landscapes, include suspected cult murders and reported UFO sightings well into the 21st-century. It's also home to Fall River's Lizzie Borden House, one of the 50 most haunted places in the world. Cris-crossed with peaceful walking trails, the 5,000-acre woodland is far from foreboding, yet it's been the site of an inordinate number of violent crimes. In 1978, the body of 15-year-old cheerleader Mary Lou Marnuda was found tied to a tree. The murders of two more young women followed shortly thereafter, ultimately revealing an unsettling pattern of cult-like activity involving animal sacrifices and ritualistic murders. Could bad juju be lurking in the forest? Another reportedly haunted site, Assonet Ledge is said to be imbued with negative energy. In 2004, an allegedly happy and well-adjusted man who was walking with his girlfriend suddenly jumped to his death from the ledge. And we haven't even touched on the multitude of reported UFO sightings, let alone Bigfoot, giant serpents, and pukwudgies (mischievous creatures who can turn mean in a flash, according to tribal lore).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harvey Elliott was left out of Aston Villa's squad for their fixture with Manchester City on Sunday afternoon, with no official reason yet given but conspiracy theories circulating that he could be sent back to Liverpool. Elliott left Liverpool towards the end of the transfer window to join Villa on loan with an obligation to buy. That obligation is dependent on him making a certain number of appearances this season, believed to be 10. Elliott's only Premier League start for Villa so far culminated in him being taken off at half-time. This week, reports have suggested Elliott regrets his choice of move in the summer and that the deal between Liverpool and Villa could be cancelled. But until any explanation arrives, fans have been wondering if the writing is on the wall and Elliott will be sent back to Liverpool. Not a chance he's meeting the appearance requirement to sign permanently. Another added: “Think he'll go back in January, unless we have a season long loan that we can't get out of… he just won't play the 10 games?? Over on Reddit, one user suggested: “I half suspect that he's ringing home begging to get out of here at this point.” On the flipside to the suggestions Villa want to cancel the Elliott deal, some have wondered why Emery would have given him appearances lasting four minutes (Feyenoord) and 19 minutes (Everton) if unsure about activating a permanent deal. It's believed Villa are committed to paying £35m for Elliott once the obligation to buy kicks in, which isn't an insignificant amount of money. GO FURTHER – Five loans that MUST be cancelled ASAP Villa head coach Emery shed some light on Elliott's situation at a press conference this week. “At the same time, we have other players who can play as a 10 and they are performing well, and I have different players. “His quality, in my opinion, is to play No. They have also reportedly taken the lead in the race for a highly-rated LaLiga winger and have been backed to make an ambitious offer for a Real Madrid forward. These five loan spells haven't got off to good start this season and might need to be backed out of if possible Liverpool have 10 players out on loan during the 2025/26 season and we're keeping track of how all of them are getting on away from Anfield Crystal Palace have granted Marc Guehi permission to undergo a medical ahead of his transfer to Liverpool, but the £160m double deal including Alexander Isak could force two players out of Anfield</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As if zombies weren't enough to worry about, downtown Elgin was the scene of an extraterrestrial invasion Saturday night during the annual Nightmare on Chicago Street. The 13th iteration of the Halloween fright festival featured thousands of revelers in the streets of the downtown Elgin “safe zone,” while hundreds of performers, including zombie and alien actors, musicians and dancers, lurched along streets and entertained on multiple stages. This year's alien invasion theme was premised on extraterrestrials using televisions and lost VHS tapes to unleash horror on the earthlings. Juan Pietras of Rockford was at his fourth Nightmare and was happy to see a thinner crowd early in the night than in years past. “It's always a good time,” he said while he sipped a drink and watched the crowd on South Grove Avenue. Juan and his friends paid for VIP tickets, which allowed them early entrance and early food and drink before the crowds showed up after 8 p.m. The Plaza Stage featured the Afro-Latin grooves and punk-rock energy of La Misa as well as Chicago's Future Nobodies, Latin-based DJ JTC and hard core/ska band La Pobreska. The event also featured four themed pop-up bars for guests with all-access tickets, with settings that included a forgotten video store, a secret science-fiction facility, an Aztec underworld and a mad scientist's mansion. Seven “street experiences” included themes of “First Contact,” “Plaza Mictlán,” “Safe Zone,” “Cirq D' Freak,” “Kingdom of Plantae,” “Thunder-Dome: Welcome to the ​Blood Lands,” and “Svengoolie's B-movie Boulevard,” which included a meet-and-scream with Svengoolie himself. Dozens of vendors lined the streets, selling food, drinks and merchandise, while Bizarre Bazaar, a haunted marketplace, offered creepy crafts, trinkets, occult oddities and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigative YouTuber Anders Otteson told The Sun how he camped on public land overlooking defence firm Lockheed Martin's Helendale radar-testing facility, where he filmed the unknown object. Your info will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy You'll now receive top stories, breaking news, and more, straight to your email. UFOs are flying over US nuclear bases, says Trump's right hand man In one frame, a distinct blue area can be spotted on its upper surface. Sex attack suspect arrested after horror attempted rape on Paris train Tourists flee as Jamaica braces for hurricane set to become Cat 5 mega storm The ‘wild card' weapon that will decide Ukraine's fate - but could spark WW3... Mr Otteson, who runs a YouTube channel to document remote secret sites across the US, said it could be an advanced aircraft technology being tested. He told The Sun: “It could be something that is in an early stage of development, it could be a new manned fighter or a new drone. A slew of conspiracy theories suggests that many projects at the facility involve reverse-engineering tech whose origins are extraterrestrial. US officials and elected politicians are currently rallying for information about unknown objects flying in US airspace – including one of Trump's top team, Marco Rubio. Mr Otteson said if the US government possesses advanced or “alien” technology, Skunk Works would almost certainly be involved. “The Hellendale facility also has a massive underground chamber below it that's 200 feet deep,” he said. “It has spawned a lot of speculation about what other advanced projects might be being worked on in an underground facility like that. “It is a good place to store advanced technology underground and that is partially why it was built to hide secrets from Soviet espionage. It is thought that next-generation aircraft could potentially reach speeds of Mach 6 (4000mph) – doubling its predecessor's top speed and introducing cutting-edge capabilities for modern combat scenarios. Lockheed Martin announced in 2018 that they are working on the SR-72 project, with a prototype expected to fly very soon. Pete Davidson and Colin Jost's Staten Island Ferry sits abandoned in harbor It is also not yet clear if Lockheed Martin has been given an official go-ahead by the USAF to complete a prototype for consideration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aliens have warned humanity that we face destroying the planet in a breathtaking UFO discovery, which is being cited as "first contact." The alarming caution from "far away in time and space" urges humans to take steps to protect the  planet. In a chilling series of phrases, experts have concluded that our intergalactic neighbors have deep seated fears for the future of  earth as human beings evolve. Italian Sartori painstakingly interpreted each etched symbol, using ancient languages, links to Sanskrit and her knowledge of ancient lingual archeology and literature. Her conclusion is that the sphere's message relates to "oldest language spoken in some form on this planet." Sartori explained, "I believe there's a message here. Sartori's conclusion features in a 30 minute broadcast, streamed by Beacon TV's website, explaining how she formulated meanings of the sphere's markings on its shell. "I believe that man who is a co-creator because he's eternal also has a responsibility for the cosmos, because if something happens to earth, it will be a problem in the solar system and will have repercussions much further afield. Read more:  Moscow under siege as world's biggest military plane forced to fly low Read more:  World's longest straight road is 159 miles and has no curves at all Sartori stated the 31 etchings on the basketball shaped flying machine, not constructed on this planet, tease details of a flood. Because Indra speaks - that symbol - also of a flood. "In fact, many others who have studied Sanskrit and pre- Sanskrit speak of pre-law dates, but the flood is spoken of. There are many texts that speak of the flood." In recent months extraterrestrial life investigators and scientists have delivered staggering conclusions about the Buga Sphere not being from our current civilization. Presently, scientists believe that the sphere may not just be sending messages into outer space, but also receiving communication. The advanced screening appears to raise questions too about potential unknown metals or compounds. Among those filming the study was TV presenter Jack Osbourne and Emmy nominated documentarian Serena DC and as part or a new TV series. Jack, famous for hit series like Portals to Hell and The Osbournes Want to Believe, and Serena DC are trekking the world on a mission to find aliens or supernatural entities. The father of four detailed how he is determined to prove "intelligent creatures occupying planets" have connected to earth and humanity." Serene explained how their visit with the spheres and Sartori's conclusion are a "pivotal moment in human discovery." "If even half of the team's findings are real, what we are peering at is a threshold, where humanity could rewrite a chapter of our origin story and our place in the cosmos. Whether this is poetry, prophecy, or a record of something that truly happened long ago, we don't know yet. Teams from several laboratories are studying the sphere's precise alloy composition to determine whether these metals are of earthly origin or something else entirely. Whatever its origin, perhaps we're being reminded that someone or something is watching over us." But Jack expressed his belief in life in other galaxies, "I do believe that there are intelligent creatures occupying planets in this universe or occupying somewhere, whether it's in this universe or not, but I feel like there is a chance that we are the only living thing in this universe. Leading UFO journalist and award-winning Mexican TV host Jamie Maussan is the custodian of the sphere, leading this intriguing probe in Mexico. NASA scientists and US university professors have also studied the craft leading to a series of conclusions. The enigmatic object is seen by many as a confirmation aliens have visited earth. It made headlines when it was was spotted above Buga making movements impossible to conventional earthbound aircraft in March. Since crashing into power cables, scientists have spent months undertaking lengthy testing procedures. A University of Georgia report stated organic material found inside the Buga Sphere is approximately 12,560 years old, predating the pyramids of Egypt by seven millennia. In recent months, boffins have made a series of claims pointing to the flying object being not of this world. Radiologist Dr Jose Luis Velazquez reported finding "no welds or joints" which would typically indicate human fabrication. More testing is needed to establish its origin." The sphere's existence is controversial though, because there are no official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga. Australian Serena DC boasts a long track history of creating TV documentaries about many mysteries and unexplained things on the planet. The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>

AKRON − Theresa Caputo, a psychic who rocketed to fame through her TLC reality TV show, "The Long Island Medium," is heading to Northeast Ohio.

"Theresa Caputo Live! The Experience" will hit Nov. 8 at the Akron Civic Theatre.

"I've been touring for almost 15 years now," Caputo said. "Ever since I started doing 'Long Island Medium,' I decided to take the show on the road, so not only healing people in their homes every Sunday night, but also live and in person. The amazing thing about the live show is that you're in a space with thousands of people, and to watch someone heal in front of you and to watch the way Spirit moves me throughout the room is just absolutely incredible."</p>

Instead, they claim there was a “true sniper.” Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, was indicted on charges that include murdering Abe. Investigators have concluded that Yamagami was the sole perpetrator, and his defense team has also denied the involvement of multiple individuals. The truth lies in power” continue to be made on social media. The Yomiuri Shimbun used Social Insight, a tool for analyzing social media posts from data analysis firm User Local Inc., to examine posts on X with phrases such as “assassination of former Prime Minister Abe.” The analysis found that more than 600,000 posts, including reposts, had been made since the incident took place as of this month. This year alone, the number of such posts so far totals about 150,000. Many posts in July this year, three years since the incident, were found to have used such terms as “truth” and “mysterious.” The group's 79-year-old representative, who is a former Tochigi prefectural assembly member, said several hundred people attended the meeting. The social media posts claim that some major points are suspicious. Likewise, they claim a gunshot distinct from those made by the suspect's homemade gun can be heard in video footage of the incident. However, according to senior officials of the Nara Prefectural Police and senior prosecutors, the prefectural police carefully investigated whether any third parties were involved and found no proof that any were. Both the Nara Prefectural Police and the Nara District Public Prosecutors Office therefore determined that Yamagami had acted alone. “It's possible for observations made in an emergency while trying to save a patient's life to be different from the results of an autopsy,” the official said. Therefore, the involvement of multiple parties will not be an issue at trial. A doctor who performed the autopsy on Abe and a police officer who analyzed the suspect's homemade gun are among those who are scheduled to appear in the court hearings.

Oregon has for years struggled with a drug crisis, reporting one of the highest rates of substance use disorders in the US and ranking last in the nation for access to treatment. The problem is systemic, rooted in decades of failure to invest in the level of behavioral health services needed for people with mental illnesses and addiction. Workers from a Portland street outreach initiative coordinated by the Mental Health and Addiction Association of Oregon (MHAAO), a non-profit dedicated to peer recovery services, approached and offered help, saying they could immediately take them to a detox program. They entered detox, Washam got emergency surgery for his infection, and after eight days, they were placed in an outpatient program, then a sober recovery home. Since its launch, the program has connected 1,005 people to services, including 651 who received access to programs on the same day outreach teams met them and 159 who got into detox and treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities revealed this week that a man once named a person of interest in the disappearance of Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit was responsible for the 2006 killing of a Wisconsin woman and may have been responsible for other murders. The Wood County Sheriff's Office announced that Christopher Revak was behind the death of Deidre Harm, officially closing a case that had gone unsolved for nearly two decades. On Oct. 20, the Wood County Sheriff's Office shared a letter from District Attorney Jonathan Barnett on Facebook stating that he would have filed charges against Revak if he were still alive. Fbi Searches Area Around Campground Where Travis Decker's 3 Daughters Were Found Dead Her remains were discovered five months later by hunters in a wooded area near Seneca, about 5 miles from downtown, according to WSAW. "This may provide some closure for many but won't bring Deidre back," the Wood County Sheriff's Office and Wisconsin Rapids Police said in a joint statement. "Our thoughts and prayers will always be with Deidre's family." Revak, a Wisconsin native and former EMT, died by suicide in a Missouri jail cell in July 2009, just one day after being charged with second-degree murder in the death of Rene Williams, 36, a mother of three from Mansfield, Missouri. Williams was last seen March 13, 2007, at the Eagle Lodge bar in Ava, Missouri, where she worked. Revak was also at the bar that night, according to FOX 9. In 2024, KCCI Des Moines reported that Iowa and Wisconsin investigators were taking a fresh look at Revak, who had long been suspected of multiple violent crimes before his death. Notorious ‘Scorecard Killer' Linked To Decades-old Murder Nearly 45 Years Later According to a recent documentary, police have examined whether Revak may have been connected to as many as five different homicides over a 14-year span, including the disappearance of Huisentruit. Douglas County Sheriff Chris Degase, who investigated Williams' case, previously told Fox News Digital that Revak's confirmed link to Harm's killing deepened his concerns about the former EMT's violent history. Degase told KY3 that forensic evidence linked Revak to Williams' disappearance. We had her DNA inside his truck," he said. "I think the biggest thing was that they weren't able to find a body. Despite the lack of a body, investigators charged Revak with Williams' murder based on DNA results. Degase said his curiosity about similar crimes led him to uncover chilling parallels. "It wasn't the first time Revak tried to abduct a woman in Ava," he said. And when I Google searched from Wisconsin Rapids, Deidre Harm came up." New Crime Scene Details Emerge In Manhunt For Fugitive Dad Accused Of Killing 3 Daughters He didn't rule out the possibility Revak could have traveled to Iowa. "We're dealing with what's possibly a serial killer," Degase told KY3. "During his day, he's doing his deed to society and helping people and saving people, but there was a dark side to Chris Revak." Revak had also been a person of interest in the 1995 disappearance of Huisentruit, a 27-year-old morning anchor for KIMT-TV in Mason City, Iowa. She was declared legally dead in 2001, though her body has never been found. Despite three decades of dead ends, then-Mason City Police Chief Jeff Brinkley said in June the department continues to receive and pursue leads year-round. We have not stopped pursuing leads and information," Brinkley told FOX 9 at the time. Earlier this year, part of a 2017 search warrant was also unsealed. "We're still hopeful the case will be solved and justice served — no matter how long it takes," Brinkley said. Huisentruit's family continues to hold out hope for closure. "The pain and anguish felt by us and all who loved Jodi are immeasurable," her family wrote in a statement on the Jodi's Hope Facebook page. We still choose to hope that one day soon it will happen."
