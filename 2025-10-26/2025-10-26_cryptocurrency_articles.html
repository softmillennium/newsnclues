Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong has rejected the idea that cryptocurrencies are too expensive for new entrants. Armstrong's remarks come as Bitcoin trades over $100,000 and Ethereum near $4,000, figures that are likely to intimidate potential investors. This sentiment is often cited as a reason some investors engage in speculative trading of assets like memecoins, which lack utility and are prone to rapid booms and busts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A proposed XRP Ledger amendment, Batch (XLS-56), is generating excitement among developers and validators alike. One pseudonymous XRP validator, Vet, has shared his experience testing the Batch functionality on the dev net, where multiple transactions, including minting and payments for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), can be bundled and executed automatically. For instance, one could trade five of their NFTs for two NFTS owned by another party, all processed simultaneously to ensure atomicity and security, Vet said on X, suggesting a game-inspired interface, similar to the classic RuneScape, to make this NFT-to-NFT trading more engaging and intuitive for users. As of writing, the Batch amendment has achieved 68.57% consensus among validators, with 80% required for activation. XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain used by Ripple to build cross border payments solution. The Batch amendment introduces atomic transaction capabilities to the XRP Ledger, allowing multiple operations to be grouped and executed simultaneously as a single unified transaction. Therefore, an atomic process means that the entire set of transactions is either fully executed or entirely rolled back to ensure data integrity. A total of four batch modes are supported: ALLORNOTHING, ONLYONE, UNTILFAILURE, and INDEPENDENT. The availability of four modes will ensure flexibility in how multiple transactions are executed as a group, helping developers choose the best approach for their use case. OwlTing aims to capture this market by developing payment infrastructure that processes transactions in seconds for fractions of a cent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bolivia's Central Bank released a report exploring a wholesale CBDC, the digital Boliviano, to modernize payments and counter stablecoin growth. The Central Bank of Bolivia issued its first report evaluating a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). A CBDC would enable private banks to efficiently optimize high-value transactions. This is extremely important in a more digital world. Thus, efficiency and monetary control are addressed in the study. In this first phase of evaluation, the bank considered different models. This model only deals with transactions between financial institutions. Therefore, it would create an optimization of the internal processes of the payment system directly. This affects key financial players in the country. The report's use of stablecoins as a key factor is highlighted. It aims to keep monetary control in the digital age effectively. Furthermore, the fact that a wholesale CBDC is a controlled environment in which to test. Therefore, near-instant settlement between banking institutions could cut through operational friction dramatically. In essence, the digital Boliviano hopes to improve high-value transaction speed. Ultimately, such benefits would trickle down the entire Bolivian economy. Therefore, central banks are considering CBDCs to reclaim their role. Bolivia's exploration fits this international trend well. This move is aimed at ensuring the successful completion of monetary stability in long-term. A retail CBDC comes with complex issues such as public acceptance and privacy issues. In contrast, an interbank system makes for a focused and controlled implementation in the first place. This way, there are minimal immediate risks taken for the broader financial system. What's more, the potential integration with existing payment systems is critical. This prevents the whole overhaul right now. As a result, the transition may be less abrupt and less disruptive on the whole. The bank is focusing on practicality when making its assessment. In conclusion, Bolivia is taking a proactive approach to digital currency innovation in the present moment. But the central bank is being circumspect. It focuses on stability and control in this critical evaluation process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the European session, Ethereum (ETH) is showing a slightly bullish bias, trading at around $3,984 level with a 24-hour trading volume of $16.5 billion. The recent price action signals that buyers are quietly regaining control, as ETH consolidates within a tightening range between $3,920 and $4,115 – a zone that typically precedes major directional moves. In this case, ETH is breaking out to the upside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 58, suggesting mild bullish bias without overbought conditions, leaving room for continued upside. Recent candlestick formations, spinning tops, Doji candles, and a bullish engulfing pattern, underscore a tug of war between bulls and bears, with momentum slowly tipping toward buyers. Ethereum price prediction is likely to be bullish if ETH breaks above $4,115, the next resistance lies at $4,298 and $4,550, supported by historical Fibonacci levels. A rejection at current levels, however, could drag ETH toward $3,712 or $3,510, where demand has previously emerged. Conversely, a drop under $3,920 could open the door for short-term bearish setups toward $3,510. Ethereum's tightening price structure reflects volatility buildup – a condition often followed by sharp expansion moves. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto's biggest ecosystems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market is showing positive momentum as Ethereum and Dogecoin see gains. Amid these new animal spirits, Digitap ($TAP), a new player, is attracting attention due to its utility-based model and its applicability in cross-border payments. Given its features and rising interest, whale investors have added it to their watchlists as one of the potential coins to hold for 100x gains. It has seen a slight recovery on the weekly chart. Lookonchain data shows that a whale recently bought 8,491 $ETH. Ethereum has acted as a resistance cluster over the past week. Crypto Caesar predicts that the Ethereum price might soar to $4,500 after forming a triple bottom pattern. Four Crypto Spaces also confirmed the triple bottom pattern. He says the Ethereum price may climb to $4,700. He told his followers that ETH is tracking Bitcoin's fractal from February to December 2024. Just look at this beauty 😍$ETH is perfectly following the February-December 2024 $BTC Fractal 👌 DOGE is witnessing positive movement after a recent pullback. However, the price of Dogecoin is still within bearish territory. This suggests there is room for a Dogecoin rally if buying pressure increases. Ali_Charts noted that the Dogecoin price is ready to rebound. Also, Javon Marks notes that Dogecoin's chart points towards a 270% price spike. Don't make it more complicated than it is.$DOGE‘s trend points toward a nearly +270% move to All Time Highs with high likeliness of an extension. Digitap is creating a unique path in finance by merging traditional banking systems and DeFi into one platform. It seeks to take advantage of the increasing demand for quick digital transactions. Research shows that digital wallet transactions might reach over $16 trillion by 2028. The platform created by Digitap will allow its users to deposit fiat, store various types of cryptocurrencies, exchange assets in real-time, and connect to a Visa-issued card, enabling them to spend their crypto on Apple Pay or Google Pay. The fintech project will also support real-time crypto-to-fiat transactions, allowing freelancers, businesses, and migrants to send and receive money anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, Digitap has a built‑in AI routing engine that finds the most efficient path for every transaction. The project also has a mobile app, available for download on Google Play Store and App Store, which customers can use to monitor transactions and make payments. Reliability is backed by audits from SolidProof and Coinsult. These assessments reassure users and investors that Digitap's infrastructure blends robust TradFi rails with DeFi flexibility. Presently, Digitap is in the second round of its presale and has sold more than 50% of the tokens for this round. Ethereum and Dogecoin are currently targeting key resistance zones. While a breakout could see them reclaim higher levels in the coming days, Digitap offers more upside potential. Given its growing presale momentum and transformation of the multi-trillion-dollar market, analysts have tagged it the best cryptocurrency investment for newbies and experts who want to see 100x returns on their portfolios.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin a stark reminder that while blockchain security prevents even a majority of validator collusion from stealing on-chain assets, this protection vanishes completely when users trust validators with off-chain tasks. He noted that if 51% of validators collude or fall victim to software bugs, they cannot steal assets stored on-chain, but this ironclad protection vanishes the moment users trust validators with tasks beyond the blockchain's direct control. While on-chain funds remain cryptographically protected even under majority-attacker attacks, any off-chain activity that relies on validator honesty leaves users vulnerable to manipulation with no recourse.The Security Boundary Blockchain Can't Cross This decentralized verification means colluding validators cannot forge transactions or create invalid blocks that steal user funds. The system's distributed nature ensures that even majority control cannot override these fundamental safeguards.Source: However, this protection breaks down when validators handle off-chain tasks like oracle data feeds, governance decisions, or restaking services. These activities fall outside the blockchain's algorithmic enforcement and rely instead on validator honesty. A colluding majority could provide false data or manipulated outcomes without the cryptographic proofs that protect on-chain transactions. However, when users move funds off-chain, through custodial wallets, centralized exchanges, or validator-controlled computations, they surrender the blockchain's built-in protections. Off-chain systems lack the independent verification that every on-chain node provides, leaving them vulnerable to majority validator manipulation. The distinction matters because blockchain consensus operates through algorithmic rule enforcement that no single party controls.Source: When whether his warning referenced restaking protocols like EigenLayer, Buterin the platform addresses this vulnerability through slashing mechanisms using its own token. This economic penalty system provides some protection but cannot match the cryptographic guarantees that secure on-chain block validity against majority attacks.Balancing Privacy with Blockchain's Transparency Shield Buterin's security reminder comes as Ethereum pursues major privacy improvements that are different from the network's traditionally transparent nature. Earlier this month, he detailed GKR, a cryptographic technique that verifies calculations 10 times faster than traditional methods while enabling zero-knowledge proofs, allowing computers to prove calculations are correct without revealing the underlying data. Aside from enterprise demand, Vitalik sees it as the only way to global adoption, especially for Ethereum. That's the reality of crypto today, and why it "will never scale beyond a niche,” says Petro Golovko. Just recently, while speaking with Cryptonews, industry expert Petro Golovko compared current blockchain transparency to the pre-encryption internet era, arguing that systems exposing salaries and account balances remain “unusable for regular people and impossible for institutions.” The solution lies in cryptographic techniques like GKR that allow verification of transaction validity without exposing transaction details, preserving the blockchain's core security property where invalid blocks remain rejected even under majority attacks, while shielding sensitive financial data from public view.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nino Paoli is a Dow Jones News Fund fellow at Fortune on the News desk. The White House has released a list of donors for the Trump administration's new ballroom construction project, following a historic East Wing demolition that began this week. The estimated cost of the 90,000-square-foot build has topped $300 million, up from its July estimate of $200 million. President Donald Trump has insisted it will not come out of taxpayers' wallets. A list released by White House officials and reviewed by Fortune shows all 37 donors footing the bill instead—and it includes some of the nation's largest tech companies, companies with government contracts and members of the administration. Their private, tax-deductible donations will be made to the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall. Trump has previously said he will pay for some of the project, though his name doesn't appear on the list. CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously attended a White House dinner for tech leaders in September, where he pledged at least $600 billion in investments in the U.S. by 2028. Meta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, frequently engages with federal digital policy initiatives and AI oversight forums. The company announced plans in August to invest $100 billion in domestic manufacturing, aligning with Trump's wishes to reshore industrial work. CEO Tim Cook also attended the White House dinner last month and has maintained a close relationship with the administration. Founded by Jeff Bezos, the e‑commerce and cloud‑computing company has major federal contracts with the Pentagon and has cultivated a new relationship with the administration through intense lobbying. The search giant's parent company agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a dispute with Trump earlier this year over his YouTube ban following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Alphabet pledged $22 million of the settlement money to go toward the ballroom construction. The defense contractor is a major supplier for Pentagon programs and has received $33.4 billion in federal contract awards in 2025 alone, according to USA Spending. The company is reportedly contributing more than $10 million to the ballroom. “Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,” a spokesperson told Fortune. The software and cloud provider has multibillion-dollar federal contracts, including AI partnerships integral to U.S. cybersecurity strategy. The parent company of NBCUniversal faces scrutiny from Trump, who called for the Federal Communications Commission to revoke NBC's license in August. He accused NBC and fellow broadcaster ABC, owned by Disney, of being “two of the worst and most biased networks in history.” The parent company of tobacco brand Marlboro and one of the country's largest tobacco firms has pushed for less FDA oversight of e-cigarettes. A subsidiary of the company, Altria Client Services, is a donor to Republican PACs. The popular crypto exchange platform is headed by CEO Brian Armstrong, who has supported Trump's push for looser crypto regulation and dollar‑pegged stablecoins. The data‑analytics company has had a surge in major federal surveillance and border‑security contracts under the Trump administration. The telecommunications giant's merger and licensing agreements were reviewed favorably during Trump's first term. “Trump Mobile,” a Trump Organization-branded cell service, runs on the company's network. The blockchain‑payments network has an interest in Trump's push to position the  U.S. as a digital‑asset finance hub. The Seminole-owned casino and hotel brand's chairman, Jim Allen, once served as a vice president of operations at the Trump Organization. The crypto stablecoin issuer has supported Trump's “digital‑dollar alternative” framework. The freight‑transportation company is hoping to merge with Norfolk Southern under a Republican-led SEC. The U.S. chip manufacturer was celebrated by the White House this year after announcing a $200 billion investment in the country. The defense and cybersecurity contractor said in its second-quarter earnings call that 90% of its $7.2 billion made in bookings in the quarter came from national security work. The computer hardware maker gave $50,000 to Trump's 2025 inaugural committee and has received contracts from the U.S. military and other departments. The top renewable‑energy utility's CEO, John Ketchum, previously said he agrees with the administration's focus on bringing jobs back to America, but has also criticized Trump's efforts to boost the coal industry. The tobacco conglomerate's PAC gave $25,000 to a Trump fundraising committee in 2016. The philanthropic arm of the late Sheldon Adelson, a casino mogul and longtime Republican donor, is now run by his widow, Miriam, who is another big GOP donor and received the Medal of Freedom from Trump during his first term. The industrial metals investor was convicted in the early 2000s of violating U.S. sanctions on Cuba, and a 2023 pardon request to President Biden was denied. The charitable organization funded by the Johnson & Johnson heiress is known for gifts to education, health and civic projects. The couple advocate for financial‑technology deregulation. The siblings and Florida sports tycoons own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and have partial ownership of Manchester United. The Glazers are also recurring donors to Trump PACs. The oil billionaire and Continental Resources founder has been an informal adviser to Trump on energy issues. The Cuban-American Miami healthcare entrepreneur and philanthropist donated over $3 million to Trump's 2024 campaign run and was nominated by Trump in January as U.S. Ambassador to Spain and Andorra. His nomination is pending Senate confirmation. Led by Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the family is a major supporter of Trump's economic agenda and philanthropy. The  Laura  and  Isaac Perlmutter Foundation The former CEO of Marvel Entertainment and his wife are consistent donors to Republican and Israel‑U.S. The Blackstone CEO served as an intermediary between Trump and China amid a trade war during his first term. The Russian‑born American investor is involved in infrastructure and energy holdings. Kelly Loeffler and Jeff Sprecher Loeffler heads the Small Business Administration and is a former U.S. senator from Georgia. Her husband Sprecher is the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange. They donated $5 million to Trump's 2024 election efforts. The founder of 3D Modular Systems and a Florida-based construction‑tech entrepreneur is active in real estate innovation. The cofounder of crypto platform Gemini and early Bitcoin billionaire is a consistent GOP donor lobbying for clear crypto laws. The Gemini cofounder and twin brother of Cameron shares similar cryptocurrency advocacy and technology‑investment roles. Part of the powerful sugar family in Florida and Republican donors, they hosted a second‑term Trump fundraiser at their Palm Beach estate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim suspended all artistic activities following the declaration of martial law in South Korea on December 3, 2024. At the Mojeon Stone Brick Pagoda at Bunhwangsa Temple in Gyeongju, Kim will unveil two 2.5-meter original canvases, the truck installation, and dozens of video and NFT artworks. The canvas works include previously unreleased pieces originally created for an exhibition atop Mount Baekdu one year ago. Each piece is a five-second video composition expressing the harmony of Yin and Yang energies. Importantly, the NFTs do not rely on external URL links; instead, the digital assets are directly uploaded and permanently preserved on-chain through a third-generation Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain node. This fully decentralized blockchain technology — SASEUL PoW Chain, independently developed over seven years by Artifriends Co., Ltd. (CEO Jeongwoo Lee) — has been recognized for its technological integrity through its listing on the BitMart exchange and is preparing for a hard fork. In 2023, Elon Musk emphasized on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast that NFTs depending on off-chain URLs are inherently vulnerable, stating that digital artworks such as JPEGs must be encoded directly onto the blockchain. Reflecting this principle, Kim noted that his entire collection is stored securely and immutably on-chain, to be presented as gifts to APEC nations and shared publicly through social media. Baekdu in North Korea, together with artists from across the world. This peace-themed international exhibition is expected to draw significant attention within the global art community. News about BDKim's planned Mount Baekdu exhibition was previously reported by North Korea–related media outlets, referring to his intention rather than an ongoing project. As the contemporary art world faces stagnation, whether BDKim's artistic universe will illuminate a new path remains to be seen — yet growing global attention is already turning toward his next steps.# # #</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum continues to display choppy price action, remaining confined within a critical range as both buyers and sellers await a decisive breakout. Further consolidation is likely before a clear directional move takes shape. On the daily timeframe, Ethereum's consolidation phase has extended, with volatility and momentum both fading. Price action remains trapped within a crucial range defined by the 100-day moving average and the flag pattern's upper boundary near $4.1K. This region represents a key supply zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts. Until a breakout occurs, Ethereum is expected to continue consolidating within this structure, absorbing order flow and building liquidity. The 4-hour timeframe reveals Ethereum fluctuating inside a symmetrical triangle, reflecting ongoing market indecision and equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The asset is currently trading just below the triangle's upper boundary near $4K, with momentum still insufficient for a confirmed breakout. If bulls manage to push above the upper trendline, a rally toward $4.1K and potentially $4.6K could follow. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would expose the $3.4K demand zone once again. Until confirmation, Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within this narrowing range — a setup that typically precedes a sharp directional breakout. This area corresponds to a significant cluster of resting short liquidations, implying that if Ethereum reclaims the mid-range near $4.1K–$4.3K, a rapid move to absorb this overhead liquidity could follow. This configuration reinforces the idea that Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within its present consolidation range until one of these liquidity pockets is decisively tested.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first meeting took place around April, when CZ became a strategic adviser for Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee. Local media outlet KG24 said Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee must ensure the KGST stablecoin is listed on international platforms and submit proposals for creating a national crypto reserve within two months. Kyrgyzstan's latest moves highlight how crypto adoption is advancing at the nation-state level by experimenting with stablecoins and CBDCs to modernize payments, improve financial inclusion, boost transparency and attract investment. "After successfully piloting all three phases, the platform will be rolled out nationally and scaled," Kyrgyzstan's top bank said. The National Bank initially said in April that it wouldn't make a decision on whether to issue a CBDC until the end of 2026.
