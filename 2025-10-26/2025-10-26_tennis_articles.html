                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belinda Bencic won the Toray Pan Pacific Open on Sunday in Tokyo, defeating 20-year-old Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes for a milestone 10th career title and second of the season. Belinda Bencic entered Sunday's Toray Pan Pacific Open final at a clear disadvantage. Her opponent, 20-year-old Linda Noskova, had spent just 35 minutes on court across the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds in Tokyo, advancing via a retirement and a walkover. Bencic, meanwhile, logged 5 hours and 23 minutes over the previous two days, battling through back-to-back three-set matches. None of that mattered in the final. A former Olympic gold medalist -- also won in Tokyo -- Bencic now climbs to No. ‚ÄúIt was wonderful playing in front of you guys,‚Äù Bencic said after the match. It's also the second time in three years she has won multiple titles in a season to bookend her absence from the WTA Tour. She narrowly defeated Muchova 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 in a three-hour battle that saw her save a match point, then outlasted last year's runner-up Sofia Kenin in 2 hours and 15 minutes to reach the final. Experience pays off: Relatively inexperienced in her first Tokyo final a decade ago, Bencic's experience proved decisive against the younger Noskova. After Noskova fired two big winners to earn the first break point, Bencic responded with a body serve that caught the Czech off guard, forcing her to swat an error into the net. Bencic, battle-tested from earlier rounds, dragged Noskova into a physical contest. Noskova, who hadn't faced pressure since trailing by a set in the second round to McCartney Kessler, struggled to match her opponent's intensity. From there, Bencic held serve with ease and broke Noskova twice to close out the first set in 32 minutes. Once again, Bencic's experience, and Noskova's lack of it, made the difference. Bencic stayed composed, refusing to let the physical and mental toll force her into errors. On the first four break points faced at 2-2, she waited for Noskova to overhit, which she did each time. Bencic then brushed aside the fifth break point of the game with an ace and held for a 3-2 lead. Noskova managed one final hold at 3-3, but Bencic converted a break before serving out the match, sealing victory with a forehand winner. üëèShe beats Noskova 6-2, 6-3 to pick up a 10th career title ü§©@BelindaBencic | #TorayPPO pic.twitter.com/NP0jtfELT0 By the numbers: Her final winner was one of 23 that Bencic hit during the match compared to just 13 unforced errors. Noskova actually tallied more winners, with 28, but was undone by 37 unforced errors, many in key moments. Other than that, the biggest statistical gaps came on each player's first-serve effectiveness and their ability to convert their break opportunities. Noskova created more chances but went 0-for-10 on break points, while Bencic converted 3 of 6. Noskova, while stronger on her second serve, placed just under 63% of her first serves and won fewer than 60% of those points -- well below her season average of 70%. A bright future: While it wasn't the ending Noskova likely envisioned, the 2025 season showed plenty of promise for the 20-year-old in just her third full season on tour. She'll finish the year having just reached her career-high ranking at No. 13 in the world and as the top-ranked Czech player, ahead of Muchova, Marketa Vondrousova and Barbora Krejcikova. Despite getting the better of her Sunday, Bencic sees big things in Noskova's future. ‚ÄúYou are a wonderful player, and for sure you will win many titles,‚Äù Bencic said during the trophy presentation. ‚ÄúIt was an honor to share the court with you. 4 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani defeated No. DOUBLES CHAMPIONS IN TOKYO üèÜTimea Babos/@Luisa__Stefani triumph 6-1, 6-4 over Danilina/Krunic üëè#TorayPPO pic.twitter.com/5ARjfM9e0d For Babos, a four-time Grand Slam champion, it's the 29th WTA doubles title of her career as she continues to inch closer to the big 3-0 mark. Belinda Bencic won the Toray Pan Pacific Open on Sunday in Tokyo, defeating 20-year-old Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes for a milestone 10th career title and second of the season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorenzo Musetti's Vienna run ended in the semi-finals on Saturday against Alexander Zverev, but the Italian's showing still leaves him in a strong position to qualify for his Nitto ATP Finals debut. Musetti increased his lead in eighth place in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin to 440 points ahead of Felix Auger-Aliassime and could seal his place in the season finale with a strong week at the Rolex Paris Masters. With Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Zverev and Novak Djokovic already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, four spots are still up for grabs in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Alex de Minaur and Musetti currently occupy those positions, with Auger-Aliassime, Casper Ruud and Daniil Medvedev leading the chasing pack. Musetti is bidding to join defending champion Sinner on home soil in Turin. In addition to the personal history of his Nitto ATP Finals debut, Musetti would also make Italian history if he can qualify: Never before have two Italian singles players qualified for the season finale in the same year. In 2021, Matteo Berrettini qualified, then withdrew after one match due to an injury. In Paris, Musetti will open his campaign against countryman Lorenzo Sonego or a qualifier. Shelton, also seeking his Turin debut, will face Flavio Cobolli or Tomas Machac in his opening match, with Andrey Rublev a potential third-round opponent. If both qualify, it would mark the first time two Americans qualify for the year-end event since Andy Roddick and James Blake both competed in 2006. Like Musetti, the Aussie bolstered his position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin with a semi-final showing this week. Fritz and De Minaur could meet in a pivotal quarter-final in the top half of the draw, with both players pushing for qualification. With 1,000 PIF ATP Ranking points on offer in Paris, Auger-Aliassime and Ruud could both move into the top eight with the title. Medvedev, the 2020 champion at the season finale, would need further points in Athens or Metz to find a way into the top eight and extend his streak of consecutive Nitto ATP Finals to seven. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, currently on 2,585 points, could pass Medvedev for 12th by beating Joao Fonseca in Sunday's Basel final.
