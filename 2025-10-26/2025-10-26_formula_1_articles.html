                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a tough Qualifying for Oscar Piastri at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver ending the session in P8 – nearly eight-tenths adrift of polesitter team mate Lando Norris. Oscar Piastri was left to reflect on a “frustrating” Qualifying at the Mexico City Grand Prix after ending the session in P8, with the Australian admitting that it was “not the lap time that I'm expecting”. Having been unable to match the pace of McLaren team mate Lando Norris in the second and third practice sessions – with Norris sitting out FP1 while rookie Pato O'Ward took the wheel – Piastri again seemed some distance away during Qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Norris ultimately sealed pole position in Q3, but Piastri was nearly eight-tenths adrift of the Briton back in P8, though he will be promoted to P7 on the grid for Sunday's race due to the Williams of Carlos Sainz ahead of him taking a five-place penalty. Looking back on how the session unfolded, Piastri explained: “It was tough. It felt like some of my laps when it counted were not bad, but just not the lap time that I'm expecting obviously. There appeared to be a potential concern over the power unit in Piastri's MCL39 during Q2 when the championship leader radioed in that “something weird happened” in Turn 5. When asked about this afterwards – as well as being quizzed on what specifically he is missing at the moment given his tricky weekend so far – the 24-year-old responded: “The PU was fine, I think – just a small under-delivery in one of the corners on the lap, but nothing major that continued. “Try and have a good start, and then see what I can do,” the McLaren driver – whose championship lead over Norris stands at just 14 points – stated. “It's a long run to Turn 1, so there's  opportunities there and I'll try and take them.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kimi Antonelli will start Sunday's race from sixth with Mercedes team mate George Russell set to line up fourth. Kimi Antonelli believes "there was a little bit more" potential to come from Mercedes in Qualifying for the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the young Italian set to start sixth. Antonelli had shown encouraging pace on Friday during practice, finishing the two sessions in second and third respectively, but come Saturday's Qualifying session, the 20-year-old dropped back in the pecking order, finishing more than half a second behind poleman Lando Norris. "I think there was a little bit more," said Antonelli when asked if he had extracted everything from the car. And then Q3 was a cleaner session but I just didn't do a good enough job at the start of the session and it put me in more of an unfavourable position. "The start is going to be very important and hopefully from there we can gain a few places and fight for the front." Team mate George Russell will start in front of Antonelli having qualified fourth, with reigning World Champion Max Verstappen splitting the Mercedes pair. "The order is a little bit surprising. Ordinarily if we were behind two Ferraris we'd probably be lining up P5 or P6 on the grid," he said. "P4 I think was a decent result and I think those three were out of reach but it was so close between me and I think Oscar [Piastri] was only one-tenth behind me and he was in P8, so glad to be on the right side of it. I don't want to be negative but I think Turn 1, Lap 1 is going to be very important but there's still always chances.</p>
