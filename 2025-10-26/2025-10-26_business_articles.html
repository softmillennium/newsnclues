                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett said Sunday he, too, has "felt pain" from China refusing to buy U.S.-grown soybeans during a trade conflict with President Donald Trump because "I'm actually a soybean farmer." Bessent's comment came during an interview with ABC News' "This Week," where he said that trade negotiations with China in the past two days had led to a "substantial framework" that he believed would alleviate American soybean farmers' concerns about the boycott. Trump is set to meet later this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Bessent, a former hedge fund executive whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be around $600 million, was asked about the soybean boycotts on "This Week" host Martha Raddatz, who noted that "American farmers have really suffered." But after Trump ignited a trade war with Beijing earlier this year, China stopped buying soybeans. "Do you see a real light at the end of the tunnel there, they may allow soybeans again?" Bessent replied, "Martha, in case you don't know it, I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain, too." Bessent's government financial disclosure shows that he owns soybean and corn farmland in North Dakota that has an estimated worth of between $5 million and $25 million. On that disclosure, Bessent said the farmland generates between $100,000 and $1 million in rental income for him annually. The Treasury secretary told Raddatz on Sunday, "I think think we have addressed the farmer's concerns, and I'm not going to get ahead of the president, but I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public, that our soybean farmers will feel very good about what's going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years."

With only two points separating Spain's football giants after nine games in La Liga, the first El Clásico of the season gives both a chance to assert their dominance. To help you see who comes out on top, we've compiled this guide on where to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, no matter where you are this weekend. Thankfully for any soccer fan who hates to see one team in a country dominate, you never quite know what way the topsy-turvy Real Madrid vs. Barcelona rivalry will turn next. But it's Xabi Alonso's side who have started fastest this time around, with talismanic striker Kylian Mbappé already notching up 10 league goals. And now it seems even Jude Bellingham has got his mojo back, with his lone goal inspiring Los Blancos to a win over Juventus in the Champions League during the week. It may still be early in the season, but Hansi Flick will know that a win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to leapfrog Real will be a massive psychological boost to Robert Lewandowski, Ferran Torres, and co. To see if the champions can pull it off, follow the information below to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona live streams in the US, UK, Spain, or anywhere else you happen to be in the world this Sunday. Keen watchers of La Liga in the US have options when it comes to where to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona on Sunday, with ESPN2 the main linear channel carrying El Clásico. If you don't already have access to ESPN channels, then a subscription to the ESPN streaming service is an affordable choice. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year. If sports are your thing, then you could also consider going for a more comprehensive ESPN Unlimited plan instead. From $30 a month, it includes everything that the various ESPN channels have to offer, so that means action from the NFL, NBA, and WWE in addition to Spain's best soccer. DirecTV MySports also offers an array of premium sports channels. The month-to-month provider offers CNN, FS1/FS2, NBA TV, NFL Network, Golf Channel, and TNT alongside ESPN Unlimited, all for $70 a month, with a $10 discount off your first two months. MySports comes with a five-day free trial for first-time customers. Fubo Sports is another sports-focused cable replacement product featuring ESPN Unlimited alongside 29 channels. Try before you buy with its 5-day free trial. The new Fubo Sports + News pack is only available in select areas. Premier Sports has the exclusive rights to show 2025/26 La Liga matches — including this Real Madrid vs. Barcelona encounter — in the UK on TV and online. It will air on the network's Premier Sports 1 channel. If you already have a pay-TV plan from any of the following providers, you can choose to add Premier Sports through those: Sky TV, Virgin Media, and Amazon Prime Video. Firstly there's Movistar's La Liga plan that costs €35 a month and includes live action from the country's top two tiers. While certain DAZN plans will also give you access to El Clasico. Considering the size and status of La Liga and its big two teams, Spanish football is now shown in many countries worldwide. But you may find yourself in a country this weekend that doesn't broadcast it. Or perhaps you already pay for a subscription service that would normally show Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, but it's blocked because you've traveled overseas. Both are frustrating scenarios that can be alleviated by using a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs allow you to spoof your IP address so that your smartphone, laptop, or other streaming device thinks it's in another country altogether. They're really secure, too, thanks to their military-grade encrypted tunnels. NordVPN is so secure and easy to use that it's easy to recommend for streaming soccer and anything else.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he had a positive meeting on Sunday with U.S. President Donald Trump, and their respective teams will start "immediately" to discuss tariffs and other matters. Trump and Lula spoke on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in a meeting to overcome tensions between Brazil and the United States after Trump increased tariffs on U.S. imports of most Brazilian goods to 50% from 10% in August. "We agreed that our teams will meet immediately to advance the search for solutions to the tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian authorities," Lula said in a social media post following the meeting. Trump had linked the tariff move to what he called a "witch hunt" against Jair Bolsonaro, the South American country's former president. The U.S. government also put sanctions on a number of Brazilian officials, including Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the trial that led to Bolsonaro's conviction for attempting a coup. Ahead of the meeting on Sunday, though, Trump said he could reach some agreements with Lula. "I think we should be able to make some pretty good deals for both countries," Trump said. Lula previously described the tariff hike as a "mistake," citing a $410 billion U.S. trade surplus with Brazil over 15 years. Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said negotiations will start immediately to work on solutions and a meeting with the U.S. delegation was planned for Sunday. "We will establish a negotiation schedule and establish the sectors we will talk about so that we can move forward," Vieira told journalists at the summit, adding that Brazil had requested that tariffs be suspended during the negotiation process. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were present at the meeting, Vieira said. "We hope to conclude bilateral negotiations that address each of the sectors of the current American (tariffs on) Brazil in the near future, in a few weeks," Vieira added. Bolsonaro was not mentioned in the meeting, said Marcio Rosa, the executive secretary for Brazil's ministry of development, industry and commerce, who stood next to Vieira. Higher U.S. tariffs on Brazilian goods have begun reshaping the global beef trade, pushing up prices in the United States and encouraging triangulation via third countries such as Mexico, while Brazilian exports to its biggest beef market, China, are booming. Brazilian beef industry group Abiec said it viewed the meeting between the two leaders as a positive step. "The recent meetings between the presidents of the United States and Brazil have been more positive, and at ABIC we are optimistic," ABIC president Pavel Cardoso said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines started pouring customers Champagne Bollinger in its top-tier lounges and cabins this fall. But at headquarters, it's not time to celebrate — yet. American has fallen behind large rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in the post-Covid luxury travel boom that has taken Seoul spa vacations and 40th birthday bashes abroad out of the chat and armed millions of consumers with high-end rewards credit cards. That means that American, which offers more flights than any other airline, according to OAG, accounted for just 2% of the profit the biggest three U.S. carriers generated so far in 2025. Power's North American airline customer satisfaction ranking this year. The carrier has also been working to undo damage from a failed business-travel sales strategy. To make that happen, CEO Robert Isom will have to rally American's more than 130,000 employees around the airline's plans and win over both customers and investors. American's stock is down 20% this year through Friday's close, compared with modest gains posted by Delta and United. Last week, however, some investors noticed a change within American, whose fourth-quarter profit forecast surpassed Wall Street analysts' expectations. Shares rose more than 16%, their biggest weekly percentage gain in almost a year. The bigger changes are going to take time and money. "I believe there is the beginning of a meaningful turnaround … but a large airline like American is not going to be turned around overnight." American has tasked Heather Garboden — who has worked for more than two decades at American and US Airways, including roles in the cargo and finance departments, and now is chief customer officer — with leading a lot of a nose-to-tail revamp of the nearly century-old airline. "Fifteen years ago, I don't think in the industry, there was much of a belief that customer experience … really drove a differentiation between airlines. At Delta, the most profitable U.S. airline, its executives were early to notice how customers were paying up for pricier first-class seats, precious real estate it and other airlines used to give away to frequent flyers as free upgrades. Now, offering buy-ups is more common among all three, and American is looking for more ways to sell those seats and to make sure its planes have enough of them to offer. One challenge for American has been that it was last of the big three airlines to complete a mega merger in 2013 when it combined with US Airways, while Delta and United had years-long head starts to get through their integrations and improve their products. Garboden spent much of her career in the finance departments and said it's tough to provide that team with the return-on-investment of something like Champagne but that it's still important. It's not just having the best lounge," she said. Including new aircraft, American expects its capital spending to total $3.8 billion this year, and rise to about $4.5 billion next year, the carrier said Thursday. It said it has nearly $37 billion in total debt, and plans to cut that down by about at least $2 billion before 2028. One example of how things have changed: American's management team nearly a decade ago decided to remove seat-back screens from its aircraft, saving money on the equipment (and the fuel-sucking weight they add to the plane) because at the time they said customers would likely use their own mobile phones, tablets or laptop to watch entertainment. United, some of whose senior leadership team, including its chief executive, Scott Kirby, came from American, has done the opposite and is in the process of adding thousands of screens to narrow-body planes both new and old, including Bluetooth technology for wireless headphones. "I think of where the technology was a decade ago, and where it can be today, or even a few years from today," Garboden said. American is working to make its website and app better, with features like a way to toggle between paying for tickets with cash or miles, Garboden said, among other revamps that executives hope will drive sales — and paid upgrades. Another goal: using artificial intelligence and allowing customers to search for vacation themes, such as "best wine tasting in spring" instead of searching for flights between cities, she said. American is also in the middle of a push to refresh many of its longer-haul premium cabins and announced on Thursday that it will refurbish its Boeing 777-200 aircraft with a new business class, adding to an upgrade, first unveiled three years ago, of its larger Boeing 777-300 jets. "That is a big deal for us because extending the lives of those and putting those into service really gives us a capital spending holiday in terms of fleet replacement," Isom said in an earnings call with analysts on Thursday. Those plans are made years in advance, and high demand, supply chain problems and long certification wait times have delayed plusher cabins, exasperating airline executives. On Thursday, American's first Airbus A321 XLR, a long-range narrow-body plane it plans to fly across the country and, eventually to Europe, touched down at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. The new suites that feature sliding doors, larger screens and a palette of dark browns, navy blue and tan, started flying this year on some of American's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, subset P, for "premium." American's updates even have it rethinking beverages throughout the plane. The airline signed a coffee provider deal with Italy's Lavazza recently, and to test out the brews, it brought airplane water to its headquarters in Fort Worth so staff could evaluate what it would taste like brewed on board. The airline on Thursday named Nat Pieper as is chief commercial officer, a nearly three-decade airline veteran who's worked at Alaska Airlines and Delta and who Isom described as "exactly the kind of leader we want at American." American fired its former CCO, Vasu Raja, last year after his business-travel strategy backfired and sparked outrage from travel agencies. "Exiting this year, we expect to have fully recovered the revenue share that was lost by our prior sales and distribution strategy," Isom said Thursday. It was the first to launch a frequent flyer program, AAdvantage. Loyalty programs, which in large part make money from selling frequent flyer miles to banks, have now become the lifeblood of many airlines. The airline this year announced new measures to improve reliability. One change: five additional minutes of boarding time. A federal judge in 2023 blocked American's regional tie-up with JetBlue Airways, leaving it without a partner in key, wealthy markets like Boston and New York, where United and Delta had made inroads. United this year scooped up a partnership with JetBlue that allows customers to earn and burn miles on each others airline, but stops short of coordinating schedules or routes. It took effect on Thursday, as American was reporting its third-quarter results. American dominates its fortress hubs in Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina, profitable operations, though it has fallen behind in the Northeast. United and Delta executives have credited some of their success to having lots of flights in big coastal hubs with affluent travelers, though United has also built up flying in key markets like Denver, Houston and Chicago. While American has been reluctant to make big investments, United's CEO Kirby earlier this month told investors that the airline is plowing more than $1 billion a year into improving customer experience. United recently started flying planes with free Wi-Fi provided by SpaceX's Starlink, following Delta and JetBlue in making the service complimentary. American plans to roll out complimentary Wi-Fi next year for most of its fleet. "We have built up a generational lead on this front," United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview, adding that new products are coming in the next few years. "We think it's substantial, and I don't want to give an inch of that ground up, no matter what our competitors do to innovate over the next decade." Some customers, however, continue to value the convenience American offers them, and have remained loyal. Todd Bryan, 41, who has Executive Platinum status on American, said he chooses the carrier in large part because it has the most frequencies out of where he lives, in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The 41-year-old sales account manager who works in the consumer packaged goods industry, said he gets upgraded on most of his flights, but he has noticed that American has been more aggressive about offering buy-ups with cash or miles. Even though he's usually at the top of the list, he now considers taking the offer instead of gambling on a free upgrade on personal trips if "it feels cheap enough that I assume someone else would buy it too."

The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I just didn't want to be anywhere else. So we moved after only two and a half years in California. I thought I wouldn't be moving again, but in 2024, my husband got a really good job opportunity in Montreal. He's an agronomist who works in indoor agriculture. He had the opportunity to help start up a greenhouse division for a national company there, which was right up his alley. As you can imagine, there's not a lot of agriculture in New York City. I'm a freelance marketer and can work from anywhere, but for my husband, it really was the perfect job at the perfect time. The thought of leaving New York was really hard. I mean, all my friends and family are there. And even though Canada isn't geographically far from New York, it's still a different environment — especially Quebec, which is a French-speaking province. "Oh God, this is going to happen again," kept running through my mind. This, plus the overwhelming feeling of how much we'd have to learn about Quebec, led me to hire a relocation coach. She's a digital nomad who's lived all over the world, and she helped me a lot — not so much with the logistics of moving, but more with realizing that the things that were important to me in New York would still be important to me in Canada, and that there are ways to incorporate them into my new life. We visited Quebec a few times before our move to scout out neighborhoods and schools. It was important for me to visit during the winter because it's very cold and snowy here, which I wasn't used to living in New York City. Unlike in New York, where you can find a rental at any time of year, in Montreal, many leases start on July 1 and run through the end of June the following year. We're right near a metro station and can walk to downtown Montreal from our apartment. In Brooklyn, we lived in a duplex with a backyard, which is pretty rare there — we got really lucky during COVID-19, when everyone was leaving the city. We paid about $3,500 there; here I'm paying roughly $1,000 less. While we've lost our outdoor space, we gained a washer and dryer, a luxury I never had in 20 years of living in Brooklyn. Quebec's primary language is French, so navigating the region's bureaucracy and school system has been challenging. We needed specific paperwork to qualify for the English system. My son now attends an English school with a French immersion curriculum. Making friends here hasn't been easy, either. Because I work for a New York-based company, I've really had to put myself out there to meet people. Most of my community has come from meeting other parents through my kid's school organizations and connecting with our neighbors. The biggest challenge we've faced has been setting up our finances. Even basic things like getting a credit card or opening a bank account took about six to eight weeks to sort out. The cost of living here is pretty comparable to New York. I have been living with celiac disease for over 40 years. I've never lived in a place with socialized healthcare, so there has been a huge learning curve in finding doctors and handling prescriptions. I have to use Google Translate for everything. We no longer pay out of pocket for coverage, which is a big change — in New York, health insurance for a family of three costs almost as much as rent. Since moving here, I've had to see a few specialists for checkups, and the service has been covered. Sometimes, I still find myself waiting for a bill to show up, and it never does. Something else that surprised me about the medical system here is that you can actually make an appointment with a pharmacist, and they can prescribe medication if you have proper test results. Life feels calmer — the city is beautiful, cleaner, and safer. People here are so much nicer; they have this polite, laid-back attitude. Our Canadian visas last for three years, but we hope to extend them. But now, especially with our child in school, I don't want to disrupt that. I also don't know if we could afford to go back. I'll always see myself as a New Yorker first and an American second; that's my identity through and through.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top Chinese and U.S. economic officials on Sunday hashed out the framework of a trade deal for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize that would pause steeper American tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls and resume U.S. soybean sales to China, U.S. officials said. Bessent said he expects China to delay implementation of its rare earth minerals and magnets licensing regime by a year while the policy is reconsidered. Trump and Xi are due to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, to sign off on the terms. "I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday," Bessent told reporters after he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang for a fifth round of in-person discussions since May. Bessent said he anticipates that a tariff truce with China will be extended beyond its November 10 expiration date, and that China will revive substantial purchases of U.S. soybeans after buying none in September in favor of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. U.S. soybean farmers "will feel very good about what's going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years" once the deal's terms are announced, Bessent told the ABC program "This Week." Greer told the "Fox News Sunday" program that both sides agreed to pause some punitive actions and found "a path forward where we can have more access to rare earths from China, we can try to balance out our trade deficit with sales from the United States." China's Li Chenggang said the two sides reached a "preliminary consensus" and will next go through their respective internal approval processes. "The U.S. position has been tough," Li said. "We have experienced very intense consultations and engaged in constructive exchanges in exploring solutions and arrangements to address these concerns." Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, his first stop in a five-day Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a face-to-face with Xi in South Korea on Thursday. After the talks, Trump struck an optimistic tone, saying: "I think we're going to have a deal with China." Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs, starting on Nov. 1, in retaliation for China's expanded export controls on rare-earth magnets and minerals. China and the United States rolled back most of their triple-digit tariffs on each other's goods under a trade truce due to expire on Nov. 10. The U.S. and Chinese officials said that in addition to rare earths, they discussed trade expansion, the U.S. fentanyl crisis, U.S. port entrance fees and the transfer of TikTok to U.S. ownership control. We're going to meet them later in China, and we're going to meet in the U.S., in either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago," Trump said. Among Trump's talking points with Xi are Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, concerns around democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai. Trump also said that he will seek China's help in U.S. dealings with Moscow, as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on. Tensions between the world's two largest economies flared in the past few weeks as a delicate trade truce, reached after a first round of trade talks in Geneva in May and extended in August, failed to prevent the United States and China from hitting each other with more sanctions, export curbs and threats of stronger retaliatory measures. China's expanded controls on rare earths exports have caused a global shortage. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite those challenges, investors can also choose to focus on stocks of companies that can navigate short-term pressures to deliver strong, long-term returns. Tracking top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick some attractive stocks, as the recommendations of these experts are based on in-depth analysis of a company's business fundamentals, opportunities and challenges. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This first stock pick is social media company Pinterest (PINS), scheduled to announce third-quarter results on November 4. Heading into those numbers, TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge reiterated a buy rating on Pinterest and a $44 price target. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Pinterest, giving it an "outperform" rating and a price target of $40. "We expect EBITDA growth of 20% y/y, outpacing rev growth, driven by modest [cost of revenue] and R&D leverage," said Blackledge. The 5-star analyst remains confident about his mid-teens, year-over-year revenue growth estimate through the second half of 2025 and 2026, partly supported by continued adoption by advertisers of PINS' Performance+ campaign tools. Following a digital ad check call with an agency that runs more than $4 billion annually in managed advertising spending, Blackledge noted that ad spend on Pinterest rose 63% year-over-year in Q3 2025, a slight slowdown compared to 66% in the prior quarter. A TD Cowen expert noted that solid uptake continues in PINS' Performance+ campaign types. In fact, some advertisers have shifted all their Pinterest spending to Performance+. 522 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a buy rating on UBER along with a 12-month price forecast of $150 after hosting a quarterly webinar with Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy and The Driverless Digest Dude, where they discussed the latest trends across rideshare, delivery and autonomous vehicle (AV) ecosystems. Like Mahaney, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on UBER stock, with an "outperform" rating and a price target of $108. Campbell was constructive about rideshare supply dynamics, given solid and stable driver economics, Mahaney noted. Campbell continues to see consistent demand and strong driver supply, particularly at Uber, which he described as operating near "all-time highs." Despite robust supply, pricing continues to be high, reflecting sustained demand elasticity and limited alternatives for consumers, particularly for airport and nightlife rides. The top-rated analyst also highlighted Campbell's commentary about early-stage shifts in AV partnerships — particularly Alphabet's Waymo's evolving first-party vs third-party strategy and Uber's expanding AV integration roadmap. Mahaney further noted stable driver economics and widening platform margins. Notably, Uber's "decoupling" of rider fares and driver payouts is driving incremental profit margin expansion, even with steady driver income. Through incremental feature innovation, Uber is focused on enhancing ecosystem "stickiness." While not transformative, Mahaney said Campbell sees these efforts as part of Uber's "broader push to create alternative income channels for drivers as AVs grow share over time." General Motors (GM) jumped 15% on Tuesday after the Cadillac and Buick parent beat the Street's revenue and earnings expectations despite a slight decline in sales. GM also raised its forward guidance, citing a lower-than-expected tariff impact. Following the Q3 results, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on GM and raised his price target to $76 from $67. By comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $66 and an "outperform" rating on GM. "We remain positive with reduced tariff burden/risk, improved profitability and [internal combustion engine] SUV/pickup onshoring tailwinds through C26E+," said Rakesh. The 5-star analyst noted that GM raised its 2025 guidance for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted free cash flow, driven by a smaller-than-expected impact from  tariffs, and said GM is rolling back some of its electric vehicle (EV) plans to boost profitability. That involves GM's sale of its Michigan EV battery plant stake to LG Energy, while keeping two battery plants, and transitioning its Orion plant to gas engine production from an EV focus by 2027. Rakesh believes that smaller EV losses, tariff challenges and warranty costs, and a higher combustion engine mix, will support GM's target to return to 8% to 10% EBIT margin in the North America business. Other tailwinds include $5 billion in deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise models, with about 70% gross margins, combined with a stable average selling prices.

My husband and I live in a four-bedroom, two-bath house with our three young adult children — ages 18 to 22 — and two of their significant others. This type of living arrangement has pros and cons. The sink and trash cans are full every time you turn around, but there are also additional helping hands. Our driveway looks like a used car lot, but there is no shortage of people who can grab a gallon of milk on their way home. In many ways, it's like living in a hostel where people come and go at all hours of the day and night. To be clear, this was never part of the grand life plan. But with the cost of living being what it is, my husband and I faced a choice: let our oldest son move out and live in his car with his girlfriend (which was their plan), or let them move in with us while they save for their own place. For me, sunshine and movement are essential. Daily walks are nonnegotiable as they reconnect me with nature and remind me that the world is bigger than my overflowing house. I find sanctuary in outdoor chores or carrying my laptop to the porch. I have my smartwatch remind me if I haven't stepped away from my computer in the last hour. When I get that buzz, I don't just cycle the laundry — I step outside to water the plants, check the mail, or go for a walk. Anything I can do to catch some extra sunshine is a good thing. This includes weekly date nights that don't bust the budget. We may share a homemade meal or lock ourselves away to watch a show together, and during these times, we consider ourselves "off-duty." It's just about disconnecting from the demands of the people living in our house and reconnecting with each other. And, yes, sometimes life happens and we get interrupted by perceived emergencies, but we are more able to roll with the punches when we know another break is within reach. For six blissful days, we left our laptops at home, only checked our phones once each morning, and were otherwise completely off duty. These breaks are not about ignoring family; they're about protecting the partnership that will outlast our current living situation. Eventually, something small, like a half-drank water bottle that was abandoned in the living room (again! So I've learned to vent before that happens. Each session starts with a mutually agreed-upon question: Do you need advice, or are you just venting? Having someone to listen releases the steam that is building inside me and allows me to breathe without the person listening feeling like they need to "fix" something. What all of these rituals have in common is that I intentionally integrate them into everyday life. I don't hide that these things are requirements for my sanity. I say, "I can't do that until after my walk," or "I would love to do that with you, but tonight is my off-duty night. As a bonus, the consistent modeling of self-care encourages others to self-reflect on their own self-care needs. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After raising $1.75 million in the pre-seed round for my startup last year, I quit my job and moved from Australia to San Francisco to go all in as a solo founder. It can get lonely and difficult at times, but living with a built-in support system of other founders helps. We all uprooted our lives, left behind our loved ones, and moved here to build startups, so we think of each other like family. Now I'm living in a hacker house, where our dining table is covered in laptops and monitors instead of flowers — and it's one of the best decisions I've made. After raising the pre-seed funding for Build Club, an AI learning hub aimed at democratizing access to AI education, I now have a team of five who work around the world, but I live in San Francisco. It's the beating pulse of AI, and there are so many insanely ambitious and talented people to be surrounded by. You can literally walk into a coffee shop and end up in a two-hour deep dive conversation about AI agents or someone's YC application. Everyone's dreaming big, and you can feel that optimism in the air. What surprised me most about San Francisco was how generous people are with their time. Plus, I think Australia has better healthcare and is just more chill. During a visit to San Francisco before I moved, I met the person who ran Mission Control, one of San Francisco's oldest hacker houses, and she told me they had empty rooms available. I later moved there for my first few months in San Francisco. I met three other founders there, and we decided to move into a more intimate place. We named our hacker house "The Stables" because it's our place of stability in San Francisco and because it's a breeding ground for unicorns. As a solo founder, I don't have a cofounder to tell everything to, so living with other founders has been really important. I've probably leaned on my housemates too many times, whether for emotional support or even to share an employee. The day before one of our launches, we stayed up late, and one of my roommates bought us food to celebrate. We also cook for each other when possible or go out to dinner together. Every Sunday, we even go on a hike together to step away from work and touch some grass, which is always a highlight of my week. Our shared spaces definitely get messy, especially during busy periods, but we like to clean together. There's also less privacy and quiet than if I lived alone, but it's just nice to have people around. When I look at founders on social media, they often only show the highlights, but living with other founders has been very humanizing and comforting. For example, you might see online that a founder raised a successful pre-seed round, but in reality, they're crying on the couch of the hacker house because an employee they really wanted said no. I usually wake up at 6:30 a.m. and spend my mornings doing deep work. When I return home in the evening, I usually have more calls with team members who come online even later. Then, my roommates and I might cook together or go for a walk around the park to de-stress. Most nights, we end by lighting candles in the living room, playing deep house music, and coworking until 12 or 1 a.m. Most people in San Francisco are very tech-obsessed, so I don't like to spend more than two months here at a time.

It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Suspects have been arrested over the brazen jewelry heist at the Louvre, just as one of them was about to fly out of France, the Paris prosecutor said on Sunday. Two men in their 30s and originally from the capital's Seine-Saint-Denis suburb - which includes some of the country's most deprived areas - were detained on Saturday evening, according to Le Parisien newspaper, which first broke the story. They were known to French police and one of the suspects was about to fly to Algeria from Charles de Gaulle airport, the newspaper said. There was no indication on Sunday that any of France's stolen crown jewels had been recovered. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not say how many people were arrested or give any more details about them. In a statement, she deplored the fact that information about their arrest was leaked. It is too early to provide any specific details," Beccuau said. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, under public pressure to deliver results a week to the day after the robbery, congratulated investigators in a tweet, but gave no more details. Four hooded thieves made off with eight precious pieces worth an estimated $102 million from the Louvre's collection on October 19, exposing security lapses at the world's most-visited museum. They broke in using a crane to smash an upstairs window during opening hours and escaped on motorbikes. News of the robbery reverberated around the world, prompting soul-searching in France over what some regarded as a national humiliation. The thieves apparently dropped the piece, made of gold, emeralds and diamonds, as they made their getaway. It was turned into a museum for the royal art collection in 1793, four years after the French Revolution. Its vast collection of masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo, attracted 8.7 million visitors last year. We want to hear from you.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even in a densely-packed city like San Francisco, I couldn't imagine getting around without it. I also think about the painful amount of money I've spent due to a cracked wheel from a pothole, flattened tires from a perfectly placed nail, or the driver who sideswiped me after they blew a red light. That was all within the past year. ALSO, a startup that began as a skunkworks inside Rivian is trying really hard to replace our large vehicles — at least for some trips. It's not an either-or proposition," Ben Steele, ALSO's chief commercial officer, told me. We want to reframe that for you.'" I met the executives of ALSO on a Saturday afternoon at their office in Palo Alto, just across the street from Rivian's office, where they gave me a chance to try the product: a $4,500 e-bike. ALSO is calling it the T-MB for "Transcendent Mobility Bike." Chris Yu, the president of the startup, told me that the "genesis" behind ALSO was simple: "Why doesn't that magical experience you get out of a Rivian exist in anything smaller than a car?" Yu has an extensive background in biking. He told me he raced competitively in college and continued to do so throughout his years at Specialized Bicycle Components, a bike manufacturer, where he spent more than 10 years and led the company as the chief product and technology officer. Yu's not doing much racing these days, but he still bikes often with his son. "Every other bike that we've used when we hit potholes and the speed bump in his school parking lot, he'd always get bounced around, and he always just thought that was the norm," Yu said. Yu said that the TM-B was designed with a one-bike-fits-all approach. He said that one of the first pain points for consumers is deciding which type of e-bike to buy in the first place. "We wanted to build in as much breadth of personality, utility, and capability into one platform as much as possible to remove that kind of initial friction and pain point," Yu said. Instead, the pedals are attached to a generator, which provides the power to move you forward. That also means there's no gear shifting in the traditional sense. I found that this propulsion system made going up a hill seamless. The bike didn't require much more pedaling effort when I went up a hill. A standard battery pack delivers up to 60 miles of range. The large battery pack provides up to 100 miles of range. Riders can also use the battery as a portable charger for their electronic devices. It's a "software-defined" bike, Yu said, which allows for over-the-air updates and an easy user experience straight out of the box. At around 70 pounds, the TM-B is not a traditional bike that a rider would lug up several floors of their apartment building. Yu said the company envisions riders treating the bike more like a car that you could feel comfortable leaving inside a parking structure. Kelly Veit, VP of software, said the bike is equipped with Wi-Fi, LTE, and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) connectivity for location tracking purposes and anti-theft protection. If the bike is stolen, the owner can track its location and "brick" it, making it essentially unrideable. ALSO executives showed me three attachments: one for the solo rider, one that allows for up to 75 pounds of payload, including a small child or groceries, and a "bench" for more comfortable riding. All the modular seat attachments are equipped with lights on the back that also serve as turn signals. The throttle on the TM-B is set to a maximum speed of 20 mph, as per federal regulations for e-bikes, allowing the bike to reach that speed without pedaling. Saul Leiken, director of product line, said the bike was designed to accelerate "basically as fast as a car can coming off of a stop sign." "I'm not talking a zero to 60 type of thing," he said, "but if you're running a little late to work, that allows you to ride with traffic instead of being in traffic's way." Yu said the throttle is helpful to quickly move out of intersections. Due to its fewer moving parts, Yu said the frequency of servicing the T-MB should be much lower than that of traditional bikes. The president said ALSO is working on several ways for riders to bring in their bikes: a "small brick-and-mortar footprint across the country," a mobile service fleet, and a network of authorized service providers. Additionally, ALSO can notify users via telemetry if there is an issue with the bike, he said.</p>
