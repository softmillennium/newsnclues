Editor's note: This article was updated after officials reported that a second incident occurred the following night on Oct. 25-26.

Lithuania has closed its last two operational border crossings with Belarus and the country's largest airport after another incident involving balloons launched from Belarusian territory, officials announced on Oct. 25. 

Air traffic at Vilnius Airport was halted until 2 a.m. local time amid the reported balloons, with officials announcing that the border will remain closed until the same time.

The incident marks the second occurred within 24 hours that the country has shuttered flight operations and closed border crossings, after Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene announced an initial incident involving balloons on Oct. 24. 

Ruginiene said that a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania, prompting the temporary suspension of operations at Vilnius and Kaunas airports.

The move comes after a series of airspace violations involving balloons carrying contraband cigarettes. On Oct. 5 and 21, Lithuanian authorities were forced to close the airspace above Vilnius, leading to the cancellation of dozens of flights.

"The State Border Guard Service has closed the Salcininkai and Medininkai border crossing points until noon tomorrow," Ruginiene wrote on Facebook following the Oct. 24 incident, citing national security concerns.

"The services are acting in accordance with the decisions taken at this week's National Security Commission meeting. Next week, the commission will meet again to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken and determine what else can be done," she said.

The latest incident marks the fourth such violation in a month.

Belarus, ruled by dictator Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, remains one of Moscow's closest allies and has provided Russia with political, economic, and military support during its full-scale war in Ukraine. 

Lithuania shares a 680-kilometer (420-mile) border with the country.

The closure follows a surge in suspicious aerial incidents across Europe, fueling fears of hybrid operations linked to Russia. In early October, Munich International Airport faced two consecutive disruptions over suspected drone activity. 

Similar incidents briefly grounded flights in Oslo and Copenhagen, while in September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that violated its airspace. Days later, Romania reported that a Russian drone had crossed its border but chose not to engage.

"It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses," Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed.

While Ukraine also lacks Western-supplied weapons, soldiers and commanders say shortages of basics — cars, drones and people — make holding back Russia extremely difficult. Even as Kyiv seeks U.S. approval for Tomahawks, they say critical, rudimentary gear is the more pressing need.

Russia faces an increase in the arson and “spontaneous combustion” of electrical panels, railway relay cabinets, and other infrastructure helping Moscow wage its war against Ukraine over the past week, a source at Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. 

The episode covers Russian war crimes in Pokrovsk and continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, including missile strikes on Kyiv and Kharkiv. While Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire with Ukraine, has President Trump finally shifted his approach to Russia?

Ukrainian forces liberated two villages in eastern Donetsk Oblast about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of embattled Pokrovsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Oct. 26. 

Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Oct. 26, killing at least three people, and injuring at least 32 others, including seven children.

At least nine civilians were killed and 44 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional authorities reported on Oct. 26.

Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania.

"I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing," U.S. President Donald Trump said.


"I think it's very important we have dialogue because President Trump already has done a lot to solve lots of the world conflicts,” Kirill Dmitriev told Fox News on Oct. 25. 







The plant is Russia's fourth-largest oil refinery and processed 13.1 million tons of oil last year, according to Russian estimates.

Two House Republicans push justice department to investigate Zohran Mamdani's path to US citizenship

Two US House Republicans are pushing the federal justice department to investigate the path to citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate favored to win the 4 November election for New York City mayor.

Congressman Randy Fine of Florida and Andy Ogles of Tennessee – both staunch proponents of Donald Trump's presidential administration – have been leading the push, which has been condemned by Democratic officials and Muslim civil rights groups as “racist and anti-Muslim”.

Fine in recent days demanded the federal government “review every naturalization of the past 30 years – starting with Mamdani”.

Fine told the New York Post: “I just think we need to take a hard look at how these folks became citizens, and if there is any fraud or any violation of the rules we need to denaturalize and deport.”

He continued: “I know that there's a lot of us that are very, very concerned about the enemy within – people who have come to this country to become citizens, to destroy it.”

Meanwhile, since June, Ogles has pushed for a justice department investigation of Mamdani, with calls to deport him over claims that the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to which Mamdani belongs are a communist organization that he didn't disclose in his naturalization process.

A dual citizen of the US and Uganda, Mamdani has criticized the rhetoric aimed at him by Fine, Ogles and other Republicans by invoking the federal government shutdown which began on 1 October as well as his decisive victory in June's New York City Democratic mayoral primary.

“In a moment where Americans across the country are deeply fearful of whether they can afford the basic dignities of life, be it healthcare, be it groceries, be it their rent, the focus of the Republican party is to try and denaturalize the Muslim guy that won the New York City Democratic primary with the most votes in our city's history?” Mamdani told MSNBC's The Weekend: Primetime on Saturday. “It just speaks to the fact that for the Republican party, the only agenda they really have on offer is that of cruelty and punishment.”

Mamdani also criticized his main mayoral opponent, Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned while facing an impeachment investigation over sexual harassment allegations in 2021. Cuomo, who is the preferred candidate of New York City native Trump, suggested on a radio talk show recently that Mamdani would cheer a terrorist attack like the ones that killed thousands on 11 September 2001.

“God forbid another 9/11,” Cuomo said. “Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?”

The host, Sid Rosenberg replied, “He'd be cheering.”

Cuomo paused, laughed, and added, “That's another problem.”

Cuomo tried to distance himself from the interview, claiming, “I can see where if you took it seriously, it was offensive.” Cuomo's campaign has also received criticism for posting, then deleting, a racist AI generated video depicting “criminals for Zohran Mamdani”.

“I think Islamophobia is something that is endemic to politics across this country,” Mamdani added in the interview with MSNBC. “And we have seen it normalized. We have seen it accepted. And it has come to a point where to speak up about it is seen as if you are making it into an issue, whereas in fact you are naming that which already exists. And so much of this is driven from an unwillingness to recognize that Muslims belong here in the city.”

Department of Agriculture says no benefits will be issued in November and it would not draw on emergency reserves

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Saturday that food benefits under one of the country's biggest social assistance programs will not be issued in November amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.

The shutdown was in its 25th day at the time of the announcement, which came after more than 200 Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Friday called on USDA to draw on its emergency reserves to fund November food benefits.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress remain at an impasse over how to fund and reopen the federal government.

“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the USDA said in a post on its website. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued” 1 November.

More than 41 million depend on the monthly payments, according to the USDA. In some states, like New Mexico, dependence on the program is as high as 21% of residents, it said.

According to a memo seen by Reuters, the department indicated that it would not draw on emergency reserves to fund food benefits in November.

A statement from the leader of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the Trump administration had the opportunity to act sooner to ensure benefits don't run out.

“It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,” the statement from Sharon Parrott said, as reported by The Hill. “Instead, it may choose not to use them in an effort to gain political advantage” as Republicans seek to exert pressure on Senate Democrats to vote in favor of a spending bill that would reopen the federal government.

Governors in Louisiana and Virginia declared states of emergencies this week to make funds available to help with hunger relief in anticipation of Snap benefits not being issued in November.

Detention of Chicago man violates his due process and he must be given a bond hearing by 31 October, judge says

The detention by immigration authorities of a Chicago man whose 16-year-old daughter is undergoing treatment for advanced cancer is illegal, and he must be given a bond hearing by 31 October, a federal judge has ruled.

Attorneys for Ruben Torres Maldonado, 40, who was detained on 18 October, have petitioned for his release as his deportation case goes through the system. While US district judge Jeremy Daniel said in an order Friday that Torres's detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is illegal and violates his due process rights, he also said he could not order his immediate release.

“While sympathetic to the plight the petitioner's daughter faces due to her health concerns, the court must act within the constraints of the relevant statutes, rules, and precedents,” the judge wrote Friday.

Torres's attorney took the ruling as a win – for now.

“We're pleased that the judge ruled in our favor in determining that ICE is illegally detaining Ruben. We will now turn the fight to immigration court so we can secure Ruben's release on bond while he applies for permanent residence status,” his attorney, Kalman Resnick, said in a statement Friday night.

Torres, a painter and home renovator, was detained at a suburban Home Depot store. His daughter, Ofelia Torres, was diagnosed in December with a rare and aggressive form of soft-tissue cancer called metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Torres entered the US in 2003, according to his lawyers. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a four-year-old son. The children are both US citizens, according to court records.

“My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” Ofelia said in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for her family. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleges that Torres has been living illegally in the US for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding.

“This is nothing more than a desperate Hail Mary attempt to keep a criminal illegal alien in our country,” assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “The Trump administration is fighting for the rule of law and the American people.”

At a hearing on Thursday, which Ofelia attended in a wheelchair, the family's attorneys told the judge that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father's arrest so that she could see family and friends. But since his arrest, she had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption”, they said.

Federal prosecutor Craig Oswald told the court that the government did not want to release Torres because he didn't cooperate during his arrest.

Several elected officials held a news conference on Wednesday to protest Torres's arrest. The Chicago area has been at the center of a major immigration crackdown dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, which began in early September.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said he stands ready to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. and tried to reassure Canadians that he is taking steps to shore up the country's economy after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs by another 10 per cent.

Mr. Trump said this weekend he's hiking tariffs on Canadian imports after an Ontario government TV ad critical of his protectionist levies ran during the first game of the World Series.

Mr. Carney, who is in Malaysia meeting with member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said his government plans massive investments in Canada's economy and intends to shift as much trade as possible away from the United States, which has become a more unpredictable and unreliable partner since Mr. Trump took office in January.

“You'll be seeing within the course of the next two weeks an ambitious budget which makes generational investments in Canada,” Mr. Carney told reporters.

“And we are in the process of diversifying our trade relationships – the focus of our meetings here in Asia,” the Prime Minister said. “We have an intention to more than double our exports away from the United States over the course of the next decade.”

Opinion: Is Ford's ad to blame for Trump's 10-per-cent tariff hike? Please, it's an excuse

Mr. Trump, who has imposed a slew of tariffs on Canadian goods since March, had already ratcheted up tensions this past Thursday by breaking off negotiations aimed at resolving the trade war in response to the TV ad.

The 60-second TV spot uses footage from nearly 40 years ago of former U.S. president Ronald Reagan decrying American protectionism, saying such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.

Mr. Trump, who has said the Ontario ad misrepresents Mr. Reagan's comments, said he was raising tariffs by 10 per cent because Canada did not immediately stop running the ad as he wanted.

“Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” the U.S. President said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew to Malaysia on Air Force One.

The President has not yet issued any executive order to enforce the threatened 10-per cent-hike. It's not clear if this new levy would apply to all Canadian imports or a selection of them. And he has announced no date for this increase.

Both Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump were in Kuala Lumpur over the weekend to attend the ASEAN summit.

Speaking at the summit on Sunday, Mr. Carney, in an apparent reference to Mr. Trump, talked of the need for dependable allies in turbulent times.

“It makes ASEAN more important than ever. It underscores the importance of reliable partners who honour their commitments, who are there in tough times and when things are not working, work collaboratively to fix them.”

Carney pitches Asia on Canada as energy superpower

He told reporters he'd agreed with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of ASEAN, as well as next year's chair, Philippines President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., that Canada would conclude a free-trade deal with ASEAN member countries by next year.

Separately, Mr. Carney said he'd agreed with the Philippines to accelerate negotiations on a free-trade deal that would also conclude next year.

“Building at home, diversifying our trade relationships abroad, and being ready to work with the United States government as, and when, the time comes .”

After Mr. Trump said he would terminate trade talks, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose government paid for the ad campaign, said he would pull the ad after this weekend.

The ad is much shorter than Mr. Reagan's original address. It is edited, with certain passages presented out of order.

In Mr. Reagan's original speech, the late president defended imposing duties on Japan during a trade dispute over semiconductors. He alleged Japan was failing to enforce Japanese companies' violations of a trade agreement with the United States.

Watch the Government of Ontario's anti-tariff advertisement

But Mr. Reagan explained why tariffs are bad for the U.S. and hurt free trade, which is largely what the Ontario government quoted in its ad. 

However, Mr. Reagan also argued that his duties on Japan were justified “to stop unfair practices against American products,” while extolling the virtues of free trade overall.

The United States under Mr. Trump has imposed 35-per-cent tariffs on trade not covered by the United-States-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 

He has also imposed a number of sectoral tariffs that affect Canadian industry disproportionately, including a 50-per-cent levy on steel and aluminum and a 25-per-cent levy on automobiles.

Softwood lumber, too, has been hit hard. Canadian producers are facing levies totalling more than 45 per cent after the administration recently announced a new 10-per-cent tariff on lumber shipments into the U.S. on top of existing duties.

Last month, Mr. Trump set a date of Nov. 1 for imposing a 25-per-cent tariff on medium- and heavy-duty trucks, a measure previously announced along with tariffs on pharmaceuticals and furniture.

The Globe and Mail last week reported that Mr. Carney and Mr. Ford spoke to each other Thursday night and on Friday. The Prime Minister expressed his preference that the ad be pulled off the air.

This is at least the second time Mr. Trump has paused trade talks with Canada. 

In June, after Ottawa proceeded to enact a digital sales tax that would hit U.S. tech giants, the U.S. President broke off negotiations. He resumed them after Mr. Carney scrapped the tax.

Analysis: Trump's bizarre outrage over Ontario's anti-tariff ad is a symbol of his presidency

Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association in Canada, called the new 10-per-cent tariff the “latest in a series of unprovoked and unwarranted escalations in tariff policy with other sovereign nations.”

He said this will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers.

“Lost in the accountability loop here is the President's threat is really to charge American taxpayers billions of dollars because of a benign World Series ad he doesn't like.”

Former Alberta premier Jason Kenney, who also served in Stephen Harper's federal government, called Mr. Trump's reaction to the TV ad embarrassing.

“The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one minute ad,” Mr. Kenney said on X.

Mr. Carney underlined the fact that it's the Canadian government and nobody else, that conducts negotiations with the United States, an apparent reference to the fact the Ontario government, not Ottawa, produced the ad.

“The Government of Canada stands ready to build on the progress that we had been making in our negotiations, our discussions with our American counterparts, and we have a consistent focus in those discussions on doing the best deal for Canadian workers and their families,” he said. 

“It is the sole responsibility of the government of Canada to have those discussions with the United States, and it's the best way forward.”

Business Council of Canada president Goldy Hyder said Canada can't have premiers freelancing on the Canada-U.S. relationship.

“To have every sector, every province, every premier kind of weighing in on this. I don't see that behaviour in the United States,” Mr. Hyder said. “I don't see governor after governor on television,” he said. “You don't see that in Mexico.”

He acknowledged the Americans want to end the assembly of cars in Canada for the U.S. market, but said Canada has leverage. 

“We have cards to play – as the President likes to say – we have oil, we have gas, we have uranium, we have potash, we have critical minerals, and we need to play to our strengths and leverage those in a negotiation.”

Experts see move as Trump's latest attempt to shift power of the purse away from Congress and into executive branch

By ordering that US military personnel receive paychecks even though the government is shut down, Donald Trump is seeing to the needs of a politically untouchable constituency that has been caught up in the congressional logjam over federal spending.

But experts who spoke to the Guardian warn that he is doing so in a way that is almost certainly illegal and, if left unchecked, bodes ill for Congress's constitutional authority to control government spending. Some fear it could set the stage for the president to unilaterally fund other contentious decisions in the future, such as the deployment of the military on US soil.

“I'm with the people who believe that there's really no good legal justification for moving the money around in this way,” said Phil Wallach, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the separation of powers in the US government.

“There's no congressional authorization for troop payment for this new fiscal year. So it's going pretty far out on a legal limb, and just sort of daring anybody to do anything about it. Because, of course, substantially, nobody thinks it's very bad to pay the troops.”

The federal government shut down at the start of October after Democrats and Republicans in Congress failed to agree on legislation to extend funding beyond the end of September. About 700,000 federal workers have been furloughed, while hundreds of thousands of others continue to report to work, but are not getting paychecks.

Troops were paid during previous government shutdowns because Congress had either approved defense department spending, or passed bills specifically to guarantee their salaries, said Bobby Kogan, a former White House office of management and budget official who is now with the Center for American Progress, a liberal thinktank.

Congress took neither of those actions this time, though lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to get legislation addressing federal workers' pay through Congress, as recently as this week.

Last week, Trump acted unilaterally, repurposing a reported $8bn in defense department funds meant for research and development to pay the military in the middle of October. Kogan called the decision “super duper duper illegal” under federal law.

“If you try to spend money you have on the wrong purpose, you're in trouble. And if you try to spend money into a purpose that you don't have money for that purpose, then you're in trouble as well,” he said.

On Thursday, Trump said an unnamed “friend” had contributed $130m to pay service members during the shutdown, later revealed by the New York Times to be reclusive billionaire and Trump supporter Timothy Mellon. Sean Parnell, the chief spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed acceptance of the funds “under its general gift acceptance authority. The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members' salaries and benefits.”

Christopher Mirasola, a law professor at the University of Houston, said that the civil servants who carried out Trump's order to repurpose funds could theoretically be prosecuted for violating a law called the Antideficiency Act. But such prosecutions have never happened in the past, and he said in an interview he finds it difficult to believe Trump's justice department, or even another president, would carry them out.

“I'm just not sure if a future administration would have the appetite to bring career government officials who at that point would have suffered years of abuse at the hands of the administration for complying with something even if they knew that it was illegal,” Mirasola said.

Trump foes who tried to sue over it – think Democratic lawmakers or civil society groups – may have trouble proving that they were harmed by paying the troops, a necessary component for bringing a case, Kogan said.

“You're in tough places here to find standing under this supreme court, at least under the Trump administration,” he said.

The experts viewed Trump's move to pay troops as his latest attempt to shift the power of the purse away from Congress and into the executive branch, but differed over how significant it was in the long term. Since taking office, he has used a variety of methods to halt government spending on areas his administration opposes, including a controversial pocket rescission of foreign aid funds.

“I think the crisis will start to feel more acute if we start seeing the president moving money around to do things that are very politically controversial,” said Wallach, noting that paying US armed forces is “something that basically everybody agrees on”.

The ball is now in the Republican-controlled Congress's court to make clear that it is they who make the decisions about spending, Wallach said.

“I certainly don't think among GOP appropriators, they're like wanting to see the White House just take things over. I'm really quite certain that they're distressed by this dynamic and want to get away from it as fast as they can,” he said.

Kogan warned that Trump was launching an offensive against Congress's appropriations process, by which lawmakers, usually working in a bipartisan fashion, outline how much the government will spend, and on what.

“If the president can just completely ignore anything and everything, can spend money into existence, he can drain accounts and use them on whatever he wants, right?” Kogan said. “Like, what are we even doing there? That makes you an appropriations king.”

Such decisions may paradoxically make finding an agreement to reopen the government harder, by sapping the trust in Congress that any legislative deal Democrats sign on to will be honored by Trump.

“The whole point of the budget deal is to figure out how you're going to allocate your limited resources. We are going to figure out what we want to prioritize in the government, and if the president has complete and unilateral authority to ignore every part of that deal, how can you ever do appropriations? How can you ever make a funding deal?” Kogan.

Mirasola connected the pay decision to Trump's deployment of national guard troops into cities across the country, including Washington DC, Chicago and Portland. He views many of the federal laws that govern how the military may be used on US soil as outdated, and the main obstacle Trump faces is his ability to get Congress to pay for the soldiers.

“If my theory that appropriations are the most important limit on these domestic military deployments, if that's true, then moves like this to edge Congress out of the appropriations process [are] really a strike at one of the most significant amendments on the president's authority to use the military in the United States,” he said.

Ukrainian forces liberated two villages in eastern Donetsk Oblast about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of embattled Pokrovsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Oct. 26. 

The General Staff said that Ukrainian troops operating in the area cleared Kucheriv Yar and Sukhetske of Russian troops over the past 10 days. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claim. 

The General Staff's report comes nearly three months after Russian forces made a sudden 10-kilometer (6-mile) push in just days toward the key highway connecting Kramatorsk and Dobropillia in early August. Since the rapid Russian advance in the area, Ukrainian forces have taken back nine villages, and nine more have been cleared of Russian sabotage groups, the General Staff said in its Facebook post. 

Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState also shows the villages of Kucheriv Yar and Sukhetske as controlled by Ukrainian forces. The villages are about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Dobropillia, a town that Russian forces have heavily struck since the August breach.

Across the front, Russian forces continue to launch offensives on multiple sectors despite the Ukrainian claims that its troops have effectively stalled Moscow's momentum. 

Russian troops have already entered the long-embattled Pokrovsk, semi-encircling what used to be a key Ukrainian logistics hub, and are trying to further close in on the city to force a Ukrainian withdrawal. 

The General Staff acknowledged on Oct. 26 that Russia has accumulated about 200 servicemen in Pokrovsk, infiltrating small infantry groups, reporting shooting and drone battles in the city. 

The 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces acknowledged the Russian penetration to the railway on Oct. 20.

"It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses," Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed.

While Ukraine also lacks Western-supplied weapons, soldiers and commanders say shortages of basics — cars, drones and people — make holding back Russia extremely difficult. Even as Kyiv seeks U.S. approval for Tomahawks, they say critical, rudimentary gear is the more pressing need.

Russia faces an increase in the arson and “spontaneous combustion” of electrical panels, railway relay cabinets, and other infrastructure helping Moscow wage its war against Ukraine over the past week, a source at Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. 

The episode covers Russian war crimes in Pokrovsk and continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, including missile strikes on Kyiv and Kharkiv. While Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire with Ukraine, has President Trump finally shifted his approach to Russia?

Ukrainian forces liberated two villages in eastern Donetsk Oblast about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of embattled Pokrovsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Oct. 26. 

Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Oct. 26, killing at least three people, and injuring at least 32 others, including seven children.

At least nine civilians were killed and 44 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional authorities reported on Oct. 26.

Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania.

"I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing," U.S. President Donald Trump said.


"I think it's very important we have dialogue because President Trump already has done a lot to solve lots of the world conflicts,” Kirill Dmitriev told Fox News on Oct. 25. 







The plant is Russia's fourth-largest oil refinery and processed 13.1 million tons of oil last year, according to Russian estimates.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  CNN FlashDocs unit tracks the theft, the investigation and the cultural fallout in “The Heist: The Louvre's Stolen Crown Jewels.” Watch tonight Sunday, October 26 at 8pm ET/PT on CNN. The special will also be available to stream via CNN's All Access subscription offering at launch on Tuesday, October 28.



            Police have arrested suspects in connection with the theft of priceless jewels from the Louvre museum, just as one attempted to leave the country, the Paris prosecutor's office said.
    


            Thieves last week targeted the Louvre's Apollo Gallery in a brazen daylight raid, fleeing with jewelry worth tens of millions in a matter of minutes.
    


            Scores of investigators have been involved in chasing down those suspected of the heist, which Louvre director Laurence des Cars called a “terrible failure.”
    


            French media first broke news of the arrests, with CNN-affiliate BFMTV reporting that two suspects in their thirties and known to police were detained on Saturday evening local time.
    


            At least two other individuals suspected of being involved in the heist remain at large, according to BFMTV.
    


            Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said “one of the men arrested was preparing to leave the territory from Roissy airport,” also known as Charles de Gaulle airport, a facility near Paris.
    


            The prosecutor did not confirm the number of arrests or say if any of the jewels were recovered.
    


            France's Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez congratulated the investigators for the arrests, who he said “have worked tirelessly, as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.”
    


            Thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre's upper floor last weekend, which houses the French Crown Jewels. They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window.
    


            In the course of a seven-minute heist, they broke into two high-security display cases and stole nine items, according to France's culture ministry. Among the items taken was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.
    


            The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million), Beccuau previously told French radio station RTL. Around 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt to track down those responsible for the heist, she said.
    


            One week after the heist, the investigation into the incident is accelerating, BFMTV reported Sunday.
    


            Following the daylight robbery, French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the heist exposed security failings at France's most famous museum.
    


            “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn't been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”

MOSCOW, October 26. /TASS/. Russia's Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile has no analogues in the world, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday.

On October 26, Putin visited one of the Russian command posts of the joint group of forces and held a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov and commanders of the battlegroups involved in the special military operation.

"I have a report from the industrial bodies, and in general I am familiar with the estimates of provided by Defense Ministry. It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses," he said.

"I remember quite well when we announced that we were in the development stage of such weapons and even high-level experts told me that it worthy objective indeed, but in the historical short term was unrealizable. I reiterate that this opinion was voiced by high-class experts," Putin added.

KYOTO — Sightings of bears and animals believed to be bears are increasing in residential areas of Ukyo Ward, Kyoto, and close to Arashiyama, a nearby tourist spot.

A total of five sightings were reported over Friday and Saturday. No human injuries have been confirmed.

On Friday evening, two cubs were spotted in a bamboo grove near Uzumasa Nakayamacho. On the same day, two other sightings were reported around Hirosawa Pond, a popular spot for moon viewing.

Early Saturday morning, police received a report of a bear-like cub on a road about 800 meters west of JR Saga-Arashiyama Station, north of the World Heritage Site Tenryuji Temple and near the Bamboo Grove Path, which is popular with tourists.

An event attempting the Guinness World Record for the longest nagashi somen, where somen noodles flow down a split bamboo trough, distance was held in Niyodogawa Town, Kochi Prefecture, on Saturday. The goal of 4,133.59 meters was met, setting a new world record. The previous record of 4,031.76 meters had taken place in Taketa, Oita Prefecture, in 2023.

The event was planned by a group of young volunteers to mark the 20th anniversary of the town's municipal merger. Local businesses also took park, splitting about 1,000 bamboo poles to make troughs. The long trough was set over a town road with an elevation difference of about 350 meters to let water flow smoothly.

Shohei Takemura, 31, the event's executive committee chair, kicked off the attempt by gently placing the noodles into the water flow. About an hour later, the noodles began to pour into the goal basket and significantly exceeded the required 25 gram amount. Participants cheered when the official adjudicator declared the attempt successful.

With tears in his eyes, Takemura stated, “We have proven we can achieve the world's best even in a town facing population decline and a lack of young people.”

            Russia has successfully tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile and will work towards deploying the weapon, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday, which comes as Moscow launched its second deadly attack on Ukraine in two nights.
    


            The timing of the missile test is notable, coming the same week that a potential summit with US President Donald Trump broke down, and the White House placed sanctions on two of Russia's largest oil companies – some of the Trump administration's most tangible actions against Russia to date.
    


            Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, claimed the Burevestnik missile remained airborne for about 15 hours and covered a distance of around 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles). During the test, the weapon demonstrated “its high capabilities in evading anti-missile and anti-aircraft defences,” Gerasimov said.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin said, “We need to determine the possible ways of using it and start preparing the infrastructure for deploying this weapon,” adding that it's a product “no one else in the world has.”
    


            Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev said that the details of the “successful” missile testing had been conveyed to the Trump administration during his visit to the US, as well as recent battlefield updates.
    


            Last week, Russia also held a “planned” strategic nuclear forces drill under Putin's supervision. The Kremlin said the drill tested staff skills and the readiness of military command-and-control systems, adding that all objectives were met.
    


            It comes as Russia launched more than 100 drones on Ukraine overnight into Sunday, striking high-rise buildings in Kyiv as residents slept.
    


            A 19-year-old girl and her mother, 46, were among three people killed in air strikes on the Ukrainian capital, according to Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. A fur﻿ther 33 people were wounded, including seven children.
    


            “The youngest is four years old,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. Of those injured, eight were hospitalized, Klitschko said.
    


            The latest wave of violence came as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky Zelensky issued a fresh appeal for more Patriot missile defense systems, part of a broader efforts to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia's sustained aerial assault.
    


            On Saturday night, a fire erupted at a nine-story residential building in the capital's Desnianskyi region, where 13 people were rescued from the upper floors. Additionally, a Russian drone struck a 16-story high-rise, shattering windows from the first to the ninth floor, emergency crew said.
    


            Natalia Zura, 49, escaped from the burning house with her daughter Maria using a fire ladder.
    


            “We had a terrible night. We had to climb down the fire escape from the third floor. Thank you to our rescuers, our guardian angels. We are very grateful because we almost suffocated, we almost burned to death,” Zura told CNN.
    


            Olha Motianina, 34, had left Kyiv for a nearby village with her family because of the constant bombardment. On Sunday, she returned to her home in the city to find the windows shattered from the blast.
    


            “It's a very sad picture. People have died, and I don't know how to describe it. It's very sad and affects my mental state,” she said.
    


            Another drone struck a high-rise building in the Obolonskyi district of Kyiv, but firefighters said the site was not set ablaze.
    


            “Every Russian strike is an attempt to inflict as much damage as possible on ordinary life,” Zelensky said on Sunday.
    


            “This week, they've been striking residential buildings, our people, our children… these are the main targets for the Russians,” he added, noting that the Kremlin has unleashed nearly 1,200 drones, more than 1,360 guided aerial bombs and over 50 missiles on his nation in the past week.
    


            More than a hundred rescuers and police officers in Kyiv responded overnight into Sunday, checking the stability of the burned out high-rises as well as clearing debris and dismantling damaged structures, the interior minister said.
    


            Elsewhere in the city, crews continue painstakingly clearing debris from the previous night's attack.
    


            The magnitude of the attack and the extent of its damage was not immediately known. Klitschko did not confirm whether the buildings were directly hit or struck by falling debris from destroyed weapons.
    


            Meanwhile, Russian air defense systems destroyed two drones heading for Moscow, according to the city's mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Sunday.
    


            Six civilians were injured in Russia's Belgorod region due to Ukrainian strikes, according to local authorities there, including three in the city of Belgorod and three in the village of Dorogoshch.
    


            Ukraine needs a constant pipeline of weapons from its allies to defend against Russian barrages of missiles and drones – often several hundred in one night. Repeated deadly attacks have underlined the shortfall in Ukraine's air defenses.
    


            Another overnight attack Saturday killed at least four people in Ukraine, prompting Zelensky to ask for more Patriot missile systems “so that we can protect our cities from this horror.”
    


            Trump has been pushing for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia but those attempts have made little progress so far.
    


            After Trump had a phone call with Putin last week, he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced he was heading soon to Budapest for an in-person summit.
    


            Five days later, the summit was off and new sanctions on Moscow were on.
    


            “It just it didn't feel right to me,” Trump said Wednesday. “It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it.”
    


            Since then, the Kremlin has said it was wrong to talk about the cancellation of the meeting, according to Russian state media outlet Vesti.
    


            On Saturday, Trump struck a similarly pessimistic tone, saying he has no immediate plans to schedule a meeting with Putin and insisting that any summit will have to wait until a potential peace deal seems achievable.
    


            “I'm going to have to know that we're going to make a deal,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Asia. “I'm not going to be wasting my time. I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing,” he added.

MIAMI, October 26. /TASS/. Russian Special Presidential Envoy for economic cooperation with foreign countries and CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev had several meetings with representatives of the administration of US President Donald Trump over the past two days, an informed source from the Russian side told TASS.

"The meetings with representatives of President Trump administration took place yesterday, today, and will continue tomorrow," the source said, without giving details of the meetings.

Dmitriev would meet US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and other politicians as part of his visit to the United States, a source told TASS earlier.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Thousands of pilgrims turned out Sunday in Romania's capital for the consecration of religious paintings inside the world's largest Christian Orthodox church that was being opened after 15 years of construction. 

Worshippers and officials arrived in droves at the People's Salvation Cathedral, known as the National Cathedral, which at its highest point stands more than 125 meters (410 feet) and has an inner capacity for 5,000 worshippers in the deeply Orthodox country. The cathedral's opulent interior is covered with frescoes and mosaics depicting saints and icons.

Proposals for a national cathedral in the country of about 19 million people had been put forward for more than a century, but its fruition was hampered by two world wars and the decades of communist rule, which sought to suppress religion. The Romanian Orthodox Church has called the cathedral “a symbol of national identity.”

Romania is one of the most pious countries in the European Union, with around 85% of the population identifying as religious. 

Situated behind the hulking Palace of the People built by the late communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, construction for the cathedral finally began in 2010, and its altar was consecrated in 2018. It has so far cost a reported 270 million euros ($313 million), with a majority drawn from public funds, and some works are yet to be completed.

Traffic was restricted for Sunday's service, which was attended by President Nicusor Dan and Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan. Many worshippers watched via TV screens set up outside the cathedral.




The cathedral's mosaics and iconography cover an area of 17,800 square meters (191,000 square feet), according the cathedral's website. 

Daniel Codrescu, who has spent seven years working on the frescoes and mosaics, told The Associated Press that much of the iconography has been inspired by medieval Romanian paintings and others from the Byzantine world.

“It was a complex collaboration with the church, with art historians, with artists, also our friends of contemporary art,” he said. “I hope (the church) is going to have a very important impact on society because … it's a public space.”

With one of the largest budget deficits in the EU, not everyone in Romania was happy about the cost of the project. Critics bemoan that the massive church has drawn on public funds, which could have been spent on schools or hospitals.

Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, said the project was a “waste of public money” but said it could offer a “boost to national pride and identity” for some Romanians.

“The fact that they have forced, year after year, politicians to pay for it, in some cases taking money from communities that really needed that money, indicates it was a show of force, not one of humility and love of God,” he said. “Economically, it might be OK in the long term as it will be a tourist attraction.”

Rares Ghiorghies, 37, supports the church but said the money would be better spent on health and education as “a matter of good governance.” 

“The big problem in society is that most of those who criticize do not follow the activities of the church,” he said.

            Former New York Jets All-Pro center Nick Mangold died at the age of 41 due to complications of kidney disease, the team announced on Sunday.
    


            Mangold died on Saturday night after battling chronic kidney disease for nearly 19 years and was undergoing dialysis.

            “Nick was more than a legendary center,” Jets Chairman Woody Johnson said in a statement. “He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.”
    


            The news comes ahead of the Jets' game against the Bengals in Cincinnati, where the team is looking for its first win of the season.

            On ESPN's “Sunday NFL Countdown,” Mangold's former head coach, Rex Ryan, was emotional upon learning of his passsing.
    


            “It's brutal,” Ryan said with Pro Football Hall of Famer Randy Moss consoling him. “Such a great young man. I had the pleasure of coaching him for all six years with the Jets.
    


            “I remember it was obvious I was getting fired. My last game, Mangold's injured. Like, injured. He comes to me and says, ‘I'm playing this game.' He wanted to play for me. That's what I remember about this kid. He was awesome and just way too young. I feel so bad for his wife and family – rough.”
    


            Earlier this month, he addressed his health situation in a plea posted on social media where he appealed for a kidney donor.
    


            “This isn't an easy message to share, but I want to be open about what's been happening with me and my health,” the former lineman stated in a statement addressed to the Jets and Ohio State University communities. Mangold won a national championship with the Buckeyes in 2002.
    


            “In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease. After a rough summer, I'm undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant,” the 41-year-old wrote. “I always knew this day would come, but I thought I would have had more time.
    


            “Unfortunately, I do not have any family able to donate at this time, so this is why I'm reaching out to you, our NY Jets and Ohio State communities. I am in need of a kidney donor with type O blood.”
    


            The Jets drafted Mangold in the first round of the 2006 NFL draft out of Ohio State.
    


            “The Ohio State football program is saddened by the news of Nick Mangold's passing and sends heartfelt condolences to his family and friends,” the Buckeyes said on Sunday.
    


            The seven-time Pro Bowler played all 11 seasons with the Jets, where he was a two-time first-team All-Pro and made the second-team All-Pro once. The franchise inducted Mangold into the team's Ring of Honor in 2022.
    


            In September, Mangold was named as one of 128 modern-era players on the initial list for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026.
    


            “On behalf of the entire Johnson family and the New York Jets organization, we offer our sincere condolences to Jenny, their four children — Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte — as well as to Nick's extended family, friends, and all who loved him,” Johnson said.
    


            “Nick Mangold will forever be a Jet,” Johnson added.

David Beckham waved to his fans while walking the green carpet at the Earthshot Prize Awards in Boston on Friday.

Victoria Beckham was nearly forced to shut down her namesake fashion brand after falling victim to irresponsible spending that left her company "tens of millions in the red."

In Netflix's new documentary, titled "Victoria Beckham," the former Spice Girl — who, throughout the three-part series, gave viewers a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to prepare for a show at Paris Fashion Week — got candid about leaning on her husband, David Beckham, for financial assistance in the early years of her company's launch and detailed the "mind-blowing" decisions that nearly cost her her brand.

"This business is everything to me. It's absolutely who I am. But it's been a hell of a journey," she said in the documentary. "I almost lost everything, and that was a dark, dark time. I used to cry before I went to work every day because I felt like a firefighter. We were tens of millions in the red."

"Yes, I'm going home to my husband, but I'm going home to my business partner as well. And so I would talk to him about it. I had to. He was invested. And I hated it. I absolutely hated it."

David said they both looked at their investments within the company, and came to the conclusion that something had to change.

"We both sat there and we looked at what I'd invested, and I think part of that conversation broke my heart because Victoria is a proud woman," David said.

"When we met, she was a lot richer than me. She actually bought our first house in Hertfordshire, known as Beckingham Palace," he added. "So for her to have to come to me and say, ‘Can I have some — we need some more money. The business needs more money,' that was hard for both of us because I didn't have the money to keep doing this, and eventually I was like, ‘This cannot continue.'"

Victoria said the "entire house was crashing down."

"I was losing my business. I needed outside investment. I needed someone to help me," she said.

The former pop star eventually connected with outside investor David Belhassen, who claimed the state of the company was a "disaster" at the time.

VICTORIA BECKHAM ADMITS SHE BECAME 'VERY GOOD AT LYING' AS FAME TOOK TOLL ON HER HEALTH

"I had never seen something as hard as that to fix," he said.

"For years, she had people telling her what she wanted to hear. I remember one of the expenses was the office plants. She loved plants," Belhassen said. "And it was costing her £70,000 a year. And then there was someone who was coming to water the plants for £15,000 a year – and that's only the beginning. So I went to her and I decided to just tell the truth, exactly the way it is, and I didn't know how she'd react."

"I said, 'Victoria, we have to change everything, restructure the business, and that's going to be painful,' and when I finished she just listened, and she left a little silence," he recalled.

Victoria admitted it was difficult to hear the truth.

"I hadn't been to business school, I'd come from an entertainment background… I didn't realize it at the time, but the waste was mind-blowing. I mean, I had 15 different linings for the insides of the outerwear. People thought that I was used to getting the best… bizarre things like flying chairs from one side of the world to the other."

"I hear it now and I'm horrified, but I allowed that to happen," she said. "I think part of the problem was people were really afraid to tell me no. There's a power to be honest, the power of celebrity. People thought I wasn't used to hearing no."

"I needed to put Victoria Beckham into Victoria Beckham," she said.

And that, she did.

Elsewhere in the documentary, Victoria also opened up about one of the toughest challenges she's faced — her past eating disorder.

"People felt it was OK to criticize a woman for her weight, for what she's doing, for what she's wearing," David said in the documentary. "There were a lot of things happening in TV then that won't happen now. That can't happen now."

"My Victoria that I knew, sits at home in a tracksuit, smiling, laughing, having a glass of wine. That started to go purely because of the criticism that she was getting," he added.

While recalling a 1999 incident in which a TV host asked her to step on a scale on live television to confirm her weight was "back to normal" six months after giving birth to her first child, Victoria admitted the whole ordeal affected her deeply.

"I was weighed on national television when Brooklyn was 6 months old," she said in the documentary. "Get on those scales on television. Have you lost weight? And we laugh about it, and we joke about it when we're on television, but I was really, really young and that hurt."

During the live television segment in question, "Don't Forget Your Toothbrush," host Chris Evans said, "A lot of girls want to know, because you look fantastic again, how did you get back to your shape after birth?"

After Victoria detailed her exercise regime, Evans asked Victoria, "Is your weight back to normal? Can I check? Do you mind?"

That experience alone left Victoria feeling as if she wasn't enough.

"I really started to doubt myself and not like myself," she said in the doc. "And because I let it affect me, I didn't know what I saw when I looked in the mirror. You lose all sense of reality. I'm just very critical of myself. I didn't like what I saw."

"I've been everything from Porky Posh to Skinny Posh," she continued. "I mean, it's been a lot. And that's hard. I had no control over what was being written about me, pictures that were being taken. And I suppose I wanted to control that. I could control it with the clothing and I could control my weight, and I was controlling it in an incredibly unhealthy way."

"When you have an eating disorder, you become very good at lying," she added. "And I was never honest about it with my parents. I never talked about it publicly. It really affects you when you are being told constantly you're not good enough. And I suppose that's been with me my whole life."

At one point, the businesswoman broke down in tears to David as they discussed her reasoning behind all that she does.

"But who are you trying to prove this to?" David asked.

"Maybe a lot of it to you," said Victoria, who admittedly accepted financial aid from David while establishing her brand in the early years. "I feel bad about all that times when I had to ask you to help me out."

"You don't have to prove it to me ever," he said, to which Victoria responded, "No, but I want to, myself. I want to. When I saw your face and the kids' faces backstage after the last show, it was not the first time, but it was a real moment for me where I could see how proud of me you were. I've still got so much that I want to do."

"I think you're trying to prove it to yourself," said David. "Not to me. Maybe you're so stubborn in the fact that you are trying to prove everybody wrong."

"Yeah, success. It feels good. I'm not going to lie," she said. "I am proud, and I'm not ashamed to say that I'm ambitious, and I've still got a lot that I want to do."

"So you're not stopping yet?" David asked.

"I'm not stopping yet," she quipped.

Soon after he stepped out of the plane, U.S. President Trump displayed his signature dance moves to Malaysian performers on Sunday. He arrived in Malaysia to attend the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.

President Donald Trump is heading for Asia for the first time this term, a trip where he is expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to de-escalate a trade war.

About 200 protesters gathered in a anti-trump protest co-organized by multiple groups, NGOs and civil society as the U.S. president attended the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hosted in Kuala Lumpur.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A trade deal between the United States and China is drawing closer, officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday as they reached an initial consensus for President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to aim to finalize during their high-stakes meeting.

Any agreement would be a relief to international markets even it does not address underlying issues involving manufacturing imbalances and access to state-of-the-art computer chips.

Beijing recently limited exports of rare earth elements that are needed for advanced technologies, and Trump responded by threatening additional tariffs on Chinese products. The prospect of a widening conflict risked weakening economic growth worldwide.

China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters that the two sides had reached a “preliminary consensus,” while Trump's treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was “a very successful framework.”

Trump also expressed confidence that an agreement was at hand, saying the Chinese “want to make a deal and we want to make a deal.” The Republican president is set to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia. Trump reiterated that he plans to visit China in the future and suggested that Xi could come to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Florida.

Bessent told CBS' “Face the Nation” that the threat of additional higher tariffs on China was “effectively off the table.” In interviews on several American news shows, he said discussions with China yielded initial agreements to stop the precursor chemicals for fentanyl from coming into the U.S., and that Beijing would make “substantial” purchases of soybean and other agricultural products while putting off export controls on rare earths.

The progress toward a potential agreement came during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in Kuala Lumpur, with Trump seeking to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker. 

Yet his way of pursuing deals has meant serious disruptions at home and abroad. His import taxes have scrambled relationships with trading partners while a U.S. government shutdown has him feuding with Democrats.

At the summit, Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement during a ceremony attended by Trump. His threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year. 

Thailand will release Cambodian prisoners and Cambodia will begin withdrawing heavy artillery as part of the first phase of the deal. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart.

“We did something that a lot of people said couldn't be done,” Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a “historic day,” and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates “the building blocks for a lasting peace.”

The president signed economic frameworks with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The United States wants to rely less on China, which has used limited on exports of key components in technology manufacturing as a bargaining chip in trade talks. 

“It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said.

Trump attended this summit only once during his first term, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January. 

This year's event was a chance for Trump to reengage with nations that have a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people. 

“The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,” Trump said. He described his counterparts as “spectacular leaders” and said that “everything you touch turns to gold.”

Trump's tariff threats were credited with helping spur negotiations Thailand and Cambodia. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people.

The president threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped. A shaky truce has persisted since then.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, saying at the summit that “it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.”

Trump met Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Kuala Lumpur, who was also attending the summit. There has been friction between them over Brazil's prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, the country's former president and a close Trump ally. Bolsonaro was convicted last month of attempting to overturn election results in his country.

During their meeting, Trump said he could reduce tariffs on Brazil that he enacted in a push for leniency for Bolsonaro.

“I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,” he said. 

While Trump was warming to Lula, he avoided Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The president is angry with Canada because of a television advertisement protesting his trade policies, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would raise tariffs on Canada because of it.

One leader absent from the summit was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during Trump's first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — On the northern bank of Argentina's Riachuelo River, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since libertarian President Javier Milei scrapped import restrictions.

Streets in the Puerto Madero financial district in Buenos Aires bustle with bankers who praise Milei for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve sushi and steak to Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.

On the opposite side of the polluted Riachuelo waterway, Veronica Leguizamon, 34, has only a few eggs, a carton of milk and a handful of bread rolls left in her pantry.

Clutching a Tupperware container, she braved heavy rain last Friday to carry home dinner for her four daughters from a soup kitchen in her neighborhood of Isla Maciel — a daily routine since Milei slashed subsidies for public services and unwound price controls on staple foods.

“It's not like we used to have so many luxuries, but before we could choose a meal,” she said. “Now we have to depend on others to know if we'll eat or not.” 

The contrasting fortunes of these Buenos Aires neighborhoods just over a kilometer apart illustrate the tensions polarizing the Argentine electorate in Sunday's nationwide congressional midterms.

As millions of voters headed to the polls Sunday, their vastly different perceptions of the economy stand to determine whether Milei succeeds — and whether the Trump administration presses on with a financial rescue plan for its cash-strapped ideological ally. 

“Within my little circle, everyone's happy with how things are going,” said Fernanda Díaz, 42, who runs a yacht rental company in Puerto Madero. “When I step outside it, I see people worried about making it to the end of the month.” 

Commenting on the midterm elections, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to rescind a $20 billion aid package for Argentina if Milei suffers a defeat at the hands of a “socialist or communist.”

Trump was apparently referring to Argentina's loosely populist movement known as Peronism that helped deliver the economic shambles that Milei inherited in late 2023. 

Reckless public spending under a succession of Peronist governments — including that of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, now serving house arrest for corruption — brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults.

“We needed a major change,” said Díaz, who, before launching her yacht business, lost her job as a top executive when Chilean retail group Falabella shut down its Argentine operations over high inflation, import restrictions and a wildly oscillating exchange rate under the previous Peronist government. “I voted for Milei's government and was really enthusiastic at first.”

Markets shudder at the thought of a Peronist return.

When the Peronist coalition beat Milei's libertarian party by a landslide in last month's Buenos Aires provincial elections, investors panicked that the president's free-market overhaul was losing support and rushed to pull capital out of the country. 

In an extremely rare move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue — selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks, signing a $20 billion credit line and promising another $20 billion in aid from private banks, rather than U.S. taxpayers. Assets jumped on each of the Trump administration's announcements. 

Having dodged a currency crisis, Milei and his supporters were, briefly, ebullient. 

“I'm proud of the U.S. support. It helps us grow stronger,” said Luciano Naredo, 28, a high-end car salesperson in Puerto Madero. “I think Argentina is finally taking its rightful place in the world.”

But Trump's warning that the U.S. could pull assistance unnerved markets. Investors are hedging against more turbulence.

Although Isla Maciel has long been a Peronist stronghold, 42% of the wider Avellaneda municipality voted for Milei as president in 2023, betting on the wild-haired political outsider to stabilize the economy and end triple-digit inflation.

Wielding a diesel-fume-spewing chain saw at rallies, Milei cut tens of thousands of government jobs, slashed state spending and burned through foreign exchange reserves to shore up a chronically depreciating peso.

Inflation dropped — in fulfillment of Milei's flagship campaign promise.

But almost two years into his economic overhaul, purchasing power has dropped, too. With inflation still hovering around 32% annually, residents of Isla Maciel have watched the value of their wages, pensions and welfare payments shrivel. 

“You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,” Epifanía Contreras, 64, said as she packed her plastic bowl with rice and peas at the Foundation of Isla Maciel soup kitchen, referring to her $200 monthly pension. “The situation is getting worse and worse. It's not fair.” 

Volunteers serving sopa paraguaya, a custardy cornbread, to a stream of regulars on Friday said demand has more than doubled in the past year. Those who once picked up occasional meals when tight on cash now turn up hungry. 

“People are coming out of real need,” said Maria Gomez, a volunteer cook. ”It's chaos.”

A third fewer residents of the Avellaneda municipality supported Milei's libertarian party in last month's provincial election than in 2023, expressing nostalgia for the redistributive policies of the opposition Peronist party despite its more recent reputation for financial ruin.

Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, said Argentina faced a “critical election in the midst of a complex economic climate” as he cast his ballot in the city of La Plata.

“Where is this resolved, or where does it begin to be resolved?” he asked of the nation's economic troubles. “At the ballot box.”

Milei has vowed in campaign speeches to press on with his harsh austerity program. But his chain saw prop, once a rally staple, hasn't been trotted out in months. 

Voting on Sunday in Buenos Aires' middle-class Almagro district with his sister under heavy security, Milei shook hands with supporters who shouted, “Go president!” and left without making statements to the press.

Most polls predict a tight race between Milei's La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances) party and the Peronist Fuerza Patria coalition. Half of Argentina's lower house, or 127 seats, and a third of the Senate, or 24 seats, are up for grabs.

Currently controlling less than 15% of Congress, Milei's government hopes to win enough seats to defend its austerity measures, uphold presidential vetoes and impose labor and tax reforms.

The stakes are high. A defeat for Milei could pile more pressure on the peso and force a painful devaluation of the currency's controlled exchange rate, raising inflation and undermining the president's main achievement. 

Weary Argentines are bracing for impact.

“Each new government comes in, criticizes the last one, promises to do things differently and ends up being the same or worse,” said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate. “This country moves in cycles.”

Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Lamar Jackson's 1-6 record against the Kansas City Chiefs, and Caleb Williams' comeback road win against the Las Vegas Raiders. 

The NFL is investigating how the Baltimore Ravens handled superstar quarterback Lamar Jackson's injury designation before Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears.

Jackson, who has been battling a hamstring injury, was expected to return to the Ravens' offense this week coming off their bye. However, the two-time league MVP was ruled out against the Bears prior to Sunday's 1 p.m. start. He was a full participant in Friday's practice, which signaled that he would play Sunday. But on Saturday, he was ruled out.

The Ravens could be subject to league discipline if they are found to have violated the league's injury report policy.

"The league will look into this," NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told ESPN on Saturday. "The league reviews any matter involving a change to a player's status."

The Ravens released their own statement on the matter, saying they contacted the league office before making the call on Jackson.

"Upon further evaluation today and after conferring with the league office, because Lamar didn't take any starter reps in practice, we updated our report to reflect his practice participation," the statement read.

ESPN added that, while Jackson was considered a full participant on Friday, he was running with the scout team while Tyler "Snoop" Huntley was running with the starting offense.

Huntley was set to start on Sunday over Cooper Rush, who was the starter for the Ravens since Jackson went down. He was, however, benched during the blowout loss to the Los Angeles Rams prior to the bye week for Huntley, as he struggled to get the offense going.

Jackson's injury couldn't come at a worse time for the Ravens, as they sit at 1-5 in what has been one of the most shocking developments for a Super Bowl hopeful this season.

It's no secret how much of a loss Jackson is due to his play-making abilities. Safety Kyle Hamilton recently gave Fox News Digital an optimistic outlook for the Ravens, who need to put together a win streak if they wish to make the playoffs. But he knows how much Jackson factors into those hopes.

"Lamar's our quarterback, and he's the guy who puts butts in seats in the stadium, sells tickets and wins games for us," Hamilton said. "Obviously, we contribute to that as well defensively and supporting guys on the offense. But, at the end of the day, [No.] 8 is what makes this thing go."

The Ravens will be forced to lean on Huntley, who is 3-7 over his career as a backup for Jackson. He has thrown an even seven touchdowns to seven interceptions over those 10 games that span five seasons.

Since 2018, the Ravens are 4-12 without Jackson at quarterback with a current six-game losing streak.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on how concerned people should be about bird flu spreading on 'Fox Report.'

A Georgia chicken producer is working to stop the spread of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), more commonly known as bird flu, after becoming the third commercial operation in the state to test positive this year.

The Gordon County producer noticed signs of illness on Wednesday and reported it to the Georgia Poultry Laboratory Network on Thursday, according to a Georgia Department of Agriculture press release.

The following day, Georgia Department of Agriculture's Emergency Management and State Agricultural Response Teams "deployed to the affected premises to conduct depopulation, disposal, cleaning, and disinfection."

The facility housed about 140,000 broiler chickens.

For at least the next two weeks, state officials say, all commercial poultry operations within a 6.2-mile radius are under quarantine and will undergo surveillance testing.

"This poses a serious threat to Georgia's #1 industry and to the thousands of Georgians whose livelihoods depend on poultry production," Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler J Harper said in a statement. "Our team is working around the clock to contain the spread and protect our flocks."

CDC DECLARES BIRD FLU EMERGENCY OVER AS EXPERTS WARN OF POSSIBLE FALL RESURGENCE

Last week, the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy Research and Innovation Office (CIDRAP) reported a commercial turkey farm in Swift County "that houses 34,000 birds is the site of the latest outbreak to hit the top turkey-producing state in the nation."

A commercial egg-layer farm in Indiana with nearly 20,000 birds also recently reported a bird flu outbreak, CIDRAP reported.

HPAI was first confirmed in a commercial flock in the U.S. on Feb. 8, 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS).

Data from the agency says over the last 30 days, 64 flocks have been confirmed infected, impacting nearly 3.5 million birds.

LONDON (AP) — London police said Sunday they arrested a convicted sex offender and asylum-seeker who was mistakenly released from prison in a blunder that has embarrassed the government.

The Metropolitan Police said Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area in north London. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would be deported as soon as possible.

Before he was released in error, Kebatu had already been in the national news because his arrest earlier this year over the sexual assault of a teenage girl triggered a wave of angry anti-migrant protests in London and other cities.

Authorities said they were alerted Friday afternoon that Kebatu was released by mistake at a prison in Chelmsford, Essex, and was seen catching a London-bound train there. British media reported that he was wrongly categorized as a prisoner due to be released, instead of being sent to an immigration detention center.

The migrant was sentenced in September to 12 months in prison for five offenses, including the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in July in Epping, on the outskirts of London, just over a week after he had arrived in England by boat.

Thousands of people protested outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, northeast of London, where he was staying along with other newly arrived migrants. Multiple protests targeting other hotels housing migrants followed in British cities and towns, with some demonstrations attended by far-right activists and spilling into disorder.




The group Stand Up to Racism also rallied in counterprotests.

The Prison Service said prison officer has been removed from discharging duties while an investigation takes place.

Government officials have described the mistaken release as an “egregious failure.” Justice Secretary David Lammy said he ordered prisoner release checks to be strengthened immediately, and an investigation will find out what went wrong and who was accountable.

“This man was behind bars because of serious sex offenses,” Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Sky News Sunday before Kebatu's arrest. “He is not meant to be in this country. In fact, what was supposed to be happening is he was meant to be transferred for deportation. So the idea that he's loose on our streets is incredibly serious. It is a serious failure.”

The issue of unauthorized migration — especially the tens of thousands of migrants crossing the English Channel in overloaded boats to reach the U.K. — has risen to the top of the political agenda in Britain. 

More than 36,900 people have made the dangerous crossing from France to the U.K. so far this year, figures show, surpassing the total number recorded in the whole of 2024. Efforts by authorities in Britain, France and other countries to crack down on people smuggling gangs or deter migrants from coming have so far been unsuccessful.

The government's policy of using hotels to house migrants who are awaiting a decision on their asylum status has also come under heavy criticism.

Canvassers in Brooklyn's Prospect Park defended Zohran Mamdani's vision for New York City in interviews with Fox News Digital on Sunday.

NEW YORK – Progressive stars Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are teaming up with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani Sunday night for a "New York is not for sale" rally at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York City.

The high-profile campaign event comes nearly one week before Election Day, as New Yorkers head to the polls for the first weekend of early voting, closing out a contentious mayoral battle where Mamdani's unanticipated success has landed him on the national stage.

"Zohran Mamdani is modeling a different kind of politics," Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate and longtime progressive leader, said in a statement ahead of the rally. 

The trio of self-identified Democratic socialists have invigorated the Democratic Party's progressive base at a time when Democrats are still grappling with devastating losses in 2024 amid growing discontent with President Donald Trump's sweeping, second-term agenda.

When Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez teamed up for the "Fighting Oligarchy" tour earlier this year, they sparked sizable buzz, firing up thousands of Democrats at rallies across the United States who had been left without a clear party leader.

"As mayor, he will not run a top-down, billionaire-funded, consultant-driven administration. Instead, Zohran will be a champion for the working people of New York," Sanders said.

Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have campaigned alongside Mamdani in his bid to lead the nation's most populous city. 

On Friday night, Sanders appeared for a virtual "Get Out the Vote" event with Mamdani. Last month, Sanders and Mamdani teamed up for a "Fighting Oligarchy" town hall in Brooklyn.

Ahead of the Brooklyn town hall event, the two progressive leaders marched alongside union members in Manhattan's Labor Day parade. That afternoon, Mamdani posed for a photo with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez in Astoria, Queens, amassing millions of views.

Sanders, a two-time Democratic presidential nominee runner-up, was an early endorser of Mamdani's primary campaign, along with Ocasio-Cortez. Their endorsements helped Mamdani consolidate progressive support in the 11-candidate field during the final weeks of the primary race.

Mamdani's primary upset triggered a political earthquake as the democratic socialist handily defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was widely expected to secure the Democratic nomination.

Mamdani's cross-endorsement with fellow progressive New York City Comptroller Brad Lander cleared the path for Mamdani to consolidate support against Cuomo through ranked-choice voting.

Cuomo has since launched an independent campaign, teeing up a competitive and contentious general election battle. 

Since Mamdani secured the Democratic nomination, Trump has labeled him a "100% Communist Lunatic," and "my little communist," ushering Mamdani onto the national political stage. Mamdani has rejected the moniker, maintaining that he identifies as a democratic socialist, like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. 

As Trump began criticizing Mamdani, New York Democrats chose to withhold their endorsements of the socialist candidate, who has made a slew of ambitious campaign promises, like fast and free buses, city-run grocery stores and free child care, all of which he plans to pay for by raising taxes on corporations and the top 1% of New Yorkers. 

After months of withholding their endorsements, Gov. Kathy Hochul finally endorsed Mamdani last month and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries finally affirmed his support in a statement Friday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has still yet to endorse.

Pressure had been mounting since Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June for Mayor Eric Adams, who was also running as an independent, or Cuomo to drop out of the race to consolidate support against Mamdani. Adams dropped out and endorsed Cuomo on Thursday. 

That pressure reached a boiling point last week as billionaires, including Red Apple Media CEO John Catsimatidis and hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman, called on Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to drop out of the race in order to clear a pathway to victory for Cuomo.

The latest Fox News survey, conducted Oct. 10-14, ahead of the first general election debate last week, revealed that Mamdani has a substantial lead in the race. According to the poll, Mamdani has a 21-point lead among New York City registered voters with 49% of voters backing Mamdani, while 28% go for Cuomo and 13% favor Sliwa.

Mamdani also rose above the 50% threshold among likely voters, garnering 52% support, while Cuomo picked up 28%, and Sliwa received just 14%.

Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports the latest on the investigation into the Louvre heist.

Multiple suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris last weekend, French officials said Sunday.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, including one man who was taken into custody as he was about to leave the country from Charles de Gaulle airport.

Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests, though French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and taken into custody. She did not say whether the jewels had been recovered.

Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at 88 million euros ($102 million) — a high-profile heist that sparked a national reckoning and stunned the world.

The crew of thieves used a basket lift to scale the Louvre's façade, forced open a window, smashed display cases and fled, according to French officials. The Louvre's director Laurence des Cars acknowledged there was a "terrible failure" in the museum's security.

Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. She said the premature leak of information could hinder the work of over 100 investigators "mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators." 

Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends.

The thieves slipped away with a total of eight objects, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense. They also stole an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife, and a reliquary brooch. Empress Eugénie's diamond diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch — an imperial ensemble of rare craftsmanship — were also part of the loot.

Eugénie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable.

            British police have arrested an asylum-seeker who was mistakenly released from prison on Friday while serving a 12-month sentence for sexual assault following a “fast-moving and complex” manhunt.
    


            Ethiopian national Hadush Kebatu was jailed in September for the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl while staying at the Bell Hotel in Epping, England – a hotel just outside of London used by the government to help house asylum seekers.
    


            “Hadush Kebatu, who was released in error from HMP Chelmsford on Friday morning, has been arrested,” London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement Sunday.
    


            He was arrested by officers in the Finsbury Park area of London at around 8:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET), police said.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that Kebatu will be deported from the UK following his arrest and vowed to make sure “this doesn't happen again.”
    


How British hotels became a flashpoint for a furious immigration debate



            Kebatu's case fuelled a wave of anti-migrant demonstrations across the country in August, with some holding protests outside the Bell Hotel – fueled by those on the far-right – which turned violent.
    


            On Friday, Essex Police said it was informed by the UK's prison service at 12:57 p.m. local time (7:57 a.m. ET) of an “error” surrounding the release of an individual.
    


            Police quickly launched a manhunt for Kebatu, with British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy also announcing an “urgent investigation” into the mistaken release.

            On a balmy summer evening, I approached a brownstone apartment in a leafy Chicago suburb and made a split-second decision that would change the direction of my life.
    


            At the time I was a 20-year-old college sophomore, bursting with the zeal of a new Christian convert. I was carrying a thick leather Bible filled with underlined passages celebrating God's love for all humanity. I had memorized a New Testament passage, which declared, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave or free, male nor female — for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”
    


            I was there because I heard an evangelical church hosted a home Bible study every Wednesday night and, being new in town, I wanted to make friends.
    


            Then I peeked in the apartment's front bay window and saw something that made my heart sink. My finger froze over the doorbell, and I started to edge away from the door.
    


            “Damn,” I muttered to myself as I spied a group of casually dressed people sitting in the living room, chatting amiably with Bibles resting on their laps. “Nothing but White people.”
    


            I had never been in the home of a White person before. I had grown up in an inner-city Baltimore neighborhood where seeing White people was like spotting Bigfoot. My mother was White, but I had no contact with her family and had only recently met her for the first time. Her relatives shunned me because my father was Black, and they thought people of different races should stay apart. I dreaded being the only Black guy in the room and assumed that the White people inside would not make me feel welcome.
    


            But I also hated the thought of allowing fear to control me, so I rang the doorbell. A skinny, young White man with thinning blonde hair and a droopy mustache answered the door with a bright smile and a hearty “Welcome.” I walked inside and I found salvation — not in a deity or a biblical doctrine but in something else: an unexpected friendship.
    


            That story, which took place in the late 1980s, may sound like it comes from a bygone era. And in many ways, it does. Many Americans no longer see church as a place for healing. They see churches as places that hurt people by demonizing outsiders and covering up abuse. And, fair or not, White evangelical Christians are viewed by many as the group that inflicts the most pain.
    


            For many non-White Americans, immigrants and LGTBQ people, the term “White evangelical Christian” has become a synonym for intolerance. Many White evangelicals are hostile to non-White immigration and belong to denominations that condemn homosexuality. About 81% of White evangelicals voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They are also among the most ardent supporters of White Christian nationalism, a false teaching that claims the US was explicitly founded as a Christian nation.
    


            For more than 20 years as a journalist, I've written my share of critical stories about White evangelicals. But I told those stories while harboring a secret of sorts: White evangelicals helped save me and my family — not in a religious sense, but in ways I'm still digesting more than three decades after it happened.
    


            The young man who opened the door to the Chicago brownstone was the first person to show me that other side of White evangelicals. His name was Paul, and he was an illustrator from a small Midwestern town I've long forgotten. When we met I was attending Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, D.C., and was in Chicago for a summer internship.
    


            I probably would have never met him in another walk of life. But we hit it off quickly. We shared a love of comic books, and we were the same age, unlike many of the older people in the Bible study. Paul exuded gentleness and an approachability that I liked. He was not what I expected.
    


            Of course, he tried to convert me. He belonged to an evangelical movement which believed that all other Christian denominations and other religions were illegitimate. Evangelicals are loosely defined as Christians who often share a “born-again” personal conversion, believe they're supposed to spread their faith to others and take the Bible either literally or seriously.
    


            I never accepted Paul's narrow definition of faith, and he didn't push it hard. I sometimes even wonder if he believed it. It was what happened after Bible study that converted me.
    


            I was at an anxious time in my life. I had massive insecurities because I had grown up poor and spent much of my time in foster homes. Many of my childhood friends were headed to prison or strung out on drugs. I struggled to believe I had a future.
    


            Paul had this uncanny ability to sense my moods, and after Bible study he'd linger to chat. We talked about our hopes, our girlfriends and our anxieties over having a career. Our conversations would often end with Paul clasping my brown hands with his pale, freckled hands and saying, “Let's pray about it, brother.”
    


            This was a strange new world for me. I never expected I would express my vulnerability to a White man and hold his hands in prayer. But when I heard Paul pray aloud, asking God to guide me, I could tell he cared about me.
    


            Over time, I stopped seeing him as a racial category. He became simply Paul, my friend, the guy I hung out with. I soon joined his church and during worship, I'd see White, Black and brown church members hug, hang out after service, and date.
    


            I experienced something that summer that I still struggle to put into words. Paul was the first person to show me how good it felt to be proven wrong — to discover your assumptions about someone you've prejudged were baseless. I remember these lyrical moments in and outside of church settings, when I was singing hymns, praying and laughing with White evangelicals, that I felt a strange physical sensation. A tiny, warm glow would well up in my heart and spread through my body. It was that electric moment of human connection when you discover that someone you once saw as an enemy is now becoming your friend.
    


            I continued to experience those sensations in subsequent years as my career took me around the country. In Washington, Los Angeles and Atlanta, I made it a point to only join multiracial congregations. I befriended more White evangelicals who defied expectation. One was Peter, a computer nerd, who refused to move his wife and young daughter out of his Atlanta neighborhood though it had gone from White to virtually all-Black. He thought racial prejudice was a sin and that abandoning his new neighbors would betray his faith.
    


            Another friend was an evangelical pastor who grew up in the Jim Crow South believing that Black people were subhuman. But he was converted — by Black people. He joined a church ministry after high school that assigned him and a childhood buddy to an anti-poverty program in Harlem. There, he made friends with Black people for the first time.
    


            He eventually founded a multicultural church where White and non-White members not only shared pews, but the power to make decisions about the church's direction.
    


            My friend told me what changed him and his friend in Harlem were not deep conversations with Black people about politics or faith. Instead it was mundane activities, such as sharing meals.
    


            “That changed everything,” he told me. “It was just our daily life with African American people. They acted like regular people, which was shocking at first. That was the place where I crossed over.”
    


            These weren't “Kumbaya” relationships — we often disagreed, sometimes loudly, over politics and theology. But our friendships endured. And these friends didn't just change me; we changed one another.
    


            And then something else happened that I never expected: I was swept up in a religious movement that gave me even more hope.
    


            It was called the “racial reconciliation movement,” and it spread throughout the White evangelical community in the 1990s. I joined evangelical churches that participated in this movement during much of my young adulthood, and I attended rallies arranged by the “Promise Keepers,” an evangelical men's movement designed to foster racial healing.
    


            I still remember standing in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta next to weeping White men as they raised their hands together with Black and brown men and sang and prayed. And I remember watching in awe as C-Span televised images of at least 600,000 evangelical men filling the Washington Mall in 1997 for the “Stand in the Gap” rally.
    


            I was a religion reporter in 1995 when I watched the nation's largest evangelical denomination — the Southern Baptist Convention, which was formed in the mid-19th century to defend slavery — publicly apologize for its historic defense of slavery and racial segregation.
    


            These were mountaintop moments. It seemed like the nation was finally shedding its original sin, racism. We were living up to our national creed, “Out of Many, One.” We were becoming the mythical America that the poet Langston Hughes described as “the land that never has been yet - And yet must be.”
    


            Joining the racial reconciliation movement helped prepare me for something even more dramatic: Not long after, the White relatives who had rejected me at birth began to contact me.  What followed were years of confrontations and anger. My White relatives were capable of acts of raw racism. But by now I had practice reaching across racial divides, and we somehow found a way to become a genuine family.
    


            How that happened is complex, but it culminated with my maternal grandfather — the same man who refused to contact me when I was a child and referred to my father as “that n*gger”— apologizing to me for his racism in an astonishing act of repentance that still boggles my mind. And my mother's sister — a person who once believed interracial marriage was bad for both White and Black people and who voted for President Trump — ended up supporting Black Lives Matter.
    


            What made this family reconnection possible? There were many reasons, but Paul, the skinny illustrator I met in Chicago, played a pivotal role. Through those Bible studies and other experiences with White evangelicals, I had acquired the patience and the spiritual tools I needed to forge bonds with people who were different.
    


            My White relatives were, despite their blind spot on race, devout Roman Catholics. We shared the same language of grace and quoted the same scripture about forgiveness: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Our mutual faith became a bridge to one another, not a barrier.
    


            Only now do I realize there was another vital factor that led to my conversion on both race and faith. And it had nothing to do with religion. It's called a “third space.”



            A third space is a location where people spend time together in community away from their first and second places: home and work. The term was coined by the late sociologist Ray Oldenburg to describe those areas where we forge relationships with people unlike ourselves.
    


            My third space was a church, but the same dynamics could happen in a mosque, synagogue or in other third-space communities, such as a 12-step program, a jazz band or a softball league.
    


            Third spaces furnish the connective tissue that hold a multifaith and multiethnic democracy together, Oldenburg said.
    


            “There must be places in which people can find and sort one another out across the barriers of social difference,” he said. “There must be places akin to the colonial tavern visited by Alexander Hamilton, which offered, as he recorded, ‘a genuine social solvent with a very mixed company of different nations and religions.'”
    


            But third spaces, like the colonial tavern, are disappearing from America. Churches are emptying out across the country, despite an uptick in membership in recent years.  On Sunday mornings I often drive by grand churches with nearly empty parking lots. My congregation is full of gray-haired members (including me), and I want to do a cartwheel whenever I see a young person visit.
    


            This retreat from church mirrors a larger retrenching. Americans are isolating themselves into digital cocoons. Participation in civic groups has plummeted; movie theaters are closing; people increasingly shop online instead of going to stores. Many of us interact more with smartphones and social media than we do with other human beings.
    


            When I walk through my neighborhood at night I see deserted streets, empty front porches and blue glows from televisions flickering on bedroom walls. We can now curate our daily lives like our streaming video queues — we only expose ourselves to ideas and people we're comfortable with.
    


            Something else is disappearing: the hopefulness I felt in many of the White evangelical churches I attended as a young man. The racial reconciliation movement has been obliterated. Promise Keepers collapsed and has been rebooted as a partisan battering ram. Many non-White people abandoned White evangelical churches after the George Floyd racial reckoning.
    


            The most toxic phrase one can use today when talking about racial justice is not critical race theory, DEI or reparations. Its “racial reconciliation” — a term dismissed by both the left and the right as an absurd fantasy. I once had a White editor tell me after reading an essay I wrote about reconnecting with my White relatives, “This story isn't angry enough.”
    


            The reasons behind why so many White evangelicals abandoned racial reconciliation is complex, but my quick take is this: Some were terrified of becoming a racial and a religious minority in a rapidly changing nation, so they acted out of fear instead of faith.
    


            I've seen this shift up close. When Black membership at a White evangelical church I attended in Atlanta passed the 50% threshold, White members fled the church so quickly that they practically left skid marks in the pews. The church became all-Black within about five years, save for the White senior pastor and his family.
    


            This shift has forced me to ask a painful question: Was I a fool for trusting White evangelicals? Did all the public prayers, the bro-hugs and the hymns we sang together mean nothing? Do most evangelicals worship Whiteness instead of Jesus?
    


            Did I walk through a door in Chicago that summer that's now closed?
    


            I'd ask Paul these questions today if I could find him. The evangelical church in Chicago I joined is still going strong. I recently checked its website, and its membership and leadership appear even more diverse today. But I lost contact with Paul after we both graduated from college. It took me years to appreciate his friendship and what it did for me, and I didn't have the words to tell him that at the time. I didn't even bother to get his last name.
    


            I sometimes wonder where Paul is now. Is he still opening doors to the stranger?
    


            I'm also left with some other difficult questions. Will I ever experience the “warm, tiny glow” I first felt in that Chicago Bible study and at those Promise Keepers rallies? Will I ever feel that hopeful again?
    


            And as I read today's headlines, which warn of a potential civil war as American soldiers and masked ICE officers sweep through American cities, I also wonder this:

ROME (AP) — The man who just took charge of Rome's top tourist attraction wants to set the record straight: the Colosseum won't be hosting any electronic dance music parties on his watch.

Simone Quilici, director of the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, shared his plan to bring concerts to the almost 2,000-year-old amphitheater in an interview with an Italian newspaper earlier this month, and social media proceeded to do what it all too often does. “Massive raves” were imminent, multiple accounts trumpeted alongside AI-generated images of multicolor light beams shooting from the arena into the heavens.

Quilici told The Associated Press that he heard complaints from archaeologists and ordinary Romans, dismayed their cultural heritage could be so desecrated. Even electronic music fans expressed concern online about the damage a whomping bass beat would inflict on an ancient structure that continues yielding new wonders, like the emperor's secret passage that opens on Oct. 27.

Concerts must respect the Colosseum as a “sacred space,” Quilici said, as it is integral to Roman identity and has become imbued with religious significance. Today, it is the site of the Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession during Easter, traditionally presided over by the pope.

“The music must be carefully controlled. I mentioned certain artists — not by accident — who haven't been ‘rock' for some time, who play calm music and attract a calm audience, because the important thing is that it's not a wild crowd,” Quilici, 55, said Friday in his first interview with foreign media since taking over on Oct. 20. “I joked about rock in moderation — that's what I meant, a more subdued kind of music. But it was reported the opposite of what I said.”

Concerts could be acoustic or jazz, he said, offering Sting as an example. The amphitheater could host poetry readings, dance performances and theater productions once the existing small platform is expanded. Also in the plans: historical reenactments of gladiatorial battles rooted in academic research.

“There are people who are extremely knowledgeable about daily life in past eras, with a remarkable level of scientific accuracy. So these activities are very welcome within the Colosseum park,” Quilici said. He stressed such presentations would be the antithesis of the shabbily costumed centurions who besiege the Colosseum by night, posing for photos with tourists and then harassing them for payment.

The Colosseum's first concerts and performances will take place in no less than two years, he added. 

Only a handful of concerts have taken place within the Colosseum over the years, including Ray Charles in 2002, Paul McCartney in 2003 and Andrea Bocelli in 2009. All were billed as special events and audience numbers were severely restricted.

“Unfortunately, as everyone knows, tourism is a commercial activity — an industry that does not always connect with culture,” he said on the Colosseum's uppermost balcony. “Bringing cultural activities into the mix would enrich this place, making it not only a site to visit, but also a place where one can experience and enjoy artistic events.”

Peering down into the arena's ruins from high above, the bustle of tourists brings to mind the cross-section of an anthill. The Colosseum had almost 9 million visitors last year, up from 7 million the year before, according to data provided by the park. 

Even in October, well outside the high tourist season of summer, the place was packed. 

That's partly due to the Vatican's Jubilee year, held once every quarter-century, which continues to draw large tour groups of pilgrims. It's also because the Colosseum is one of just two must-see spots for short-staying tourists, along with Vatican City, and “already is at maximum capacity,” Quilici said.

Therein lies the other great ambition for his tenure: inducing tourists to go elsewhere. 

The park he oversees includes not just the Colosseum, but also other sites directly adjacent like the Roman Forum, which was the heart of the ancient city's society, and Palatine Hill, where Rome was founded and the emperor's palace is located.

Tickets lasting 24 hours include all three destinations. Still, one-third of buyers visit only the Colosseum, according to park data. If Rome's an open-air museum, as is often said, that's like catching a glimpse of Leonardo da Vinci's “Mona Lisa” through the crowd at the Louvre, then leaving without even looking at the other masterpieces in the room.

“Last year, tourists in Rome didn't stay just two and a half days; their visits increased to four days. So there's also the opportunity to use the Colosseum as a starting point for exploring less-visited places,” he said.

Likewise, relatively few visitors go to the nearby Circus Maximus, the sprawling grounds of Rome's high-adrenaline chariot races, depicted in the 1959 film “Ben-Hur.” The Appian Way, known as “the queen of roads,” goes even more overlooked, despite becoming a UNESCO world heritage site last year. Its giant paving stones provide passage into a golden countryside that evokes long-gone centuries and provides welcome respite from Rome's tourist-thronged center. 

Both the Circus Maximus and the Appian Park, which Quilici administered before the Colosseum, are free to visit. 

All these sites and more are near to one another, though somewhat disjointed – archaeological islands mostly separated by busy roads. Quilici hopes to create new access points to his park as well as connections with others to better manage the crowds and establish one consolidated area for exploration and discovery. 

“It's a collective effort, one that requires cooperation from all the different administrations,” he said. “However, it's more a matter of management than of infrastructure costs. Choices that sometimes can be simple decisions like limiting traffic — not necessarily involving major expenses, but rather a courageous choice to restore life to the heart of the city of Rome.”

The Permitting Council is pressing ahead with President Donald Trump‘s priority of expediting key infrastructure projects, such as mining, despite the government shutdown. 

The government shutdown is in its fourth week, leaving many federal agencies with furloughed employees. However, the Permitting Council, a federal agency responsible for guiding essential infrastructure projects through the permitting process, continues its efforts to advance them.

Emily Domenech, executive director of the Permitting Council, told the Washington Examiner, “We're still coming to work and making sure things are getting built, and we have the results to show that this is a worthwhile endeavor.” 

The council oversees the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41) program, which supports the permitting process for infrastructure projects within several economic sectors, including transportation, semiconductors, and renewable energy.

The Trump administration has used the program to help mining projects obtain permits, strengthening the domestic supply of critical minerals and rare earths needed for sectors such as defense and energy. 

Since the shutdown, Domenech noted that some projects have completed their processes, including the Caldwell Canyon Mine Project in Idaho, which will mine phosphate.

She added that three new mineral projects have been added to the council's FAST-41 in the past month, including the Burnt Rock Exploration Project in Nevada and the Copper Creek Exploration Project in Arizona. The first two projects were added to the council's Transparency Dashboard, allowing the public and private sectors to monitor progress, but without access to the full benefits of the program.

Additionally, the council added the Kilbourne Graphite Project in New York to the list of covered projects that receive the full benefits of the council.

“We did not slow down at all,” Domenech said. “We really did work with the [Office of Budget and Management] and the White House ahead of time to say, ‘hey, look, we're going to prioritize moving projects that are in the President's priority sectors.'”

She added, “So we're continuing to work on those projects regardless of what Congress decides to do this week.”

Most of the council's activities are funded through the Environmental Review Improvement Fund, which supports federal environmental review processes for various projects.

As part of the fund, the council has transfer authority, allowing it to move funding to other federal agencies to assist with permitting. Domenech said, for example, that the council helped fund staff who worked on mining projects in the Department of Agriculture because it did not have a large, robust staff. 

“We have the ability to transfer our funding that keeps us open during the shutdown to these other federal agencies as needed, if it's required, to bring folks back from furlough,” Domenech said. 

Domenech said the council has brought back about a dozen of its own employees from furlough. However, more than three dozen employees at other agencies have returned to work as a result of the council emphasizing their key role in the permitting process.

A private sector adviser engaged in the critical mineral sector told the Washington Examiner, “From where I stand, the government shutdown hasn't materially affected the federal government's critical mineral development activities.”

They added, “The critical mineral portfolio cuts across multiple departments and, of course, the White House, and the senior-level officials driving it are all ‘essential employees.'”

The Trump administration has leaned on the FAST-41 program, which began during former President Barack Obama's second term, to help streamline the permitting process for critical infrastructure projects. During the Biden administration, only one mining project was on the program's dashboard. The council now manages 47 mining projects. 

EPA TO UNVEIL NEW CYBERSECURITY TOOLS TO PROTECT US WATER SYSTEMS

The Trump administration has made it a priority to bolster the domestic supply of critical minerals and rare earths to reduce the United States's reliance on China, which controls the majority of the supply chain. 

“We are looking to focus on sectors that were either sort of been under assault by the previous administrations … or were forgotten,” Domenech said. “I think the mining sector really is that forgotten sector that did not get attention from previous administrations, even when maybe it should have.”

Fox News medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the remarkable recovery of a Minneapolis church shooting victim and previews his new book, ‘The Miracles Among Us,' on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.'

One person is dead and multiple others are injured after a gunman opened fire at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania during the college's homecoming weekend, according to officials.

The university's police chief, Marc Partee, confirmed at a news conference that one person was killed in the shooting, and six others were wounded and taken to a hospital.

One suspect was taken into custody, according to police.

"Law enforcement has responded to the scene and are actively investigating," the Chester County District Attorney's Office wrote in a statement. "Please avoid the area at this time."

Lincoln University is a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and is located about 45 miles southwest of Philadelphia and about 25 miles west of Wilmington, Delaware.

This weekend marked the school's homecoming festivities, with the main football game taking place at 1 p.m. Saturday.

"I've been briefed on the shooting at Lincoln University tonight, and my Administration has offered our full support to President Allen and local law enforcement," Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wrote on social media.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett said Sunday he, too, has "felt pain" from China refusing to buy U.S.-grown soybeans during a trade conflict with President Donald Trump because "I'm actually a soybean farmer."

Bessent's comment came during an interview with ABC News' "This Week," where he said that trade negotiations with China in the past two days had led to a "substantial framework" that he believed would alleviate American soybean farmers' concerns about the boycott.

Trump is set to meet later this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

Bessent, a former hedge fund executive whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be around $600 million, was asked about the soybean boycotts on "This Week" host Martha Raddatz, who noted that "American farmers have really suffered."

China in 2023 and 2024 bought more than half of the soybeans grown in the U.S., accounting for nearly $12.8 billion in 2024.

But after Trump ignited a trade war with Beijing earlier this year, China stopped buying soybeans.

"Do you see a real light at the end of the tunnel there, they may allow soybeans again?" Raddetz asked.

Bessent replied, "Martha, in case you don't know it, I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain, too."

Bessent's government financial disclosure shows that he owns soybean and corn farmland in North Dakota that has an estimated worth of between $5 million and $25 million.

On that disclosure, Bessent said the farmland generates between $100,000 and $1 million in rental income for him annually.

The Treasury secretary told Raddatz on Sunday, "I think think we have addressed the farmer's concerns, and I'm not going to get ahead of the president, but I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public, that our soybean farmers will feel very good about what's going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years."

With only two points separating Spain's football giants after nine games in La Liga, the first El Clásico of the season gives both a chance to assert their dominance. To help you see who comes out on top, we've compiled this guide on where to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, no matter where you are this weekend.

Thankfully for any soccer fan who hates to see one team in a country dominate, you never quite know what way the topsy-turvy Real Madrid vs. Barcelona rivalry will turn next. Barcelona currently hold the bragging rights in Spain, having done the double over their fierce rivals on the way to taking back the La Liga crown last season and beating them 3-2 in a memorable Copa del Rey final.

But it's Xabi Alonso's side who have started fastest this time around, with talismanic striker Kylian Mbappé already notching up 10 league goals. They recovered from a thumping 5-2 loss across the capital to Atlético to overcome Villarreal and Getafe domestically. And now it seems even Jude Bellingham has got his mojo back, with his lone goal inspiring Los Blancos to a win over Juventus in the Champions League during the week.

It may still be early in the season, but Hansi Flick will know that a win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to leapfrog Real will be a massive psychological boost to Robert Lewandowski, Ferran Torres, and co. To see if the champions can pull it off, follow the information below to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona live streams in the US, UK, Spain, or anywhere else you happen to be in the world this Sunday.

US: ESPN2

Spain: 

Access streaming anywhere:

Keen watchers of La Liga in the US have options when it comes to where to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona on Sunday, with ESPN2 the main linear channel carrying El Clásico. If you don't already have access to ESPN channels, then a subscription to the ESPN streaming service is an affordable choice. Its entry-level ESPN Select tier (formerly ESPN Plus) costs $13 a month on a rolling basis and will let you watch the game on a wide variety of devices.


                      ESPN Select, formerly ESPN Plus, offers select coverage from ESPN properties. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year.
                    

If sports are your thing, then you could also consider going for a more comprehensive ESPN Unlimited plan instead. From $30 a month, it includes everything that the various ESPN channels have to offer, so that means action from the NFL, NBA, and WWE in addition to Spain's best soccer. And, for a limited time, you can save 40% when you bundle with Disney Plus and Hulu.


                      ESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.
                    

DirecTV MySports also offers an array of premium sports channels. The month-to-month provider offers CNN, FS1/FS2, NBA TV, NFL Network, Golf Channel, and TNT alongside ESPN Unlimited, all for $70 a month, with a $10 discount off your first two months. MySports comes with a five-day free trial for first-time customers.


                      DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. 
                    

Fubo Sports is another sports-focused cable replacement product featuring ESPN Unlimited alongside 29 channels. Not sure if Fubo is for you? Try before you buy with its 5-day free trial. It costs $56 a month, but you can get $10 off your first month.


                      The new Fubo Sports + News pack is only available in select areas. It combines 20+ major sports channels (including the new ESPN Unlimited) and select local networks (ABC, CBS, and FOX).
                    

Premier Sports has the exclusive rights to show 2025/26 La Liga matches — including this Real Madrid vs. Barcelona encounter — in the UK on TV and online. It will air on the network's Premier Sports 1 channel. Premier Sports costs £17 a month on a rolling basis, with annual subscriptions costing £120 upfront or £12 a month. If you already have a pay-TV plan from any of the following providers, you can choose to add Premier Sports through those: Sky TV, Virgin Media, and Amazon Prime Video.

In Spain, you have the choice of where to stream this Real Madrid vs. Barcelona match in La Liga. Firstly there's Movistar's La Liga plan that costs €35 a month and includes live action from the country's top two tiers. While certain DAZN plans will also give you access to El Clasico. The most affordable is DAZN Fútbol that currently costs just €10 a month thanks to a special limited-time offer.

Considering the size and status of La Liga and its big two teams, Spanish football is now shown in many countries worldwide. But you may find yourself in a country this weekend that doesn't broadcast it. Or perhaps you already pay for a subscription service that would normally show Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, but it's blocked because you've traveled overseas. Both are frustrating scenarios that can be alleviated by using a VPN, or virtual private network.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he had a positive meeting on Sunday with U.S. President Donald Trump, and their respective teams will start "immediately" to discuss tariffs and other matters.

Trump and Lula spoke on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in a meeting to overcome tensions between Brazil and the United States after Trump increased tariffs on U.S. imports of most Brazilian goods to 50% from 10% in August.

"We agreed that our teams will meet immediately to advance the search for solutions to the tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian authorities," Lula said in a social media post following the meeting. 

Trump had linked the tariff move to what he called a "witch hunt" against Jair Bolsonaro, the South American country's former president. The U.S. government also put sanctions on a number of Brazilian officials, including Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the trial that led to Bolsonaro's conviction for attempting a coup.

Ahead of the meeting on Sunday, though, Trump said he could reach some agreements with Lula.

"I think we should be able to make some pretty good deals for both countries," Trump said.

Lula previously described the tariff hike as a "mistake," citing a $410 billion U.S. trade surplus with Brazil over 15 years.

Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said negotiations will start immediately to work on solutions and a meeting with the U.S. delegation was planned for Sunday.

"We will establish a negotiation schedule and establish the sectors we will talk about so that we can move forward," Vieira told journalists at the summit, adding that Brazil had requested that tariffs be suspended during the negotiation process.

It was not immediately clear if the United States agreed to the request.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were present at the meeting, Vieira said.

"We hope to conclude bilateral negotiations that address each of the sectors of the current American (tariffs on) Brazil in the near future, in a few weeks," Vieira added.

Bolsonaro was not mentioned in the meeting, said Marcio Rosa, the executive secretary for Brazil's ministry of development, industry and commerce, who stood next to Vieira. Higher U.S. tariffs on Brazilian goods have begun reshaping the global beef trade, pushing up prices in the United States and encouraging triangulation via third countries such as Mexico, while Brazilian exports to its biggest beef market, China, are booming.

Brazilian beef industry group Abiec said it viewed the meeting between the two leaders as a positive step.

"The understanding between the two countries can preserve the competitiveness of the Brazilian product, guarantee predictability for exporters and expand the presence of (Brazilian) beef in the North American market," it said in a statement.

Globally, Brazil's total beef exports, including fresh and processed meat, edible offal and tallow, generated $1.92 billion in revenue in September, with volumes reaching 373,867 metric tons, up 49% in value and 17% in volume year-on-year.

Brazilian coffee industry group ABIC said it was confident in the historic partnership between the two countries. Brazil is the world's top coffee producer and exporter, while the United States is the biggest importer.

"The recent meetings between the presidents of the United States and Brazil have been more positive, and at ABIC we are optimistic," ABIC president Pavel Cardoso said in a statement.

In this article

FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines started pouring customers Champagne Bollinger in its top-tier lounges and cabins this fall. But at headquarters, it's not time to celebrate — yet.

American has fallen behind large rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in the post-Covid luxury travel boom that has taken Seoul spa vacations and 40th birthday bashes abroad out of the chat and armed millions of consumers with high-end rewards credit cards.

In the first nine months of this year, Delta made $3.8 billion and United made $2.3 billion. American made $12 million. That means that American, which offers more flights than any other airline, according to OAG, accounted for just 2% of the profit the biggest three U.S. carriers generated so far in 2025.

American ranked last in a J.D. Power's North American airline customer satisfaction ranking this year. The carrier has also been working to undo damage from a failed business-travel sales strategy.

And American, which branded itself the "on-time machine" in the 1980s, in the first half of this year ranked ninth out of 10 airlines for on-time arrivals, according to the Department of Transportation.

The airline is trying to change all of that and uplift its brand after strategy errors, some skittishness about spending, and at times being late to capitalize on industry trends, like travelers' willingness to pay up to sit in bigger seats, according to current and former executives and industry watchers.

To make that happen, CEO Robert Isom will have to rally American's more than 130,000 employees around the airline's plans and win over both customers and investors. American's stock is down 20% this year through Friday's close, compared with modest gains posted by Delta and United.

Last week, however, some investors noticed a change within American, whose fourth-quarter profit forecast surpassed Wall Street analysts' expectations. Shares rose more than 16%, their biggest weekly percentage gain in almost a year.

"You're going to have a three-month period where you have to be crystal clear on your story," said Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham, referring to the airline's leaders.

The bigger changes are going to take time and money.

"American hasn't been paying attention to the customer for the longest time," said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group travel consulting firm. "I believe there is the beginning of a meaningful turnaround … but a large airline like American is not going to be turned around overnight."

American has tasked Heather Garboden — who has worked for more than two decades at American and US Airways, including roles in the cargo and finance departments, and now is chief customer officer — with leading a lot of a nose-to-tail revamp of the nearly century-old airline.

"Fifteen years ago, I don't think in the industry, there was much of a belief that customer experience … really drove a differentiation between airlines. I think everyone felt it was price and schedule, and that's it," she said in an interview. "That has changed, and we understand that."

American fell behind with both retailing fares and technology compared with large U.S. rivals. At Delta, the most profitable U.S. airline, its executives were early to notice how customers were paying up for pricier first-class seats, precious real estate it and other airlines used to give away to frequent flyers as free upgrades. Now, offering buy-ups is more common among all three, and American is looking for more ways to sell those seats and to make sure its planes have enough of them to offer.

One challenge for American has been that it was last of the big three airlines to complete a mega merger in 2013 when it combined with US Airways, while Delta and United had years-long head starts to get through their integrations and improve their products.

Garboden spent much of her career in the finance departments and said it's tough to provide that team with the return-on-investment of something like Champagne but that it's still important.

"Customer experience, it's not just Champagne. It's not just a nice seat. It's not just having the best lounge," she said. "It's the whole holistic view of it, and from end to end, [how] we want it to feel."

Including new aircraft, American expects its capital spending to total $3.8 billion this year, and rise to about $4.5 billion next year, the carrier said Thursday. It said it has nearly $37 billion in total debt, and plans to cut that down by about at least $2 billion before 2028.

One example of how things have changed: American's management team nearly a decade ago decided to remove seat-back screens from its aircraft, saving money on the equipment (and the fuel-sucking weight they add to the plane) because at the time they said customers would likely use their own mobile phones, tablets or laptop to watch entertainment.

United, some of whose senior leadership team, including its chief executive, Scott Kirby, came from American, has done the opposite and is in the process of adding thousands of screens to narrow-body planes both new and old, including Bluetooth technology for wireless headphones.

American might be changing its tune. "I think of where the technology was a decade ago, and where it can be today, or even a few years from today," Garboden said. "Hopefully the complexity is less."

American is working to make its website and app better, with features like a way to toggle between paying for tickets with cash or miles, Garboden said, among other revamps that executives hope will drive sales — and paid upgrades. Another goal: using artificial intelligence and allowing customers to search for vacation themes, such as "best wine tasting in spring" instead of searching for flights between cities, she said.

American is also in the middle of a push to refresh many of its longer-haul premium cabins and announced on Thursday that it will refurbish its Boeing 777-200 aircraft with a new business class, adding to an upgrade, first unveiled three years ago, of its larger Boeing 777-300 jets.

"That is a big deal for us because extending the lives of those and putting those into service really gives us a capital spending holiday in terms of fleet replacement," Isom said in an earnings call with analysts on Thursday. "So it's a win-win-win for our customers, for our company and, most certainly, our investors."

Those plans are made years in advance, and high demand, supply chain problems and long certification wait times have delayed plusher cabins, exasperating airline executives.

On Thursday, American's first Airbus A321 XLR, a long-range narrow-body plane it plans to fly across the country and, eventually to Europe, touched down at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. On all three aircraft types, it will do without first class in favor of a larger business class. For flights over the Atlantic it can cost $600 in the back and well over $6,000 up front.

The new suites that feature sliding doors, larger screens and a palette of dark browns, navy blue and tan, started flying this year on some of American's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, subset P, for "premium."

Meanwhile, the union that represents American's attendants is pushing the carrier add more crew members on board to cater to the larger business-class cabins.

"Staff your airplanes the way a world-class airline should — and deliver a competitive onboard experience in every cabin," the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the pilots' union and unions at the carrier said in a message on Friday that was sent to staff but directed at the carrier, targeting the airline's underperformance compared with rivals.

American's updates even have it rethinking beverages throughout the plane. The airline signed a coffee provider deal with Italy's Lavazza recently, and to test out the brews, it brought airplane water to its headquarters in Fort Worth so staff could evaluate what it would taste like brewed on board. Lavazza made the cut.

The airline on Thursday named Nat Pieper as is chief commercial officer, a nearly three-decade airline veteran who's worked at Alaska Airlines and Delta and who Isom described as "exactly the kind of leader we want at American." American fired its former CCO, Vasu Raja, last year after his business-travel strategy backfired and sparked outrage from travel agencies.

There are signs of progress.

"Exiting this year, we expect to have fully recovered the revenue share that was lost by our prior sales and distribution strategy," Isom said Thursday.

American also just inked a new credit card deal with Citi and last week said it would introduce a new mid-tier card, with a $350 annual fee.

American Airlines was an industry leader for decades. It was the first to launch a frequent flyer program, AAdvantage. Loyalty programs, which in large part make money from selling frequent flyer miles to banks, have now become the lifeblood of many airlines.

The airline this year announced new measures to improve reliability. One change: five additional minutes of boarding time. An American spokeswoman said that helps avoid bottlenecks and last-minute gate-checked bags, which she said are down 25% since May 1.

Some of American's challenges are fairly recent. A federal judge in 2023 blocked American's regional tie-up with JetBlue Airways, leaving it without a partner in key, wealthy markets like Boston and New York, where United and Delta had made inroads.

United this year scooped up a partnership with JetBlue that allows customers to earn and burn miles on each others airline, but stops short of coordinating schedules or routes. It took effect on Thursday, as American was reporting its third-quarter results.

American dominates its fortress hubs in Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina, profitable operations, though it has fallen behind in the Northeast. Other companies have looked to the Sun Belt for growth as the population there grew.

United and Delta executives have credited some of their success to having lots of flights in big coastal hubs with affluent travelers, though United has also built up flying in key markets like Denver, Houston and Chicago.

While American has been reluctant to make big investments, United's CEO Kirby earlier this month told investors that the airline is plowing more than $1 billion a year into improving customer experience.

United recently started flying planes with free Wi-Fi provided by SpaceX's Starlink, following Delta and JetBlue in making the service complimentary. American plans to roll out complimentary Wi-Fi next year for most of its fleet.

United said such investments take years.

"We have built up a generational lead on this front," United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview, adding that new products are coming in the next few years. (He declined to provide details.) "We think it's substantial, and I don't want to give an inch of that ground up, no matter what our competitors do to innovate over the next decade."

Some customers, however, continue to value the convenience American offers them, and have remained loyal.

Todd Bryan, 41, who has Executive Platinum status on American, said he chooses the carrier in large part because it has the most frequencies out of where he lives, in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

The 41-year-old sales account manager who works in the consumer packaged goods industry, said he gets upgraded on most of his flights, but he has noticed that American has been more aggressive about offering buy-ups with cash or miles.

Even though he's usually at the top of the list, he now considers taking the offer instead of gambling on a free upgrade on personal trips if "it feels cheap enough that I assume someone else would buy it too."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Erin Smith, a 47-year-old a freelance marketer and founder of the travel blog Gluten-Free Globetrotter, who moved to Montreal in 2024. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I was born and raised in New York and spent my last twenty years living in Brooklyn. I just didn't want to be anywhere else.

Not even in 2016, when I moved with my then-boyfriend, who is now my husband, to Santa Cruz. Even though it was beautiful there, I just wasn't happy. I had to get back to the city, back to New York. So we moved after only two and a half years in California.

I thought I wouldn't be moving again, but in 2024, my husband got a really good job opportunity in Montreal. He's an agronomist who works in indoor agriculture. He had the opportunity to help start up a greenhouse division for a national company there, which was right up his alley.

As you can imagine, there's not a lot of agriculture in New York City. I'm a freelance marketer and can work from anywhere, but for my husband, it really was the perfect job at the perfect time.

We had to wait for my son to finish the school year in New York, so from January to July, we focused on planning the move.

The thought of leaving New York was really hard. I mean, all my friends and family are there. And even though Canada isn't geographically far from New York, it's still a different environment — especially Quebec, which is a French-speaking province.

I kept thinking back to when we moved to California, which hadn't been a good fit for us. "Oh God, this is going to happen again," kept running through my mind. This, plus the overwhelming feeling of how much we'd have to learn about Quebec, led me to hire a relocation coach.

She's a digital nomad who's lived all over the world, and she helped me a lot — not so much with the logistics of moving, but more with realizing that the things that were important to me in New York would still be important to me in Canada, and that there are ways to incorporate them into my new life.

We visited Quebec a few times before our move to scout out neighborhoods and schools. It was important for me to visit during the winter because it's very cold and snowy here, which I wasn't used to living in New York City.

Our last visit before the move was in April, and we literally had a week to find a place. Unlike in New York, where you can find a rental at any time of year, in Montreal, many leases start on July 1 and run through the end of June the following year.

My husband works in rural Quebec, and we couldn't live there for many reasons, but we're very happy with where we landed. We live in a great neighborhood in Westmount, in the southwest part of Montreal. We're right near a metro station and can walk to downtown Montreal from our apartment. I feel very lucky.

When we moved, our goal was to spend less on rent than we did in New York. In Brooklyn, we lived in a duplex with a backyard, which is pretty rare there — we got really lucky during COVID-19, when everyone was leaving the city. We paid about $3,500 there; here I'm paying roughly $1,000 less. While we've lost our outdoor space, we gained a washer and dryer, a luxury I never had in 20 years of living in Brooklyn.

Quebec's primary language is French, so navigating the region's bureaucracy and school system has been challenging.

In Montreal, there are two main school boards, one English and one French. We needed specific paperwork to qualify for the English system. My son now attends an English school with a French immersion curriculum.

Making friends here hasn't been easy, either. Because I work for a New York-based company, I've really had to put myself out there to meet people. Most of my community has come from meeting other parents through my kid's school organizations and connecting with our neighbors.

The biggest challenge we've faced has been setting up our finances. Since we had no financial history in Canada, we had no credit. Even basic things like getting a credit card or opening a bank account took about six to eight weeks to sort out.

The cost of living here is pretty comparable to New York. We spend about the same on groceries, and while we're saving on housing, my husband spends more on gas because he's commuting and driving farther outside the city. I, however, work from home.

I have been living with celiac disease for over 40 years. In Canada, it has been much easier to eat gluten-free due to the country's food regulations and labeling laws. And thanks to my work with gluten-free restaurants and brands — and my blog — I already had a built-in gluten-free community when I moved here.

I've never lived in a place with socialized healthcare, so there has been a huge learning curve in finding doctors and handling prescriptions. I have to use Google Translate for everything.

Health insurance is affordable here. We no longer pay out of pocket for coverage, which is a big change — in New York, health insurance for a family of three costs almost as much as rent.

It's different from province to province, but in Quebec, you're required to have an assigned family doctor. Since moving here, I've had to see a few specialists for checkups, and the service has been covered. Sometimes, I still find myself waiting for a bill to show up, and it never does.

Something else that surprised me about the medical system here is that you can actually make an appointment with a pharmacist, and they can prescribe medication if you have proper test results.

I really love Montreal and I'm happy here. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. Life feels calmer — the city is beautiful, cleaner, and safer. People here are so much nicer; they have this polite, laid-back attitude.

Our Canadian visas last for three years, but we hope to extend them. For now, I'd like to stay as long as possible.

A year ago, I probably would've wanted to move back to New York. But now, especially with our child in school, I don't want to disrupt that. I also don't know if we could afford to go back.

I'll always see myself as a New Yorker first and an American second; that's my identity through and through. But in New York, I never really felt like I could slow down. In Montreal, we're not in that constant, heightened state anymore. Life here just feels different.

Top Chinese and U.S. economic officials on Sunday hashed out the framework of a trade deal for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize that would pause steeper American tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls and resume U.S. soybean sales to China, U.S. officials said. 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the talks on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur had eliminated the threat of Trump's 100% tariffs on Chinese imports starting November 1. Bessent said he expects China to delay implementation of its rare earth minerals and magnets licensing regime by a year while the policy is reconsidered.

Chinese officials were more circumspect about the talks and offered no details about the outcome of the meetings.

Trump and Xi are due to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, to sign off on the terms. While the White House has officially announced the highly anticipated Trump-Xi talks, China has yet to confirm that the two leaders will meet.

"I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday," Bessent told reporters after he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang for a fifth round of in-person discussions since May. Bessent said he anticipates that a tariff truce with China will be extended beyond its November 10 expiration date, and that China will revive substantial purchases of U.S. soybeans after buying none in September in favor of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina.

U.S. soybean farmers "will feel very good about what's going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years" once the deal's terms are announced, Bessent told the ABC program "This Week."

Greer told the "Fox News Sunday" program that both sides agreed to pause some punitive actions and found "a path forward where we can have more access to rare earths from China, we can try to balance out our trade deficit with sales from the United States."

China's Li Chenggang said the two sides reached a "preliminary consensus" and will next go through their respective internal approval processes.

"The U.S. position has been tough," Li said. "We have experienced very intense consultations and engaged in constructive exchanges in exploring solutions and arrangements to address these concerns." Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, his first stop in a five-day Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a face-to-face with Xi in South Korea on Thursday.

After the talks, Trump struck an optimistic tone, saying: "I think we're going to have a deal with China." Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs, starting on Nov. 1, in retaliation for China's expanded export controls on rare-earth magnets and minerals. China and the United States rolled back most of their triple-digit tariffs on each other's goods under a trade truce due to expire on Nov. 10.

The U.S. and Chinese officials said that in addition to rare earths, they discussed trade expansion, the U.S. fentanyl crisis, U.S. port entrance fees and the transfer of TikTok to U.S. ownership control.

Bessent told NBC's "Meet the Press" program that the two sides have to iron out details of the TikTok deal, allowing Trump and Xi to "consummate the transaction" in South Korea.

On the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit, Trump hinted at possible meetings with Xi in China and the United States.

"We've agreed to meet. We're going to meet them later in China, and we're going to meet in the U.S., in either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago," Trump said. Among Trump's talking points with Xi are Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, concerns around democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai.

The detention of the founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily has become the most high-profile example of China's crackdown on rights in Hong Kong. Trump also said that he will seek China's help in U.S. dealings with Moscow, as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on.

Tensions between the world's two largest economies flared in the past few weeks as a delicate trade truce, reached after a first round of trade talks in Geneva in May and extended in August, failed to prevent the United States and China from hitting each other with more sanctions, export curbs and threats of stronger retaliatory measures. China's expanded controls on rare earths exports have caused a global shortage. That has prompted the United States to consider a ban on software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, according to a Reuters report.

The stock market has been volatile lately as investors study the latest twists and turns in the the U.S.-China trade war as well as earnings of major American companies. Despite those challenges, investors can also choose to focus on stocks of companies that can navigate short-term pressures to deliver strong, long-term returns.

Tracking top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick some attractive stocks, as the recommendations of these experts are based on in-depth analysis of a company's business fundamentals, opportunities and challenges.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This first stock pick is social media company Pinterest (PINS), scheduled to announce third-quarter results on November 4. Heading into those numbers, TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge reiterated a buy rating on Pinterest and a $44 price target. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Pinterest, giving it an "outperform" rating and a price target of $40.

Blackledge expects Pinterest Q3 revenue grew by 16.6% versus the year-earlier quarter, in line with the Street's consensus estimate and toward the high end of the company's own guidance. "We expect EBITDA growth of 20% y/y, outpacing rev growth, driven by modest [cost of revenue] and R&D leverage," said Blackledge.  

The 5-star analyst remains confident about his mid-teens, year-over-year revenue growth estimate through the second half of 2025 and 2026, partly supported by continued adoption by advertisers of PINS' Performance+ campaign tools.

Following a digital ad check call with an agency that runs more than $4 billion annually in managed advertising spending, Blackledge noted that ad spend on Pinterest rose 63% year-over-year in Q3 2025, a slight slowdown compared to 66% in the prior quarter. A TD Cowen expert noted that solid uptake continues in PINS' Performance+ campaign types.

In fact, some advertisers have shifted all their Pinterest spending to Performance+. Blackledge said Performance+, rolled out in late 2024 with automated creative tools, has expanded to include automated bidding tools and other artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automated features.

Blackledge ranks No. 522 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.5%. See Pinterest Statistics on TipRanks.

Next up is ride-sharing and delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a buy rating on UBER along with a 12-month price forecast of $150 after hosting a quarterly webinar with Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy and The Driverless Digest Dude, where they discussed the latest trends across rideshare, delivery and autonomous vehicle (AV) ecosystems. Like Mahaney, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on UBER stock, with an "outperform" rating and a price target of $108.

Campbell was constructive about rideshare supply dynamics, given solid and stable driver economics, Mahaney noted. Campbell continues to see consistent demand and strong driver supply, particularly at Uber, which he described as operating near "all-time highs." Despite robust supply, pricing continues to be high, reflecting sustained demand elasticity and limited alternatives for consumers, particularly for airport and nightlife rides. 

The top-rated analyst also highlighted Campbell's commentary about early-stage shifts in AV partnerships — particularly Alphabet's Waymo's evolving first-party vs third-party strategy and Uber's expanding AV integration roadmap.

Mahaney further noted stable driver economics and widening platform margins. Notably, Uber's "decoupling" of rider fares and driver payouts is driving incremental profit margin expansion, even with steady driver income.

Through incremental feature innovation, Uber is focused on enhancing ecosystem "stickiness." Uber's recent "Only on Uber" event rolled out small feature updates, including tip guarantees and safety enhancements. While not transformative, Mahaney said Campbell sees these efforts as part of Uber's "broader push to create alternative income channels for drivers as AVs grow share over time."

Mahaney ranks No. 473 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13%. See Uber Technologies Financials on TipRanks.

General Motors (GM) jumped 15% on Tuesday after the Cadillac and Buick parent beat the Street's revenue and earnings expectations despite a slight decline in sales. GM also raised its forward guidance, citing a lower-than-expected tariff impact.  

Following the Q3 results, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on GM and raised his price target to $76 from $67. By comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $66 and an "outperform" rating on GM.

"We remain positive with reduced tariff burden/risk, improved profitability and [internal combustion engine] SUV/pickup onshoring tailwinds through C26E+," said Rakesh.

The 5-star analyst noted that GM raised its 2025 guidance for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted free cash flow, driven by a smaller-than-expected impact from  tariffs, and said GM is rolling back some of its electric vehicle (EV) plans to boost profitability. That involves GM's sale of its Michigan EV battery plant stake to LG Energy, while keeping two battery plants, and transitioning its Orion plant to gas engine production from an EV focus by 2027.

Rakesh believes that smaller EV losses, tariff challenges and warranty costs, and a higher combustion engine mix, will support GM's target to return to 8% to 10% EBIT margin in the North America business. Other tailwinds include $5 billion in deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise models, with about 70% gross margins, combined with a stable average selling prices.

Rakesh ranks No. 67 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.8%. See General Motors Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

My husband and I live in a four-bedroom, two-bath house with our three young adult children — ages 18 to 22 — and two of their significant others. This type of living arrangement has pros and cons.

The sink and trash cans are full every time you turn around, but there are also additional helping hands. Our driveway looks like a used car lot, but there is no shortage of people who can grab a gallon of milk on their way home. In many ways, it's like living in a hostel where people come and go at all hours of the day and night. You share the same roof, but everyone lives very separate lives.

To be clear, this was never part of the grand life plan. But with the cost of living being what it is, my husband and I faced a choice: let our oldest son move out and live in his car with his girlfriend (which was their plan), or let them move in with us while they save for their own place. Then our future son-in-law joined the party so he could save dorm costs, finish college, and afford to tie the knot and move out by the end of the year.

In situations like this, where alone time exists only as a theoretical concept, self-care is no longer a luxury — it's a matter of survival. I've integrated three self-care rituals into my lifestyle that, I believe, have kept me sane.

For me, sunshine and movement are essential. Daily walks are nonnegotiable as they reconnect me with nature and remind me that the world is bigger than my overflowing house. I find sanctuary in outdoor chores or carrying my laptop to the porch.

I have my smartwatch remind me if I haven't stepped away from my computer in the last hour. When I get that buzz, I don't just cycle the laundry — I step outside to water the plants, check the mail, or go for a walk.

Anything I can do to catch some extra sunshine is a good thing.

My second self-care ritual is setting intentional boundaries to safeguard my marriage. This includes weekly date nights that don't bust the budget. We may share a homemade meal or lock ourselves away to watch a show together, and during these times, we consider ourselves "off-duty." It's just about disconnecting from the demands of the people living in our house and reconnecting with each other.

And, yes, sometimes life happens and we get interrupted by perceived emergencies, but we are more able to roll with the punches when we know another break is within reach.

As a special treat this year, we threw in a road trip. For six blissful days, we left our laptops at home, only checked our phones once each morning, and were otherwise completely off duty.

These breaks are not about ignoring family; they're about protecting the partnership that will outlast our current living situation.

My third self-care ritual is releasing my own personal pressure valve by venting to someone. Without it, I get a little twitch in my right eyelid, and I get snappy. Eventually, something small, like a half-drank water bottle that was abandoned in the living room (again!), sets me off.

So I've learned to vent before that happens. This is often a conversation with my husband or a close friend around a campfire. Each session starts with a mutually agreed-upon question: Do you need advice, or are you just venting?

That simple question changes everything.

Having someone to listen releases the steam that is building inside me and allows me to breathe without the person listening feeling like they need to "fix" something.

What all of these rituals have in common is that I intentionally integrate them into everyday life. I don't hide that these things are requirements for my sanity. I say, "I can't do that until after my walk," or "I would love to do that with you, but tonight is my off-duty night. Does tomorrow work?"

The more I normalize these pauses, the more the household respects them. As a bonus, the consistent modeling of self-care encourages others to self-reflect on their own self-care needs.

In a busy home, carving out space for yourself is more of a mental game than a physical one. When I take these small but consistent steps, I notice that I'm calmer and kinder. I respond rather than react.

That's not just better for me. It's better for everyone.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Annie Liao, a 24-year-old startup founder based in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.

After raising $1.75 million in the pre-seed round for my startup last year, I quit my job and moved from Australia to San Francisco to go all in as a solo founder.

The reality of being a solo founder has been a lot harder than I thought it would be. It can get lonely and difficult at times, but living with a built-in support system of other founders helps. We all uprooted our lives, left behind our loved ones, and moved here to build startups, so we think of each other like family.

Now I'm living in a hacker house, where our dining table is covered in laptops and monitors instead of flowers — and it's one of the best decisions I've made.

After raising the pre-seed funding for Build Club, an AI learning hub aimed at democratizing access to AI education, I now have a team of five who work around the world, but I live in San Francisco.

I've always wanted to live in San Francisco. It's the beating pulse of AI, and there are so many insanely ambitious and talented people to be surrounded by.

You can literally walk into a coffee shop and end up in a two-hour deep dive conversation about AI agents or someone's YC application. Everyone's dreaming big, and you can feel that optimism in the air. It's a nice place to build a startup.

What surprised me most about San Francisco was how generous people are with their time. It's a real "pay it forward" culture, and people actually want to see each other win.

Of course, there are downsides. Some streets don't feel safe, and the contrast between incredible wealth and deep struggle is hard to ignore. Plus, I think Australia has better healthcare and is just more chill.

During a visit to San Francisco before I moved, I met the person who ran Mission Control, one of San Francisco's oldest hacker houses, and she told me they had empty rooms available. I later moved there for my first few months in San Francisco.

I met three other founders there, and we decided to move into a more intimate place. We named our hacker house "The Stables" because it's our place of stability in San Francisco and because it's a breeding ground for unicorns. As a solo founder, I don't have a cofounder to tell everything to, so living with other founders has been really important.

I've probably leaned on my housemates too many times, whether for emotional support or even to share an employee. We've had some really great moments together. The day before one of our launches, we stayed up late, and one of my roommates bought us food to celebrate.

We also cook for each other when possible or go out to dinner together. We're all very time-poor and come home exhausted, so it's convenient to be able to knock on someone's door to ask if they want to grab dinner. Every Sunday, we even go on a hike together to step away from work and touch some grass, which is always a highlight of my week.

Our shared spaces definitely get messy, especially during busy periods, but we like to clean together. There's also less privacy and quiet than if I lived alone, but it's just nice to have people around.

When I look at founders on social media, they often only show the highlights, but living with other founders has been very humanizing and comforting. For example, you might see online that a founder raised a successful pre-seed round, but in reality, they're crying on the couch of the hacker house because an employee they really wanted said no.

I remember there was one time when all of us were having really rough weeks — one of us was fundraising their round, and everyone else was working until 1 a.m. every day. We were all locked in, and our laptops and monitors were everywhere.

I usually wake up at 6:30 a.m. and spend my mornings doing deep work. My team is split across time zones, so my afternoons consist of calls with people in other regions. When I return home in the evening, I usually have more calls with team members who come online even later.

Then, my roommates and I might cook together or go for a walk around the park to de-stress. Most nights, we end by lighting candles in the living room, playing deep house music, and coworking until 12 or 1 a.m.

Most people in San Francisco are very tech-obsessed, so I don't like to spend more than two months here at a time. I usually go back to Australia to spend time with my family and ground myself, or I go to a place like Bali, where there's a focus on well-being.

The hardest part about being away from Australia is definitely the distance, both personally and professionally. Many of our early supporters and part of our team are still in Australia, and our customer base is split between there and the US.

My whole family's back home. When my niece was born, I wish I could've just teleported back. However, the balance has helped me stay a bit more sane and appreciate both places more.

It's cuffing season for chipmakers.

As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars.

There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner.

One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company."

It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening.

Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley.

It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode.

"A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'"

The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

"Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi.

One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement."

In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000.

Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million.

In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000.

Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each.

One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere.

"The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities."

Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent.

Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years.

Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees."

The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings.

According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent.

It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts.

Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK.

"In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs."

Suspects have been arrested over the brazen jewelry heist at the Louvre, just as one of them was about to fly out of France, the Paris prosecutor said on Sunday.

Two men in their 30s and originally from the capital's Seine-Saint-Denis suburb - which includes some of the country's most deprived areas - were detained on Saturday evening, according to Le Parisien newspaper, which first broke the story.

They were known to French police and one of the suspects was about to fly to Algeria from Charles de Gaulle airport, the newspaper said.

There was no indication on Sunday that any of France's stolen crown jewels had been recovered.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not say how many people were arrested or give any more details about them. In a statement, she deplored the fact that information about their arrest was leaked.

"This revelation can only hinder the investigative efforts of the 100 or so mobilized investigators, both in the search for the stolen jewelry and for all the perpetrators. It is too early to provide any specific details," Beccuau said.

Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, under public pressure to deliver results a week to the day after the robbery, congratulated investigators in a tweet, but gave no more details.

Four hooded thieves made off with eight precious pieces worth an estimated $102 million from the Louvre's collection on October 19, exposing security lapses at the world's most-visited museum.

They broke in using a crane to smash an upstairs window during opening hours and escaped on motorbikes.

News of the robbery reverberated around the world, prompting soul-searching in France over what some regarded as a national humiliation.

The stolen treasures included a tiara and an earring from the jewelry of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense from the early 19th century.

The crown of Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, was found damaged outside the museum. The thieves apparently dropped the piece, made of gold, emeralds and diamonds, as they made their getaway.

Built in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace used to be the official residence of the kings of France, until Louis XIV abandoned it for Versailles. It was turned into a museum for the royal art collection in 1793, four years after the French Revolution.

Its vast collection of masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo, attracted 8.7 million visitors last year.

In a 2009 interview, a 25-year-old Mark Zuckerberg offered a grand prognosis on the human condition. "You have one identity," the Facebook founder said. "The days of you having a different image for your work friends or coworkers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly. Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity."

At the time, his five-year-old social network was shaping the identities of more than 350 million people. Like Sergey Brin and Larry Page with their mission to "organize the world's information" with Google, like Steve Jobs when he put the internet in our pockets, Zuck was becoming something of the world's new Minister of Thought — influencing how humans conceived of themselves and one another as they communicated at an unprecedented scale.

Today, 16 years and arguably several identities later (from the hoodie-wearing "I'm CEO, bitch" wunderkind to the suit-wearing presidential prospect to the shirtless jiu jitsu-fighting MAGA beefcake), Zuck is starting to cede that title to another tech leader who is shaping human cognition at perhaps an even grander scale, Sam Altman.

ChatGPT, just three years old, has more than 800 million weekly users, at least 40 times Facebook's audience three years in. OpenAI is now the most valuable private company worldwide. Ten percent of the world's adults use its flagship chatbot on a monthly basis — for writing emails and scouring the web, planning trips, decoding medical mysteries, or finding love.

Where Zuck taught us to post, Altman teaches us to prompt. If the past twenty years were about curating who we are, the next may be about creating who we want to be.

Facebook rewired how we see ourselves and each other. Posts, pokes, photos, and likes stitched together a specific digital avatar. Instagram gave us filters. The feed's ranking systems rewarded the glossiest slice of life — the latté foam art and dopamine décor. Zuckerberg promised to "bring the world closer together." He didn't say we'd show up unvarnished.

Altman's world is generation, not just presentation. Filters that boost saturation and darken edges have been supplanted by "Ghiblified" photo edits. Sora lets users turn rough ideas into hyperreal videos. I cast myself in a fake space opera; Mark Cuban tap danced with the late Ginger Rogers. These tools don't polish reality so much as draft new versions of it.

I've seen the appeal up close. My husband, historically terrible at gifts, recently nailed it on my birthday: gold hoops and a Catbird necklace with our daughter's initial. His confession — "I used ChatGPT" — felt both cute and slightly disorienting. If a bot is co-authoring intimacy, what else are we outsourcing? Holiday cards, wedding toasts, and homework may be just the start.

The office is already there. Studies suggest generative tools can speed up knowledge work and lift quality, especially for low performers. Emails became more polished, decks more dazzling. That power also comes with a catch: more "workslop" to sift and lower productivity if misused.

There's a bigger platform shift underneath all of this. Facebook's feed once redistributed attention outward. Publishers lived and died by referral traffic. AI flips the model. Large language models ingest the open web and answer queries in its place. Where Zuckerberg built a web of people and links, Altman built a funnel. The user asks, it synthesizes. That convenience is already hitting publishers.

Zuckerberg started Facebook to connect his Harvard class. His ambitions went global. Facebook groups knit together new parents, bird watchers, English learners, and Bronies. The company has expanded internet access in developing countries.

The same algorithms that brought us closer also sorted us apart. Ranking systems fed people more of what they already agreed with, hardening echo chambers. Critics accused Facebook of supercharging conspiracies and "fake news" — around elections, the environment, and health.

Altman isn't auditioning as a great communitarian. His concerns lie with the human-to-machine connection.

People are consulting ChatGPT as "a sort of therapist or life coach," Altman said, a trend he admitted made him feel "uneasy." Others are falling in love with the chatbot. Soon, a gated adult mode will offer erotica for personalized fantasy on demand. That's the shift from the public square to private rooms.

Early evidence points to extreme tradeoffs. In March, a study from OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab found that ChatGPT heightened feelings of loneliness in a group of power users. Last month, parents of two teens who died by suicide after talking to chatbots testified to Congress about the technology's harms.

Zuckerberg still regulates humanity's attention; Meta has some 3.5 billion daily active users across its products. He has credited fast-improving algorithms with putting content people actually want in front of them, increasing time spent on the company's apps in the second quarter. Altman is moving into intention, the first — and in some cases final — draft of what we say and do.

Zuckerberg isn't ceding the future to Altman. He's desperately trying to catch up: billions in capex for data centers and chips, Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressive, NBA superstar-level offers to poach researchers. In July, Facebook published a new manifesto: "personal superintelligence for everyone," essentially echoing the frontier Altman staked out.

There's upside. Coauthoring with machines can widen who gets to sound sharp, ship better work, or just be kinder in the group chat. There's also creep. The more we rely on a model as our first reader and first responder, the easier it is to mistake its output for our own thinking.

In the age of social media, we shaped and curated our identity — or identities — for the computer. In the age of AI, the computer is starting to shape and curate our identities for us.

He's desperately trying to catch up: billions in capex for data centers and chips, Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressive, NBA superstar-level offers to poach researchers. In July, Facebook published a new manifesto: "personal superintelligence for everyone," essentially echoing the frontier Altman staked out.

There's upside. Coauthoring with machines can widen who gets to sound sharp, ship better work, or just be kinder in the group chat. There's also creep. The more we rely on a model as our first reader and first responder, the easier it is to mistake its output for our own thinking.

In the age of social media, we shaped and curated our identity — or identities — for the computer. In the age of AI, the computer is starting to shape and curate our identities for us.

I'm addicted to my car.

Even in a densely-packed city like San Francisco, I couldn't imagine getting around without it.

But I also hate my car.

It's a little silly to think that I need to start and stop a couple-ton vehicle just to drive a few minutes to my friend's house or to grab groceries. I also think about the painful amount of money I've spent due to a cracked wheel from a pothole, flattened tires from a perfectly placed nail, or the driver who sideswiped me after they blew a red light. That was all within the past year.

If I could get rid of my car, I would.

ALSO, a startup that began as a skunkworks inside Rivian is trying really hard to replace our large vehicles — at least for some trips.

"The name ALSO is very intentional. It's not an either-or proposition," Ben Steele, ALSO's chief commercial officer, told me. "I think what we're really seeking to do with our products is to say to people: 'The unexamined choice of just defaulting to a car? We want to reframe that for you.'"

I met the executives of ALSO on a Saturday afternoon at their office in Palo Alto, just across the street from Rivian's office, where they gave me a chance to try the product: a $4,500 e-bike. ALSO is calling it the T-MB for "Transcendent Mobility Bike."

Chris Yu, the president of the startup, told me that the "genesis" behind ALSO was simple: "Why doesn't that magical experience you get out of a Rivian exist in anything smaller than a car?"

Having seen the bike up close and hearing the executives talk about the TM-B, I can clearly see where Rivian's vertically integrated approach and even the design language are ingrained into the bike.

Yu said the startup is growing, from about 75 employees in March to over 150 employees today. ALSO is building a second office, located less than a mile away.

Here's a closer look at the TM-B and the executives behind ALSO.

Yu has an extensive background in biking.

He told me he raced competitively in college and continued to do so throughout his years at Specialized Bicycle Components, a bike manufacturer, where he spent more than 10 years and led the company as the chief product and technology officer.

Yu's not doing much racing these days, but he still bikes often with his son.

Yu said he'd take his son to school on the back of his bike, one of the use cases ALSO kept in mind for the development of the TM-B. Both the father and son are intimately aware of the pain points for e-bikes.

"Every other bike that we've used when we hit potholes and the speed bump in his school parking lot, he'd always get bounced around, and he always just thought that was the norm," Yu said.

"The payload capacity to carry a 75-pound kid on the back does not exist," he added.

Yu said that the TM-B was designed with a one-bike-fits-all approach. He said that one of the first pain points for consumers is deciding which type of e-bike to buy in the first place.

"We wanted to build in as much breadth of personality, utility, and capability into one platform as much as possible to remove that kind of initial friction and pain point," Yu said.

I had the opportunity to try the launch edition, which has a starting price of $4,500. The base edition will start under $4,000. ALSO plans to launch in 2026.

The TM-B stands apart from most e-bikes on the market due to its pedal-by-wire system. That means the pedals aren't mechanically linked to a chain that moves the tires. Instead, the pedals are attached to a generator, which provides the power to move you forward.

That also means there's no gear shifting in the traditional sense. There is a manual mode where you can "shift" gears, and you'll feel a haptic feedback on the pedals that indicates when you're changing gears.

I found that this propulsion system made going up a hill seamless. The bike didn't require much more pedaling effort when I went up a hill.

The TM-B is a class 3 bike, giving a pedal-assist speed of up to 28 mph and a throttle that assists the rider for up to 20 mph.

A standard battery pack delivers up to 60 miles of range. The large battery pack provides up to 100 miles of range.

The regenerative braking system can extend the range by around 25%, according to the company.

Riders can also use the battery as a portable charger for their electronic devices.

Much like a Rivian, a rider can walk up to the TM-B to turn on the bike since it's connected to the user's phone.

It's a "software-defined" bike, Yu said, which allows for over-the-air updates and an easy user experience straight out of the box.

At around 70 pounds, the TM-B is not a traditional bike that a rider would lug up several floors of their apartment building.

Yu said the company envisions riders treating the bike more like a car that you could feel comfortable leaving inside a parking structure.

Kelly Veit, VP of software, said the bike is equipped with Wi-Fi, LTE, and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) connectivity for location tracking purposes and anti-theft protection.

If the bike senses motion, the owner is alerted on their phone. If the bike is stolen, the owner can track its location and "brick" it, making it essentially unrideable.

ALSO executives showed me three attachments: one for the solo rider, one that allows for up to 75 pounds of payload, including a small child or groceries, and a "bench" for more comfortable riding.

All the modular seat attachments are equipped with lights on the back that also serve as turn signals.

For bikers, that means no longer having to stick their arm out to indicate when they're about to make a turn.

The headlight serves as a daytime running light and a turn signal.

Yu said that the light can also indicate the battery charge status and show the progress of over-the-air updates.

The throttle on the TM-B is set to a maximum speed of 20 mph, as per federal regulations for e-bikes, allowing the bike to reach that speed without pedaling.

Saul Leiken, director of product line, said the bike was designed to accelerate "basically as fast as a car can coming off of a stop sign."

"I'm not talking a zero to 60 type of thing," he said, "but if you're running a little late to work, that allows you to ride with traffic instead of being in traffic's way."

Yu said the throttle is helpful to quickly move out of intersections.

Due to its fewer moving parts, Yu said the frequency of servicing the T-MB should be much lower than that of traditional bikes.

The president said ALSO is working on several ways for riders to bring in their bikes: a "small brick-and-mortar footprint across the country," a mobile service fleet, and a network of authorized service providers.

Additionally, ALSO can notify users via telemetry if there is an issue with the bike, he said.

Oops, something went wrong

Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong has rejected the idea that cryptocurrencies are too expensive for new entrants.

“You don't need to buy a full Bitcoin or ETH to get started,” Armstrong said Sunday on X. “You can start buying and holding crypto with a few dollars. It's never too late.”

Armstrong's remarks come as Bitcoin trades over $100,000 and Ethereum near $4,000, figures that are likely to intimidate potential investors. For investors seeking significant returns, it may also feel like the train has left the station. This sentiment is often cited as a reason some investors engage in speculative trading of assets like memecoins, which lack utility and are prone to rapid booms and busts.

According to several cryptocurrency executives and top market watchers, however, it is still early to get into cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.

“Until Bitcoin hits $500K, it is still early,” Bitwise investment chief Matt Hougan said in a November 2024 memo. This view, which SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has since shared, is based on Bitcoin's digital gold narrative.

The idea is that if the narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold takes off, a mature Bitcoin would have half the market share of gold, which Hougan, at the time, estimated would push the asset to $500,000.

In the same vein, Gemini Space Station Inc. (NASDAQ:GEMI) co-founder Tyler Winklevoss said last month that “it's still very much the bottom of the first inning” for Bitcoin. He said he expected Bitcoin to trade at $1 million if it disrupts gold.

Similarly, Armstrong has recently said that Bitcoin would trade at $1 million by 2030. Reiterating this prediction in a Fox Business interview last month, he cited growing regulatory clarity in the U.S. as one of the reasons for his confidence. He also cited President Donald Trump‘s establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and institutional flows from spot BTC exchange-traded funds.

“There's a lot of positive tailwinds for Bitcoin, and there's never going to be more than 21 million Bitcoin ever made in the world, and lots of pools of capital still haven't gotten access to it,” Armstrong told Fox Business. “So that tells me this thing has a long way to run.”

Bitcoin was most recently trading at $108,000. The asset has fallen 14% below its record high of $126,000 amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China, casting doubt on its store-of-value status. Comparatively, gold has surged to new price records above $4,000.

A proposed XRP Ledger amendment, Batch (XLS-56), is generating excitement among developers and validators alike.

One pseudonymous XRP validator, Vet, has shared his experience testing the Batch functionality on the dev net, where multiple transactions, including minting and payments for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), can be bundled and executed automatically.

The amendment, according to Vet, enables creation of a fully peer-to-peer NFT-to-NFT trading platform, allowing users to perform a barter-like NFT swaps in a single transaction. 

For instance, one could trade five of their NFTs for two NFTS owned by another party, all processed simultaneously to ensure atomicity and security, Vet said on X, suggesting a game-inspired interface, similar to the classic RuneScape, to make this NFT-to-NFT trading more engaging and intuitive for users.

As of writing, the Batch amendment has achieved 68.57% consensus among validators, with 80% required for activation. XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain used by Ripple to build cross border payments solution. 

The Batch amendment introduces atomic transaction capabilities to the XRP Ledger, allowing multiple operations to be grouped and executed simultaneously as a single unified transaction.

It takes the all or nothing approach – either all transactions in the group are completed successfully or none are, thereby eliminating the risk of partial execution failures.

This principle of atomicity has its roots in computer science and database management, where a sequence of operations is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Therefore, an atomic process means that the entire set of transactions is either fully executed or entirely rolled back to ensure data integrity. 

Atomicity on XRP Ledger could be valuable in complex NFT trades or swaps involving multiple steps, facilitating the development of sophisticated NFT marketplaces.

"This new amendment drastically changes the functionality of the XRP Ledger by allowing the grouping and ordering of up to 8 transactions into a single batched operation. It also introduces atomic execution via ALLORNOTHING as one of its execution modes for batched transactions," Teucrium said in a Substack post.

A total of four batch modes are supported: ALLORNOTHING, ONLYONE, UNTILFAILURE, and INDEPENDENT. The availability of four modes will ensure flexibility in how multiple transactions are executed as a group, helping developers choose the best approach for their use case.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin miners are using their computing power to service a thirsty AI boom, and investors are taking notice.

Companies once focused solely on mining digital tokens are signing long-term contracts using their land, energy, and data centers for AI workloads.

Miners like IREN (IREN), Riot (RIOT), TeraWulf (WULF), and Cipher Miner (CIFR) are just a handful of players shifting their resources toward high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and artificial intelligence.

Industry insiders point to the promise of better returns from AI than crypto mining.

"Bitcoin mining just doesn't cut it anymore," Daniel Keller, CEO and co-founder of cloud infrastructure firm InFlux Technologies, told Yahoo Finance.

A crowded mining field and bitcoin's price swings have squeezed margins. Jefferies analysts hly competitive mining environment and price volatility can impact bottom lines. Jefferies analysts estimate miner profits declined more than 7% in September as bitcoin prices declined.

Every four years, bitcoin's “halving” event cuts mining rewards in half, further eroding revenue over time.

"Due to halving schedules, mining is less profitable in the long run than AI computing," said Keller.

"Additionally, demand for AI workloads is through the roof right now, and BTC miners have what AI data centers require: affordable and consistent power housed in temperate environments," he added.

The pivot comes as AI demand booms and heavyweights such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) are striking new deals in the space.

Cloud hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are facing multiyear grid and permitting delays for more AI data center capacity, creating an opportunity for smaller, power-ready operators to help meet demand.

"The access to ready and cheap renewable power combined with data center capabilities positions Bitcoin miners as attractive partners for AI cloud providers looking to accelerate time-to-market and build resilient high-performance computing clusters," Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani said in a note earlier this month.

Bernstein analysts estimate that bitcoin miners' grid-connected power can cut data center deployment timelines by up to 75%. Additionally, their existing infrastructure is "closer to AI data centers" versus traditional ones.

"This allows Bitcoin miners to retrofit existing BTC mining facilities for AI/HPC at low incremental capex," Chhugani wrote.

Earlier this week, bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) unveiled its move into AI data centers, using its land and computing infrastructure to tap into the booming market.

The announcement follows a slew of other players pursuing similar strategies.

Miner Riot's shares are up 104% since the start of the year as the company has pivoted into AI. Over the summer, Riot announced additional acreage at its Corsicana, Texas, data center campus would be converted to mixed bitcoin and HPC use, expected to be online in 2026.

Meanwhile, bitcoin miner TeraWulf and peer Cipher Mining recently struck multibillion-dollar, decade-long leases with Fluidstack, a Google-backed AI cloud infrastructure company. Shares of TeraWulf have soared 150% since the start of the year.

In August, Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced plans to transform its 1,500-acre Helios data center campus in Dickens County, Texas, into an AI and HPC hub, in a tie-up with cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave (CRWV), whose big customers include OpenAI and Microsoft.

IREN, formally known as Iris Energy, paused its bitcoin mining expansion in April to pivot to AI cloud services. In August, the company announced the purchase of 4,200 Nvidia Blackwell chips as part of its expansion. The stock is up more than 500% year to date.

Analysts view the pivot to AI cloud services as structural and not a temporary side bet.

"Taken together — multi-year, investment-grade backstops, double-digit-year contract terms, and power-grid bottlenecks — this is not a band-aid while hyperscalers wait for their own campuses," Compass Point analysts Michael Donovan and Ed Engel wrote earlier this month.

Bolivia's Central Bank released a report exploring a wholesale CBDC, the digital Boliviano, to modernize payments and counter stablecoin growth.

The Central Bank of Bolivia issued its first report evaluating a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Consequently, the bank is looking at implementing the “digital Boliviano.” This initiative aims to get the country's entire financial system modernized in effect. Therefore, the report represents a significant step towards a possible digital currency.

The bank also recognizes the potential benefits of such currency. A CBDC would enable private banks to efficiently optimize high-value transactions. Moreover, it could not only revamp the sovereignty of the Bolivian Boliviano, but also revamp the sovereignty of the fiat currency. This is extremely important in a more digital world. Thus, efficiency and monetary control are addressed in the study.

In this first phase of evaluation, the bank considered different models. Specifically, it concluded the wholesale, interbank currency would be most useful in the beginning. This model only deals with transactions between financial institutions. Therefore, it would create an optimization of the internal processes of the payment system directly. This affects key financial players in the country.

The report's use of stablecoins as a key factor is highlighted. For this reason, a central bank probably considers a CBDC a necessary countermeasure. It aims to keep monetary control in the digital age effectively. Furthermore, the fact that a wholesale CBDC is a controlled environment in which to test. This is because it allows the bank to test the impact of the technology safely.

Moreover, the focus on the optimization of internal payment systems is strategic. It targets existing inefficiencies within the traditional infrastructure of traditional banking institutions head-on. Therefore, near-instant settlement between banking institutions could cut through operational friction dramatically. This improvement improves the overall resilience of the financial sector in a short time.

In essence, the digital Boliviano hopes to improve high-value transaction speed. This improvement could reduce costs to participating financial institutions to a significant level. Ultimately, such benefits would trickle down the entire Bolivian economy. The bank is seriously considering these possible advantages at the moment.

Additionally, the report highlights the role of fiat currency sovereignty. The emergence of private digital currencies is a challenge at the global level. Therefore, central banks are considering CBDCs to reclaim their role. Bolivia's exploration fits this international trend well. This move is aimed at ensuring the successful completion of monetary stability in long-term.

The move to favor a wholesale model is a well-thought-out move. A retail CBDC comes with complex issues such as public acceptance and privacy issues. In contrast, an interbank system makes for a focused and controlled implementation in the first place. This way, there are minimal immediate risks taken for the broader financial system.

What's more, the potential integration with existing payment systems is critical. The report suggests the CBDC has the potential to improve existing infrastructure efficiently. This prevents the whole overhaul right now. As a result, the transition may be less abrupt and less disruptive on the whole. The bank is focusing on practicality when making its assessment.

In conclusion, Bolivia is taking a proactive approach to digital currency innovation in the present moment. The potential existence of a digital Boliviano can modernize the financial system considerably. But the central bank is being circumspect. It focuses on stability and control in this critical evaluation process. The eyes of the world's financial community will be focused on the progress of Bolivia.

Major cryptocurrencies are trading higher, with key events, including Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate decisions, and earnings reports from influential Mag 7 stocks lined up for the week ahead.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 4% on Wednesday, bringing the total easing since September last year to 150 basis points.

The CME Fed funds futures are pricing in near certainty that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday and at its December meeting.

The consensus anticipates further rate cuts next year, supporting a continued bullish trend for bitcoin and the wider crypto market.

Bitcoin is already showing strength, rising 1.7% over the past 24 hours to $113,600, extending its three-day winning streak. The upswing follows signs of seller exhaustion near the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently placed at $108,800.

Prices, however, have yet to surpass the 50-day SMA at $114,250, a widely recognized barrier that must be overcome to restore near-term bullish momentum.

Other major tokens, such as XRP$2.6366, ether ETH$4,065.55, and solana SOL$199.32, have risen by 3% over the past 24 hours. Payments-focused XRP has risen past its 200-day SMA at $2.60, hinting at renewed bullishness in momentum.

The upcoming Fed rate decision will be issued without economic forecasts or interest rate projections, making Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference the key event to watch.

Powell is likely to reiterate the September message that downside risks to the job market have become more concerning, while tariff-induced inflation is expected to be transitory and short-lived.

The dovish talk will likely bolster hopes for additional easing over the coming months, potentially adding to upward momentum in risk assets.

Powell will most likely get questioned about the impact of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown on its economic and interest rate projections.The chief, however, is likely to downplay the shutdown while sticking to September economic forecasts, which showed prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025 and then falling to 2.6% in 2026. September forecasts also showed the jobless rate averaging 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and eventually falling to 4.3% by 2027.

Note that labor market weakness began before the ongoing government shutdown, so the absence of fresh jobs data due to the shutdown is unlikely to prompt Powell to reverse the September guidance prioritizing labor concerns over inflation.

According to Scotiabank, a more meaningful development could come from the Fed's balance sheet following Powell's recent speech, in which he indicated that conditions are nearing the point at which to end quantitative tightening (QT) or the balance sheet runoff program that began in 2022.

"Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions. We may approach that point in coming months," Powell said.

The banking system's reserves recently fell below $3 trillion, breaching a level widely perceived as ample and signaling tighter liquidity conditions.

While a potential end to quantitative tightening (QT) does not guarantee an immediate resumption of balance sheet expansion or quantitative easing (QE), it could nevertheless boost optimism across crypto social media.

On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will issue a policy statement with Governor Ueda taking centre stage following the rate decision.

The central bank is expected to keep rates steady. However, fresh economic and interest rate forecasts could breed market volatility. "Markets are priced for no rate change at this meeting but about half of a quarter-point cut in December and full cut pricing by early 2026 at either the January or March meetings," Scotiabank said in a market note.

Apple, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Microsoft – members of the famed Mag 7 group – are among the key tech names set to announce their earnings this week.

Traders will closely examine these reports for insights into AI-related tech spending, which has been a major driver behind the rise in risk assets since 2023. Any signs of a slowdown in this spending could trigger increased risk aversion in the market.

The U.S.-China trade tensions eased Sunday after both sides announced that a trade deal was nearing between the world's two largest economies.

The comments came days after the White House confirmed that President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in person on Thursday in South Korea. This highly anticipated meeting will take place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. 

The positive soundbites ahead of the meeting have raised expectations for a potential trade deal, meaning any disappointment could trigger a risk-off reaction among investors.

As the Solana ecosystem is preparing for the upgrade to come at the end of this year or in early 2026, Repetny shares how he thinks this shift could expand validator participation and improve decentralization, even as higher hardware demands loom.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Solana's upcoming Alpenglow upgrade could mark a turning point for the network's staking economy. CoinDesk sat down with Michael Repetny, CEO of Marinade Labs, the firm that supports Solana's liquid staking protocol Marinade, to discuss how the update aims to change the economics of running a validator on Solana, significantly lowering the barrier to entry.

As the Solana ecosystem prepares for an upgrade at the end of this year or in early 2026, Repetny shares his thoughts on how this shift could expand validator participation and improve decentralization, even as higher hardware demands loom.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.



CoinDesk: Talk to me about the state of Solana staking – what are the most pressing issues right now in this area, in your opinion?

Michael Repetny: So when we started Marinade, there were 700 validators on Solana, with 11 of them big enough to potentially halt the network.

Then we launched Marinade during the first few years, the number of validators grew to 2000 so it looked great. Right now we are below 1000 validators again active on Solana.

I think there are other signals [on the health of Solana staking]. Another way of looking at it is if you look at the concentration of the stake, which is, if you get one-third of that stake to shut down, Solana stops working.

It takes right now around 20 of the biggest violators to do that, or also it takes two countries and it takes two data centers right now. Those are like different ways to look at it. So, it is not ideal.

We would rather see hundreds of bad quality validators than thousands of them with people just running potatoes.

And with the ETFs and with institutional interest, I think that centralization is becoming a greater risk.

At Marinade, we're trying to make sure that we have a viable option for validators to stake in a responsible way.



Solana has a major upgrade coming called Alpenglow. How will it affect the staking ecosystem?

We are hopeful, and it should impact the staking and validator economics. There is a proposed change to just cut down the vote fees for validators (vote fees are incurred by validators when they vote on processing SOL on the blockchain). So this is a huge one, because right now, if you want to run a validator, just to get it started, you need to pay about $5,000 a month.

Of those $5,000, about $4,000 is spent on just the voting fees. So as you can see, 80% of the cost today to spin up your validator is vote fees. Alpenglow aims to turn the vote fees to be much less. This is super exciting, and should make it much more accessible to start their own validator because the cost will go down



Will there be any changes to Solana validator rewards?

One way to look at it is to cut the cost of running a validator. Alpenglow is really about increasing the bandwidth and reducing latency.

We hope to see more saturated blocks when we pack them better, which should also improve the economics of the validators by packing the blocks.

Another benefit to that would be that if you increase the bandwidth and reduce the latency, then there is a shorter time for arbitrage and malicious maximum extractable value (MEV). This means if there's less time to manipulate the ordering of the transactions, there's going to be less toxic and malicious MEV happening, which is great for users.



Are there any tradeoffs for validators with Alpenglow?

Maybe eventually the hardware cost might go up. There may be a higher requirement on the end validators to make sure that they still keep up with the network, as there will be more transactions coming in. Maybe with the more requirements on them, there could be a trade-off. Other than that, I don't know. There will be problems, but we have to see once we are there.



How does Alpenglow tie back to Marinade's mission?

It makes it more accessible to spin up just more validators. The threshold for being break-even is way lower.



So Alpenglow is coming at the end of the year or maybe early next year – is this going to be a really big transformation or just another upgrade? And where does Solana head after that?

It's one of the pieces that need to be sorted out for Solana to be and stay competitive with things like Hyperliquid or decentralized exchanges.

Solana is working on fixing the protocol with Alpenglow, fixing the infrastructure with new projects like DoubleZero, fixing the software clients and optimizing Firedancer. All those things, hopefully now, are all coming together.

A six-month timeframe might not be enough for the results to show, but once it's out there, it's hopefully going to unlock use cases that wouldn't be available on Solana at present.

Hopefully, there will be more economic activity, which should translate to more revenue, and hopefully that pie grows.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has cautioned that the blockchain's cryptographic guarantees stop where external trust begins.

On October 26, Buterin explained that even a 51% attack cannot validate an invalid block. This means that even if a majority of validators collude or experience a software bug, they cannot seize users' funds or forge transactions.

This is because each blockchain node independently verifies new blocks and automatically rejects any that break the protocol's rules. This decentralized verification protects Ethereum from false ledger entries, even under majority control.

However, Buterin emphasized that this security guarantee only applies to the blockchain's protocol.

According to him, the moment users rely on validators for tasks outside that framework—such as bridging assets, verifying real-world data, or confirming off-chain events—they enter a zone where trust replaces math.

In that realm, if 51% of validators agree on a false statement, the network itself offers no recourse.

Buterin's remarks have reignited debate within the developer community. Many are now questioning how much control validators should hold as blockchains adopt complex features like bridges, oracles, and off-chain attestations.

Polygon's Chief Technology Officer, Mudit Gupta, supported the warning.

However, he explained that while validators can't alter Ethereum's state, they can "steal money" through maximal extractable value (MEV) or even enforce censorship.

Meanwhile, others disagreed with Buterin's position.

Seun Lanlege, co-founder of Polkadot's Hyperbridge, argued that validator influence runs deeper. He warned that a malicious majority could manipulate block propagation or isolate nodes through eclipse attacks.

This exposes a structural vulnerability that extends beyond MEV or censorship.

Adding another perspective, MultiversX core developer Robert Sasu urged teams to minimize reliance on off-chain components altogether.

"Make and move everything onchain. Directly in a decentralised L1," he stated.

In his view, any reliance on centralized systems like bridges, oracles, or price feeds invites manipulation. True resilience, he argued, comes from designing decentralized, permissionless, and composable systems that minimize trusted intermediaries.

During the European session, Ethereum (ETH) is showing a slightly bullish bias, trading at around $3,984 level with a 24-hour trading volume of $16.5 billion. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $480.9 billion, gained 1.04% over the past day. 

Despite recent market volatility, ETH's ability to maintain higher lows suggests growing trader confidence as it inches closer to a potential breakout.

The recent price action signals that buyers are quietly regaining control, as ETH consolidates within a tightening range between $3,920 and $4,115 – a zone that typically precedes major directional moves.

On the 4-hourly timeframe, the ETH/USD is shaping up for a possible symmetrical triangle breakout. Typically, a breakout of such a pattern triggers sharp price swings, particularly in the same direction where it is breaking out now. 

In this case, ETH is breaking out to the upside. The 20-day EMA ($3,935) has nearly crossed above the 50-day EMA ($3,926), a short-term bullish signal indicating momentum may soon accelerate.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 58, suggesting mild bullish bias without overbought conditions, leaving room for continued upside. Recent candlestick formations, spinning tops, Doji candles, and a bullish engulfing pattern, underscore a tug of war between bulls and bears, with momentum slowly tipping toward buyers.

Ethereum price prediction is likely to be bullish if ETH breaks above $4,115, the next resistance lies at $4,298 and $4,550, supported by historical Fibonacci levels. A rejection at current levels, however, could drag ETH toward $3,712 or $3,510, where demand has previously emerged.

For traders, a breakout above $4,115 offers a favorable long opportunity, targeting $4,298–$4,550, with a stop below $3,920. Conversely, a drop under $3,920 could open the door for short-term bearish setups toward $3,510.

Ethereum's tightening price structure reflects volatility buildup – a condition often followed by sharp expansion moves. Whether it's a bullish surge or a bearish pullback, this breakout is likely to define ETH's direction heading into November 2025.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin's stability with Solana's high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin.

Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $24.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013165 before the next increase.

As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto's biggest ecosystems.

If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Ferrari makes history by organizing the first auction of a legendary racing car, the 499P Hypercar, exclusively in crypto. This initiative, combining technological innovation, AI, and automotive tradition, aims to attract a new generation of investors. Analysis of an auction that could revolutionize the luxury market.

One year after its arrival in Europe with BTC payments, Ferrari announces an exceptional auction for its 499P Hypercar, triple winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, reserved for its most exclusive clients. To participate, bidders must use a dedicated digital token, the Ferrari 499P Token, created especially for the occasion. This crypto token, developed in collaboration with the Italian fintech Conio, will allow members of the Hyperclub – a closed circle of 100 endurance enthusiasts – to submit bids on a secure platform.

The process is quite simple:

Accepted cryptos include bitcoin, ethereum, and USDC, with automatic conversion to fiat currency to facilitate exchanges. The auction, scheduled for 2027, is part of the World Endurance Championship, adding a sporting and prestigious dimension to the event. Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a key role in this auction. Algorithms will analyze real-time data to detect trends, prevent fraud, and optimize participant experience.

The auction for Ferrari's 499P Hypercar continues the brand's crypto strategy, which already accepts payments in bitcoin, ethereum, and USDC for its new vehicles since 2023. By choosing an iconic racing car like the 499P, the Italian brand specifically targets crypto-millionaires and technology enthusiasts, a rapidly growing market.

The Ferrari 499P Token is not just a payment tool. It symbolizes Ferrari's commitment to innovation and modernization of its processes. By integrating blockchain and AI, Ferrari shows how luxury can adapt to new investor expectations. All this while preserving its prestige. This initiative places the brand as a pioneer, ahead of competitors like Lamborghini or Porsche, who are only beginning to explore crypto payments.

This auction raises an important question: can cryptos and AI become standards in the luxury sector? Ferrari shows that these technologies allow modernization of sales processes while attracting a young and wealthy clientele. The Ferrari 499P Token, coupled with AI analysis tools, offers a tailored and secure experience.

However, challenges remain. Cryptocurrency volatility and regulatory uncertainties could deter some investors. Yet, Ferrari appears determined to overcome these obstacles, leveraging its prestige and expertise. Experts believe this initiative could become a benchmark! This would pave the way for other similar auctions in the luxury world.

Ferrari thus reinvents luxury auctions by integrating crypto and AI, proving that tradition and innovation can coexist. This initiative poses questions about the future of high-end transactions: will cryptocurrencies become essential?

The crypto market is showing positive momentum as Ethereum and Dogecoin see gains. Amid these new animal spirits, Digitap ($TAP), a new player, is attracting attention due to its utility-based model and its applicability in cross-border payments.

The platform will simplify the process of payments to freelancers, migrants, and businesses. It has already amassed over $1 million in funds and sold 72 million coins. Given its features and rising interest, whale investors have added it to their watchlists as one of the potential coins to hold for 100x gains.



As the crypto market recovers, Ethereum has emerged as one of the top 10 crypto coins to watch at the moment. It has seen a slight recovery on the weekly chart. Still, data from CoinMarketCap shows that the Ethereum price is up by 7% on the 1W chart.



Meanwhile, whales have been accumulating Ethereum. Lookonchain data shows that a whale recently bought 8,491 $ETH. For a meaningful bullish breakout, the ETH price must clear the $3,950–$4,000 zone. Ethereum has acted as a resistance cluster over the past week. 

Sustained movement above that region could open the path for the price of Ethereum to rally toward $4,200 and $4,400. Conversely, if sellers return and drive prices below the $3,780–$3,750 support area, Ethereum could slide toward the psychological $3,600 level.

Crypto Caesar predicts that the Ethereum price might soar to $4,500 after forming a triple bottom pattern. Four Crypto Spaces also confirmed the triple bottom pattern. He says the Ethereum price may climb to $4,700.

CryptoBullet1 is also optimistic about ETH. He told his followers that ETH is tracking Bitcoin's fractal from February to December 2024. According to the expert, the price of ETH may shoot up to a new high of $6,800.

DOGE is witnessing positive movement after a recent pullback. The Dogecoin price is up 4.6% in the weekly chart, per CoinMarketCap.



This uptrend shows that buying interest is rising in the crypto market after a steep decline earlier in October. Dogecoin's RSI has risen to 41.97, which is a sign of a bullish trend. However, the price of Dogecoin is still within bearish territory. 



This suggests there is room for a Dogecoin rally if buying pressure increases. However, investors' confidence remains shaky as the Fear and Greed Index reads Fear.

Ali_Charts noted that the Dogecoin price is ready to rebound. Also, Javon Marks notes that Dogecoin's chart points towards a 270% price spike. 

Don't make it more complicated than it is.$DOGE‘s trend points toward a nearly +270% move to All Time Highs with high likeliness of an extension.

He said that the memecoin trades inside a rising channel and could soar to the middle of the channel, which corresponds to $0.25, or to the top, which is $0.33. Meanwhile, RAFAELA_RIGO_ expects the price of DOGE to climb to $0.24.

Digitap is creating a unique path in finance by merging traditional banking systems and DeFi into one platform. It seeks to take advantage of the increasing demand for quick digital transactions. Research shows that digital wallet transactions might reach over $16 trillion by 2028. 

The platform created by Digitap will allow its users to deposit fiat, store various types of cryptocurrencies, exchange assets in real-time, and connect to a Visa-issued card, enabling them to spend their crypto on Apple Pay or Google Pay.

XRP (XRP/USD) ended the week with an impressive 11.4% gain, outperforming most major altcoins and reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $2.62, up 2.63% in the past 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $3.68 billion.

XRP ranks #4 globally, commanding a market cap of $157.4 billion and a circulating supply of over 60 billion coins.

The steady climb in XRP's price comes amid renewed optimism in the broader crypto market and increased institutional engagement, driven by Ripple's ongoing expansion in global payments. However, technical indicators suggest that XRP may still be consolidating before confirming its next major move.

Despite the week's strong performance, XRP's chart structure remains cautious. The token is forming a descending triangle pattern, defined by lower highs near $2.71 and a flat base at $2.26. This formation typically signals waning bullish strength and potential continuation of a corrective phase if resistance levels fail to break.

Key signals include:

For XRP to regain momentum, it must decisively break above $2.72. Failure to do so could confirm resistance, pulling the price back toward $2.26 or even $2.02, where historical demand has previously stabilized the market.

From a trading standpoint, XRP price prediction is at a technical crossroads. Short-term traders are closely monitoring the $2.70–$2.72 zone for a breakout confirmation. A successful close above this level could open the path toward $3.15, aligning with prior swing highs. Conversely, rejection at this resistance could reintroduce bearish momentum.

Trade Outlook:

In summary, while XRP's 11.4% weekly gain underscores growing optimism, the token remains technically constrained within a descending triangle. A clear breakout will be needed to confirm whether this rally marks the start of a larger recovery or just another pause before the next pullback.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin's stability with Solana's high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin.

Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $24.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013165 before the next increase.

As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto's biggest ecosystems.

If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin a stark reminder that while blockchain security prevents even a majority of validator collusion from stealing on-chain assets, this protection vanishes completely when users trust validators with off-chain tasks.

He noted that if 51% of validators collude or fall victim to software bugs, they cannot steal assets stored on-chain, but this ironclad protection vanishes the moment users trust validators with tasks beyond the blockchain's direct control.

Regular reminder:A key property of a blockchain is that even a 51% attack *cannot make an invalid block valid*. This means even 51% of validators colluding (or hit by a software bug) cannot steal your assets.However, this property does not carry over if you start trusting…— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) 

The warning particularly highlights a critical but often misunderstood boundary in blockchain architecture. 

While on-chain funds remain cryptographically protected even under majority-attacker attacks, any off-chain activity that relies on validator honesty leaves users vulnerable to manipulation with no recourse.The Security Boundary Blockchain Can't Cross

Blockchain protocols enforce strict validation rules that every node independently verifies by checking transaction signatures, preventing double-spending, and ensuring that state transitions follow the protocol logic. 

This decentralized verification means colluding validators cannot forge transactions or create invalid blocks that steal user funds. 

The system's distributed nature ensures that even majority control cannot override these fundamental safeguards.Source: 

However, this protection breaks down when validators handle off-chain tasks like oracle data feeds, governance decisions, or restaking services. 

These activities fall outside the blockchain's algorithmic enforcement and rely instead on validator honesty. 

A colluding majority could provide false data or manipulated outcomes without the cryptographic proofs that protect on-chain transactions.

Users affected by such off-chain collusion have no automatic dispute-resolution or recovery mechanism. 

The blockchain cannot verify or contest decisions made beyond its consensus layer, leaving victims without the recourse that makes on-chain assets fundamentally secure.Why Off-Chain Trust Amplifies Risk

Traditional blockchain verification requires computers to perform 100 times as much work as the original calculation. 

However, when users move funds off-chain, through custodial wallets, centralized exchanges, or validator-controlled computations, they surrender the blockchain's built-in protections. 

Off-chain systems lack the independent verification that every on-chain node provides, leaving them vulnerable to majority validator manipulation.

The distinction matters because blockchain consensus operates through algorithmic rule enforcement that no single party controls.Source: 

Off-chain activities depend on coordinated behavior and validator integrity, but not on protocol-level verification. 

Smart contracts that rely on validator-provided oracle data could yield incorrect outcomes if a majority colludes to report false information, potentially causing financial losses that on-chain mechanisms cannot prevent or reverse.

When whether his warning referenced restaking protocols like EigenLayer, Buterin the platform addresses this vulnerability through slashing mechanisms using its own token. 

Eigenlayer relies on slashing (for subjective criteria using its own token) for this exact reason— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) 

This economic penalty system provides some protection but cannot match the cryptographic guarantees that secure on-chain block validity against majority attacks.Balancing Privacy with Blockchain's Transparency Shield

Buterin's security reminder comes as Ethereum pursues major privacy improvements that are different from the network's traditionally transparent nature. 

Earlier this month, he detailed GKR, a cryptographic technique that verifies calculations 10 times faster than traditional methods while enabling zero-knowledge proofs, allowing computers to prove calculations are correct without revealing the underlying data.

The Ethereum Foundation also launched a 47-member Privacy Cluster in September to make network privacy default rather than optional, addressing concerns that public blockchains expose too much financial information. 

Aside from enterprise demand, Vitalik sees it as the only way to global adoption, especially for Ethereum.

❓️ Imagine if your bank account had a public URL. That's the reality of crypto today, and why it "will never scale beyond a niche,” says Petro Golovko. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) 

Just recently, while speaking with Cryptonews, industry expert Petro Golovko compared current blockchain transparency to the pre-encryption internet era, arguing that systems exposing salaries and account balances remain “unusable for regular people and impossible for institutions.” 

The initiative aims to enable private transactions, selective identity disclosure, and improved user privacy experience without sacrificing the verification mechanisms that prevent validator manipulation.

However, the privacy push creates an apparent paradox. If transactions become private, how can the network maintain the transparent verification that protects against off-chain manipulation, Buterin warned about? 

The solution lies in cryptographic techniques like GKR that allow verification of transaction validity without exposing transaction details, preserving the blockchain's core security property where invalid blocks remain rejected even under majority attacks, while shielding sensitive financial data from public view.

Kyrgyzstan has rolled out a new stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Kyrgyzstani som, while confirming plans to issue a central bank digital currency and explore a digital asset reserve.

The KGST stablecoin will run on the BNB Chain, and BNB (BNB) would be included in the crypto reserve if launched, according to former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao, who attended the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies' second meeting on Friday with President Sadyr Japarov.

The first meeting took place around April, when CZ became a strategic adviser for Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee.

Local media outlet KG24 said Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee must ensure the KGST stablecoin is listed on international platforms and submit proposals for creating a national crypto reserve within two months.

Kyrgyzstan's latest moves highlight how crypto adoption is advancing at the nation-state level by experimenting with stablecoins and CBDCs to modernize payments, improve financial inclusion, boost transparency, and attract investment.

Japarov also advised the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to continue crafting a legislative framework for virtual assets and for the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic to begin pilot testing of the digital som.

Kyrgyzstan moves forward with CBDC plans

The pilot will run in three stages, building on the National Bank's demo of the digital som platform built with Build Block TECH. It will first connect commercial banks to enable transfers, then link the Central Treasury for social and government payments, and finally test offline and low-connectivity transactions ahead of a national rollout.

"After successfully piloting all three phases, the platform will be rolled out nationally and scaled," Kyrgyzstan's top bank said. 

The National Bank initially said in April that it wouldn't make a decision on whether to issue a CBDC until the end of 2026. 

While over 100 nations have initiated CBDC projects, only three CBDCs are currently live — the Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria's e-Naira and Jamaica's JAM-DEX, data from cbdctracker.org shows.

Education is also a focal point for Kyrgyzstan

Meanwhile, Japarov also advised the Ministry of Science, Higher Education, and Innovation to submit proposals on how it intends to develop digital financial literacy plans and train specialists in the blockchain and AI industries.

Nino Paoli is a Dow Jones News Fund fellow at Fortune on the News desk.

The White House has released a list of donors for the Trump administration's new ballroom construction project, following a historic East Wing demolition that began this week.

The estimated cost of the 90,000-square-foot build has topped $300 million, up from its July estimate of $200 million. President Donald Trump has insisted it will not come out of taxpayers' wallets. 





A list released by White House officials and reviewed by Fortune shows all 37 donors footing the bill instead—and it includes some of the nation's largest tech companies, companies with government contracts and members of the administration. 





Their private, tax-deductible donations will be made to the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall. The White House did not release the size of the donations for all 37 listed. Trump has previously said he will pay for some of the project, though his name doesn't appear on the list. 





1. Meta Platforms




CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously attended a White House dinner for tech leaders in September, where he pledged at least $600 billion in investments in the U.S. by 2028. Meta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, frequently engages with federal digital policy initiatives and AI oversight forums.





2. Apple


The company announced plans in August to invest $100 billion in domestic manufacturing, aligning with Trump's wishes to reshore industrial work. CEO Tim Cook also attended the White House dinner last month and has maintained a close relationship with the administration.

5. Lockheed Martin 


The defense contractor is a major supplier for Pentagon programs and has received $33.4 billion in federal contract awards in 2025 alone, according to USA Spending. The company is reportedly contributing more than $10 million to the ballroom.

17. Caterpillar 


The heavy‑machinery manufacturer is viewed by the administration as symbolic of the “Made in America” push.





18. Booz Allen Hamilton 




The defense and cybersecurity contractor said in its second-quarter earnings call that 90% of its $7.2 billion made in bookings in the quarter came from national security work.





19. HP 


The computer hardware maker gave $50,000 to Trump's 2025 inaugural committee and has received contracts from the U.S. military and other departments.





20. NextEra Energy 


The top renewable‑energy utility's CEO, John Ketchum, previously said he agrees with the administration's focus on bringing jobs back to America, but has also criticized Trump's efforts to boost the coal industry.

NEW YORK, NY, October 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Korean artist BDKim (Kim Dae-Yong) announced a special project celebrating world peace and APEC 2025 through his official website (www.Daum.ai) on October 22, 2025.

Kim suspended all artistic activities following the declaration of martial law in South Korea on December 3, 2024. As political stability returned, he resumed his work and launched the nationwide art tour project "BDKim – Art on the Move."

As part of this initiative, a 1.2-ton wing-body truck has been transformed into a mobile gallery and has been touring the country since October 3.

The journey will culminate in Gyeongju, where leaders of the 21 APEC member economies will gather. At the Mojeon Stone Brick Pagoda at Bunhwangsa Temple in Gyeongju, Kim will unveil two 2.5-meter original canvases, the truck installation, and dozens of video and NFT artworks.

The canvas works include previously unreleased pieces originally created for an exhibition atop Mount Baekdu one year ago.

The NFT video artworks — titled "Dancing Flags of Peace" — reinterpret the national flags of APEC member economies and are dedicated to their leaders and citizens. Each piece is a five-second video composition expressing the harmony of Yin and Yang energies.

Importantly, the NFTs do not rely on external URL links; instead, the digital assets are directly uploaded and permanently preserved on-chain through a third-generation Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain node.

This fully decentralized blockchain technology — SASEUL PoW Chain, independently developed over seven years by Artifriends Co., Ltd. (CEO Jeongwoo Lee) — has been recognized for its technological integrity through its listing on the BitMart exchange and is preparing for a hard fork.

In 2023, Elon Musk emphasized on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast that NFTs depending on off-chain URLs are inherently vulnerable, stating that digital artworks such as JPEGs must be encoded directly onto the blockchain.

Reflecting this principle, Kim noted that his entire collection is stored securely and immutably on-chain, to be presented as gifts to APEC nations and shared publicly through social media.

In addition to the NFT dedication works, three supplementary video versions (6-second, 30-second, and 2-minute cuts) have already been delivered to the embassies of all 21 member economies, accompanied by official invitations to national leaders and relevant officials.

Kim explains that "Beyond the Whole World" and "Dancing Flags of Peace" embody the energy of peace and the origins of primordial art for the future spiritual era — a cultural legacy for generations to come.

Looking ahead, Kim plans to present the complete five-piece set of "Beyond the Whole World" — including three previously unreleased works, totaling 12 meters — at Mt. Baekdu in North Korea, together with artists from across the world.

This peace-themed international exhibition is expected to draw significant attention within the global art community. News about BDKim's planned Mount Baekdu exhibition was previously reported by North Korea–related media outlets, referring to his intention rather than an ongoing project.

As the contemporary art world faces stagnation, whether BDKim's artistic universe will illuminate a new path remains to be seen — yet growing global attention is already turning toward his next steps.# # #

Ethereum continues to display choppy price action, remaining confined within a critical range as both buyers and sellers await a decisive breakout. Further consolidation is likely before a clear directional move takes shape.

By Shayan

On the daily timeframe, Ethereum's consolidation phase has extended, with volatility and momentum both fading. Price action remains trapped within a crucial range defined by the 100-day moving average and the flag pattern's upper boundary near $4.1K. This region represents a key supply zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts.

On the downside, the flag's lower boundary, aligning with the $3.5K demand zone, acts as the primary support where buyers have consistently defended. Until a breakout occurs, Ethereum is expected to continue consolidating within this structure, absorbing order flow and building liquidity. A confirmed bullish breakout above $4.1K could likely trigger an impulsive rally toward a new all-time high (ATH).



The 4-hour timeframe reveals Ethereum fluctuating inside a symmetrical triangle, reflecting ongoing market indecision and equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The asset is currently trading just below the triangle's upper boundary near $4K, with momentum still insufficient for a confirmed breakout.

This compression pattern signals a liquidity buildup phase, where traders are positioning ahead of a potential volatility expansion. If bulls manage to push above the upper trendline, a rally toward $4.1K and potentially $4.6K could follow. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would expose the $3.4K demand zone once again. Until confirmation, Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within this narrowing range — a setup that typically precedes a sharp directional breakout.



By Shayan

The 1-month liquidation heatmap for Ethereum reveals a dense liquidity pocket forming above the $4.8K swing high, situated directly beyond the current symmetrical consolidation structure. This area corresponds to a significant cluster of resting short liquidations, implying that if Ethereum reclaims the mid-range near $4.1K–$4.3K, a rapid move to absorb this overhead liquidity could follow.

Below the current price, the $3.5K range displays relatively weaker liquidation density, indicating that much of the downside liquidity was already cleared during last week's sell-off, though a smaller residual cluster remains. This configuration reinforces the idea that Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within its present consolidation range until one of these liquidity pockets is decisively tested.

Overall, the heatmap confirms that short-term volatility will remain concentrated within the $3.4K–$4.8K corridor, with the upper range carrying a slightly higher probability of being targeted first due to the larger liquidity concentration above current levels.

Home - Crypto Presales - Inside BlockDAG's Over $430M Digital City: Hybrid DAG + PoW Tech Powers a New Blockchain Civilization!

The conversation around digital assets is changing, and BlockDAG is leading that transformation. It isn't just launching a currency, it's constructing an entire digital metropolis. Priced at $0.0015 for a limited time, and with over $430 million raised, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers far more than a traditional crypto entry; it's an opportunity to own a piece of a functioning digital economy before the world moves in.



Instead of buying into a single product, participants are effectively taking part in a self-sustaining city's economy. As more builders and users join, its ecosystem expands in both value and utility. This approach reshapes what digital ownership can mean, positioning BlockDAG as the blueprint for a new kind of online civilization.

At its core, BlockDAG serves as the operating framework for decentralized growth. It tackles the long-debated “Blockchain Trilemma,” ensuring no compromise between speed, security, and decentralization. The platform achieves this balance through its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work architecture.

Unbreakable Security: Using the proven Proof-of-Work mechanism, BlockDAG ensures immutability and resistance to attacks.



Unmatched Throughput: The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure enables parallel transaction confirmations, achieving speeds of up to 15,000 transactions per second.











This dual-layer design allows for smooth scalability while maintaining Bitcoin-grade reliability. It forms the groundwork for next-generation decentralized applications, offering developers a system capable of handling both enterprise-scale demands and community-driven projects with ease.

Unlike projects that rely on distant promises, BlockDAG's infrastructure is already active. Key components of this “digital city” are operational, establishing credibility and reducing the uncertainty typical of new launches.

The Power Grid: The Awakening Testnet is live, demonstrating performance and security under real conditions.

Roads and Bridges: Full EVM compatibility lets developers seamlessly migrate or deploy decentralized applications.

A Growing Population: Over $430 M raised and more than 3.5 million X1 mobile miners are already engaged, ensuring widespread adoption and early participation.

This combination of live technology and a growing community makes BlockDAG more than a concept; it's a functioning digital environment, ready to scale. Developers and users aren't waiting for promises; they're already contributing to a network that's operational and expanding daily.

At the heart of BlockDAG's city lies a thriving economy driven by real demand. Its native currency, BDAG, powers all on-chain activities, acting as the system's essential utility. The more people and applications that interact within the ecosystem, the greater the natural demand for BDAG, creating sustainable, built-in growth.

Fuel for dApps: All decentralized applications on the network use BDAG for execution and smart contracts.

Commerce and Transactions: From in-game assets to DeFi platforms, BDAG functions as the medium of exchange across the city.

Scalable Demand: As adoption accelerates, usage increases organically, ensuring continuous economic expansion.

This self-reinforcing model transforms BlockDAG into more than a blockchain; it becomes a living economy, where currency and utility move hand in hand.

The project's foundation of trust and transparency is reflected in its $430 million presale success, backed by 312,000+ holders. Each milestone has added proof that this is a movement with tangible traction and real-world support.

Massive Community Trust: A historic presale that continues to draw strong global participation.

Global Visibility: A multi-year partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team amplifies its global recognition, aligning the brand with speed, precision, and endurance.

High ROI Potential: With the presale price locked at $0.0015 until Genesis Day, and a projected listing price of $0.05, early participants could see a 32x potential upside based on fundamentals, not speculation.












This alignment of marketing scale, verified technology, and widespread adoption positions BlockDAG to be one of the defining projects of the coming market cycle.

BlockDAG isn't just building another network; it's laying the foundation for a digital civilization. Its hybrid DAG + PoW design provides the infrastructure, the live testnet and mining community validate its operation, and the thriving presale community adds financial strength. Every element, from the ecosystem's architecture to its cultural partnerships, reinforces one idea: this isn't a speculative asset, it's a functioning digital city in progress.

By bridging real-world structure with blockchain performance, BlockDAG represents the next phase of digital expansion. The opportunity to join before its official Genesis Day on November 26 offers a moment to claim a position within a growing, self-sustaining ecosystem.

 A stablecoin is now live in Kyrgyzstan, which confirmed plans to launch a CBDC and explore a national crypto reserve after meeting with strategic adviser Changpeng Zhao. 

Kyrgyzstan has rolled out a new stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Kyrgyzstani som, while confirming plans to issue a central bank digital currency and explore a digital asset reserve.

The KGST stablecoin will run on the BNB Chain, and BNB (BNB) would be included in the crypto reserve if launched, according to former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao, who attended the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies' second meeting on Friday with President Sadyr Japarov.

The first meeting took place around April, when CZ became a strategic adviser for Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee.

Local media outlet KG24 said Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee must ensure the KGST stablecoin is listed on international platforms and submit proposals for creating a national crypto reserve within two months.

Kyrgyzstan's latest moves highlight how crypto adoption is advancing at the nation-state level by experimenting with stablecoins and CBDCs to modernize payments, improve financial inclusion, boost transparency and attract investment.

Japarov also advised the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to continue crafting a legislative framework for virtual assets and for the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic to begin pilot testing of the digital som.

The pilot will run in three stages, building on the National Bank's demo of the digital som platform built with Build Block TECH. It will first connect commercial banks to enable transfers, then link the Central Treasury for social and government payments, and finally test offline and low-connectivity transactions ahead of a national rollout.

"After successfully piloting all three phases, the platform will be rolled out nationally and scaled," Kyrgyzstan's top bank said. 

The National Bank initially said in April that it wouldn't make a decision on whether to issue a CBDC until the end of 2026.

While over 100 nations have initiated CBDC projects, only three CBDCs are currently live — the Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria's e-Naira and Jamaica's JAM-DEX, data from cbdctracker.org shows.

Meanwhile, Japarov also advised the Ministry of Science, Higher Education, and Innovation to submit proposals on how it intends to develop digital financial literacy plans and train specialists in the blockchain and AI industries.

CZ said Kyrgyzstan would integrate Binance's education arm, Binance Academy, with 10 of its top universities and “fully localize” the Binance app across the south Asian country.

It comes as CZ was pardoned on Wednesday by US President Donald Trump over anti-money laundering violations while serving as Binance CEO.

Copper wire thefts have increased in Los Angeles and other cities, but with thieves looking outside of street lights for cables to cut, drivers expecting to use EV chargers are sometimes caught off-guard. But for the person trying to steal copper from the station, the crime is a dangerous proposition. Given the high voltage charging units use, and not a lot of money from scrap buyers, it's only questionably worth the effort. For those trying to stop this scourge, a focus on the economics involved could potentially produce a solution.With a significant number of the cut cables and smashed charging units being harvested for copper wire now, companies, governments and EV advocates are proposing everything from greater enforcement and penalties to cables that cover a vandal with ink—similar to the measures employed against bank robbers. Such a system has also been discussed in the UK, according to a BBC story from April.Los Angeles-based ChargerHelp, which helps train technicians to diagnose and repair EV charging stations and offers data on station uptime and downtime, and the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, recently spoke about the problem in that city where many neighborhoods continue to experience widespread copper wire thefts, leaving some of them dark. Thefts at public and workplace EV charging stations have also grown and also cost hundreds or thousands of dollars each to repair.“For level two, slower chargers, you're seeing anywhere between $650 to $700 for the connector plus the labor. But then, when you start talking about DC fast chargers, it can go all the way up to $1,500,” ChargerHelp CEO Kameale C. Terry told Los Angeles' KABC on Oct. 22. Some solutions sound simple, such as thicker cables that are harder to cut, or using wireless charging pads for cars. But thicker cables are heavier and more cumbersome to use for some drivers and the only EV with wireless charging capability set for sale in the US is the Porsche Cayenne Electric, which at this point has only been seen in prototype form.Several bills in California have been signed in the last few years to hold various agencies accountable for broken and vandalized public EV charging stations in the state, such as mandating governments to identify and repair broken charging units within 30 days.California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a bill into law that imposes stricter laws and penalties for metal recycling, including identification and personal information from the seller, identification of the vehicle used to transport the material, and proof that the metal being sold was legally obtained. There are also restrictions on what metal scrap buyers can lawfully accept, with an eye toward materials from EV chargers. Matt Petersen, CEO of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, said even charging stations at his offices, have been targeted. And he and Terry told KABC that they are concerned more downtime and vandalism of charging stations will further hurt EV adoption, and slow the addition of stations for existing electric drivers—unless solutions are found soon.“All our focus is, ‘How do we accelerate transportation electrification?'”

A teardown from Northridge Fix finds a damaged connector that can't be replaced.

The GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition is Nvidia's own-brand flagship GPU for consumers, but one repair technician says it comes with a hidden flaw that makes it “one of the worst designs in the history of… GPUs,” he's seen. In a teardown uploaded to the Northridge Fix YouTube channel, the card was declared unrepairable after damage to an internal connector — one that, the technician claims, cannot be replaced or sourced.

The card in question was sent in after it stopped outputting video following the installation of a third-party water block. While one of the customer's two cards was successfully repaired, the Founders Edition model wasn't so lucky. “I checked all contacts,” Alex explains in the teardown. “I inspected the voltage rails; everything is within range, but we do not have an image on the screen.” Eventually, the fault was traced to a board-to-board connector inside the FE's modular two-part construction.

The GPU repair expert goes on to explain that the Founders Edition is built in two sections — the main card and the PCIe connector assembly — joined by what he calls “a very fragile FPC connector.” Comparing it to plumbing, he argues that every extra joint adds a new potential failure point: “The more connections you have, the more likely you're going to have a failing point… the same goes with the 5090.”

After inspecting “every single pin”, Alex points to what he calls a damaged connector. “He installed a water block, the card stopped working, and that's because of the damage that we see here,” he says. “No other damage was found on the board, and that's the only physical damage I see.”

Northridge Fix's expert host, who has previously covered melting RTX 4090s, adds that the connector, which carries signals between the GPU and the PCIe interface, cannot be sourced as a replacement. “I went online to look for this connector, and I was not able to get my hands on this connector,” he says. “You cannot even get your hands on this if it broke for whatever reason… So what's the use of having this made in two pieces if you cannot buy a replacement?”

He concludes by warning owners against attempting to open the Founders Edition at all. “If it's not broken, do not fix it,” he says. “I would stay as far away from the Founders Edition 5090 as I possibly can.”

Razer's $230 Clio headrest speaker did not appreciate the shape of my home gaming chair. I own a cheap chair—technically a hand-me-down from my father—and the speaker likely fetches more than the chair itself. But the Clio didn't reject the bum support. It simply did not fit around the back of the chair. The device would sit too far down, and sound literally blasted into my upper back, rather than my ears—which is where you want the sound to go.

I've used plenty of odd speaker setups, including neck speakers like Sony's Bravia Theater U that promises to offer personalized audio without the need to sandwich your head between two cans. There's certainly an audience that is looking for high-quality, room-filling audio that doesn't actually fill the room—further incentivizing angry neighbors to knock down your door.

Razer Clio

The Razer Clio is awkward to attach to your chair, and even when you get it on, it won't provide the sound you expect from these large speakers.

Pros

Cons

In that way, the Clio fits the bill. Even though I work in an open office, I wasn't annoying my deskmates too much as I tested out my chair speaker on the other side of the room. They could hear me, certainly, but the “near-field” directional speakers on either side of the headrest kept the sound contained. Of course, what would be even less distracting is a quality pair of headphones with solid active noise cancellation to avoid any ambient sound bleeding.

The Clio nearly makes a case for itself—especially if you're looking for a device to perfect your Razer surround sound setup. It's also brought down by its attempts to keep you from developing tinnitus, protecting your ears from the might of two speakers with large drivers. It likely offers the personalized surround sound experience you want; it won't if you're used to high-end gaming headsets. Those headsets won't reject you just because you tend to slump forward, nor poorly fit your chair just because it doesn't have the right headrest circumferance.

I already mentioned my problems getting the Clio to accept the curves of my home gaming chair. Razer cites that any chair with a headrest circumference of  47 to 65 cm (18.5 to 25.5 inches) should be compatible, but how often are people measuring the tops of their chairs? To aid me in my predicament, Razer sent me a loaner of its own expensive and excessively ergonomic Iskur V2 X gaming chair so I could position the device correctly, just behind my ears. The Iskur is the kind of chair that reminds you of all your poor sitting habits. It's comfortable and curves to the shape of your spine. Even though it's made with Razer's products in mind, the $300 gaming chair isn't designed perfectly for the Clio.

The speaker uses two horizontal bands with adjustable buckles that are supposed to tighten against the chair's back. You would imagine Razer would opt for stretchy bands to offer a snug fit. Instead, you end up doing your best to angle and tighten the Clio so the speakers sit to the left and right of your head. On Razer's Iskur chair, that meant I couldn't wrap the bottom strap all the way around the chair back, leaving the ends dangling.

The headrest itself is comfortable enough if you decide to lean your head back into it. The two wings are made of stiffer material you won't want to rest your head on. The thing is, I don't know many people who normally lean back far enough that they will keep their head and neck straight. If you're a PC gamer, you're more keen to lean toward your keyboard and mouse. When in this position, you won't get the prime experience the Clio is trying to offer. If you're a console gamer, get ready to sit straight-backed, like a soldier on parade, if you want the best quality audio listening with Razer's 2.4GHz “Hyperspeed” dongle.

The Clio, like nearly every other Razer product, needs to connect through Razer Synapse PC software for firmware updates and to control the EQ, or equalization options. You only have three settings to chose from: Game, Movie, and Music. You can customize your options based on your preferences, but I found the Game option felt more flat than the Movie preset, no matter if I was watching Netflix, YouTube, or hearing the rattle of gunshots in Battlefield 6.

On the top of the speaker are controls for on and off, volume up and down, and another switch for toggling between Bluetooth and a 2.4GHz dongle connection. The dongle itself uses USB-C, and sticks out in an “L” shape, which thankfully helps you avoid taking up too much space on your desktop. There's a single USB-C port on the headrest for charging, though you'll also have to use it if Synapse forces you to update the firmware.

The Clio speaker looks enormous; big enough you may assume its twin full-range drivers would somehow offer the full soundbar plus subwoofer experience behind your head. But no, it's actually more closely aligned to the many, many headphones you may go out and buy right now—just larger. And despite the size, the sound really doesn't feel “large” in the way you would expect for a separate, $230 full-range speaker.

The Clio makes use of 43mm drivers with an aluminum core. If you assumed that would create some head-pounding bass, you may be dissapointed. The sound is more subtle than that. Even when I maxed out it and my PC's volume, I didn't feel ratttled by it. Then, if you tend to lean over at all in your chair, you'll start to miss out on the best audio quality. Sorry, but I don't have an English gentleman's sense of perfect posture. I grew up playing games on my basement couch. My spine is a permanent letter “C.”

On completely balanced EQ settings, I felt I was getting the most out of the speaker's sound suite. Gunfire in some games could sound slightly muffled, but it wasn't so toned down I couldn't hear small differences in various weapons in a game like Cyberpunk 2077. I tried to put on a number of games with more overt or subtle audio. As I played through Marvel's Spider-Man 2, there was a part of me that knew I could be feeling the horns on the soundtrack deeper in my chest.

The Clio's sound was balanced and clear without any sense of “wow” factor in anything I played. Audio when playing any shooter game needs to be punctuated with the hard staccato of a machine gun, but sitting in my chair I felt like I was peppering my environment by loose gravel. The subtle lutes and lyres of Baldur's Gate III need more of a twang to help sell the fantasy than what the Clio can fully provide. Audio quality felt better-tuned to a game like Ninja Gaiden 4, where the sound of your slicing and dicing has the satisfying quality of being on the right side of a butcher's block.

The headrrest speaker also felt better situated for listening to music. My usual slate of indie folk rock felt tuned for this device. Andrew Bird could swoon and fiddle, and I felt right at home. Heavier music that you want to feel deep in your spine will offer a slight tingle instead. Again, the audio felt about right for the price for passive listening, especially with your back pressed up against the chair. It's what I would want from a relatively cheap speaker setup but without needing to stick multiple speaker units around your desk. However, in that case, it wouldn't matter how you sit if you were hoping to get the full effect.

The one unique feature of the Clio is that it can act as the driver seat for a kind of 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound setup. More specifically, the Clio can work as a rear speaker while another device can perform as front speakers. You could use your monitor or laptop's built-in speakers to do the job, though that clearly isn't the best use case. You'll want an actual speaker setup in front of you. However Razer's Synapse software failed to recognize separate speakers like a BlueAnt Soundblade soundbar. It's just another quirk of Razer's software, of which there are many. You will have a much better time if you plug in other Razer speaker or soundbars, like the company's Leviathan V2.

If your content doesn't support full surround sound, hitting the setting for audio mirroring will provide a better full-sound experience. In this mode, you don't need to worry about your head's position for the best audio experience. If you have any type of desktop speaker setup, the Clio may actually be a great addition if you don't want to bother with placing speakers on the other side of your gaming room. That would also defeat the purpose of the “near-field” speakers if you were hoping to let your roommates sleep in.

One of the big selling points behind this speaker is the promise of THX immersive audio. In Synapse, you can get a demo of the spatial audio sensation as sound moves around the room. Again, in games, the “spatial” sensibility is less distinctive. I could get a better spatial sense out of Razer's own Kraken V4 Pro headset. If you were hoping these drivers could offer enough bass that it would run from your spine to the tips of your toes, you'd also come away disappointed.

Clio promises a battery life of up to 14 hours, which is considerably less than many of the big name wireless headsets out there which promise at least 30 or more hours of listening time. In my days using it, I didn't have to worry about that much considering I can barely get in a few hours of gaming a week, at most. Charging the device isn't all that difficult if you have an extra-long USB-C cable. Otherwise, you'll need to take the Clio off your chair to bring it somewhere to give it that extra juice.

My mind kept going back to the various headsets I've used all throughout 2025. For the same price, you can grab a pair of headphones that will offer personalized audio with improved bass. An Alienware Pro Wireless headset is notably light on bass compared to similarly priced devices, and I would still prefer it over the Clio to make my spine tingle. A HyperX Cloud III Wireless at $180 also provides meaty sounds without pitching over into annoying highs or lows.

For anything better quality, you end up spending closer to $300 or even more. The cream of this year's crop of headsets is still the Sony Inzone H9 II. It's the moment when “balanced” audio transforms into something more meaningful. Razer's own BlackShark V3 Pro, built for competiive gamers, will cost you $250. A Razer Kraken V4 Pro will set you back $400 when not on sale, but I can confirm it offers truly immersive audio. Yes, all these options involve earcups. The Clio may be that extra piece of kit you needed for your surround sound (if Razer likes your device). Otherwise, most people are better off sticking with what works.

There wasn't a cunning piece of coding behind this thrilling game pacing feature.

One of the most charming bug = feature tales is the story behind the thrilling crescendo of pacing gamers experienced when playing the original Space Invaders arcade machine. This weekend, self-proclaimed C/C++ expert Zuhaitz reminded us that the adrenaline-pumping rising intensity of Taito's arcade classic was not due to genius-level coding. Rather, it was simply the fact that the underlying Intel 8080 could run the game code faster as aliens were wiped from the screen one by one, by the player dishing out laser missile death.

If you ever played Space Invaders you surely noticed that each time you killed an alien the game went faster.But, if you checked the source code from one of the arcade machines, you would find nothing related to this. That's because this mechanic is a hardware accident.The… pic.twitter.com/UkqTEUvC9IOctober 25, 2025

Intel's 8080 processor, launched in 1974, was the successor to the legendary 8008, enhanced with a more powerful and flexible architecture. However, with its ~5,000 transistors, 8/16-bit bus, and ~2.0 MHz clock speed, powering the original Space Invaders with 224 x 256 mono pixels was probably near the limits of its gaming capabilities. Hence, the impact on gameplay ‘feel' as the alien horde was eliminated by the player.

The processor-bottlenecked performance slowdown persisted, even though the CPU was aided by a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter in this cabinet design. Also, a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip was used for the iconic audio.

As Zuhaitz states in the above-linked Tweet, checking the original arcade game's source code confirms there is no code to adjust the game speed as aliens are wiped from the game.

At the beginning of the game, “changing the position, redrawing the sprites and checking for collisions for each one of the 55 aliens was really expensive,” notes the computer engineering prodigy. In a way this isn't just a bug becoming a feature, but for players of the original game this was a killer hook, and helped arcade machine owners liberate gamers of many shiny silvery quarters.

Space Invaders was launched by Taito in Japan in June 1978.

Later versions of the game, and emulators running on more modern, powerful platforms, would need mitigations to implement the ‘arcade perfect gameplay' the original was renowned for. Rewrites and reboots could achieve the correct balance of game pacing using code. However, as emulators like MAME became popular, allowing the running of original code ROMs, they would benefit from custom configurations that limit CPU/timing parameters to period- and architecture-correct levels.

In the remote town of Huaytará, Peru, the building that houses the Church of San Juan Bautista is more than what it seems. It was built upon a three-walled Incan structure called a carpa uasi that exchanged stability for something unexpected.

While the Incan Empire is best known for the iconic 15th-century citadel of Machu Picchu, a team of researchers is investigating the acoustic properties of the carpa uasi, another one-of-a-kind Incan construction that likely dates back to the same century. Their work emphasizes the importance of studying more than what meets the eye—literally—when tracing the footsteps of bygone civilizations.

“We're exploring the possibility that the carpa uasi may have amplified low-frequency sounds, such as drumming, with minimal reverberation,” Stella Nair, associate professor of Indigenous arts of the Americas at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a university statement. “With this research, for the first time, we'll be able to tell what the Incas valued sonically in this building.”

The Inca were a pre-Hispanic civilization whose empire flourished in the 15th and early 16th centuries. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, the Inca Empire stretched along South America's western coast, from modern-day Ecuador to modern-day Chile.

The building in question had only three walls, potentially enabling sound, like drums, to be directed toward the opening and then beyond. Carpa uasi, meaning “tent house,” references that unique structure, and the Inca may have built it specifically to amplify sound and music

“Many people look at Inca architecture and are impressed with the stonework, but that's just the tip of the iceberg,” Nair explained. “They were also concerned with the ephemeral, temporary and impermanent, and sound was one of those things. Sound was deeply valued and an incredibly important part of Andean and Inca architecture — so much so that the builders allowed some instability in this structure just because of its acoustic potential.”

Researchers have long known about the building, but Nair and her colleagues might be the first to recognize its potential for magnifying sound. It is the only known surviving carpa uasi and has endured the last 600 years thanks to the stabilizing force of the church built on top of it. Now, the team is working on a model to explain how sound would have spread through the carpa uasi and outside it.

“Sound studies are really critical, because we tend to emphasize the visual in how we understand the world around us, including our past,” Nair concluded. “But that's not how we experience life—all of our senses are critical. So how we understand ourselves and our history changes if you put sound back into the conversation.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Thomas Wilde on Oct 26, 2025 at 7:00 amOctober 24, 2025 at 12:35 pm

When I was a kid, my mom used to call my Nintendo the “anti-social idiot box.” The widespread assumption back then was that video games, in any format, were a new and particularly efficient way to waste time and money while also becoming an obsessed shut-in.

Over the course of the subsequent decades, video games have grown into both a multi-billion-dollar industry and a much more socially acceptable hobby. While gaming does attract its share of anti-social obsessives, just like any other form of media, I've found it's much more common for people to meet and bond over their mutual enjoyment of the hobby.

Whether it's friends you meet through MMORPGs or fighting games, finding stories and characters that deeply resonate with you, or discussing your latest game in a shared space like Bluesky or a message board, video games often have a positive impact on the people who play them. That impact simply doesn't get a fraction of the press of gaming's various downsides.

That ability is the focus of a new paper from the University of Washington, “'I Would Not Be This Version of Myself Today': Elaborating on the Effects of Eudaimonic Gaming Experiences.” The paper, by Nisha Devasia, Georgia Kenderova, Julie A. Kientz, Jin Ha Lee, and Michele Newman, was the focus of a presentation this month at the Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI-PLAY) in Pittsburgh.

For the paper, the authors surveyed 166 respondents about the “meaningful experiences” they'd had as a result of playing video games, such as rich storytelling, becoming interested in specific skill development, or the experience of watching a narrative shift based upon the player's in-game actions.

According to the paper's abstract, “While much of the research in digital games has emphasized hedonic experiences, such as flow, enjoyment, and positive affect, recent years have seen increased interest in eudaimonic gaming experiences, typically mixed-affect and associated with personal meaningfulness and growth.”

Of the 166 respondents, 78% reported that they'd had meaningful, life-changing experiences from their time playing video games, the researchers said in a UW News story about the paper. 

“We highlighted three conclusions drawn from modeling the data,” Devasia told UW News. “The first is that playing games during stressful times was strongly correlated with positive outcomes for physical and mental health. For example, during COVID, people played games they felt strongly improved their mental health, such as Stardew Valley.”

Devasia also noted that other respondents had developed new interests, such as sports, due to video games they'd played, or gained insight into themselves or their identities from the journeys undertaken by video game protagonists.

“Playing as a character and seeing your choices change the course of events is pretty unique to games, compared with other narrative media like novels or movies,” Devasia said.

“As researchers, we develop games for learning, for instance, for teaching people about misinformation or AI, or promote digital civic engagement, because we want to foster meaningful experiences,” Lee added. “But a lot of the existing research just focuses on the short-term effects of games. This study really helps us understand what actually caused a game to make a difference in someone's life.”

It sounds obvious at first glance if you're someone who grew up around video games. It's almost a given that there's at least one game that made a serious mark on you somehow, especially if you live in a heavily nerd-coded space like the greater Seattle area.

Anecdotally, that strikes me as an underexplored part of the hobby. If anything, there's a strange critical drive in the space to deliberately treat gaming as disposable pop culture, without any real meaning or lasting value. If you read any op-ed in the gaming press that discusses the cultural or political meaning of a video game, someone will inevitably show up in the comments to accuse the author of overthinking something that isn't meant to matter. It's “just a game.”

Even so, modern video games have just as much ability to resonate with their audience as any novel or film, and people who've grown up with them will take lessons away from that. It's something we don't discuss often enough in the field; we'll talk at length about how video games are fun or socially acceptable now or a surprisingly big business, but their influence as culture is less discussed.

“People have a tendency to treat technology as a monolith, as if video games are either good or bad, but there's so much more nuance,” Kientz told UW News. “The design matters. This study hopefully helps us untangle the positive elements. Certainly, there are bad elements — toxicity and addictiveness, for example. But we also see opportunities for growth and connection.”

Much like when Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the newest EVs' switch to Tesla's charging ports has plunged the world into dongle hell.With 2026 models of new and returning electric vehicles officially out on the streets, a new generation of EVs is finally here. These EVs such as the Lucid Gravity, Rivian R1S and R1T and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are all natively built with Tesla's charging connector that allows a seamless connection to its Supercharger network.But we can't escape adapters.The transition to Tesla's NACS, or North American Charging Standard, now means that every plug at public charging stations like those from ChargePoint, Electrify America, EVgo and others outside the Supercharger network now require an adapter. Even home chargers will need an extra piece of plastic to work on new EVs. Like with the “courage” Apple summoned with its transition to Bluetooth connection from wired headphones, the next few years will require endurance—because it's getting messy.Until now, only Tesla EVs (the Model S, 3, X and Y and Cybertruck) needed an adapter to work at every charging station outside the Supercharger network, but now a growing portion of the 4 million EVs in America (as of 2024) are barreling into dongle overload.A Hyundai spokesperson confirmed, “the vehicles come with two adapters,” as will Lucid's new Gravity SUV for AC and DC charging. Rivian's 2026 models will include a J1772 adapter for Level 2 charging for its Dual, Tri and Quad vehicles and its Quad Launch Editions will have a CCS Combo 1 DC fast adapter. In a word: messy. General Motors, Cadillac's parent company, put out a summer blog post saying exactly that about the upcoming adapter situation, “That creates a little complication: there will be cars on the road with both standards, as well as chargers of both varieties in public and private settings.” The 2026 Cadillac Optiq will be the first GM EV to transition to NACS. While Tesla's Supercharger network is thriving and growing (7,753 stations housing 73,817 individual connectors, up 16% from last year), home chargers and older network plugs won't be compatible with the newest EVs. An Electrify America spokesperson wrote in an email, “Electrify America remains committed to supporting the future of the [NACS] connector.” She went on to explain that the company is testing NACS charging at stations in Florida and Connecticut “to gain insights into the customer experience and data on the hardware.”ChargePoint has taken more aggressive steps to escape dongle hell. Rob Newton, the network's senior director of marketing, acknowledged in a call that in the past the “experience has been really clunky” when different charging systems are involved. ChargePoint has never provided adapters. Instead of relying on carmakers or individual EV owners to keep up with the latest dongles, ChargePoint is changing the source. Enter the Omni Port. Introduced this summer, the newest ChargePoint stations will have the adapter built into the station itself and drivers can select what type of EV they are charging. “You want to be able to pull up to a station and have confidence it works,” Newton said.New stations will come standard with an Omni Port, but older stations need to retrofit old connectors with a conversion kit from the company. Newton called it “future-proofing,” but it's more about ensuring new EV owners can continue to use (and pay for kilowatt-hours from) non-Tesla charging stations.Nearly every automaker with an electrified model announced in the past few years that it was making the inevitable shift to the Tesla charging system. And now it's happening — dongles and all.

Security cameras can be spammy, blowing up your phone with useless notifications. Manufacturers have been battling this issue with AI detection, but Google's Gemini assistant takes things to a whole new level in its latest Nest Cams.

The Nest Cam Indoor (Wired, 3rd Gen) and Outdoor (Wired, 2nd Gen) may not look new (apart from the Berry red indoor model), but they finally make the jump to 2K resolution, empowering a new level of AI insight, more accurate detection, and better animated notifications.

I've been testing both side by side with the previous generation Nest cameras for the last two weeks, and they clearly represent a leap in quality. But the Google Home app overhaul and hardware improvements were long overdue, and the infusion of Gemini AI is only partially successful, with top-tier features requiring a hefty subscription.

The new Nest Cam Indoor and Nest Cam Outdoor boast the easiest setup experience I've encountered. Simply plug them in (the Nest Cam Indoor comes with a 10-foot USB-C cable, the Nest Cam Outdoor has an 18-foot weatherproof cable), scan the QR code sticker on the front of each camera with the Google Home app, connect to Wi-Fi, and you're up and running in no time (both support 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands). The elegant magnetic mount for the Nest Cam Outdoor needs a couple of screws, while my Nest Cam Indoor is perched neatly on a shelf.

While Google has lagged behind competitors for years with its 1080p cameras, support for HDR and a high frame rate helped keep the last-gen Nest cams relevant. That said, the jump to a 2560 x 1400 resolution with a wider 152-degree diagonal field of view is a clear and immediate upgrade. This resolution bump also enables 6X digital zoom, so the Nest Cams can serve up notifications that zoom in on the subject of each animated alert. These notifications show a few frames of each event, making it far easier to decide whether you need to tap through and watch the full video. You can also zoom in on the live feed and crop the view to stay focused on a specific area, like a garden gate or path.

Both cameras detect more activity and alert more accurately and swiftly than their predecessors. The range seems to be better, too. For example, my indoor camera faces a side door, and it can pick up people across the street and zoom in on them as they walk by. I don't necessarily want it to do that, but the reach is impressive. It's more successful with the outdoor camera, as only the newer model picks up on me entering the back door of the distant garage compared to the prior generation. The outdoor camera is also far faster to alert and upload accessible video than the old battery-powered model (this is generally true for wired cameras).

The cameras get six hours of cloud video history at no extra cost (up from three for the previous generation), but that's your allotment without an expensive subscription. On that note, Google has killed off Nest Aware in favor of the two-tier Google Home Premium: Standard is $10 per month or $100 per year, and Advanced is $20 per month or $200 per year.

Google's Home Premium subscriptions include everything you got with Nest Aware (30 days of video history, Familiar Faces, and garage door, package, smoke and CO alarm detection) and Nest Aware Plus (60 days of video history or 10 days of 24/7), but Standard also includes Gemini Live on compatible smart speakers and displays, and the option to create automations by typing what you want in the Home app. This last feature works well if you have a bunch of smart home devices set up in Google Home, and you can tell it to do things like “turn on the lights at sunset” or “have the side door camera trigger the outside lights.” It's far easier than using the old script editor.

The cream of the AI goodies requires the Advanced subscription. This adds descriptive notifications, so instead of “person detected,” you get messages like “person walks up stairs” or “cat is on the table” instead of “animal detected.” The searchable video history using the Ask Home search bar is genuinely handy; you can ask questions like “who opened the back door last night?” or “Did FedEx deliver a package today?” and jump straight to the event. You also get daily summaries with Home Brief, giving you an often weirdly comical digest of highlights from the day.

​Some folks feel AI is overhyped, but it has made tangible improvements to home security cameras in the last few years. When I started testing them, it was common to get alerts from branches blowing in the breeze, passing birds or moths, and sometimes seemingly nothing at all. AI is pretty good at detecting people now, and animal, vehicle, and package detection are standard in most security cameras.

Google's cloud-only approach enabled it to take things further faster than most with facial recognition, though it's no longer unique, with competitors like Amazon, Eufy, Lorex, and Wyze all offering similar features. Google has stepped things up again with Gemini, and the hardware bump to a 2K resolution provides the AI more data, enabling more descriptive and accurate alerts. This is a growing trend across the industry; Amazon also just unveiled a new line of 2K and 4K Ring cameras with facial recognition and a new Search Party feature to help you find your lost dog.

As smart as Google's Nest cameras are, the AI is far from totally accurate. It regularly confuses my kids, much to their annoyance, and, while both have long hair, it's not a mistake a person would make. I also get pretty regular alerts that I am at the front door when I'm sitting at my desk, because it struggles to tell me apart from any other bald, bearded bloke. Gemini is also convinced my colleague's dog is a cat. Making these mistakes is understandable, but it's frustrating that, even after he corrected Gemini, telling it he has a dog and not a cat, it continues to make the same error.

​Ultimately, there's a beta feel to these new AI features—and they are in early access. You are helping to train it (you can give thumbs-up or down feedback). I'm sure it will improve, but I wouldn't rush to drop $20 per month for these features alone. Home Premium Advanced is a much easier sell if you're already paying for Nest Aware Plus.

The Home Premium Standard plan will be enough for most folks, but it's tough to justify unless you have at least a couple of Nest cameras and a doorbell. At least Standard is bundled in with some Google One subscriptions. The extra monthly fee for Advanced seems like a step too far, and it's only bundled with Google's most expensive AI Ultra plan ($250 per month).

Stepping back to the camera hardware, there's no doubt that both offer tangible improvements over the previous generation. The Google Nest Cam Indoor (Wired, 3rd Gen) is the smartest indoor security camera, but the upgrades felt more useful to me in the Google Nest Cam Outdoor (Wired, 2nd Gen). The caveat for anyone upgrading from the battery-powered version is that you must run the cable to a power outlet, though I suspect Google will release a 2K outdoor battery camera before long (maybe even a version with a floodlight).

Ultimately, these slick and elegant security cameras are easy to recommend. But they are up against many cheaper, comparable video quality indoor security cameras and similarly priced wireless, solar-powered, pan/tilt outdoor cameras that can record locally. If you're cool with plugging in, using Google Home, and the price and subscription, they may still be the better choice for you.

Guys, I'm trying. Right now, as I type these words, I am trying on multiple levels. Trying to understand, trying to be fair, and I'm trying really, really hard to breathe through my nostrils, given the enormous weight of our AR glasses future resting uncomfortably on my nose.

The thing is, you shouldn't need to try hard to justify wearing AR smart glasses. Any pair that doesn't just work is dead on arrival. I want the future, and the AR glasses that come with it. but unfortunately, with the $900 Inmo Air 3, trying is the best I'm going to get, and that, dear reader, is what I'd call a major drag.

Inmo Air 3

The Inmo Air 3 AR smart glasses should be avoided at all costs.

Pros

Cons

Let's start from the top. Inmo is a Chinese purveyor of smart glasses that recently launched its Inmo Air 3 via Kickstarter, a pair of Android-powered AR glasses that tout a few enticing ideas and features. One of those selling points is a full-color screen that is 1080p, and the other is a novel input method for navigating UI inside the glasses using a smart ring. Both of those ideas caught my attention during IFA 2025, which is why I chose to write about them in September. Those features, coupled with the fact that you can run pretty much any app in 2D by just downloading it from the Google Play Store via the glasses UI felt like they could be a winning combo.

But in the world of gadgets, there are hits, and there are misses, and then there are complete and total whiffs, and the latter category is where Inmo's Air 3 smart glasses fall for me, and the problems started almost immediately out of the box.

Before we get to my list of grievances, I'll start with a small positive, which is that the packaging is impressive, and so is the selection of stuff that comes with the smart glasses. In addition to the smart glasses, there's a touch-sensitive ring with multiple buttons, a garage door-like touch controller if you don't feel like using that, a magnetic cable for charging the ring, and magnetically attachable shades for when you want more contrast. That's a lot of stuff, which is welcome, but that's where the positive impressions stopped for me, because the first thing that jumped out when I put the smart glasses on was… I couldn't see anything.

I quickly discovered that it wasn't a problem with the waveguide display inside the smart glasses; it was actually an issue with how they sit on my face. Like some other folks out there, I have a bump on my nose, which is a polite way of saying I have a big schnoz. Because of that, I have to wear glasses closer to my face (resting above the bump in my nose) as opposed to in the middle, where other folks might wear them. On one hand, that's a physical thing specific to me. On the other hand, I am not the only person out there with a nose like this.

Because of the way the Inmo Air 3 sit on my face, I actually can't see two-thirds of the display when the smart glasses are in a comfortable, natural position on my nose. So, in order to see the full screen, I have to move them down my nose to where the smart glasses (and the nose pads) actually press my nostrils in, making it hard to, um… breathe. It's really, incredibly, almost laughably not fun. And before you ask—no, you cannot adjust the position of a single screen on your face to fix it, and these smart glasses are far from lightweight, so, to avoid mouth-breathing for extended periods, I decided to test them out by holding them in the strange, unnatural position on my face that I could see best in. I did feel justified when two of my other colleagues put the Inmo Air 3 on and reported that the screen is faint and difficult to make out, so I'm not the only one. “They hurt my eyes,” was the exact first impression of Gizmodo Senior Editor of Consumer Tech, Raymond Wong, when he put them on.

Needless to say, that's not a great start, but it gets worse.

As I mentioned, one of the things I was most excited about was the inclusion of a smart ring for controlling the UI inside the smart glasses. It's a pretty clever method for input that I haven't yet tried, and felt (on the surface) like something that could catch on if executed properly. I say if here because novel hardware is a lot harder to make than it sounds on paper, and there's always a chance that it doesn't work right. And boy, does Inmo's ring (called the Ring 3) not work right.

The Ring 3, which connects to the Inmo Air 3 smart glasses via Bluetooth, has quite a bit of latency, which makes using it a little aggravating. While I got more adept the longer I used it, the touch surface is rather small, and combined with the lag, I found it to be imprecise at best. Nah, let's be honest, it was a nightmare. Luckily, though, I was relieved from having to use the Ring 3 fairly quickly. While attempting to adjust the size by bending the plastic part that wraps around your finger (this is how the ring is intended to be resized), it started to break, separating from the hard plastic where all the touch-sensitive hardware and buttons live. Not realizing, I attempted to adjust even further (I wasn't applying Hulk-like force here, I promise), and it started to crack.

So, that was that for the ring for me. I couldn't resize it to fit properly on my finger without breaking it further, so I did the rest of my testing using a combination of the Inmo Air 3's touch-sensitive surface on the right side of the smart glasses (similar to how Meta's Ray-Bans work) and the garage door remote-like controller that I mentioned earlier. The latter worked fine, but it feels incredibly cheap and is far from perfect.

I wouldn't describe the touchpad on the front of the device, where you use your thumb to direct a cursor, as being super responsive, but it gets the job done. You'll wind up having to tap things multiple times to register a “click” in the UI, but I suppose it's better than trying to use a broken smart ring if just by virtue of the fact that it technically works. There are some physical buttons on the non-ring touch controller that allow you to go back, go home, control the volume, and pull up the camera, which is nice if you get tired of not having your taps registered.

And if both those controllers fail, there are touch and tap controls on the right arm of the smart glasses and volume buttons on the left arm.

Once I was able to navigate the Inmo Air 3 properly, I could start actually using them. That, in theory, should have been the exciting part, but the highs weren't exactly what I would call soaring. First, there was the irksome part of getting the AR smart glasses online, which I had to do entirely through the Inmo UI. While there is an Inmo app for iOS and Android, my app wouldn't register the smart glasses and connect, so any added functionality through the app was unusable. So, to enter Wi-Fi credentials, I had to select my network in the Air 3 and painstakingly punch in passwords one character at a time using the garage door remote. I managed to do that without giving up, luckily, and was able to download some apps in the Google Play Store.

The first place I went was YouTube, where I loaded up some cooking content. The experience was pretty nice, though I definitely wish the smart glasses weren't crushing my nose while I was watching. I could see, on someone whose face fits the smart glasses, that watching things could be enjoyable in the Inmo Air 3, if not altogether groundbreaking. Sure, the Inmo Air 3 are more lightweight than a VR headset, but they're nowhere near as immersive as watching in a Quest 3 and much less premium than an Apple Vision Pro, though that's admittedly a tough comparison.

I also downloaded TikTok and scrolled through some videos for good measure, and that experience was also fine, though I can't say it was preferable to just pulling out my phone and zoning out that way. The screen is definitely the strongest part of the Inmo Air 3; it's sharp, and watching content feels surprisingly hi-fi given it's just some waveguides displays shoved into a pair of glasses. The brightness isn't the best, though. While Meta's Ray-Ban Display tops out at an impressive 5,000 nits of brightness and works well in full natural light, the Inmo Air 3 reaches just 600 nits. Even just using the AR smart glasses in my office on a sunny day was enough to kill contrast, though a magnetic attachment that gives the lenses shade does help. But, to be honest, that's not the only reason I wouldn't wear Inmo's Air 3 outside…

If you saw Inmo's Air 3 in renderings like I did and thought, “those look like smart glasses I could wear on the subway,” you may want to think again. The Air 3 are big smart glasses. The frames are thick, which is bad for someone like me who has a relatively small head, though even if you don't look as dumb as I do when you wear them, you might feel dumb just because of the weight. The big lenses also don't pass for normal glasses, and there's a non-zero chance someone might assume you have a visual impairment if you walk around with them on.

I think what's more aggravating about the size is the fact that battery life doesn't seem to be particularly great. After every session (about 20 to 30 minutes), I felt like I should charge the Inmo Air 3 up since a significant chunk of the battery was gone. While Inmo doesn't offer official battery life estimates, there's a 660mAh battery on board, and in my estimate, you can expect between 1.5 to 2 hours max with continuous use. That's not great, obviously, but all of that 1080p goodness is going to come at a cost.

If you're not bringing the smart glasses outside with you, it kind of renders some features useless, like the ability to take pictures. That's mostly okay, though, because I took some snaps with the Inmo Air 3 and they were not very high-res. While it technically has a higher megapixel camera than the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 (the Air 3 has a 16-megapixel sensor, and Meta's smart glasses have a 12-megapixel sensor), the quality somehow looks worse.

Inmo's Air 3 seem kind of stuck in a liminal space between display-free smart glasses and thicker AR smart glasses like Snapchat's Spectacles. Clearly, Inmo thinks this is a product you'd want to walk around with on your face, based on its marketing, but in practice, they still feel like a stay-at-home gadget due to the not-so-great battery life, the chunky size, and the general lack of convenience. Maybe your level of comfort with them will vary, but from where I'm sitting, style is not the Inmo Air 3's strong suit. In fact, I don't know that a strong suit exists…

There's more that you can do with these smart glasses, but unfortunately, I wasn't really able to test it all because of the hiccups with the hardware. One area that I would have liked to test was cloud gaming, since the idea of being able to play on a big virtual screen (like you can do in a Meta Quest 3) is kind of awesome. I wasn't able to really do that, though, since the Inmo Air 3 don't sit properly on my face, and I basically had to hold them up with one hand while I tested. And as we all know, holding a typical controller historically requires two hands.

There's also a multi-window mode where you can have up to three different windows open simultaneously, but that mode requires the use of the Ring 3, which as I've already established, was basically unusable for me. It's a shame, in a lot of ways, that Inmo's Air 3 is as rough as it is, because there are a lot of interesting ideas. I love the idea of a ring-based wearable (but it has to not crumble in your hands), being able to download any app and use it in 2D is freeing (but only if you can see the apps), and wearing the smart glasses around would be like having a real computer on your face (but you have to actually want to feel comfortable putting them on for that to work).

Unfortunately, for people interested in AR, the Inmo Air 3 just feel like more trouble than they're worth. Yes, they're a crowdfunded gadget, and you should expect some wonkiness from that category, but at $900 (that's early bird pricing, the future MSRP is actually $1,100) I don't think lack of polish to this degree is something anyone should put up with. If nothing else, It makes you appreciate the refinement of glasses like the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and even if they don't do quite as much on paper. So, while I wouldn't ever recommend paying for AR smart glasses like this, sometimes just knowing how bad things can get is its own kind of reward, and in the name of that crucial knowledge, I tortured my nose and face so you don't have to.

Cooler Master corrects its customer support teams and stops producing its problematic right-angle plug.

Cooler Master has responded to Igor's Lab regarding the firm's highly problematic instructions to users to DIY repair the right-angled 12V-2x6 power connector. Igor's Lab received an email from the PSU maker stating that the right-angled connector has been discontinued and that all regional support teams have been instructed to immediately stop advising customers to pry their power connector apart to fix it.

The email also documented that all newly developed Cooler Master power supplies now come with a straight 12V-2x6 power connector. Updated quality control will ensure that its newer 12V-2x6 implementations can work with all 12V-2x6-equipped graphics cards, including models sporting recessed connectors. Cooler Master will also be adding a two-toned color "indicator" to its newer connectors to make it clear whether the connector is fully plugged in. The connector tips will be painted purple.

If you are the owner of an existing Cooler Master power supply that came with the aforementioned problematic right-angled 12V-2x6 power connector, Cooler Master will provide you with a replacement cable with a straight end if needed.

These updates should put to rest any future troubles Cooler Master customers might have had with its power supplies. Luckily, Cooler Master reports that it has not received any customer damage reports directly tied to modifications to its 12V-2x6 connectors. But it's still dangerous, and something could have very well happened to anyone.

Cooler Master's previous right-angled connector was very problematic, and only worked in certain graphics cards that did not have a recessed internal 12V-2x6 power connector. Ironically, the customer support team's previously recommended modification did not even resolve the issue. The modification involved removing the connector's right-angled cover, turning the connector back into a straight plug. However, the physical connector itself had a giant plastic tab that was the actual cause of the incompatibility.

Bring back the '90s.

The end of dial-up internet means future generations will no longer hear the iconic screech of the dial-up handshake. However, YouTube creator Nick Bild did not want this experience to be lost to history, so he used a Raspberry Pi 3 and a USB Wi-Fi adapter to gather network traffic and convert it into an analog signal that is blasted out of a small speaker. According to Bild's Hackaday project, he had to add random amplitude and frequency adjustments to make the output sound more interesting, but all the data is sourced from the Wi-Fi network.

Back before the days of DSL and fiber-optic internet, all our data had to travel over phone lines. Since these weren't designed for digital signals, internet companies had to use modems to convert them into analog signals (i.e., sound) that could be transmitted over the already existing telephone network. The nostalgic screeching sound many born in the ‘90s and earlier hear when connecting to the internet is just the handshake signal between two computers negotiating which protocol they'll use to communicate. Once the connection has been established, the screeching just turns to static, which is what actual data sounds like.

This was a relatively easy build for Bild, who used a Raspberry Pi 3 with a secondary USB Wi-Fi adapter to collect network traffic from a target computer. These are then sent to an Adafruit QT Py microcontroller, which converts the data to a specific amplitude and outputs an analog signal via an onboard DAC. The output is then fed into a small amplifier so that the tiny 2-watt speaker can play it. Nick says that since the signal is random, you're bound to hear nothing but static. Although he added random variations to the output to mimic the old sound a bit more, it's still based on the actual data being transmitted and received by the target computer.

The sound this contraption makes isn't the same as what we hear from the old modem. After all, dial-up internet made that sound so users could listen to whether the connection was working as expected. Advancements in networking technology meant we no longer needed to do that (and it would probably be annoying to hear that sound from all the devices connected to the internet around us). Still, it would be nice to hear this nostalgic sound, or something similar, to remind us how slow the internet used to be.

Wingtech flags cash-flow risk despite profit surge as Dutch state tightens grip on Nexperia.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Wingtech, the Chinese parent company of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, has warned investors of a potential cash flow squeeze if it fails to regain operational control of its European subsidiary, despite posting a 280% surge in quarterly net profit. The company's woes and supply disruptions have multiple car makers worldwide preparing for shutdowns as the supply of critical semiconductors for automobiles dwindle.

The alert came via an earnings filing on Friday, in which Wingtech said that Nexperia “may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit, and cash flow,” related to governance issues. This is based on a machine translation of the company's earnings report.

The statement appears to reference the Dutch government's recent move to tighten oversight of the company, which is one of the largest producers of commodity parts such as diodes, MOSFETs, and small-signal logic used in applications like voltage regulation modules and ESD protection. If geopolitical challenges begin to impair the company's ability to execute on orders or invest in expansion, impacts could creep in through extended lead times and upstream pricing pressure.

While Wingtech's earnings release did not name the Dutch government explicitly, the context is obvious. In September, the Hague invoked new foreign investment screening powers to place Nexperia under direct oversight, citing national security concerns. The decision effectively allows the Dutch state to veto or revise key choices made by Nexperia's board. That marks the second major intervention into the company's operations, following the UK government's forced divestment of Newport Wafer Fab in 2024.

According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the tension has already led to halted salaries for some Nexperia staff in China and internal access issues — signs that the governance dispute could bleed into day-to-day operations if left unresolved.

This, unfortunately, raises a familiar but still uncomfortable prospect of uncertainty for PC and parts makers. But this time, the uncertainty could reach the most fundamental tiers of the supply stack. Nexperia's tech might not attract headlines like Nvidia's high-end GPUs, but it's no less important in a world that scrapes by on just-in-time manufacturing.

If Wingtech can't regain control of its European asset, or if state oversight results in slow-walked decision-making, there's a serious risk of a logistical nightmare that could start causing problems downstream very soon.

Congratulations to Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov on his newly announced national digital currency. And further congratulations to Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Japarov's advisor, who helped facilitate this launch, on his pardon from President Donald Trump two days ago.

To catch you up on what Kyrgyzstan is, it's a mountainous, landlocked, former Soviet Republic that borders northwest China. Now that you have your bearings, that country has just announced a national stablecoin in partnership with Binance, the company Zhao co-founded, and where he used to work as CEO.

Updates from Kyrgyzstan🇰🇬– The National Stablecoin launched, on @BNBChain– The CBDC is ready for rollout. Yes, both. CBDC will be used for gov related payments, etc– The National Cryptocurrency Reserve set up, #BNB included– LE training– Binance Academy with 10 top… https://t.co/KPrL0pnsWG pic.twitter.com/SInh5aCPMZ

— CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 25, 2025



According to Zhao's post on X, the currency—which is pegged to the Russian ruble—is a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a digital version of a national currency, set to be used for government payments. It was launched on the BNB blockchain, the blockchain created by Zhao's former company Binance.

Since not long after his release from prison for a conviction related to failing to prevent money laundering, Zhao had been lobbying for Trump to pardon him. A New York Times report found that in addition to pushing for a pardon, Zhao had been publicly praising Trump on podcasts, paying for lobbyists who had cozy relationships with Trump and his allies, and making a deal that resulted in a windfall for World Liberty Financial, the Trump family crypto company.

Trump, for his part, signed his signature piece of crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act, in July. It establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins not unlike the new one Kyrgystan just created, and helps to deepen the involvement of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. economy.

For all we know, there's nothing wrong with any of this. It might all be just fine.

Brands spent an incredible $247 billion on social media ads in 2024. Get it right and it's a phenomenally good platform for targeted selling. It has rocketed countless tiny brands to viral fame, and made their fresh-faced founders unimaginably rich.

It can also be a wonderful space to find new and exciting products, and the Slack channels at WIRED are continually pinging with links to interesting ideas and cool concepts. Responses range from “Love this!” and “If this exists, we have to test” to “Call this in now!” and “Stand down, it's just AI.” Then, a few months ago, a link to the Sodapop Bluetooth speaker was shared, with the question, “Does this really work?”

Sodapop is a one-of-a-kind super compact Bluetooth speaker that can be screwed onto a standard soda bottle if you want to boost the bass. Your empty bottle of Mountain Dew is transformed into a bass chamber that, according to the manufacturer, will boost the speaker's bass output by up to 10 decibels. This doesn't sound like much, but again, according to the brand, this configuration will double the perceived volume in the mid-bass range.

It's a neat idea, especially as the very smallest portable bluetooth speakers are notoriously thin in the bottom end. They can't help this; there's simply not the power in the driver, or breathing space in the casing, to produce those rumbling lows. That's not to say there aren't some fantastic small portable speakers out there, but in reality, the very best options tend to be the biggest.

So does the Sodapop work? On its own, the cylindrical speaker is just 3.8 inches long, 2.3 inches deep, and weighs 10.5 ounces. It's tiny. There are two 4.5-watt stereo drivers, a 10-watt amplifier, and Bluetooth 5.0, plus a 3.5-mm AUX and a built-in mic for calls. It's powered by a 1,600-mAh rechargeable battery, which should be good for up to 30 hours of playback.

The speaker also comes with, and is hidden snugly inside, its own plastic bottle. That's right folks, the speaker designed to screw onto any standard soda bottle (specifically the global PCO 1881 standard) comes encased in its very own. It isn't your typical drink receptacle however. It has matching color accents with the speaker for starters, and the base of the bottle features a small open bass port and diaphragm. It's basically a screw on bass chamber—no drinks allowed. The bottom also unlocks, which creates space for the speaker to live. This makes for an excellent case, and it keeps the Sodapop compact on the go, but the company also supplies an additional soft case in the box, which seems wasteful.

It's super cute, and the poppy colorways make it perfect for social media. But why ship it with a plastic bottle? The use of standard soda bottles was prominent in their hugely successful Kickstarter campaign, but maybe I was being naive in thinking that the Sodapop was all about giving waste plastic a second chance.

Perplexed, I contacted the brand and a spokesperson explained that the Sodapop comes with its own bottle because, “Not all bottles fit perfectly, so the included one ensures users get the intended acoustic performance straight out of the box.” They also explained that “the supplied bottle is tuned to complement the speaker's design, ensuring the best possible sound without trial and error.”

This irked me on several levels, not least in terms of sustainability. Sodapop seems to be leaning into the idea of reuse, but it's also deliberately manufacturing new bottles because they sound better. But then, the supplied bottle isn't really a bottle. It's a screw-on bass chamber made from thick plastic, with multiple components. There's even a lid on it, to hold all of the liquid you can't put in it. I'm so confused. Maybe I should stop dwelling on the Mountain Dew of it all, and think of Sodapop as a quirky two-piece Bluetooth speaker that looks like a bottle. All this and I've not even turned it on yet.

The Sodapop works like most Bluetooth speakers, with simple on/off, pairing, volume, and skip controls. Connectivity caused no issues, and I was quickly playing songs through Spotify over Bluetooth. On the underside of the speaker, a bottletop-sized rubber bung hides the bass port and screw threads. To attach it to your bottle of choice, just pull the stopper aside and screw.

To test the contrast however, I first listened to the speaker without its bass bottle. It's very loud for a small speaker, and in my office I couldn't cope with the volume turned up past 30 percent. It's just not an enjoyable listen, sounding shrill and disappointing without any discernible bass. It's not quite as bad as putting your old iPhone in a cup for extra amplification, but it's not far off—and at least you can actually drink from the cup afterwards.

But we're here for the bass-boosting bottle, and I can categorically say that the acoustically tuned plastic bottle does indeed boost the lower frequencies, and makes the speaker sound significantly better. The bottle takes the edge off the volume, and there's a noticeable depth to the mids and bass once it's attached. You can really hear the difference in the mix and balance, and the contrast between the sound with the bottle on and off is impressive.

Push the volume, however, and the bass gets muddy quickly, with the sharp edges once again noticeable in the mix. It's not horrible, but compared to the competition it's just not that enjoyable to listen to, which is a shame, because it sure does look cute on my desk.

While it is larger, the Anker Soundcore Motion 300 ($70) wipes the floor with the Sodapop, with clear bass and clarity, even at volume. Similarly, the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 ($80) is small, portable, boasts full 360-degree sound and comes with IP67 waterproofing (it floats), which is a huge upgrade to Sodapop's dust- and splash-resistant IPX65 rating.

Played side-by-side with the similarly proportioned and much cheaper $35 Tribit StormBox Micro 2 (IPX7 rating, 10 hours playtime), the physical separation and large chamber between the drivers and bass port does create a wider soundstage. There's not much in it in terms of the amount of bass and overall performance though.

But what about existing plastic bottles and Sodapop's original promise? I can see why they've designed their own bottle as the plastic is stiffer, the bass more stable and the thread consistent. It's almost as if the original idea wasn't quite right and they needed to engineer themselves out the situation.

Screwed into a standard 16.9-fluid-ounce (500-milliliter) soda bottle, the bass is definitely boosted, but the result sounds significantly worse than with the supplied bottle. It's also precarious and fell over several times in a breeze. A larger 84-fluid-ounce (2.5-liter) bottle had a shallower thread, making attachment harder, and there certainly wasn't five times more bass.

After extensive testing, we also concluded that, while the difference is imperceptible to all but the most trained pair of ears, Pepsi Max tasted sounded better than Coke Zero.

Sodapop is by no means the only mini-speaker brand trying to defy physics and boost bass. Anyone who remembers those resonating speaker that use any hard surface to boost audio, will hopefully recall just how awful they were. It was a clever idea, and there was plenty of science-backed data proving their brilliance, but in practice they were meh at best.

Sodapop does work, and it looks pretty (it's a conversation starter at the very least), but the sound quality isn't transformative to overlook all its other problems. If you're after novelty then be my guest, but there are better sounding, more versatile, and smaller speakers available for less.

Real Madrid came out on top in El Clásico for the first time under Xabi Alonso as they overcame Barcelona with a 2-1 victory at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday after on, with Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham on the scoresheet either side of a Fermín López equaliser. The result means Real Madrid now sleep five points clear at the top of La Liga, ahead of Barcelona, and seven points ahead of Villarreal in third place.

1. Who would play in defence?

Even though the line-up seemed pretty clear, there were so many defensive injuries and doubts that it left question marks over who would play in the Real Madrid defence. With Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Dean Huijsen and Raúl Asencio all overcoming knocks and injuries to make the squad, Huijsen was the only man to start, and the defensive unit looked as strong as ever. Injury to Fede Valverde, forced off with what seemed like a pulled muscle in the second half, could force Xabi Alonso into making a decision on his first-choice right-back sooner rather than later. On this occasion, it was Carvajal who came on to replace the vice-captain, but both him and Alexander-Arnold will compete for the spot against Valencia next weekend.

2. Could Xabi Alonso get his first “high-stakes” win?

After the derby defeat against Atlético Madrid, which followed the Club World Cup semi-final loss to Paris Saint-Germain, the question of Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid quickly became whether he was capable of getting a “big win” out of his team. Following in the footsteps of Carlo Ancelotti, a specialist in the big occasions, Alonso has had his work cut out but knew that in becoming only the second Real Madrid coach to win his first Clásico in the last decade, matching Zinedine Zidane, he would go some way to calming those nerves. This was an impressive win not only in terms of the performance, but in terms of the tactical set-up which outsmarted Hansi Flick and Barcelona from the off. At no point in this game did Barcelona look like they were on top or the better team. Job done for Xabi Alonso.

3. How far would Barcelona be from their best?

With no Hansi Flick in the dugout as he served a suspension, it was true that this was not Barcelona at their full strength. Without Robert Lewandowski or Raphinha in attack, while Lamine Yamal was not fully fit, without Gavi or Dani Olmo in midfield, Andreas Christensen in defence, or Joan García or Marc-André Ter Stegen in goal, Barça were lacking far more regulars than Real Madrid, even with their defensive absences. The question was whether Real Madrid would be able to make the most of this. They did, while Wojciech Szczesny produced arguably his best performance in a Barcelona shirt, Real Madrid exploited the gaps in midfield and were able to shut out the Barça offensive block easily. Lamine Yamal's dreadful display, with 21 possession losses, was in part down to a lack of fitness, but also down to a superb performance from Álvaro Carreras and smart tactical work to silence him and deny him space.

1. How should Xabi Alonso handle Vinícius Júnior's reaction to being subbed off?

If there was a negative for Real Madrid, it was the fury in Vinícius Júnior's reaction when Xabi Alonso opted to replace him on 72 minutes. The Brazilian threw up his arms and made a beehive for the tunnel, with no features towards the coach or the bench on his way. With his team leading in such a crucial game, it was a bizarre reaction. Alonso has struggled a little in this aspect, failing to manage the egos of a challenging dressing room as Carlo Ancelotti did during his stint in charge. Alonso has rotated everyone, other than Kylian Mbappé, and it requires further work to keep all of his players happy. The ongoing battle to satisfy Vinícius and rotate his attacking options continues to be one of the few uncertainties in the Xabi Alonso reign.

2. How many goals will Kylian Mbappé score this season?

A missed penalty in a Clásico could have been dramatic, but when you are Kylian Mbappé, you make enough of an impact for it not to be decisive. The Frenchman is now on 11 goals in 10 games in La Liga this season, putting him on track for 42 goals in the league alone through the season, which would surpass his return of 31 goals in 34 games last season. The Frenchman is on fire, but there is an element of dependence on his services. It was a superb goal ruled out for a millimetric offside, and he then scored the goal to break the deadlock. In 10 league games to date this season, he has scored in nine. Of those nine, he has scored the opening goal in five games. Mbappé's finishing is the best it has been since he joined the club, and he's showing it on the big occasions, as he proved on Sunday afternoon.

3. Can this be a turning point for Jude Bellingham?

For the first time since January 3rd, Jude Bellingham recorded both an assist and a goal in the same game. The last time it happened was when he scored an injury-time winner at Mestalla at the very start of Valencia, and on Sunday he looked to be back to his dominant best. The England international was involved in 18 duels in total, in a much more combative role than many expected him to play in the middle of the park, but more than proving himself capable of taking on one of Spain's more gifted midfielders in Pedri, who ended the afternoon with a red card. Bellingham has now scored in back-to-back games for the first time since he scored against Leganés and Real Sociedad in late March and early April of this year.

Jude Bellingham had a hand in both goals, and Kylian Mbappe continued his excellent run of form as Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-1 in the first Clasico of the season. It was hardly a legendary iteration of this famous fixture, but two first-half goals from Los Blancos were enough to see off the short-handed Blaugrana. 

Madrid thought they might have had a penalty early on, but saw it chalked off after Vinicius Jr was adjudged to have kicked Lamine Yamal, rather than the other way round, as the Brazilian burst into the box. Mbappe then had a goal disallowed for a narrow offside, but he wasn't to be denied, and soon after Bellingham played him through and Mbappe lashed into the bottom corner.

Los Blancos then gifted Barca an equaliser as Arda Guler gave the ball away on the edge of his own box to allow an unmarked Fermin Lopez to ghost into the area and finish. But Madrid had more in them, still, and Bellingham made it 2-1 thanks to an easy tap-in after no one tracked the Englishman on a set-piece. 

Xabi Alonso's side had a chance to put the game away in the second half from the spot, yet Wojciech Szczesny responded, saving Mbappe's penalty after a lengthy VAR review handed Madrid a fortuitous spot-kick. It was a rather quiet second half, otherwise as Madrid sat in while Barca, without the injured Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, had few attacking ideas.

Vinicius Junior stormed straight down the tunnel after he was subbed off in the second of half of Real Madrid's Clasico clash with Barcelona. Goals from Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham saw Real Madrid go in at the break 2-1 up after Fermin Lopez had briefly levelled for Barcelona at the Bernabeu. However, Vinicius was furious at his withdrawal and rather than take a place on the bench, he went stomping back to the home dressing room.

COSTA RICA'S LEADING ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER

Our under-17 women's national team ended their FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup campaign on a tough note Friday evening, falling 3-1 to host nation Morocco in the final Group A match at Rabat's Olympic Stadium. The defeat eliminated us from the tournament, while Morocco advanced to the round of 16 for the first time in their history.

The game started with high stakes for both sides. Our team, coming off a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Brazil, needed a win to keep their knockout hopes alive as one of the best third-place teams. Morocco, winless in their first two matches, aimed to capitalize on home support to secure the points required for progression.

Morocco struck early. In the fourth minute, a mishandled clearance by goalkeeper Valeria Fernández allowed forward Mayssa Baha to slot home the opener from close range. The 14-year-old Baha, who emerged as the match's standout player, doubled the lead in the 39th minute from the penalty spot after Fernández fouled a Moroccan attacker inside the box.

Our team pushed back in the second half, creating several chances. They thought they had pulled one back in the 71st minute when Fabiana Alfaro found the net, but a VAR review ruled the goal off for an offside in the buildup. The setback proved costly. Just six minutes later, in the 77th minute, Alfaro inadvertently turned a Moroccan free kick into her own net, extending the hosts' lead to 3-0.

Our Ticas showed resilience late on. In the fifth minute of stoppage time, substitute Naima Moya scored a consolation goal with a well-placed shot, making the final score 3-1. Despite the late effort, it came too late to spark a comeback.

Our team controlled slightly more possession at 51 percent and outshot Morocco 10-9 overall, but the hosts were more clinical, registering six shots on target to our teams three. Yellow cards were shown to players on both sides, reflecting the competitive intensity, but no major disciplinary issues disrupted the flow.

This result left us at the bottom of Group A with one point from three matches, having scored just three goals while conceding seven. Their tournament journey mirrored previous World Cup appearances, where the team struggled to convert opportunities into wins. Coach Édgar Rodríguez's squad, featuring young talents like captain Priscilla Rodríguez and forward Sharon Umaña, gained valuable experience but will return home reflecting on defensive lapses that proved decisive.

For Morocco, the victory marked a milestone. Finishing third in the group with three points, they qualified as one of the four best third-place teams across the tournament's six groups. The win also made them the first host nation to reach the knockout stage in the history of the U-17 Women's World Cup. Baha's brace highlighted her potential, as she led the attack with composure beyond her years.

The 2025 edition, expanded to 24 teams and hosted in Morocco from October 17 to November 8, has showcased emerging talent from around the globe. In the other Group A fixture, Italy defeated Brazil 4-3, confirming the top two spots. Morocco now awaits their round of 16 opponent, set to face Group B winners North Korea.

Our players leave with heads held high after competing against strong opposition, including former champions Brazil and Italy. The experience positions them well for future qualifiers, as the federation continues to build its women's program. Back here in San José, our fans will look ahead to the next cycle, hoping for breakthroughs in youth development.

As Marcus Rashford prepares to face Real Madrid as Barcelona's most productive player this season, fresh from scoring two classy goals against Olympiacos in the Champions League, it is worth remembering that the striker was mocked in some quarters for having the audacity to think he could even play for the Blaugrana after two disappointing seasons, let alone rip it up for them.

Former Manchester United forward Teddy Sheringham said Rashford "didn't deserve to make the step up" to Barca after leaving Old Trafford. European football pundit Gabriele Marcotti told Rashford to "get a grip of where you are right now" and laughed at his entourage's trip to Barcelona last May to try to persuade the Catalans to sign him. 

No-one is laughing now though. Rashford not only got his move, he has convinced the doubters in England and the sceptics in Spain. And his next stop is a first-ever visit to the Santiago Bernabeu to play in the biggest club fixture in the world and take on Barca's eternal rivals Real Madrid.

Eberechi Eze's first-half strike proved the difference as Arsenal beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Sunday. Eze's goal was his first of the season as the Gunners downed the England international's former employers on home turf to go four points clear at the top of the Premier League table.

The Gunners weren't wholly convincing against the Eagles but did just enough to claim another huge three points as Arsenal capitalised on their title rivals Manchester City and Liverpool dropping points over the weekend.

Eze beat Dean Henderson with a fine hit shortly before the break and despite a late Palace push, the Gunners held out to secure all the spoils.

CANCUN — As the world turns its eyes to North America for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a fascinating story is emerging, and it places the Mexican Caribbean at the very center of the action. While Cancun is not an official “host city” for any matches, it is strategically positioning itself to be the unofficial capital and primary logistical hub for the entire tournament.

This isn't just wishful thinking; it's a calculated plan backed by massive infrastructure and major official announcements. For soccer fans and regular travelers alike, this will transform the entire region for 2026. Here at The Cancun Sun, we're breaking down what's happening and what it means for your vacation.

The single biggest factor in Cancun's new role is its air connectivity. According to a recent announcement from Quintana Roo's Tourism Minister, Bernardo Cueto, Cancun International Airport (CUN) is the only airport in Mexico offering direct flights to all 16 official host cities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

This is a massive game-changer. It means Cancun will function as the perfect “home base” for tens of thousands of international fans. Travelers can base themselves at a luxurious all-inclusive resort, enjoy the beach and amenities, and then take easy, non-stop flights to watch their team play in Miami, Dallas, or Mexico City, all without the hassle of multiple connections.

This isn't just about the fans; it's about the players, too. In a huge vote of confidence, Governor Mara Lezama recently announced that two of the region's most renowned resorts—Fairmont Mayakoba and Moon Palace Cancun—have been officially chosen to accommodate national team delegations, including their coaching staff, families, and media personnel.

For the savvy traveler, this “stamp of approval” from FIFA is the ultimate review. It speaks volumes about the verified, world-class quality of these properties in three key areas:

Now, does this mean you'll be able to get a selfie with a superstar player at the swim-up bar? Almost certainly not. You can expect a large area of the resort to be privately cordoned off for the team's security. But the fact that you are staying at a property deemed worthy of a World Cup team is a powerful testament to its quality.

While no official “fan zone” has been announced yet, it is heavily expected. With millions of people traveling through Cancun and using it as a home base, the stage is set for a massive celebration.

It is highly anticipated that the Hotel Zone and downtown areas will host enormous, organized fan festivals, where visitors from all over the world can gather to watch the matches on massive screens, turning the entire destination into a non-stop party for a solid month.

This new role as a global hub reaffirms Cancun's leadership as a world-class destination. For travelers, it means two things:

After the U.S. women's national team's most underwhelming performance of her short tenure, head coach Emma Hayes remains optimistic ahead of Sunday's rematch against Portugal. She will use the opportunity to test more players and continue to evaluate her roster's depth with the 2027 Women's World Cup qualifiers still a year away.

Hayes hinted before the first Portugal match on Thursday that she intended to promote a player from the U-23 team, which was training alongside the senior squad in Chester, Pa. With Trinity Rodman and Sam Meza both sidelined by injuries, she added Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta earlier in the week, leaving one roster spot still open for that U-23 player. On Friday, Hayes gave the nod to Paris Saint-Germain center back Eva Gaetino.

“When I got the call, knowing that all of my work, all of my effort, all of the setbacks, everything was worth it, I was just speechless,” Gaetino told The Athletic. “I couldn't stop crying, honestly.”

The 22-year-old earned her first senior call-up from interim head coach Twila Kilgore in March 2024 for the SheBelieves Cup, but did not make it onto the field. She earned her first cap later that year in an October friendly against Argentina, starting and playing 70 minutes alongside Naomi Girma in the 3-0 win.

After those first call-ups, Gaetino returned to her club determined to put the feedback she received from the U.S. coaching staff into practice.

“There was definitely a learning curve, so I focused on locking down those details, especially as a center back defending higher up the pitch,” Gaetino said. “We like to keep teams pinned in and defend in a way that sets us up for attack. It's about improving defensively while maintaining our core principles and figuring out how to blend your own individual style into a system that makes us one of the best teams in the world.”

Center back is one of the positions that Hayes is currently examining, especially as previous starters Girma and Tierna Davidson remain out due to injury. Girma has had limited time with the U.S. after her January move to Chelsea due to calf injuries, and Davidson remains out this year with an ACL injury. In addition to adding Gaetino, Hayes also called in San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley to her first U.S. camp.

Before joining PSG, Gaetino was a first-team All-American and ACC Defensive Player of the Year for Notre Dame in her junior and senior years of college. She signed for PSG in January 2024, following fellow USWNT and Notre Dame teammate Korbin Shrader (Albert).

Last season, Gaetino earned regular minutes and featured in the UEFA Women's Champions League; however, since the firing of former head coach Fabrice Abriel, she has only started three games this season under the new coach Paulo César. In the offseason, Shrader also left the team, joining eight-time Champions League winner OL Lyonnes. During the difficult transition, Gaetino has looked to another USWNT player, Crystal Dunn, for help. Dunn joined PSG earlier this year, but has yet to feature for the team this season.

“She keeps me grounded. She keeps me sane. She's just an incredible person, an incredible player, and I just have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for her,” Gaetino said. “I'm still learning how to navigate life as a pro, and doing it in another country adds a layer of difficulty. But I've quickly realized it's really just a race, and the only true competition is against yourself.”

Hayes told reporters that Gaetino is “the most WNT-ready player in this U-23 group,” but that she won't likely start the young defender against Portugal.

“It's unrealistic to have a player that's not been training in this environment, not built connections in this environment, not even trained with the team yet to start a game … even if she's showing qualities in the right direction,” Hayes said. “I think performing at the under-23 (level) is one step for her to perform at this level. As I keep saying to all of our players, doing well for your club, being club class, is one thing. Being in the national class is another.”

The USWNT stumbled in a 2-1 loss against Portugal on Thursday, a reminder that consistency remains the squad's biggest challenge. Hayes will likely shuffle her line-up heading into Sunday's rematch at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn., before wrapping up the international window against New Zealand on Oct. 29 at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City.

“I want to learn these things now,” Hayes said. “I'd much rather have the situation that happened the other night happen now and learn what we learn, than do that in 12 months time. So let me be clear, learning never stops.”

Gaetino is just one part of a puzzle Hayes is trying to put together as she continues to assess players ahead of the 2027 Women's World Cup qualifiers next year, but she is ready to make her case.

“I am doing everything I can to get myself ready, so if my name is called, I can help the team out to the best of my ability,” Gaetino said. “We have a chip on our shoulder, and we're ready to prove who we are.”

Kylian Mbappe has been told that he is still “missing something” in his bid to land an elusive Ballon d'Or. The France international was expected to dominate Golden Ball discussions as all-time greats Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo step out of that spotlight, but he has been informed by a fellow World Cup winner that being a ‘Galactico' at Real Madrid may not be enough.

Lamine Yamal has risked the wrath of Real Madrid supporters once again after the Barcelona forward sent out a defiant message ahead of the first Clasico of the season. Having already received scorn from the Blaugrana's bitter rivals, the 18-year-old decided to prod them for a second time before Sunday's mouth-watering fixture at the Santiago Bernabeu.

The U.S. Women's National Team heads to East Hartford, Connecticut, this Sunday for a rematch against Portugal, carrying the rare sting of a defeat. Portugal stunned the USWNT 2-1 on Thursday, marking their first-ever win against the Americans.

For head coach Emma Hayes, this second friendly is a crucial test of her young squad's character and ability to respond to adversity. The USWNT was outmuscled and disjointed in the first clash, particularly vulnerable on set pieces—a definite area of focus for the coaching staff.

Portugal will be highly motivated to prove their win wasn't a fluke, banking on their organized defense and efficient counter-attacking. However, with the loss snapping the USWNT's unbeaten streak against them, expect a far more focused and aggressive performance from the Americans.

The match, which also honors Connecticut native and USWNT legend Alyssa Naeher, is a chance for the team to show progress in the early stages of their 2027 World Cup qualification cycle.

World Cup

This is the 12th in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup.

Previously, we've looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962, an England success in 1966, another Brazil win in 1970, a second West Germany triumph in 1974, and Argentina's long-awaited win in 1978. In 1982, Italy matched Brazil's three World Cup wins, and this is how they did it.

One of the cliches about Italy going into every World Cup — if they qualify — is that they are ‘traditionally slow starters'.

But Italy had won their opening game of the 1966, 1970, 1974 and 1978 tournaments. In fact, in 1978, they started very strongly before tailing off. Really, the cliche stems from World Cup 1982 in Spain.

And it really was extreme. A goalless draw with Poland was followed by a flat 1-1 draw with Peru, and another unconvincing 1-1 draw against Cameroon, meaning Italy were fortunate to progress from the group stage on goals scored. At that point, the idea of them winning the World Cup was absurd.

But then, in the second group phase — consisting of four groups of three, in the first 24-team World Cup — Italy exploded into life despite a very tough draw, defeating holders Argentina and favourites Brazil.

When the knockout stage eventually arrived, they got past European opposition, in Poland and West Germany, with relative ease.

Italy were hugely unfancied going into the tournament, having only finished second in their qualification group behind Yugoslavia and losing to France and East Germany in friendlies. Bookmakers had them as 18-1 seventh-favourites amid serious questions over a couple of key players. World Soccer magazine considered that they “face the real threat of first round elimination” in its tournament preview.

West Germany and Brazil were considered the favourites, while Argentina were not merely defending champions, they'd also unearthed Diego Maradona, who was already being spoken about as the world's best player.

There have been major shocks in World Cup finals — 1950 and 1954 in particular — but considering the tournament hasn't produced anything like a Denmark 1992 or a Greece 2004, this is probably the World Cup's biggest underdog triumph, despite Italy's considerable footballing heritage.

In some ways, Enzo Bearzot was a classic Italy manager: a former international himself, a dedicated smoker, a tactician more than a coach. In other ways, he felt different: Bearzot was more of a father figure than an authoritarian, he gave his players a fair amount of freedom, and he liked attacking football, having been inspired by the Total Football of the previous decade.

Bearzot had worked for the Italian federation as under-23 manager and as assistant to both Ferruccio Valcareggi and Fulvio Bernardini, before taking charge in 1977. Italy's performance at World Cup 1978 and Euro 1980 on home soil was decent enough, but their sluggish form going into the tournament meant he was mercilessly mocked in the Italian press. He was criticised so heavily during the initial group phase that he imposed a complete media blackout for the rest of the competition, with him and his players simply refusing to speak to journalists.

That approach seemed to be successful, cultivating an ‘us against them' mentality. Italian journalists were forced to eat their words by the end of the tournament.

There is a slight irony in the fact that at a time when football was becoming concerned at the dominance of systems over the star power of individuals, this was actually the period in World Cup history where three straight tournaments were overwhelmingly dominated by one man. In 1978, it was Mario Kempes. In 1986 — spoiler alert — it was Maradona. And in 1982, it was Paolo Rossi, which had seemed highly unlikely going into the tournament.

Rossi was Italy's golden boy and had performed impressively at World Cup 1978, scoring three goals. But Rossi was involved in the Totonero match-fixing scandal, which came to light in 1980. He was handed a three-year ban, later reduced to two years on appeal. Rossi protested his innocence and claimed he was punished so strictly because of his prominent role in Italian football, to make an example.

He went two years without playing any football, although Juventus nevertheless signed him midway through his ban. He returned to play only three Serie A games before the World Cup, when Bearzot placed great faith in him. Rossi's rustiness was evident in the group stage, to the extent that he was substituted at half-time in the 1-1 draw with Peru. He didn't score against Argentina, either, and when Marco Tardelli played an inviting cutback to him early in the fifth game, against Brazil, he produced a complete air-kick. He was still goalless.

But then, out of nowhere, Rossi exploded into life when he firmly nodded home left-back Antonio Cabrini's cross. Brazil equalised through Socrates after a lovely flowing move.

Then Rossi pounced on Toninho Cerezo's wayward square pass (hugely reminiscent of Italy's consolation goal against the same opposition in the 1970 final) and fired home. Brazil equalised again, through Falcao's excellent strike.

But then, in the second phase of a corner kick, a scuffed shot found its way to Rossi, all alone — aside from team-mate Francesco Graziani. Both went for the ball. Rossi connected for his hat-trick goal.

After that, he couldn't stop scoring: he scored both goals in the 2-0 semi-final win over Poland, the first a sidefoot, the second a cushioned header, and then opened the scoring in the final. 3, 2, 1.

Rossi wasn't tall or powerful, and he didn't score spectacular goals. In fact, he wasn't obviously good at anything aside from that old knack of being in the right place at the right time.

Even accounting for his two-year ban, Rossi wasn't particularly prolific at club level either. The relatively meagre number of Serie A goals he scored is fitting: 82, as if to symbolise the year he won the World Cup, the World Cup Golden Boot, the World Cup Golden Ball, the Ballon d'Or, and World Player of the Year.

Bearzot was a more attack-minded coach than many of his predecessors, favouring a front three and a glorious playmaker in Fiorentina's Giancarlo Antognoni, who recovered from a fractured skull to be fit for the tournament.

Also notable was Bruno Conti on the right, in part because Italy so rarely produce outstanding wingers. He scored Italy's first goal of the tournament in the group stage, and while he briefly became notable for an incredible open goal miss against Cameroon, he shone in the latter stages, transforming his reputation from a workmanlike wide midfielder to a genuinely world-class attacker.

But in the Italian tradition, Bearzot was a flexible tactician who varied his approach from game to game, attempting to nullify the opponent's strengths. Perhaps that's why Italy looked so poor in the group stage against feeble opposition; they needed to be the underdogs.

Bearzot excelled against stronger sides. Against Argentina, he used an aggressive man-marking system with the terrifying Claudio Gentile playing a particularly fierce game to shackle Diego Maradona. Gentile committed six fouls in that game, all on Maradona. When he was booked against Brazil, too, he was suspended for the semi-final against Poland, so in came 18-year-old Giuseppe Bergomi, who performed well.

Therefore, Bearzot was faced with a dilemma about who to play in the final. But then it turned out Antognoni wouldn't be fit, having limped off with a badly gashed shin against Poland. Bearzot didn't select a replacement for Antognoni, instead playing both Gentile and Bergomi and switching to a system featuring five defenders in front of 40-year-old goalkeeper Dino Zoff, the side's captain.

Of course, had Italy failed to beat West Germany, it would have been considered typical Italian over-caution, but Bergomi nullified Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Gentile did a job on Pierre Littbarski, while the classy Gaetano Scirea swept up behind them and brought the ball forward into attack, including in the move for Italy's second goal. Scirea's class on the ball, to a certain extent, made up for Antognoni's absence.



Italy ran out convincing winners over West Germany in a final that was less thrilling than the 3-1 scoreline suggests.

West Germany seemed tired after their semi-final had gone to penalties — the first shootout in a World Cup — after a 3-3 draw with France. They had little support from most neutrals, partly because of Harald Schumacher's infamous challenge in that semi-final, and partly because of the way they and Austria engineered a mutually convenient result to both progress from the group stage — the infamous Disgrace of Gijon that resulted in FIFA changing the structure of future tournaments so the final group games were always played at the same time.

By half-time, though, you sensed it wasn't going to be Italy's day. Already without Antognoni, they then lost Graziani just seven minutes into the game, with his replacement Alessandro Altobelli struggling to get up to speed. They also missed a penalty when the otherwise faultless left-back Cabrini skewed wide after Conti had been brought down.

But Italy were always the better side. Rossi headed the opener from a Gentile cross that bounced up perfectly for him. Tardelli added the second — more on that shortly — before the brilliant Conti teed up Altobelli for the third. Paul Breitner scored a late consolation.

Oddly, considering the latter stages were really all about Rossi, it was Tardelli who stole the limelight for the most memorable moment of Italy's tournament.

His goal to put Italy 2-0 up in the final, ending a patient passing move by twisting onto his left foot and thumping the ball home, on the slide, was followed by one of football's most famous celebrations, with Tardelli sprinting to nowhere in particular, screaming ‘gol!'.

“I was born with that scream inside me,” he said later. “That was just the moment it came out.”

Considered a runner and a scrapper going into the tournament, similar to how Italy's current manager, Gennaro Gattuso, was spoken about in his playing days, this World Cup showed Tardelli offered technical quality, too, and he was probably the best player in the final.

The neutral's favourites were unquestionably Brazil, who played marvellous attack-minded football in a tournament largely lacking quality. The unfortunate striker Serginho was often blamed for their inability to win the tournament, but the real problem was the defence. They lost to Italy thanks to three Rossi goals, and on each occasion, it was due to a serious defensive lapse.

Their lack of quality at the back was obvious in 1970, but it didn't prove costly; now it did. The defeat by Italy, claimed Zico, was ‘the day football died'. But Brazil were fundamentally flawed, only keeping one clean sheet, against minnows New Zealand.

Granted, Italy only kept two clean sheets themselves, both against Poland. Still, Italy defeated the two South American giants impressively, and were comfortable in the semi-final and final. Ultimately, Italy were considered worthy winners.

Belinda Bencic won the Toray Pan Pacific Open on Sunday in Tokyo, defeating 20-year-old Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes for a milestone 10th career title and second of the season. The win comes 10 years after she lost in the final as an 18-year-old, and this time, entering as the more experienced player paid dividends. Meanwhile, the duo of Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani claimed their fourth doubles title of 2025.

Belinda Bencic entered Sunday's Toray Pan Pacific Open final at a clear disadvantage. 

Tokyo: Scores | Draw | Order of play

Her opponent, 20-year-old Linda Noskova, had spent just 35 minutes on court across the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds in Tokyo, advancing via a retirement and a walkover. Bencic, meanwhile, logged 5 hours and 23 minutes over the previous two days, battling through back-to-back three-set matches. Her quarterfinal win over Karolina Muchova required a comeback from a set down and saw her save a match point.

None of that mattered in the final. The 28-year-old Bencic defeated Noskova 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes to claim redemption for her loss in the final of the very same tournament 10 years ago.

A former Olympic gold medalist -- also won in Tokyo -- Bencic now climbs to No. 11 in the PIF WTA Rankings, putting her back on the cusp of the top 10.

“It was wonderful playing in front of you guys,” Bencic said after the match. “The last time I won here was the Tokyo Olympics when it was an empty stadium, so it was a completely different atmosphere, but it was great to play in front of you guys. I love to play in Japan, so I'm super happy to finally win this tournament.”

The victory marks Bencic's second title of the season and a milestone 10th of her career. It's also the second time in three years she has won multiple titles in a season to bookend her absence from the WTA Tour.

Road to the title: Seeing Bencic hoist the trophy shows that the road less traveled isn't always the best path.

After a first-round bye and a routine second-round win over Varvara Gracheva, Bencic's path intensified. She narrowly defeated Muchova 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 in a three-hour battle that saw her save a match point, then outlasted last year's runner-up Sofia Kenin in 2 hours and 15 minutes to reach the final.

Though the scoreline in the final appeared straightforward, Bencic overcame a series of challenges to secure the title.

Experience pays off: Relatively inexperienced in her first Tokyo final a decade ago, Bencic's experience proved decisive against the younger Noskova.

She saved all 10 break points she faced, including seven in the second set. But the first three came in the opening game. After Noskova fired two big winners to earn the first break point, Bencic responded with a body serve that caught the Czech off guard, forcing her to swat an error into the net.

The gritty six-minute hold that ensued, which saw Bencic save two more break points, set the tone. Bencic, battle-tested from earlier rounds, dragged Noskova into a physical contest. Noskova, who hadn't faced pressure since trailing by a set in the second round to McCartney Kessler, struggled to match her opponent's intensity.

From there, Bencic held serve with ease and broke Noskova twice to close out the first set in 32 minutes.

After trading holds to reach 2-2 in the second set, the fifth game proved pivotal. Once again, Bencic's experience, and Noskova's lack of it, made the difference.

Bencic stayed composed, refusing to let the physical and mental toll force her into errors. On the first four break points faced at 2-2, she waited for Noskova to overhit, which she did each time. Bencic then brushed aside the fifth break point of the game with an ace and held for a 3-2 lead.

Noskova managed one final hold at 3-3, but Bencic converted a break before serving out the match, sealing victory with a forehand winner. Her celebratory scream felt like a release a decade in the making.

BENCIC WINS IN TOKYO! 👏She beats Noskova 6-2, 6-3 to pick up a 10th career title 🤩@BelindaBencic | #TorayPPO pic.twitter.com/NP0jtfELT0

By the numbers: Her final winner was one of 23 that Bencic hit during the match compared to just 13 unforced errors. Noskova actually tallied more winners, with 28, but was undone by 37 unforced errors, many in key moments.

Other than that, the biggest statistical gaps came on each player's first-serve effectiveness and their ability to convert their break opportunities. Noskova created more chances but went 0-for-10 on break points, while Bencic converted 3 of 6.

To further highlight her clean, more efficient brand of tennis in Sunday's final, Bencic landed 68% of her first serves and won nearly 79% of those points. Noskova, while stronger on her second serve, placed just under 63% of her first serves and won fewer than 60% of those points -- well below her season average of 70%.

A bright future: While it wasn't the ending Noskova likely envisioned, the 2025 season showed plenty of promise for the 20-year-old in just her third full season on tour. She'll finish the year having just reached her career-high ranking at No. 13 in the world and as the top-ranked Czech player, ahead of Muchova, Marketa Vondrousova and Barbora Krejcikova.

Despite getting the better of her Sunday, Bencic sees big things in Noskova's future.

“You are a wonderful player, and for sure you will win many titles,” Bencic said during the trophy presentation. “It was an honor to share the court with you. You play very beautiful (tennis).”

In Sunday's doubles final, No. 4 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani defeated No. 3 seeds Anna Danilina and Alexsandra Krunic in straight sets, winning 6-1, 6-4 in 1 hour and 12 minutes to close out the week in Tokyo.

It's the fourth title of the season for the duo, who recently clinched a spot in the WTA Finals in Riyadh and will move up to No. 15 and No. 16, respectively, in the PIF WTA Doubles Rankings.

For Babos, a four-time Grand Slam champion, it's the 29th WTA doubles title of her career as she continues to inch closer to the big 3-0 mark. For Stefani, it's career title No. 13.

Lorenzo Musetti's Vienna run ended in the semi-finals on Saturday against Alexander Zverev, but the Italian's showing still leaves him in a strong position to qualify for his Nitto ATP Finals debut. Musetti increased his lead in eighth place in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin to 440 points ahead of Felix Auger-Aliassime and could seal his place in the season finale with a strong week at the Rolex Paris Masters.

With Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Zverev and Novak Djokovic already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, four spots are still up for grabs in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Alex de Minaur and Musetti currently occupy those positions, with Auger-Aliassime, Casper Ruud and Daniil Medvedev leading the chasing pack. Players have two more weeks to rack up points, with a pair of ATP 250s in Athens and Metz to follow Paris.

Musetti is bidding to join defending champion Sinner on home soil in Turin. In addition to the personal history of his Nitto ATP Finals debut, Musetti would also make Italian history if he can qualify: Never before have two Italian singles players qualified for the season finale in the same year. In 2021, Matteo Berrettini qualified, then withdrew after one match due to an injury. Sinner, an alternate, replaced him.

In Paris, Musetti will open his campaign against countryman Lorenzo Sonego or a qualifier. He could face Medvedev in the third round.

Shelton, also seeking his Turin debut, will face Flavio Cobolli or Tomas Machac in his opening match, with Andrey Rublev a potential third-round opponent. Fritz, a Turin semi-finalist in 2022 and finalist in 2024, seeks his third Nitto ATP Finals appearance. If both qualify, it would mark the first time two Americans qualify for the year-end event since Andy Roddick and James Blake both competed in 2006.

De Minaur is hoping to return to Turin for the second consecutive season. Like Musetti, the Aussie bolstered his position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin with a semi-final showing this week. Sinner ended his run in Vienna on Saturday.

Fritz and De Minaur could meet in a pivotal quarter-final in the top half of the draw, with both players pushing for qualification. They have split 10 previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings.



With 1,000 PIF ATP Ranking points on offer in Paris, Auger-Aliassime and Ruud could both move into the top eight with the title. Medvedev, the 2020 champion at the season finale, would need further points in Athens or Metz to find a way into the top eight and extend his streak of consecutive Nitto ATP Finals to seven.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, currently on 2,585 points, could pass Medvedev for 12th by beating Joao Fonseca in Sunday's Basel final. That would put the Spaniard on 2,755 points, 990 points behind Musetti.

Fonseca will face another Spaniard in Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in Sunday's title match. The No. 8 seed advanced after Ugo Humbert retired in the second set of their semifinal, trailing 7-6 (4), 3-1, due to a lower back injury. It marked Davidovich Fokina's second consecutive win via retirement following No. 4 seed Casper Ruud's withdrawal in the quarterfinals with an ankle issue after losing the first set 7-6 (1).Davidovich Fokina, seeking his first ATP title, has finished runner-up in all four of his previous final appearances. Fonseca, meanwhile, will be bidding for his second career title and first above the ATP 250 level, having won his maiden trophy in Buenos Aires earlier this season.

The teenager's path to the Basel final included a win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, a walkover against No. 7 seed Jakub Mensik, and a quarterfinal victory after No. 9 seed Denis Shapovalov retired with a knee injury while trailing 3-6, 6-3, 4-1.No matter the result on Sunday, Fonseca is guaranteed a new career-high ranking, projected to rise to at least No. 34 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.“It's been an amazing year, starting at No. 130 in the world, now 40-something and into a first ATP 500 final,” Fonseca said.“We didn't go to Asia this year, I was a little bit sick. I was working with my mentality, and now I'm getting the opportunities… I'm just very happy to be here.”

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

It was a tough Qualifying for Oscar Piastri at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver ending the session in P8 – nearly eight-tenths adrift of polesitter team mate Lando Norris.

Oscar Piastri was left to reflect on a “frustrating” Qualifying at the Mexico City Grand Prix after ending the session in P8, with the Australian admitting that it was “not the lap time that I'm expecting”.

Having been unable to match the pace of McLaren team mate Lando Norris in the second and third practice sessions – with Norris sitting out FP1 while rookie Pato O'Ward took the wheel – Piastri again seemed some distance away during Qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Norris ultimately sealed pole position in Q3, but Piastri was nearly eight-tenths adrift of the Briton back in P8, though he will be promoted to P7 on the grid for Sunday's race due to the Williams of Carlos Sainz ahead of him taking a five-place penalty.

Looking back on how the session unfolded, Piastri explained: “It was tough. It felt like some of my laps when it counted were not bad, but just not the lap time that I'm expecting obviously. There's some things we need to try to understand, but obviously a frustrating session.”

There appeared to be a potential concern over the power unit in Piastri's MCL39 during Q2 when the championship leader radioed in that “something weird happened” in Turn 5.

When asked about this afterwards – as well as being quizzed on what specifically he is missing at the moment given his tricky weekend so far – the 24-year-old responded: “The PU was fine, I think – just a small under-delivery in one of the corners on the lap, but nothing major that continued.

“The thing that's been missing is the lap time. Everything's felt normal. The car's never going to feel amazing around here with the high altitude, but everything's felt pretty normal – just the lap time's not been there.”

With the focus now switching to Sunday's race, Piastri outlined how he intends to approach the launch when the 71-lap Grand Prix gets underway.

“Try and have a good start, and then see what I can do,” the McLaren driver – whose championship lead over Norris stands at just 14 points – stated. “It's a long run to Turn 1, so there's  opportunities there and I'll try and take them.”

Kimi Antonelli will start Sunday's race from sixth with Mercedes team mate George Russell set to line up fourth.

Kimi Antonelli believes "there was a little bit more" potential to come from Mercedes in Qualifying for the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the young Italian set to start sixth.

Antonelli had shown encouraging pace on Friday during practice, finishing the two sessions in second and third respectively, but come Saturday's Qualifying session, the 20-year-old dropped back in the pecking order, finishing more than half a second behind poleman Lando Norris.

"I think there was a little bit more," said Antonelli when asked if he had extracted everything from the car.

"A really scrappy Q1, just couldn't find my rhythm and it was a bit all rushed in Q2. And then Q3 was a cleaner session but I just didn't do a good enough job at the start of the session and it put me in more of an unfavourable position.

"Just a shame but still P6, close to P3, we can put on a fight.

"The start is going to be very important and hopefully from there we can gain a few places and fight for the front."

Team mate George Russell will start in front of Antonelli having qualified fourth, with reigning World Champion Max Verstappen splitting the Mercedes pair.

The Briton was left surprised to be behind the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton on the grid and believed that although the run to Turn 1 at the start would be crucial, other strategic opportunities might present themselves.

"The order is a little bit surprising. Ordinarily if we were behind two Ferraris we'd probably be lining up P5 or P6 on the grid," he said.

"P4 I think was a decent result and I think those three were out of reach but it was so close between me and I think Oscar [Piastri] was only one-tenth behind me and he was in P8, so glad to be on the right side of it.

"Race pace is good. I don't want to be negative but I think Turn 1, Lap 1 is going to be very important but there's still always chances.

"You've got the two Ferraris, maybe they can off-set the strategy to put pressure on the McLaren and equally, those two can't pit on the same lap so maybe I can undercut one of them. Who knows."

Laugh Factory Chicago is crowdsourcing to assist night manager Nathan Griffin with legal funds after he was arrested Friday morning outside the comedy club.


	Despite being born in America, masked federal agents tackled him to the ground and reportedly took him into custody without due process, for attempting to intervene with an immigration operation.


	A video of the arrest shows at least four agents in camouflage pushing Griffin to the ground and handcuffing him, briefly pinning his mother Elaine Plybon down in the process. “Why are you doing this? Where are you taking him?” bystanders could be heard shouting as he was put in the backseat.

	











	“After being arrested and hidden throughout the system, he finally resurfaced about 4 hours after his detainment in FBI custody awaiting a hearing for a federal assault charge which could carry 8 years in prison if convicted,” wrote Griffin's brother-in-law on a GoFundMe page for his attorney costs.

	In a video since posted by his mother, she noted that her “voice is still very messed up” and her hand is hurting from the altercation. “For those of you who don't know, I was in Chicago visiting my son, and he was kidnapped by Border Patrol in front of my eyes,” she said.


	“When I think about going out the door in the morning, I don't want to,” she added in part. “Because I do not want to encounter the SUV, the screams, the crying and the horrific things that I saw before I was pulled into the fray when somebody tried to kidnap my son.


	Neighborhood resident Will Kolic told NBC Chicago he saw agents pull up and grab a man who appeared to be Hispanic before people gathered and “started screaming stop it,” before more agents stepped out of the vehicle and arrested Griffin.


	A Border Patrol spokesperson told the outlet that Griffin “attempted to impede and obstruct federal officers” by attempting to shut the car door on an agent's leg. “The individual was immediately detained and turned over to the FBI for investigation,” they said.

	










A post shared by Elaine Plybon (@eplybon)


	Chicago Police arrived on the scene around 9:20am in response to a call about a battery in progress, telling NBC they worked to “de-escalate and conduct crowd control to ensure all those who had gathered at the location remained safe.”


	In a since deleted post by Laugh Factory Chicago, sharing the arrest video, they stated that Griffin's family is aware of his arrest and “actively working to get his release,” according to CBS News.


	Griffin's arrest comes after the Trump administration deployed 300 California National Guard troops to Oregon, under the guise of law and order, in addition to boots on the ground in Chicago and other major cities.

'Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reze Arc' is the latest victory for Japanese anime. Elsewhere, awards hopeful Springsteen biopic 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' settled for a fourth-place finish.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Japanese anime feature Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc is off to an impressive start at the U.S. box office, where it opened to an estimated $17.3 million from 3,003 theaters, well ahead of expectations in another win for the genre. The acclaimed manga pic boasts a 96 percent critics score and a 99 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes — a rare combo, along with an A CinemaScore and five out of five stars on PostTrak.


	Since its first launch at the Japanese box office last month, Chainsaw Man — The Movie has already grossed north of $80 million worldwide. Sony and Crunchyroll are handling the movie domestically and in select overseas markets. Produced by the team at MAPPA, the R-rated pic is based on the hit manga-turned-anime TV series that is available to stream in the U.S. on Disney+, Crunchyroll and other platforms.

Chainsaw Man follows the adventures of Denji (Kikunosuke Toya), a teenager and demon hunter who is killed by his overlords, the yakuza. But when his beloved chainsaw-powered, devil-dog Pochita (Shiori Izawa) makes a deal and sacrifices himself, he is reborn with the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. Along with violence, the pic doubles as a teenage romance with the arrival of the mysterious Reze. However, Reze is not quite who she seems, and a series of battles ensues that could destroy Tokyo when their love story takes a twisted turn.

	











	Directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara, the film is based on Tatsuki Fujimoto's original story, with a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko. “It's safe to say that manga and anime fans won't be disappointed, even if they'll inevitably be nitpicking about one narrative aspect or another,” writes THR in its review.


	Heading into its U.S. opening, Chainsaw Man was expected to battle Blumhouse and Universal's holdover hit Black Phone 2 for No. 1 with a debut in the $11 million to $12 million range. But it quickly pulled ahead of the pack thanks to males, who made up 75 percent of all ticket buyers, and younger moviegoers. More than 50 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25. It's also drawing an ethnically diverse audience, including over-indexing among Asian moviegoers (20 percent), according to PostTrak.


	In a second surprise twist, holdover Black Phone 2 found itself in a closer race with Regretting You — the second Colleen Hoover book adaptation to hit the big screen after 2024's box office blockbuster It Ends With Us — but ultimately pulled ahead by a narrow margin, according to Sunday estimates (the race won't be officially called until Monday morning).


	The pic, a needed win for Blumhouse, fell a scant 52 percent to $13 million for a domestic total of $49.1 million and $80.4 million globally. The Blumhouse and Universal's release is holding remarkably well for a horror title, and should continue to take advantage of being the only major studio horror film opening nationwide over the Halloween corridor this year.

	











Regretting You opened to an estimated $12.9 million domestically and $22.9 million globally.


	Many expected Regretting You to be dinged by generally withering reviews, but the female-fueled pic garnered strong exits on PostTrak and boasts an audience score of 87 percent on Rotten Tomatoes (its CinemaScore, however, was only a B). It's also clearly benefiting from being one of the few films to target women amid a glut of male-sewing fare, and is also a testament to Hoover's continued popularity. (She's stayed mum on the topic of the ongoing legal battle between It Ends With Us director/producer Justin Baldoni and actress/producer Blake Lively). Females made up at least 80 percent of the audience, while nearly 75 percent of all ticket buyers were under the age of 35.


	The new film is described as a romantic drama that explores the aspirational theme of living life fully and without regrets. Constantin Films produced and financed the movie, with Paramount acquiring domestic and certain overseas rights. Internationally, the film opened week in 40 markets, including the U.K., Australia, Brazil and Mexico, for an early foreign total of $10 million.


	Disney's Bruce Springsteen bio-drama and awards hopeful Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere had to settle for fourth place in its debut after coming in behind expectations with $9.1 million domestically and $7 million internationally for a global start of $16.1 million (it has yet to roll out in 20 percent of the foreign marketplace). The movie, coming in on the low end of expectations, is skewing notably older, which is no surprise, and Disney is confident the pic will have staying power because of its subject matter, originality and solid-to-strong audience scores.

	











	More than 60 percent of ticket buyers on Friday were 45 and older, including 40 percent over the age of 55. That's a demo that isn't known for rushing out to see a film on opening weekend; it also cares more about reviews. The movie's Rotten Tomatoes critics score presently rests at 61 percent, while the RT audience score is far stronger at 85 percent. And it earned a B+ CinemaScore, which isn't a disaster.


Springsteen, playing in a total of 3,460 cinemas, benefited from 250 IMAX runs and an additional 750 in other premium large-format auditoriums, but it still couldn't clear $10 million. The music-infused pic stars Jeremy Allen White in the titular role, and he is credited in THR‘s review for giving a “raw and internalized performance as The Boss.” Jeremy Strong, Stephen Graham and Odessa Young also star in director Scott Cooper's examination of a brutal comedown after a blockbuster tour, which yielded the prolific musician's most personal album, Nebraska.


	It remains to be seen how much of an impact the first two games of this year's World Series — which pits the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Toronto Blue Jays — had on the weekend box office. Generally speaking, NFL games pose far more competition. At the same time, L.A. is the largest moviegoing market alongside New York City (it is also the biggest market for anime). Friday night's opening game of the World Series, as well as Saturday's, are both in Toronto.


	At the specialty box office, Neon launched Shelby Oaks in 1,823 locations. Marking YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann‘s debut feature, the found-footage pic opened to a solid $2.4 million. So far, its main claim to fame is that it raised $1.4 million via a Kickstarter campaign, the highest amount ever for a horror title, per the crowd-sourcing platform. Neon later provided some additional funds.

	











	Focus Features' awards contender Bugonia also made headlines in its limited debut at the specialty box office, and is reporting an estimated opening per-location average of $40,588 from 17 cinemas, one of the best platform starts of the year to date (it will also be the top location average of the weekend by a long shot). Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the acclaimed film stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons.

Lana Del Rey took the stage Saturday at Neil Young's “Harvest Moon” charity concert, with the singer opened her set with a rendition of the host's “The Needle and the Damage Done.”


	“I thought we'd get started with a little bit of Neil,” Del Rey told the crowd as she walked onstage at Lake Hughes, California's Painted Turtle Summer Camp. She and her band then launched into a faithful and stirring take on the Harvest classic.


	Del Rey's set also included performances of her own “Arcadia,” “Video Games,” “Summertime Sadness,” and “Norman Fucking Rockwell,” as well as her first-ever solo performance of “Let the Light In.”

	Saturday's gig marked Del Rey's last scheduled performance of 2025 — and the last show on her live itinerary in general — but there's always the slim chance she might randomly hop up onstage if the moment strikes her. The singer previously revealed that her country-inspired album has been pushed to 2026.

	











	This year's Harvest Moon concert also featured sets from Beck, John Mayer, and Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts. Proceeds from the concert will benefit the Painted Turtle, which provides a summer camp experience for kids with serious medical issues, and the Bridge School, which educates children with severe speech and physical disabilities.

	As Yorgos Lanthimos rolls out another award-worthy film with Emma Stone for the third consecutive year, he's due for some R & R.


	The 5x Oscar nominee recently admitted he needs “a little break” after his latest movie Bugonia‘s wide release on Oct. 31, despite also intending to take a breather after his previous two titles, Poor Things (2023) and Kinds of Kindness (2024).


	“Well, I can't keep doing that anymore. [Laughs] That's what we're certain of right now,” he told Collider, adding: “It's a big mistake. I think I need a break. I've said that before in between the other three, but I'm serious now. You can hold me to it. I'm going to take a little break.”

	Lanthimos' pending hiatus comes after Poor Things earned him Academy Award nods for Best Picture and Best Director, while Stone won the award for Best Actress. The pair also made Kinds of Kindness while he completed post-production on Poor Things.


	“I decide which film to make every time a script is ready, so when it is ready, and we've been working on something for such a long time, it just feels like a shame to just leave it there and wait,” he explained. “So, I kind of forced myself, almost, to try and find the time to do it immediately after I finished something.” 


	Lanthimos continued, “Like we shot Kinds of Kindness during that very long period of VFX on Poor Things, so I felt that I needed to do something during that time. Then, Bugonia, I had read three years before, and we worked with Will [Tracy] a little bit on the script, so it felt ready, and we just wanted to go out and make it. So, you find the will and the strength, but at some point, it runs out. We're at that point.”


	In Bugonia, now playing in select theaters, two conspiracy theorists (Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis) kidnap a powerful CEO (Stone), convinced she's an alien intent on destroying Earth.

SUNDAY AM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is landing at the high end of where we were seeing it yesterday with $17.2M after a $5.2M million Saturday in a weekend where the Toronto Blue Jays and LA Dodgers were a complete distraction in the World Series, now with 1-1 tied streak. Running global cume on this anime movie is $108 million (40% of that coming from a September Japan release). 


	Sony and Crunchyroll know how to speak to their followers directly. They kicked off the campaign at Anime Expo Los Angeles in July which included a MAPPA panel (they produced the movie) and activations on the expo floor with MAPPA and Crunchyroll booths and Pochita walkabout and photo ops. Sony trailered Chainsaw Man on Demon Slayer, Him, One Battle After Another, and Tron: Ares. There was a big splash at New York Comic-Con two weeks ago with a MAPPA panel, exclusive BTS footage, a surprise fan screening raffle, Pochita photo ops, and more. 

	











	There were also Anime Influencer screenings at Alamo Drafthouse Downtown LA attended by 80+ leading creators, as well as an Anime Men (13M followers) Imax advance screening at the large format exhibitor's HQ in Playa Vista, CA. Sony also tapped into the Crunchyroll fanbase with a stunted two-part recap program for the IP on the anime brand's platforms. There was also a presence across Crunchyroll's platform and owned digital channels across 65+ markets, premium App Homepage placement, dedicated newsletters, video ads, podcast ad spots, and a YouTube watch-along livestream of the first season across five global channels. Premium formats, Imax and 3D drove an updated 63% of the weekend with AMC Empire in NYC the highest grossing venue with $72K.

	Universal/Blumhouse's second weekend of Black Phone 2 is edging out the start of Paramount‘s Colleen Hoover movie, Regretting You, $13M to $12.8M. Overindexing regional update shows the Mountain, Midwest, South Central and Southern areas for the Hoover source material pic. Megaplex Theatres in Geneva, UT is the leading single-location gross at $16.9K. Bestselling woman's novel-turned-film, Where the Crawdads Sing, held -40% in weekend two and legged out to a massive 5.2 multiple off its $17.2M opening for a final stateside of $90.2M. That landed an A-, Regretting You has a B. We'll see what the hold factor is here for Regretting You; note that Crawdads had the advantage of a July 2022 playdate. 


Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is arriving at the low end of its projections with $9.1M. That start is just north of what MGM's Aretha Franklin movie Respect did in its opening, $8.8M, which bowed in the summer of 2021 as movie theater were making their way back from the pandemic. Respect finaled at $24.2M off an A CinemaScore. Springsteen‘s global take is $16.1M, under the $20M the studio was expecting. The movie was shot with New Jersey tax credits and cost a net $55 million. Respect also cost a net of $55M. While the movie was made with the utmost respect and authenticity for The Boss, getting his sign off so that the Warren Zanes novel could make it to screen under the direction of Scott Cooper, a movie about the global rock star's depression period during the making of his Nebraska album, pre Born in the U.S.A., is not a movie that his fans want to rush out for. Seriously, a lot of pure heart from Jeremy Allen White's prep as Bruce Springsteen to the production shooting in The Boss' NJ stomping ground; a lot went into this. Also complicating Springsteen‘s success is a non-holiday release date during an October World Series-NFL perfect storm weekend. Had Springsteen been released during the holidays, that's when this older skewing audience of 59% over 45 could truly find it. The movie was brought in by incoming Disney chief David Greenbaum as his first project since segueing over from Serachlight after A24 passed on the movie over its production cost. In its essence, Springsteen is more of an arthouse film than a big Bohemian Rhapsody 20th Century title, however, the studio didn't want to put it through Searchlight since they recently played James Mangold's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. Springsteen championed the movie during the promotional tour. He didn't sign as an EP as he never desired the production to come across as a vanity project. 


	Also, as is the Russian roulette with these possible awards contenders, if they're trotted out too early at the fall film festival troika, and they're not exactly perfect, it could spell doom for a movie's prospects. Springsteen, despite the brilliant performance White, didn't exactly wow following its Telluride world premiere and has been sitting on Rotten Tomatoes with a 61% fresh critics score. For the penny-counting older skewing audiences and their streaming apps at home, that doesn't scream ‘get out of the house.' At the same time, Disney is hoping for some sort of hold with 85% Rotten Tomatoes score and that 60% definite recommend from Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits. 


	Note, just because Springsteen bottomed out, doesn't mean that rock performer biopic is dead. True, they are hard to stitch so that it's not the same old, drugs, sex and rock n' roll, but you have to have a groundswell, overcoming all odds story, and chock-a-block concert performances. This has been a successful sub-genre with Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocket Man and Elvis and Bob Marley: One Love post Covid. Why did A Complete Unknown win over in the story of off-beat poet-turned-electric guy, Bob Dylan? Why it was the whole romantic tension between Timothee Chalamet's Dylan and Monica Barbaro's Joan Baez (note that movie received an A CinemaScore to Springsteen‘s B+). 

	











	Pre-release social media universe reach on Springsteen counted 160M, which was +4% ahead of the music bio genre norm per RelishMix, yet below that of A Complete Unknown (187.4M), Bob Marley: One Love (193.6M),  


	In better news for arthouse, Focus Features' first limited weekend of Yorgos Lanthimos' zany corporate politco-hostage comedy Bugonia posted a $40,5K opening theater average at 17 theaters — that's the fifth best opening theater average YTD. Huge performances in NYC, LA and Austin, I understand.The Emma Stone-Jesse Plemmons movie posted $690K off of very shiny critical reviews of 90% coming out of its Venice and Telluride premiere. The movie cost a ton of cash, Focus taking this package off the table for $45 million (I hear the movie itself cost $55 million). Part of the promotion included free screenings for anyone who is bald, or yearning to be with a barber on hand at cinemas. Bugonia expands to 1,800 locations over Halloween weekend. Note, the distribution plan here for Bugonia is different from Lanthimos' Oscar darlings, The Favourite and Poor Things which played the Thanksgiving and early December corridor, riding their awards season buzz and posting and holding weekends where those pics were often making $2M to $3M a weekend.

SATURDAY AM: In an autumn where prestige awards potential isn't working, nor attempted tentpoles like Tron: Ares, Sony/Crunchyroll anime proves its merit again with its latest Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc which is now looking at a $15.5M-$17M opening after an $8.5M Friday, powered by an A CinemaScore from fans. 


	It will be interesting to see if the audience expands today as the fanbase for this movie are shouting its praises to the sky with an 82% definite recommend on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak.  

	











	This is the ninth anime movie to open north of $10M, which is a big deal, because not every Japanese animation IP works on the big screen. What's great about this is that Sony has a new solid franchise in the wake of Demon Slayer. Even if this drops tonight in typical front-loaded anime fashion, it's another No. 1 win for Sony this year with non-traditional motion picture fare. As studios execs remain perplexed about what exactly works this fall, it's all anime, horror and Taylor Swift. 


	Imax and premium large format screens are revving 58% of Chainsaw‘s weekend with the West, South and South Central its best grossing regions. There's also a great swath of diverse demos all around in 32% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, a very strong 20% Asian American and 13% Black. The AMC Empire in NYC is the top grossing theater with close to $45K. 


	A title acquired during the Brian Robbins regime at Paramount, Regretting You, is doing its job in attracting 83% female moviegoers with a $13M 2nd place opening after a $5.2M Friday and B CinemaScore. In PostTrak exits, women love the movie giving it a 77% definite recommend. Regretting You isn' the most popular of the Colleen Hoover novels in the It Ends With Us-sense of the word, and it didn't have the whole Blake Lively-Ryan Reynolds post-Deadpool & Wolverine marketing halo effect, so take that into account. Paramount snapped up the $30 million financed production post the Hoover It Ends With Us box office fiesta in summer 2024 (that moving making $351 million worldwide); Amazon MGM Studios took the author's novel Verity (out on Oct. 2 next year with Anne Hathaway and Dakota Johnson) while Universal snapped up Reminders of Him (March 13 with Maika Monroe).


	Diverse demos for Regretting You are 50% Caucasian, 36% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian American and 5% Black. Women over 25 led at 45%, with women under 25 at 39%. 


	Distrib sources are complaining that the World Series is cutting into male moviegoers this weekend. Then why the hell are you booking movies aimed at men during a juggernaut time when guys can't come? Good on Paramount for capitalizing on the opportunity to book a female-driven title on the marquee. 


	While we're on the subject of bad release dates for what should be older skewing male movies: 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere which has now shifted its range to $9M-$10M (many are seeing $9M) after a B+ CinemaScore in fourth with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 second weekend ahead in 3rd with $12M (-56%). If Springsteen hits the bottom of its tracking range at $9M, it won't be “Glory Days” for this net $55M Jeremy Allen White-Jeremy Strong starring production. On the upside, the movie has a 60% definite recommend on PostTrak, so we'll see if this improves. Why isn't this brand-name rock performer movie not being released over Christmas ala last year's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown when a bigger audience is available? While older Springsteen fans showed up last night at 40% over 55 (the pic's biggest demo) and 59% over 45, it was clearly not in bulk judging from the grosses. Also, Springsteen was largely female leaning movie at 52%. Women over 25 bought tickets at 46% and men over 25 went at 42%. Overall, this is very Caucasian leaning movie at 85% with few diverse demos showing up. We'll get into this more as the weekend goes on, but off the bat, the release date isn't doing this making-of-the-Nebraska-album any favors.  


	Premium large format screens for the Scott Cooper directed title are repping a quarter of the weekend's gross with best areas of play in the East and Midwest. AMC Lincoln Square is the top grossing location with over $32K so far. 

	











	NEON's Shelby Oaks gets a C+ after a $1.1M Friday on its way to around $2.3M now. Best areas for the  Chris Stuckmann directed movie are the West, South Central, and East with AMC's Boston Common 19 the top grossing venue stateside with just over $7K. Fifty-three percent guys, 74% 18-34. This is a standard NEON niche genre play. 


	Overall ticket sales are clocking an estimated $75.4M, which is +8% from last weekend, but down 20% from a year ago when Venom: The Last Dance opened to $51M. Remember, New Line's Mortal Kombat 2 was suppose to open this weekend before it moved to early May next year; a brilliant release date change by Warner Bros, sidestepping the World Series. 


	Saturday numbers:


	1. Chainsaw Man (Sony) 3,003 theaters, Fri $8.5M, 3-day $15M-$17M/Wk 1

FRIDAY PM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is slicing its way to the top of the box office with a good $8M today for what's shaping up to be a $14 million-plus weekend.


	While at the high end of its $11M-$14M projections, and a clear No. 1, the caution here is that it's the first night of the World Series with the Los Angeles Dodgers taking on the Toronto Blue Jays. Los Angeles is the No. 1 market for anime movies.


	RelishMix reports that the social media reach on Chainsaw Man is massive at a half billion, 6x above anime genre norms across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram combined with gigantic video views counts on YouTube of 351 million and counting. Note Chainsaw Man‘s reach on social is 2.5x more than Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle before its opening which stood at 200 million.


	Reports the social media stat org, “Convo runs positive for Chainsaw Man-The Movie: Reze Arc, with fans losing their minds over animation studio MAPPA's cinematic polish, the faithfulness to the manga's art style, and Kenshi Yonezu's soundtrack. Theatrical worthiness is a recurring theme, with audiences insisting this arc had to be a movie. The chatter even positions it above competing anime events, with praise like ‘compared to the recent Infinity Castle, Reze arc was kick ass—would watch in theaters again' and ‘I absolutely love how loyal they stayed to the art style, it feels like the manga came to life.' 


	The following music video alone is racking up close to 68 million views on YouTube. 


	Second is a three-way race between 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere (3,460 theaters), Paramount's Colleen Hoover movie Regretting You (3,393 theaters) and the second weekend of Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 (3,460 theaters) each looking at $10.8M-$12M. For Black Phone 2, that hold-range is better than -60% with at least $47M by Sunday, which would be $400K less than Black Phone at the same point in time of its ten-day run. 


	Fifth is the third weekend of Disney's Tron: Ares at 2,940 theaters with $1.3M today and $4M+ for the weekend. 

	











	Neon's horror thriller from Chris Stuckmann, Shelby Oaks, is spotting $1.1M today for a $2.5M take at 1,823 sites. This is in the range of Neon's summer 2024 horror title, Cuckoo which opened to $3M.


FRIDAY AM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc revved up $3.4 million in previews Thursday in screenings that began at 4 p.m. at 2,500 locations.


	By the way, that preview number is close to the $3.8M posted by Demon Slayer: Mugen Train back in April 2021, on its way to a three-day total f $21.2M as movie theaters were reopening from Covid. That title, released by Funimation/Aniplex, had a Friday of $9.5M.


	The Tatsuya Yoshihara-directed Chainsaw Man based on the popular manga is expected to ring up $11M+ in a weekend that might now be too close to call with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 with an expected $12M+ second frame.


Chainsaw Man is 100% fresh from 18 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 99% audience score. 


	Meanwhile, 20th Century Studios' $55M Scott Cooper-directed Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere strummed $850,000. The movie is expected to bring in $9M-$11M. Note that preview take is under the $1.4M Christmas preview gross of Searchlight's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, which went electric over the holidays with a $7.2M opening day, $11.6M 3-day and 5-day total of $23.2M. Springsteen is opening at 3,460 theatres including 250 Imax screens and 750 Premium Large Format screens. Critics aren't wowed by this rock performer biopic at 61% fresh, but fans last night enjoyed it better at 85%.


	Jeremy Allen White plays Bruce Springsteen and Jeremy Strong plays his manager Jon Landau in a semi-biopic about The Boss recording the personal 1982 album Nebraska which preceded his global phenomenon Born in the U.S.A.


	Paramount is not reporting grosses on Regretting You given its limited run in under 500 theaters last night, with one showtime for the A Night of No Regrets fan event that included a Q&A with cast and director Josh Boone with a special performance by Hannah Cohen. Nonetheless, sources say the movie did better than Springsteen last night. Regretting You was forecasted at $9M-$11M this weekend in what is the second Colleen Hoover novel feature adaptation to hit the screen after the massive success of It Ends With Us. Critics don't like the schmaltziness of Regretting You at 34% on RT, but there was also never beginning with them on It Ends With Us which they threw Kleenex boxes at with 54%.


	Neon this frame has the psychological thriller Shelby Oaks, which did $515K from combined mystery screenings and last night's previews. The movie is expected to file in the low single digits.


Black Phone 2 posted $1.6M yesterday, off 11% from Wednesday, for a first week of $36M, up 3% from its 2022 first chapter.


	The rest of the top 5:


	1.) Black Phone 2 (Uni) 3,411 theaters, Thu $1.6M (-11% from Wed), Wk $36M/Wk 1 


	2.) Tron: Ares (Dis) 4,000 theaters, Thu $698K (-22%), Wk $15M (-65%), Total $58.4M/Wk 2

I loved Bugonia so much. Twisted, hilarious and super original. I hadn't seen the original Korean movie it was inspired from until just a few days ago and it manages to completely make the story its own and offer something fresh and utterly compelling imo. I know Emma Stone probably isn't going to win a third Oscar at such a young age but dammit if we were going performance wise and not politics or whatever girl should have it in the bag. What a force she is.

Speaking of music biopics, there's a Milli Vanilli movie barely released in the US that is available to see now on various streamers that is absolutely fantastic.

JAW & Glenn Powell, they're not “movie stars” I ain't paying $20+ to see streaming stars with streaming caliber acting in mediocre movies.

The Two Jeremy's have 0 drawing power whatsoever. I can't believe social Network 2 is going with both of them.

I think the star of that project is Aaron Sorkin, much like the stars of the first movie were Sorkin and David Fincher.

Didn't wbd used to own Crunchyroll and sell it off?

	In late 1961, barely a year after he'd arrived in New York City from the Midwest, Bob Dylan already contained multitudes. The proof arrives early in Through the Open Window, the 18th edition of Dylan's ongoing Bootleg Series. That fall, Dylan, then only 20 years old, recorded his first album with producer John Hammond. Among the many unheard tapes crammed into the box's eight discs are leftovers from those sessions, including an alternate version of the traditional “Man of Constant Sorrow.” Sounding like an unsure Boy Scout asking for the approval of his Scoutmaster after attempting a square knot, Dylan lays down a take and then asks Hammond,  “Did you get that? … Did you like that?” But when Hammond asks if anyone else had cut the song already, a different Dylan emerges. “Not that way … A different way, I guess,” he says, before mentioning a peer on the scene who'd already released a version of the song. “Judy Collins did it. But not a version … not like that. That's a different one.”

	











	On a compilation that gives us any number of glimpses into Dylan's growth and creative process before he went electric, that moment is both a throwaway and a deep reveal. Dylan's version of “Man of Constant Sorrow” isn't vastly superior to anyone else's; he doesn't rock it out like he did with other folk and blues songs he was playing at the time. But his subtle brush-off of Collins is a sign of the cocky and brash kid already beginning to emerge — the same one who could cut down people down to size on his way to redefining himself and jolting both the New York folk scene and the world of pop at large.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Taking in the years 1956 to 1963, Through the Open Window serves as an unofficial companion to last year's A Complete Unknown biopic. It starts before that entirely credible and affecting film did, with a teenage Robert Zimmerman romping through the Shirley & Lee hit  “Let the Good Times Roll” in a St. Paul music store (the first known recording of Dylan). The box wraps up about two years before Dylan's rampaging performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, depicted in the movie. As with the film, it tells a familiar story: earnest and ambitious but seemingly fumbling kid with a mysterious background moves to the big city, ingratiates himself with a music community, knocks everyone's beret's off with his skills and songs, and then begins leaving behind all those inspired by news headlines in favor of more ambitious, poetic, and personal ones.

	Needless to say, that story has been told on his official releases of the era, from Bob Dylan to Another Side of Bob Dylan and Bringing It All Back Home and beyond. But Through the Open Window brings us another side of that transformation. Using a plethora of sources — unearthed club recordings, tapes of Dylan singing in people's homes or at rallies, outtakes from recording sessions, stage remarks — it allows us to eavesdrop as Dylan moves from the Midwest to New York, hits the Village coffeehouse and club circuit, tries out songs for friends, interacts with fellow performers, plunders some of their repertoire (especially that of his mentor Dave Van Ronk), even interacts with a gushing radio DJ. As familiar as that map is, we've never been afforded such a granular document of that metamorphosis, and how fast, relentless, and often breathtaking it could be.  


	Compiled by Steve Berkowitz and Sean Wilentz, the massive box (also available in a two-disc distillation for Dylanologists on a budget) includes a certain amount of material already available on previous Bootleg Series editions and other Dylan compilations. But 48 of its cuts have never been heard by anyone other than collectors and Dylan's gatekeepers, which lends added weight to its historic value. We finally get to hear one of his fall 1961 sets at Gerde's Folk City: not the one that New York Times critic Robert Shelton saw, resulting in the rave review that landed Dylan his record deal, but one a few nights later, which is close enough. We get the first-ever live performance of “Blowin' in the Wind,” which shows how fully formed the song was from the start. Not all of these rarities live up to their legends: that Folk City set is a bit anticlimactic, and “Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues,” his infamous dig at the nutjob conservative group, is a little too cute. But their appearance on any Dylan collection is long overdue.

	Along the way, though, Dylan's transformation from frisky, plucky folk upstart — a walking, talking, cap-wearing version of the Anthology of Folk Music collection everyone was discovering at the time — to master of his domain is heard in large and small ways. Recordings of him playing Woody Guthrie and Jesse Fuller songs before he moved to New York show how fully invested he already was in American vernacular music; his sound and persona were already in the works before he stepped into his friend's car for that ride to New York City. We also hear deeper examples of the way he pillaged the sources around him. On a recording of an early, bumpier version of “Tomorrow Is a Long Time,” he mentions the “tape recorder machine” in front of him as if he were auditioning for a Guthrie biopic.


	As anyone who saw his early New York performances still attests, Dylan was also legitimately funny, and the comic timing on display in these tapes is another revelation. At various shows, he charms audiences with tales of almost getting hit by a bus on the way to the venues, the idea of written setlists (“I don't much believe in lists … I went around and I copied down all the best songs I could find off everybody else's lists,” he cracks), or a hokey fake-hootenanny movie he'd just seen in Times Square (“Don't tell anybody,” he jokes, adding, “42nd Street, a very hip street”). It's a chatty, endearing side of Dylan we've rarely, if ever, heard onstage since. There are also hints of his post-folk future in an early original, “I Got a New Girl,” which he croons as if prepping for Self-Portrait years later, and the piano-locomotive “Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,” a Times They Are A-Changin' outtake that pounds with a rock & roll heart. No purist was he, right from the start.

	As the box hurtles toward its finale — the complete recording of his fall 1963 Carnegie Hall concert, which cemented his stature — Dylan's feel for traditional songs grows deeper, and the growth in his own songwriting, so quickly, remains astounding. The transformation of “Tomorrow Is a Long Time” into the somber beauty it became is remarkable, and a version of “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,” taped at a friend's place in Los Angles, is mesmerizing. By the time he arrives at Carnegie Hall, with three albums under his belt, Dylan is fully in command of his voice, songs, and presence. He sings his “North Country Blues” as if he were a member of that devastated coal-mining family before moving onto “A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,” which feels like a statement of its own: That was the feel of folk music then, but this is folk music now, and on his terms.

	











	That tape, which takes up the last two discs of Through the Open Window, is also unexpectedly illuminating. The audience is hushed during his protest songs and laughs adoringly when he talks about an academic not quite understanding the title phrase of “Blowin' in the Wind.” (“Now this guy's gonna be a teacher!” Dylan retorts.) They sound in awe of him, as they should: The recording stands as one of Dylan's greatest (unreleased) concert albums. In that moment, on that night, the very thought that he would largely abandon that approach and some of those songs — he would never again play a few of them, like “Lay Down Your Weary Tune” — must have been unfathomable, and we share their discombobulation. Yet move on he did, plugging in just over a year and a half later and leaving that period in the Carnegie Hall dust. But as Through the Open Window makes clear, he was always on the verge of slamming one window shut and opening another to an entirely different world.

Will the song make its debut on the charts 17 years after it first was released? 


Treavor Anderson


	Kid Cudi's “Maui Wowie,” which debuts this week in the 70s, really blowing up on TikTok. This is a song from 2008 by the way. So it's our first time actually seeing Kid Cudion the Hot 100 in a lead role since 2020 so welcome back to the chart, Cudi. But this trend is going crazy. This song is blowing up, so that's something to watch out for as the streams keep going up, that song could really be a big hit for him.

Sometimes, even the Google AI Overview gets it right. Sometimes. In searching out confirmation as to when Scott Cooper‘s Bruce Springsteen film, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” first tacked on that “Springsteen,” a quick Google search helped, as did the AI Overview leering at me from the top of the page.

Important findings reigned. First up: “The initial title of the film was ‘Deliver Me from Nowhere,' based on Warren Zanes' book” (true!). Next: “The title was officially changed to ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere‘ in June 2025, according to news reports and the movie's production status updates” (well, really, it was a new trailer, but OK). Finally: “The change was made to make it clear to the audience that the film is a biopic about Bruce Springsteen.” Ah, well.

Except, well, it's not really. At least, not in the way that a potential movie-goer who is not already a fan of The Boss would expect to see if they're hitting the multiplex to check out the “Springsteen biopic.” Adding his name to the front of film's title — again, a title pulled directly from a much-loved and well-known book on the subject — was the first sign that the 20th Century Studios powers that be were getting a little squirrelly about their big fall feature.

 










What is “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” really about? As our own David Ehrlich wrote in his review out of Telluride, it “is a semi-desolate sketch of a biopic about a depressed 32-year-old man” who  is also “haunted by unresolved childhood trauma and suffering from a depression that he knows how to sing about but lacks the words to diagnose” and “is at its best during the frequent stretches when it finds Bruce staring at the walls of his isolated rental home in Colts Neck.”

Trailers for the film — which has now screened at Telluride, New York Film Festival, and AFI Fest, to name a few, so it's certainly not hiding — play up the more glitzy and recognizable moments of Springsteen's career. These are also moments that have relatively little to do with the film itself. If moviegoers are taking marketing on its face, who could blame them for expecting to see a film about Bruce and the E Street Band on the road? That's what this trailer opens with.

Or, consider this clip, the only one on 20th Century Studios' dedicated “Deliver Me from Nowhere” YouTube page, which is entirely comprised of a performance of “Born to Run.” For those keeping track, Cooper's film is about the creation of Springsteen's album “Nebraska.” “Born to Run” is not a track that appears on that album. And while this performance is indeed part of the film, it's a very weird pick to represent the entire feature.

 










Look, I'm the last person to think that a film about a depressive episode in a global superstar's early career makes for the easiest of sells. (Well, small note here, I think most musical biopics should probably be about a depressive episode in a global superstar's early career, but I don't run a film studio.) I get the impulse to try to make this look like something more broad, but that's a mistake. 

I worry that when even casual Bruce fans show up to see the movie, they'll expect to see what they've seen in the trailers: The Boss jumping around on stage, playing “Born in the U.S.A.,” celebrating another smash hit show with the E Street Band. Hell, they'll expect to see significantly more of the E Street Band in general.

This is not that film. It's better for it, and it's also a much tougher sell.

Other marketing, the kind of stuff that people who would need to seek out (like, oh, big fans of Bruce) is more honest, like this featurette all about Cooper's approach to this specific time in The Boss' life and career. Cooper isn't shying away from what sort of film he's made, even if audiences might be surprised. As he told IndieWire earlier this week, “So many people have preconceived notions about a music film about Bruce Springsteen. Or a film that they want to see, like the ‘Born in the U.S.A.' or ‘Born to Run' story. … This is probably the most unexpected story that folks will get about a music icon. … I'm realizing this film is not what people expected. Now, whether it's what they wanted is another thing.”

 










If it's not clear: I am a huge Springsteen fan. I've seen him live over a dozen times — that includes actual concerts, performances at premieres (like the NYFF premiere), and quite literally live in his own home studio when I interviewed him for “Western Stars” in 2019 — and the prospect of a biopic uniquely tailored to some of Springsteen's continuing obsessions, interests, and neuroses is particularly appealing to me. And, based on the general queries I've made of other Bruce fans, that holds true for them, too.

(Fun fact: Ehrlich's older brother is a Springsteen freak who has seen him in concert so many times that he's pushing triple digits with his count. When I asked David if Steven is excited to see the film, he said he was “frothing at the mouth.”) Now that's an audience to bank on and appeal to. 

Those are not the people who need a trailer or a clip or a title that simplifies what they're going to see (or, if we're being more candid about it, just kind of lies about it). Those are the people who will come multiple times, tell their fellow fans to check it out, to champion it. They're Bruce fans; dedication is part of their DNA. Don't ever count them out. Like the Boss, they're tougher than the rest. Selling this film to them does not have to be.

A 20th Century Release, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” hits theaters on Friday, October 24.

							By 

	Brenna Ehrlich



	Ann-Marie Delsol squints against the humid Caribbean sun as she points down at the rutted dirt track where the bodies were found in December of 2023. Her employers had been shot and left in their car, which someone set ablaze and pushed into the underbrush. The vehicle could have been shoved down the steep hill instead of this a shoddy attempt at concealment. “When I saw Daniel and Dominique's bodies — Daniel's body was in holes,” Delsol says, her musical voice stoic despite her grief. 


	A former cook for hoteliers Daniel Langlois and Dominique Marchand, Delsol heard news of a charred vehicle not far from her old workplace, eco-resort Coulibri Ridge. Worried about her family, who had land near the incident, she raced across the treacherous, rutted road to see what was amiss. What she saw haunts her to this day. “It is very painful for us because we've lost two great people,” she says. “That's the first time we are ever having a crime like this in Dominica.”

	











	Nearly two years later, there's still evidence at the crime scene that shook this small island country — ash on jutting rocks, melted scraps of plastic and fabric scattered in the verdant shrubbery where wild dogs stalk giant lizards. A modest roadside memorial vase. A crime scene that's no longer just a crime scene — but something in limbo, much like the tragic case of Langlois and Marchand, who have yet to get justice.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Langlois and Marchand were the de facto patron saints of Dominica, a small island country that settlers played tug-of-war over for centuries until it went independent in the ‘70s. The Canadian ex-pat couple found the beauty in what is now dubbed the “Nature Island,” even though signs of colonial turmoil remain: a village called, simply, Massacre (in honor of a 1600s battle between the British and the indigenous people), a courthouse still boasting cells and chains from before slavery was abolished in the 1800s. Churches, libraries, and houses stand splintered and rotting next to posh tourist resorts, the aftermath of 2017's Hurricane Maria. The death of the popular couple, then, became another stain on the island — a grisly, shocking double murder that stood as an anomaly in the close-knit, friendly community.

	Langlois and Marchand were long-time philanthropists, even before they moved across oceans. But when they washed ashore, their charity flowed as freely as the bubbling hotsprings studded on the island's beaches. Langlois — a Canadian VFX visionary responsible for the tech that made movies like Jurassic Park possible — and his partner Marchand collaborated not only on Coulibri Ridge, but also rebuilding jetties, a primary school, and coral reefs after the devastating 2017 storm. 


	“When I heard of his demise I was very much taken aback and sad,” says Ericson Degallaire, principal of the Soufrière Primary School, which Langlois and Marchand meticulously rebuilt with the same materials they used for their eco-resort. Now, children laugh and study in the open-air structure, boasting candy-bright paint. “Since his demise, things have not been the same in terms of that economic activity. Because I'm sure he would have done more had he been around. So his loss has impacted the community a great, great deal,” the principal adds.


	The question soon became: Why would anyone want this couple, who had given so much to their community, dead? Police soon zeroed in on another family of transplants, the Lehrers, who had bought the neighboring chocolate plantation Bois Cotlette in 2011. To hear the islanders tell it, the patriarch, a former Wall Street wunderkind named Jonathan Lehrer, didn't have the best reputation. Degallaire says that the man never waved to him when he drove by the school toward his 1720s estate; islanders claim he filmed them when they got too close to his land; and TripAdvisor reviews paint a picture of a man who shouted at anyone who stepped foot on his property sans invitation or reservation. “The White American manager… informed us in a very rude and unfriendly way to get off his estate straight away,” wrote one reviewer. “Almost felt we were about to manhandled off the premises.” And that was a problem, since what islanders considered a public road passed through Lehrer's property — as did Langlois.

	According to local press, this dispute over a simple spit of land could have culminated in bloodshed. “My own investigations and personal knowledge [show] that there is a strong… case against [Lehrer] including and not limited to direct eye witness evidence, circumstantial evidence, and scientific evidence,” police would later say in court. Still, the veracity of that statement remains in question and a judge and jury have yet to decide.

	











	MORNE ROUGE ROAD first appeared on a map in the late 1770s, tread by slaves, foreigners, and citizens for hundreds of years before and after Dominica became an independent nation in 1978. Lehrer and Langlois began battling over the road in 2014; Lehrer said it was his property and that Langlois' heavy trucks were clipping the sides of his ancient estate. Langlois — and many other residents — maintained that it was a public thoroughfare. 


	Ayeola George, who works in public relations on the island, recalls an alleged run-in with Lehrer right before the murders when she was on her way to meet up with Marchand at Coulibri Ridge to discuss a charity concert. She got turned around on the dirt road, and drove too close to Bois Cotlette. “Here comes Jonathan and he said — he's in jeans, no shirt, no shoes — ‘Hey you're going to see Daniel?' I was like, ‘Yeah.' He's like, ‘Tell Daniel I said he is an asshole,'” she recalls. “So I was reversing, I'm looking in the mirror and Jonathan Lehrer is filming me. He has his phone and he's filming me. I'm a Dominican — we know how to talk, we know how to stand up for ourselves. But at the same time, I knew of his aggressions toward locals. So I just left it alone.” 


	A PR rep for the Lehrer family could not comment on this particular incident, but pointed out that islanders had staged a protest on the road in 2018 after alleging that Lehrer blocked the byway. Lehrer's rep denies that his employer ever blocked the road, and, when asked about the reported filming of locals, told Rolling Stone: “My thought is that this was in direct response to the family getting things stolen and the property vandalized [during the protest]. So if Jonathan was filming locals tearing across his property, it was likely due to ensuring his safety and the safety of his property.”


	The men had previously taken the matter to court after Lehrer built another road as a compromise, and, after Langlois' death in 2023, a judge ruled in the Canadian's favor. It hardly mattered at that point, though, since the police had arrested Jonathan Lehrer and his bus driver Robert Snyder Jr. for murder. The conflict over the road was trumpeted as the motive in the press. 

	











	Lehrer — who has maintained his innocence to Rolling Stone claimed he wasn't bothered by the road ordeal — has been locked away in Dominica State Prison for over two years now. In stasis, much like that crime scene. “To truly understand the inhumane conditions, you must be able to imagine the cell block,” says his 25-year-old daughter, Emma, who grew up largely on the island and has always dreamed of returning there as a doctor. She also claims that islanders' views of her father are wildly incorrect, describing him as a sweet, adventurous man who wasn't afraid to play pretend with his kids at theme parks. “[He lives in] a concrete room, with a hallway in the middle lined with six single-occupancy cells along each wall,” she says of his current predicament. “There are no windows in the block, and no ventilation built in. In fact, the ventilation is so bad that the prison puts a giant fan in the entrance to the cell block in the evening so the inmates don't suffocate.” 


	There's been a series of starts and stops with Lehrer's case, which Emma claims is riddled with corruption. “There is a lot of planted evidence, concealed documents, tampered witness statements, and more generally abuse of process that we hope to successfully showcase along with the perjury of police officers about the evidence they claimed early on before their suspicions were proved false,” she says. “Now we need to expose it.” 


	The news coming out of Dominica is much more opaque, filtering largely through local reports since both the defense and prosecution have yet to respond to Rolling Stone for comment. After previous denials, Lehrer was initially granted bail in November of 2024 due to what the defense claimed was the State's “misrepresentation of the quality of evidence” against him. In short: the defense claims, the prosecution have none and they're stalling. Lehrer remained imprisoned while the bail conditions were determined; those included about a quarter of a million in U.S. dollars and the revoking of his U.S. citizenship. 


	According to Lehrer's family publicist, the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Police then submitted an application to reverse bail — which was denied by the judge. In December of 2024, the ADCP searched the prison where Lehrer is being held and found a set of jail keys in an “undisclosed location,” according to PR. The ADCP then provided the keys as evidence that Lehrer intended to escape, but was dismissed by the judge due to lack of witnesses, per PR. Then, in January of this year, Lehrer was slapped with a weapons trafficking charge, which made bail ultimately impossible. Still, the charges allege that he was transporting an arsenal of guns on December 4th, when, as Emma points out, he was already in custody. Lehrer was again denied bail for these charges in March.

	











	In the midst of all this, the judge who initially granted Lehrer bail recused himself from the case, after he was told by the prosecution that he should remove “himself from the matter since they had information that was not helpful to him,” according to local press. 


	It's a thorny matter all around, to put it lightly, with both sides bristling at how slowly the process is going. “On the side of the court, there's an inscription that says ‘the High Court of Justice,'” says local activist Lofty Durand. “Sometimes what goes on in there, I think that the inscription should change to the high court of injustice,” adding that locals are afraid Lehrer will just be released and disappear in lieu of a trial. “The court should have been moving with a little more alacrity in that regard, so that all parties concerned, even Jonathan's family, if he's innocent [get answers].”


	Both sides, too, point to government corruption by way of explanation, Lehrer's defenders claiming he's being used as a foreign scapegoat for a crime he didn't commit, and islanders whispering that Lehrer is receiving preferential treatment due to his wealth. Lehrer's family is part of the country's controversial Citizenship By Investment program, whereby folks can obtain passports if they funnel money into local projects. Dubbed the Golden Passport program, it has had its share of issues, with the Government Accountability Project (GAP) alleging that the island has sold citizenship to such people as an Afghan spy, a Turkish millionaire-fraudster, and a former Libyan colonel under Muammar Gaddafi.


	Although Lehrer has not been accused of any malfeasance regarding the program, his original lawyer, Lennox Lawrence, was previously attorney general of Dominica. Still, in the past, Lawrence denied that this gave his client any advantage. “We have a system of separation of powers just like you have in the United States and in Canada,” he said. “The executive is totally different from the legislature.” 


	Finally, in August, a judge ruled that Lehrer and Snyder would stand trial for murder, with an indictment pending for September, but the indictment and trial have yet to transpire. When Rolling Stone reached out to the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court about timing, they declined to comment.


	“At nearly every stage of the case, the government has manipulated the course of justice and interfered with the proceedings,” says the Lehrer family publicist. “Jonathan has been denied the right to speak with media or see his doctor. To date, there is no trial date set as the government and prosecution scrambles to find a way forward for this case.”

	











	MEANWHILE, LEHRER's FAMILY also waits — back in Texas, where they worry every day that Jonathan will die from prostate cancer, for which they claim he is receiving paltry care. When his daughter, Emma, visited him recently — after bail was denied — she says she was met with a grim scene. “I was finally, after weeks of begging through letters and phone calls from the lawyers, allowed to see him for 15 minutes through a Plexiglass screen talking to him through a phone,” she says. “As the end of the time approached, the guards began to harass us and told me I had to leave. I remember turning to the guard with tears in my eyes, asking him if I could just give my dad a hug. He laughed at me. ‘Who do you think you are?' he asked me as he escorted me out the door. I didn't even get a proper goodbye.” If Lehrer is found guilty, he could face public hanging.


	The Lehrer family aren't the only ones suffering. There's Delsol, a grandmother, who leads a group of protesters down to each of Lehrers' hearings, yelling up at the windows of the old courthouse so he can hear her pain. “Every time the court case is on the agenda, I am always there,” she says, looking down at a photo of her brand-new grandchild on her phone. “We will be protesting until…” she pauses. “It will never stop.”

	And then there's Langlois' old friend, Simon Walsh, a dive shop owner, who is still shaken by the murders. His blue eyes fill with tears as he recalls how Langlois saved him from bankruptcy after a hurricane, how they teamed up to rebuild the coral reefs after they were beset by a rare disease. They never did get to finish that project, but Walsh carried on, coaxing dying coral back to life in the breezy, beachside Daniel Langlois Coral Rescue Center. And Degallaire, principal of the Soufrière Primary School? He's eagerly anticipating the opening of a secondary school, named for Marchand. 


	Langlois' and Marchand's impact, then, is not just a lonely crime scene — scraps of a car and soot scarred rocks. It's there in the fabric of the island they called home, in the hearts of the people who welcomed them — and that will endure, much like Dominica has all these centuries.

Radiohead talked about their upcoming European tour and opened up about why they needed to take a nearly decade-long break in the band's first interview together in years.


	“I guess the wheels came off a bit, so we had to stop,” Thom Yorke told The Times UK about the band's vibes by the end of their tour in support of 2016's A Moon Shaped Pool. “There were a lot of elements. The shows felt great but it was, like, let's halt now before we walk off this cliff.”


	“And I needed to stop anyway,” Yorke added. “Because I hadn't really given myself time to grieve,” referring to the death of Rachel Owen, his former partner and mother of his children who died from cancer in 2016. “[My grief] was coming out in ways that made me think, I need to take this away.”


	“Music can be a way to find meaning in things and the idea of having to stop it, even when it makes sense to, because you're not well? Even at my lowest point? I can't,” Yorke said of touring at the time. “I need something that I can hold on to. But there have been points in my life where I have looked for solace in music and played the piano, but it literally hurts. Physically. The music hurts, because you're going through trauma.”

	Guitarist Ed O'Brien added that by the end of the A Moon Shaped Pool tour, he was “effectively over Radiohead.” “It wasn't great on the last round. I enjoyed the gigs but hated the rest. We felt disconnected, fucking spent. It happens. This has been our whole life — what else is there? Look, success has a funny effect on people — I just didn't want to do it any more. And I told them that,” O'Brien said.

	











	“I went through a very long dark night of the soul. I had a deep depression. I hit the bottom in 2021. And one of the things that was lovely coming out of it was realizing how much I love these guys. I met them when I was 17 and I have gone from thinking I can't see myself doing it again to realizing that, you know, we do have some stellar songs.”

	For the band's upcoming tour, Yorke sent the list of 65 potential setlist songs to his band mates. “Which we're all frantically learning,” guitarist Jonny Greenwood said. “Then Thom will turn up and say, let's not do half.” Unlike some other recent reunion tours with rigid setlists, the band's shows will differ from night to night. “We have too many songs,” Yorke added.


	The band also talked at length about the Israel-Hamas conflict and their perceived “whitewashing genocide” in Palestine; Jonny Greenwood is married to an Israeli artist and spends a lot of time in the region.


	“A few times recently I've had ‘Free Palestine!' shouted at me on the street. I talked to a guy. His shtick was, ‘You have a platform, a duty and must distance yourself from Jonny,'” Yorke told the Times UK. “But I said, ‘You and me, standing on the street in London, shouting at each other? Well, the true criminals, who should be in front of the ICC [International Criminal Court], are laughing at us squabbling among ourselves in the public realm and on social media — while they just carry on with impunity, murdering people.' It's an expression of impotency. It's a purity test, low-level Arthur Miller witch-hunt. I utterly respect the dismay but it's very odd to be on the receiving end.”

	While some members of the band, notably O'Brien, have voiced their support for a “Free Palestine” on social media, drummer Philip Selway added, “What [the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement] are asking of us is impossible. They want us to distance ourselves from Jonny, but that would mean the end of the band and Jonny is coming from a very principled place. But it's odd to be ostracized by artists we generally felt quite aligned to.”


	Radiohead was also asked what the future of the band is after these European shows, and whether they'll perform new music on the trek. “I don't know,” Jonny Greenwood said. “We haven't thought past the tour.” Yorke added, “I'm just stunned we got this far.”

The British actor talks season three of the ITV bomb squad thriller, working opposite Vicky McClure and why he's learned to embrace the charming villain roles that always seem to come his way.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	You've probably seen English actor Jason Flemyng in Guy Ritchie and/or Matthew Vaughn‘s films, such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and X-Men: First Class. You may have seen him in such Hollywood movies as Rob Roy, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Seed of Chucky, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Transporter 2 or in small independent films from around the world. Now he is playing the antagonist in one of Britain's biggest TV dramas, season three of Trigger Point, starring Vicky McClure.

	











	Flemyng stars as Steven Wyles, who is causing the team of Explosives Officer, or Expo, Lana Washington, portrayed by McClure, all sorts of headaches with his sinister vendetta. “Someone is targeting individuals and demanding revenue,” according to a season three plot synopsis. “Working alongside the Police Counter Terrorism Unit, the Bomb Disposal Squad race against time to find the bomber before they claim their next victim.”

	Season three of the show, produced by Jed Mercurio's (Line of Duty, Bodyguard) HTM Television, in association with All3Media International, which distributes the series internationally, starts airing on ITV1 and STV on Sunday and will be available to stream on ITVX and STV Player.


	Flemyng talked to THR about his role and why he always seems to get cast as a baddie.I told to a friend of mine that you got cast in Trigger Point, and he said, “Yes, I recognize him. He must play a bad guy!”












Flemyng [Laughs] Everyone says that. It's so unfair. I've been playing those parts for my whole career, and I think I have been miscast from the very beginning of time until now. But that's what I do. As soon as you see I'm in it, you know that people are gonna die.


What can you share about your character in season three without spoiling too much?


	Initially, we see the victims, we see the explosions, we see the ramifications of his actions, but we don't see him. It's a cat-and-mouse game between me and Vicky, which was fun. 


	Vicky's someone I've admired from a distance for a long time. When you meet people like that, you're like, “Please, let them be nice.” And Vicky was exactly as I expected her and exactly as I wanted her to be. It was a happy shoot, and it comes from the top.


	There are some big dialogue scenes with Vicky that were a joy. In football [aka soccer], if you go on to the pitch with Ronaldo, you look like an idiot, right? But in acting, if you go on to the set with Vicky or Stephen Graham or Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, the better the actor, the better you are. Honestly, I've been really lucky.


What can you tell us about the dynamic between Vicky's Lana and your character Steven?


	It's a classic film relationship between the compassionate copper, even though Vicky is not a copper, but, you know, the compassionate protagonist and my character. The story behind this character is that he is a little man. It's David versus Goliath. He's been fucked over by the capitalist system. He is a byproduct of profit, and he's sick and dying, as a lot of his friends are. He has no way of fighting back. So he takes it into his own hands. It's a sort of Robin Hood story to a degree.


	Vicky's character understands why he's doing it, but obviously doesn't agree with the way he's doing it. But her character is compassionate and left-leaning, you could say. He does it the wrong way, and she understands why he's doing it, but can't agree with the way he does it. There are a lot of those head-to-head things where they discuss that, which is great. Her compassion for him is very understated, but we know it because she's such a great actress.

	











	There are some massive scenes in it, which you definitely don't get in a film. I have more lines in one scene than I have in whole movies, because there are six-, seven-page scenes. But when you have good dialogue, it's easy.


	The writing was working well, and I hope that the audience will have compassion for him because they understand his predicament, and they understand what's happened to him. I think in modern society, a lot of people feel voiceless, and a lot of people feel like they're a byproduct of the capitalist system. 


Did you know Trigger Point well? What was your reaction to the opportunity to join the show?


	This landed on the desk, and I was like: Brilliant! It's [shot] in London as well. Double brilliant! I really didn't have much of an idea about it. I knew Vicky was in it, and I knew that it was Jed's show. But then when I arrived on it, I knew this was a big deal. Usually, when people ask me what I am doing, I'm like: “I'm making this film about a lesbian sheep farmer in the Czech Republic. And it's got subtitles in German.” And they're like, “Oh yeah? Great.” But when I said I'm in Trigger Point, they were like, “Oh my god, yeah, Trigger Point.” It's probably the most popular thing I've ever done.


	I'm at an age where my kids are 14, and it's nice to be on the telly and at home. It sits easy with me that I'm not in Jordan, making a film that not many people are ever going to see. It's nice to be in London, filming with the people who know exactly what they're doing in a really tight machine. I have now watched the other seasons, which are great. And I think this year, it's sort of stepped up another level visually. It looks more cinematic and dramatic. So, I'm really excited to see what people think.

	











Will your fans get to see more of you on mainstream TV shows then, maybe even as the hero saving the day for once?I'm with you on that. But the people who are in control need to make those decisions. (Laughs)

The pop star was at the top of her game, performing tracks from all three of her studio albums.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Billie Eilish has been touring for well over a year at this point. She's probably exhausted — it would be understandable if she was sick and tired of life on the go — but if either of those things were true, the thousands of fans at the UBS Arena in New York on Saturday night (Oct. 25) would never have been able to tell.


	The singer — who previously stopped through NYC's Madison Square Garden in October 2024 — was poised, energetic and appeared to be having the the time of her life on stage, playing the first of two back-to-back shows at the venue on her mammoth Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour supporting last year's album of the same name. If anything, Eilish's marathon time on the road since the trek kicked off two Septembers ago has only made her a stronger, sharper performer, with the star commanding her setlist of songs spanning all three of her studio albums, her debut EP Don't Smile at Me and club-ready Charli xcx collaboration “Guess” with impressive stamina and musicality.


	And despite a headline-making instance of an over-aggressive concertgoer forcibly yanking her at a show in Miami, the best part of Saturday's show was the vulnerable connection and trust Eilish maintains with her fans regardless of the potential dangers. “You're very precious to me, and I feel the need to protect you always,” she said shortly before performing Oscar-winning Barbie anthem “What Was I Made For?” while holding the hands of front-rowers reaching out to her.


	“I just love you so much, and I'll always fight for you and stand up for you,” she added. “Just know that I got you, and I know you got me.”


	Eilish, finally, is now in the final stretch of her HMHAS tour, with the nine-time Grammy winner having just a month left of shows to go before wrapping with two nights at the Chase Center in San Francisco in late November. From impeccable vocal moments to a hilarious looper snafu, check out Billboard‘s roundup of the best moments from her last stop in New York on her finale lap through the United States below.


	This certainly isn't the first time Eilish's vocal growth has been pointed out, but if there's anyone left out there who still thinks of her as a quiet, whisper-soft singer, all they need to do is attend one of her concerts to realize how wrong they are. Even from the opening number — Hit Me Hard and Soft‘s “Chihiro” — it was clear that she has completely leveled up in her singing capabilities, with the star beautifully belting freely and often throughout the set. That even included songs where you wouldn't necessarily expect her to let loose vocally, like on “NDA,” but it only ever elevated the original versions.


	Nearly a year and a half after Billboard ranked “Wildflower” the No. 1 song on Hit Me Hard and Soft, Eilish proved that the track is still one of her all-timers with an exquisite and palpably passionate live performance toward the beginning of her set. It also marked one of the loudest instances of fans singing along with her the entire night, with the crowd becoming part of the show by screaming the studio version's backup vocals in call-and-response form — something that's become a tradition amongst Eilish's concertgoers.


	Another thing that made the number extra special: the arena holding up their phone flashlights without Eilish even having to ask, surrounding her in a comforting glow as she poured her heart out in some of the most vulnerable lyrics she's ever written.


	One of the coolest moments in Eilish's show is when she performs “When the Party's Over” from debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? a cappella, stacking her own harmonies with a looper tool. “Listen, listen,” she instructed the crowd beforehand. “The thing is, it will only work if the entire room is completely silent for, like, one minute. It's the only time in the whole show that you'll have to be quiet.”


	Despite Eilish's plea, a fan or two couldn't help themselves when the arena went silent. “I love you!” they screamed as the singer recorded her first harmony layer, after which other audience members loudly scolded them.


	Unfortunately, the rogue “I love you!” did make it into the loop, and as it played again and again while Eilish continued stacking vocals, the crowd — assuming that people were still being unruly and not realizing that it was the same “I love you” being repeated — continued chastising the rule-breakers, which led to even more noise bleeding into the recording. Eilish, however, took it in stride, cracking up a little before giving a “yikes” expression and moving the number along like a pro, extra sound effects included.


	Shortly before one of the show's quieter moments — during which Eilish invites fans to sit down for a spell as she sings moving ballad “Your Power” and accompanies herself on acoustic guitar — the star gave a stirring speech about the importance of connecting with others through live music. “It's, like, a really dark time in the world,” she began.


	“It's a really scary time, and it's hard to feel like there's anything that's making a difference at all,” Eilish continued. “It feels like we're all doomed a little bit … but also, I think that it's really special that we have [this]. I have this feeling of like, ‘Oh, I shouldn't do shows, maybe, because I feel like there's more important things in the world,' or something. Then I think, ‘It's actually really important that we have things that bring us together and art that we love, and that we have togetherness at all.'”


	She went on to share that she feels “really, really grateful and lucky” that she gets to hold concerts at a time when it's more vital than ever. “I think we all really need it, and we need to be together, and we need to have this glue that keeps us one, you know?” Eilish added. “I hope you feel safe here, and I hope that you feel comfortable to be yourself.”


	Eilish's visuals — which included lasers, horror-movie-esque stills and pyrotechnics — were top tier throughout the one-hour, 45-minute show, but one of the best effects also happened to be the most simple. At different points in the program, the singer carried a handheld camera with her as she walked around and under her stage, giving each individual band and crew member a chance to wave “hi” to the audience as the feed projected live on the big screens. 


	She also carried the camera as she moved through the pit and performed “Guess” on a B-stage, where Eilish pointed the lens down at the fans below and gave them a rare glimpse at her POV. Without the handheld, the crowd also never would have gotten to see the completely random visitor Eilish had chilling beneath the stage the entire time — a life-size Tinky-Winky Teletubby — whom she filmed while crossing under the risers between “Everything I Wanted” and a mashup of “Lovely,” “Blue” and “Ocean Eyes” on piano. Eh-oh!

Time magazine has released a new cover of its upcoming Nov. 10 issue featuring President Donald Trump after the GOP leader heavily critiqued the original image used.


	The legacy publication unveiled the second edition earlier this week, tied to its feature on Trump, who was interviewed about his role in brokering the ceasefire deal between Gaza and Israel. While the former image features the POTUS looking upward framed against the sky with the caption “His Triumph,” the latter depicts Trump with his hands clasped under his chin at the Hayes desk with the subtitle “Trump's World.”

	Unveiled Oct. 14, Trump took significant umbrage with the cover photo initially chosen, writing on Truth Social at 1:36 a.m. ET that night: “Time Magazine wrote a relatively good story about me, but the picture may be the Worst of All Time. They ‘disappeared' my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump has a long established relationship with the newsweekly — both as subject and reader. According to the outlet, as of December 2024, Trump's total cover count exceeds 40, coming behind only Presidents Ronald Reagan and record-holder Richard Nixon. Naturally, this doesn't include the fake covers that had reportedly been hanging in “at least five of his golf clubs,” which featured a cover line exclaiming that “Trump is hitting it on all fronts … even TV!” The existence of the bogus covers, reported by the Washington Post, prompted the magazine to ask Trump to remove them. Since then, several real covers currently hang in various locations inside his Mar-a-Lago residence. Time also named him the Person of the Year in 2016 and 2024.


	Prior to the release of the original cover, the owner of Time, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, made waves over the weekend for comments to The New York Times in which he said he thought Trump was doing a “great job” and “fully” supported the idea of sending federal troops into San Francisco.

	











	According to a report by The Daily Beast, Washington, D.C.-based photographer Stephen Voss's new photo of Trump drew inspiration from Arnold Newman's 1963 photograph of German industrialist and convicted Nazi war criminal Alfried Krupp, which was published by Newsweek, though Time vehemently denied this. (The digital outlet also reported Voss liking comments on Instagram where followers asked about the connection, though he has since seemingly removed his likes.)


	“There is no connection and claims suggesting otherwise are completely untrue,” a Time spokesperson said. “The references for this photoshoot were past presidential portraits in the Oval Office, including TIME's own covers. Giving weight to speculation on social media is reckless and contributes to the spread of misinformation.”

Marta Kristen is remembering her longtime co-star and on-screen mother, June Lockhart, following Lockhart's passing at age 100. The two starred together on the CBS sci-fi series “Lost in Space,” where Lockhart played Dr. Maureen Robinson and Kristen played her daughter, Judy. Their connection continued long after filming ended.

“June Lockhart! She was one great dame,” Kristen shared, in a heartwarming, lengthy tribute. “She had unparalleled tenacity and intelligence. I'm not surprised she lived to be 100.”

A post shared by Christopher Baum (@scifi_revisited)

Kristen recalled a moment during production that revealed Lockhart's vibrant personality.“While filming ‘Lost in Space,' June would often go out on Friday evenings after a long day on the set,” she said. “I especially remember one Friday when I saw her coming out of her dressing room, and I could not help but gawk.”

A post shared by Rubens Valle (@rubensavalle)

Kristen described Lockhart in a striking outfit of green and white crocheted bell-bottoms with a matching top, her hair loose and glowing. “She was magnificent,” Kristen wrote in her tribute: “A Rock 'n' Roll Queen.”

Kristen also remembered Lockhart's generosity and sense of adventure. When Kristen was planning a fiftieth birthday surprise for her late husband, she hoped to arrange a ride on the Goodyear Blimp. Not knowing where to begin, she turned to Lockhart.

“June immediately said that she would arrange this with one condition – that she be a part of the birthday surprise and excursion,” Kristen shared. “Of course, I said yes. As you could imagine, we all had one helluva day in the air.”

A post shared by Joe Bushor (@joebushor)

Kristen said countless stories demonstrate Lockhart's intelligence, humor, and curiosity. “She loved life, and life loved her,” she wrote.

“Her zest for life, whether it be listening to David Bowie or being honored by NASA with a public achievement medal for her dedication to space exploration, is just a few examples of why we all loved her.”

A post shared by Arts 🐾🐾 (@memories.official)

“I treasure all of the moments, both professional and personal, I was blessed to experience with this incredible, intelligent, and beautiful woman,” Kristen said. “My heartfelt condolences to her loving family. June's light will continue to shine. Rest in Peace, my dear friend.”

A post shared by Gr8erDays (@gr8erdays)

Lockhart leaves behind a legacy defined by grace, wit, and a lifelong love of storytelling. Her work on “Lost in Space,” “Lassie,” and countless film and television roles continues to resonate with audiences across generations.

Colleagues, fans, and loved ones remember her not only for her talent but for her curiosity, humor, and generous spirit. Her light, as her co-stars say, will continue to shine.

Bryant Gumbel is “expected to recover” after a sudden medical emergency led to his hospitalization in New York last week, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. The retired “Today” show anchor, 77, was taken from his Manhattan apartment on October 20 around 9 p.m., as reported by TMZ.

“He's not dying,” a source told Page Six, while another insider told TMZ that Gumbel remained in the hospital through Wednesday, October 22, but was “doing OK.” It has not been confirmed whether Gumbel has since returned home, though those close to him were optimistic he would be discharged by Thursday. Details surrounding the nature of the medical incident have not been publicly disclosed. “They're being extremely tight-lipped about it,” one source shared, as per PageSix.

As per photos published by TMZ, days after the hospitalization, Gumbel was photographed walking in New York City alongside his wife, Hilary. The former “Today” co-host wore a black jacket, baseball cap, and sunglasses while Hilary kept close to him. The sighting offered reassurance that Gumbel is regaining strength as he continues to recover.

Hilary later shared the word “gratitude” in a simple Instagram post, signaling quiet relief following the stressful week.

Gumbel's recent hospitalization comes more than a decade after he revealed a lung cancer diagnosis in 2009. At the time, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant tumor and part of his lung.

“It's nothing to hide from,” he said during a guest appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly, as reported by ABC. “They opened up my chest, they took a malignant tumor, and they took part of my lung, and they took some other goodies.”

In 2010, Gumbel told People, “I'm still doing well. Doctors tell me I'm free and clear, so I hope for better times.”

Gumbel hosted “Today” for 15 years beginning in 1982, working alongside Jane Pauley, Katie Couric, and Chris Wallace. He later became the host of HBO's “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,” where he earned widespread respect for his thoughtful reporting and interviewing style.

He shares two children, Bradley and Jillian, with his former wife, June Baranco. Gumbel later married his current wife, Hilary, in 2002.

His brother, fellow broadcaster Greg Gumbel, died in 2023 at age 78 from pancreatic cancer.

A post shared by Marcia Lane (@thenewsjunkiedaily)

Friends and family say Gumbel is now taking time to rest and focus on his health. Those close to him remain positive and expect him to make a full recovery.

Gary Clark Jr. played a surprise set for F1 attendees in Austin last weekend, taking over the city's Franklin Barbecue for a private show sponsored by Velocity Black.


	The invite-only event transformed Austin's famed barbecue joint into an intimate showcase for the rock and soul star, who played an hour-long set that included his hits like “Things Are Changing” and “Low Down Rolling Stone,” as well as a cover of Jimi Hendrix's “Little Wing.”


	Clark Jr., who was born and raised in Austin, was joined by wife Nicole Trunfio (a successful model-turned-entrepreneur of maternity brand, Bumpsuit), while other guests in the crowd included Aston Martin Formula 1 development driver Jak Crawford; Franklin Barbecue owner Aaron Franklin; and ambassadors for whiskey brand Glenfiddich, celebrating the brand's ongoing collaboration with the Aston Martin team.


	“I got a call to play music at a barbecue joint and I couldn't turn it down,” Clark Jr. told the crowd of 50 or so guests by way of introductions. “I'm trying to find my groove right now,” he said minutes later: “I did myself a disservice and had a whole bunch of barbecue, so this might be a low down blues set,” he joked.




	Though thousands of racing fans descended upon Austin for the 2025 U.S. Grand Prix, the night was reserved exclusively for members of Velocity Black, a luxury digital concierge service that offers insider access to premium dining, entertainment and travel experiences around the world — all from the convenience of a handy app. Velocity Black's team of insiders come from the worlds of aviation, fashion and hospitality and can curate everything from a private jet pickup, to bespoke getaways, to scoring tickets to sold-out sporting events and concerts (think everything from World Series tickets to Sabrina Carpenter seats). Members also get access to special events tailored to their profile and interests, with the app using custom-built tech to identify “hyper-personalized experiences,” per a company memo.

	Access to the private Clark Jr. and Franklin Barbecue event was available only to Velocity Black members, who received invitations through the Velocity Black app as a complimentary perk of membership. The restaurant — which typically closes as soon as its meat is sold out for the day — re-opened exclusively in the evening, with Franklin pitmasters smoking up brisket, ribs and turkey to pair with the Glenfiddich x Aston Martin F1 16-year single malt. The party and music continued afterwards with a Dwight Yoakam concert at the Moody Center, with an official after-party in a members-only speakeasy dubbed “The Hideaway by Velocity Black.”






	$71.99




		The official collaboration with the Aston Martin team is a limited-edition release	


	Velocity Black has also been the official Luxury Lifestyle Partner of the Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 team for the last three years, and Velocity Black members were able to access dedicated VIP tables in the Aston Martin paddock club lounge over the weekend, while taking in private garage tours and pit lane walks. Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso even made a surprise appearance in the paddock club the day before the race.


	Velocity Black's activations in Austin will continue on beyond the race, with the “Hideaway” returning to the Moody Center later this fall, offering VIP access in the “most exclusive corner of the arena's event floor” for the upcoming Tate McRae and Billie Eilish concerts. More details about Velocity Black's offerings, experts and membership dues are available on its website.

Kathy Garver is honoring June Lockhart following the beloved actress's death at age 100. Lockhart died on October 23 in Santa Monica, California, as reported by The New York Times. Garver and Lockhart first met while working together on an episode of the classic Western anthology series “Death Valley Days,” and they remained close for decades after filming.

“Sad to say goodbye to June Lockhart, who died on Thursday at the age of 100,” Garver wrote. “A well-lived life, fulfilled with wonderful roles and a beautiful family.”

A post shared by Kathy Garver (@kgcissy)

Garver recalled that Lockhart played her mentor in the “Death Valley Days” episode, portraying a knowledgeable librarian opposite Garver's character, who was based on a young Isadora Duncan. Their connection extended beyond the screen.

“She just had an inner sense of people and engaged in their energies,” Garver shared.

A post shared by Kathy Garver (@kgcissy)

The actress also remembered a surprising and intimate moment that became one of her most cherished memories.

“We remained in touch for many years. And she even announced on a talk show when I had not told anyone that ‘Kathy, you're pregnant.' She just knew,” Garver wrote.

Her tribute highlighted Lockhart's empathy and intuitive warmth, qualities that endeared her to colleagues and audiences alike.

Garver closed her tribute with a message of love and peace for her longtime friend.

“Her beautiful soul will take flight in heaven, to rest along with my husband David and dear sister Beverly. I know they will welcome her with warmth and love.”

Born in New York City in 1925 to actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, Lockhart stepped into the spotlight early. She made her feature film debut at age 13 in the 1939 adaptation of “A Christmas Carol,” appearing alongside both of her parents.

A post shared by Amazing Time Capsule (@amazingtimecapsule)

Her early film work included titles such as “All This, and Heaven Too,” “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “The Yearling,” and “Sergeant York.” Before joining the “Lassie” series, she appeared in “Son of Lassie” as Priscilla, the granddaughter of the Duke of Rudling.

Over the course of her long career, Lockhart took on dozens of roles across television, film, and stage. She continued performing well into her 80s, with recurring appearances on shows including “Petticoat Junction,” “General Hospital,” and “Beverly Hills 90210.” She also made guest appearances on series such as “The Beverly Hillbillies,” “Happy Days,” “Full House,” “Roseanne,” and “Grey's Anatomy.”

Lockhart leaves behind a legacy of warmth, intelligence, grace, and a body of work that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Her impact on television history and on those who worked with her will endure for generations.

	Before Mariska Hargitay ended up as “America's sweetheart sex cop,” as she aptly described herself on her Good Hang with Amy Poehler podcast appearance, the veteran TV actor thought she would be a comedian and tested for Friends “many times.”


	Discussing her affinity for comedy with the Parks and Recreation alumna, Hargitay said “all I wanted to be was you,” reflecting on having come up through The Groundlings, the famed Saturday Night Live pipeline improv school and sketch comedy troupe.


	“I did a lot of [comedy auditions],” Hargitay told Poehler about going out for comedic roles at the beginning of her career. “I did Seinfeld, and I did Single Guy, and I tested for Friends so many times.”

	When asked which part she auditioned for, Hargitay said, “I think it's Monica — so long ago, again. But I always thought that I would end up being on a sitcom or doing comedy, that's what I thought.”

	However, a chance encounter with a psychic, who had come highly recommended by her friends, revealed to her a different destiny.


	At the time, the My Mom Jayne documentarian had just wrapped her time as Cynthia Hooper on ER and was a “struggling actor.” Via her development deal at DreamWorks, she was then working on a dramedy in the vein of Ally McBeal. But while on a routine trip to New York City, she visited a psychic in Long Island at her friends' behest, who “started saying all this amazing stuff to me.”


	“He said to me, Amy, ‘You see that face you're doing right now? You see that face?' … I said, ‘Yeah.' He goes, ‘You're gonna be famous for that face. You're moving to New York, and you're gonna be famous for that face,'” she recalled. “And I said, ‘Uh, no, I live in L.A., and I'm gonna be a comedian because I'm funny, and I'm pretty, and that is a deadly combination.' And he looks at me — and this is my favorite moment in my life — and he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's ass what you say.'” 

	











	She concluded, “Six months later, swear to God, I got SVU.”


	Hargitay has portrayed no-nonsense and fiercely protective New York Police Department officer-turned-captain Olivia Benson in Law & Order: SVU since 1999. The Dick Wolf-created NBC mainstay is currently airing its 27th season.

A gripping debut that unearths ancient evils and the eternal struggle between redemption and damnation.

OMAHA, NE, UNITED STATES, October 26, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Emerging author Edward Lillion announces the release of his debut novel, The Old Lords, a chilling supernatural thriller that delves into the battle between Heaven's betrayed angels and the fallen Ones who seek to rise again. Blending political intrigue, theology, and horror, Lillion's story confronts the nature of power, corruption, and the human soul.

About the BookWhen journalist Damian Hunter's wife falls into an unexplained coma, his desperate search for answers thrusts him into the secret underworld of vampire politics, demonic possession, and conspiracies older than civilization itself.

Twelve years after vampires revealed themselves to humanity, a hidden Council of seven immortal lords manipulates global wealth, power, and blood. At its center sits Luciaus, an ancient being born of a cursed ritual—ruling from the Red Throne with charisma and cruelty in equal measure.

But something even older is awakening. Shadows move in hospital corridors. Whispers fill Damian's dreams. And an ancient book—the NarShian—may hold the key to saving his wife... or destroying his soul.

From ancient Austria to modern Boston and Vienna's blood-soaked palaces, The Old Lords spans continents and centuries as Damian unravels a cosmic war that has never truly ended. As he descends deeper into the darkness, he discovers that the greatest battle may not be between angels and demons—but within himself.

A blend of supernatural horror, political conspiracy, and spiritual reckoning, The Old Lords invites readers into a world where faith falters, evil evolves, and the line between redemption and ruin blurs forever.

About the AuthorEdward Lillion, a Pittsburgh-born author, writes stories that explore the shadows of the human soul—where redemption, destiny, and darkness converge. The Old Lords, his debut novel, marks the beginning of a powerful literary journey into the unseen forces that shape humanity's fate.

The most haunted place in Massachusetts must be Salem, right? After all, the quaint east coast town that boasts historic charm and the highest quality of life in the U.S. was also the site of the Salem Witch Trials, where a total of 25 accused witches died horrific deaths between spring 1692 and late-summer 1693. Keeping an open mind, we'd be hard pressed to argue that the 15-month frenzy of mass hysteria that gripped the community didn't leave at least some kind of energetic imprint on the town.

It's that what-if factor that draws hordes of visitors to Witch City every year during Halloween season, but today's lighthearted festivities are a far cry from the horror that gripped 17th-century Salem. The town located about 20 miles northeast of Boston may be home to one of the most iconic Halloween events in the nation, but there's a lesser-known haunted place in Massachusetts where activity is said to rival the unexplained phenomena of the Bermuda Triangle.

We're talking about the Bridgewater Triangle, a 200-square-mile "paranormal vortex" located about 30 miles south of Boston. "The Bridgewater Triangle, I think per square foot we've got more weirdness here than the Bermuda Triangle could hold a candle to, and the reason of course is so much history," Jeff Belanger, an author and lecturer who specializes in unexplained phenomena, told CBS News in 2022. The three points of the triangle-shaped vortex identified in 1983 by Loren Coleman, director of Maine's International Cryptozoology Museum, are located in the towns of Abington (north), Freetown (southeast), and Rehoboth (southwest). So what exactly happens within the confines of the Bridgewater Triangle? Here's what we know.

Like other reportedly haunted places, including the aforementioned Salem, Massachusetts and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania — home of one of the most haunted hiking spots in America — a number of horrific events and gruesome deaths have occurred within the confines of the vortex. One of the earliest recorded incidents dates to an epic battle during King Philip's War, a 17th-century stand-off between British colonists and indigenous members of the Algonquin, Nipmuc, Wampanoag, Pocumtuck, and Narragansett tribes.

One of the bloodiest battles of the 15-month war took place at Hockomock Swamp, a 16,950-acre parcel of wetlands once home to a Wampanoag stronghold that was also considered to be a sacred place. The word Hockomock translates to "the place where spirits dwell." Long before the fateful battle, colonists had already reported experiencing unnerving phenomena in the vicinity of the swamp, especially sightings of eerie light floating above at sunrise and sunset. It's not much of a leap to connect lingering energy related to the agonizing deaths warriors and colonists experienced in the vicinity of the swamp during King Philip's War to paranormal activity. "King Philip's War was the bloodiest battle in US or British history ever per capita, meaning the greatest population percentage died," Belanger told CBS News. "Seventy-five to 80 percent of the natives were wiped out, 25 percent of the colonists. That leaves a stain that I don't think can ever be washed away."

But that's just the tip of the Bridgewater Triangle's paranormal iceberg. Reports of spine-tingling activity in the region, an unassuming blend of suburban and rural, even pastoral, landscapes, include suspected cult murders and reported UFO sightings well into the 21st-century. It's also home to Fall River's Lizzie Borden House, one of the 50 most haunted places in the world.

About 20 miles south of Hockomock Swamp, Freetown-Fall River State Forest is a veritable hotbed of disturbing activity. Cris-crossed with peaceful walking trails, the 5,000-acre woodland is far from foreboding, yet it's been the site of an inordinate number of violent crimes. In 1978, the body of 15-year-old cheerleader Mary Lou Marnuda was found tied to a tree. A year later, 19-year-old Doreen Levesque's body was discovered on the grounds of a local high school within the confines of the Bridgewater Triangle. The murders of two more young women followed shortly thereafter, ultimately revealing an unsettling pattern of cult-like activity involving animal sacrifices and ritualistic murders. Could bad juju be lurking in the forest?

Another reportedly haunted site, Assonet Ledge is said to be imbued with negative energy. In 2004, an allegedly happy and well-adjusted man who was walking with his girlfriend suddenly jumped to his death from the ledge. Other visitors have reported the sudden onset of deep despair and the urge to jump, while some notice glowing orbs and dark apparitions lurking in the pond beneath. And we haven't even touched on the multitude of reported UFO sightings, let alone Bigfoot, giant serpents, and pukwudgies (mischievous creatures who can turn mean in a flash, according to tribal lore).

The Bridgewater Triangle isn't a tourist attraction. You won't find costumed witches peddling tarot readings or hear the call of ghostly spirits beckoning you into a mystical storefront, but you may find the most spine-tingling adventure of your life, if you dare. Most of the reportedly haunted places are open to the public. Or you may just have a drive-by encounter with the infamous red-headed hitchhiker, a ghostly figure said to haunt a section of Route 44 near the Rehoboth-Seekonk town line.

Premier League • England


                                    Is the writing on the wall for Harvey Elliott at Aston Villa?                                

Harvey Elliott was left out of Aston Villa's squad for their fixture with Manchester City on Sunday afternoon, with no official reason yet given but conspiracy theories circulating that he could be sent back to Liverpool.

Elliott left Liverpool towards the end of the transfer window to join Villa on loan with an obligation to buy. That obligation is dependent on him making a certain number of appearances this season, believed to be 10.

And although he's halfway towards that milestone now, he has been used sparingly by Unai Emery. Elliott's only Premier League start for Villa so far culminated in him being taken off at half-time.

This week, reports have suggested Elliott regrets his choice of move in the summer and that the deal between Liverpool and Villa could be cancelled.

Thus, it was interesting to see when the team news was announced for Villa's clash with City that Elliott wasn't even on the bench.

It could be due to an injury, or it could be a conscious decision by Emery. But until any explanation arrives, fans have been wondering if the writing is on the wall and Elliott will be sent back to Liverpool.

On X, one account posted: “Harvey Elliott not even on the bench! Not a chance he's meeting the appearance requirement to sign permanently. Genuinely feel horrible for the lad.”

Another added: “Think he'll go back in January, unless we have a season long loan that we can't get out of… he just won't play the 10 games?? Time will tell I suppose”

Over on Reddit, one user suggested: “I half suspect that he's ringing home begging to get out of here at this point.”

Another replied: “I suspect he'll get his wish. It's seeming like we don't want to trigger the obligation to buy at this point more than trying to work him into the system.”

And another concurred: “Wouldn't surprise me in the least if he's sent back in January.”

On the flipside to the suggestions Villa want to cancel the Elliott deal, some have wondered why Emery would have given him appearances lasting four minutes (Feyenoord) and 19 minutes (Everton) if unsure about activating a permanent deal.

It's believed Villa are committed to paying £35m for Elliott once the obligation to buy kicks in, which isn't an insignificant amount of money.

GO FURTHER – Five loans that MUST be cancelled ASAP

Villa head coach Emery shed some light on Elliott's situation at a press conference this week.

Emery said: “I am being very, very demanding myself to choose in each match the player to start and the players on the bench and the subs players, and firstly is always trying to get the best performance collectively, through individual players.

“Harvey is a 10 number in our structure, in our shape, and he plays some matches and there is still adaptation to add himself individually in our structure, the task we have.

“Of course, he is training well, and his commitment is being very well as well, but his performance was not enough (up to this point).

“At the same time, we have other players who can play as a 10 and they are performing well, and I have different players.

“This is the main reason he is not playing the last matches minutes, but he has to continue working like he is doing in the training session and of course getting his confidence in the performance we need through him.

“His quality, in my opinion, is to play No. 10.

“He can maybe play wide right, like John McGinn, but he will need more time.

“At the beginning I signed him thinking him to play No. 10 and getting the performance and getting him to play consistently for us. There are other players who can play there.”

In a further blow to Elliott's long-term prospects, Villa are reportedly close to agreeing a contract extension with one of their other players who can operate as a No. 10.

They have also reportedly taken the lead in the race for a highly-rated LaLiga winger and have been backed to make an ambitious offer for a Real Madrid forward.


                        These five loan spells haven't got off to good start this season and might need to be backed out of if possible                    


                        Everyone is in agreement a Liverpool star made the wrong decision with his summer transfer, and a recent report from a trusted source has confirmed the deal could be cancelled                    


                        Liverpool have 10 players out on loan during the 2025/26 season and we're keeping track of how all of them are getting on away from Anfield                    


                        The Egyptian superstar has publicly spoken about the defending Premier League champions' decision to offload a young gem in the summer transfer window                    


                        The arrival of Alexander Isak at Anfield has prompted Liverpool to sell an attacker to a Premier League rival, though the Reds have largely negotiated the terms they were looking for

As if zombies weren't enough to worry about, downtown Elgin was the scene of an extraterrestrial invasion Saturday night during the annual Nightmare on Chicago Street.

The 13th iteration of the Halloween fright festival featured thousands of revelers in the streets of the downtown Elgin “safe zone,” while hundreds of performers, including zombie and alien actors, musicians and dancers, lurched along streets and entertained on multiple stages.

This year's alien invasion theme was premised on extraterrestrials using televisions and lost VHS tapes to unleash horror on the earthlings.

Juan Pietras of Rockford was at his fourth Nightmare and was happy to see a thinner crowd early in the night than in years past.

“It's always a good time,” he said while he sipped a drink and watched the crowd on South Grove Avenue. “Being able to walk around and see all the costumes is the best.”

Juan and his friends paid for VIP tickets, which allowed them early entrance and early food and drink before the crowds showed up after 8 p.m.

The sprawling event area included three stages with music, including performances on the main stage by 12-piece brass/funk band My Son the Hurricane, 1990s throwback band Nerdvana, alt-punk band Take the Reins and DJ Cold.

The Plaza Stage featured the Afro-Latin grooves and punk-rock energy of La Misa as well as Chicago's Future Nobodies, Latin-based DJ JTC and hard core/ska band La Pobreska.

Select businesses within the safe zone were open and offering food and specialty drinks. The event also featured four themed pop-up bars for guests with all-access tickets, with settings that included a forgotten video store, a secret science-fiction facility, an Aztec underworld and a mad scientist's mansion.

Seven “street experiences” included themes of “First Contact,” “Plaza Mictlán,” “Safe Zone,” “Cirq D' Freak,” “Kingdom of Plantae,” “Thunder-Dome: Welcome to the ​Blood Lands,” and “Svengoolie's B-movie Boulevard,” which included a meet-and-scream with Svengoolie himself.

Dozens of vendors lined the streets, selling food, drinks and merchandise, while Bizarre Bazaar, a haunted marketplace, offered creepy crafts, trinkets, occult oddities and more.

For years, the testing facility has been known for housing secret objects due to its history of developing classified technology 

BOMBSHELL footage shows a mysterious “UFO-like” aircraft being tested during secret experiments at a US military-linked base.

Investigative YouTuber Anders Otteson told The Sun how he camped on public land overlooking defence firm Lockheed Martin's Helendale radar-testing facility, where he filmed the unknown object.

The footage, shot from a distance, shows what appears to be a dark, wing-shaped object mounted at the top of a white pillar.

It was inside the premises of Lockheed Helendale, a facility used by the firm's secretive Skunk Works division, which is in the middle of a remote desert.

Skunk Works is the official pseudonym of the US defence company's Advanced Development Programs (ADP) – which develops top secret aircraft and weapons. 

For years, the testing facility has been known for housing secret objects due to its history of developing classified, high-tech aerospace technology.

Some of America's most groundbreaking and classified aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, are known to have been developed at this facility. 

And secrecy surrounding Skunk Works' projects has fueled public speculation and conspiracy theories that the organisation is involved in reverse-engineering alien technology.

Throughout the clip, the object, which resembles an aircraft fuselage, can be seen floating on top of the pillar as if it were being radar-tested. 

In one frame, a distinct blue area can be spotted on its upper surface.

Mr Otteson, who runs a YouTube channel to document remote secret sites across the US, said it could be an advanced aircraft technology being tested. 

He told The Sun: “It could be something that is in an early stage of development, it could be a new manned fighter or a new drone. 

“It could also be a model that is developed specifically for a test… say they're going to test a new type of paint, or a new particular component.”

The investigative YouTuber, who has filmed near classified facilities including the infamous Area 51, also linked the Skunk Works team to alien technology.

A slew of conspiracy theories suggests that many projects at the facility involve reverse-engineering tech whose origins are extraterrestrial.

US officials and elected politicians are currently rallying for information about unknown objects flying in US airspace – including one of Trump's top team, Marco Rubio.

And there have been numerous high-profile hearings on the subject, with suggestions the US has “exotic” technology held under wraps. 

Mr Otteson said if the US government possesses advanced or “alien” technology, Skunk Works would almost certainly be involved. 

“The Hellendale facility also has a massive underground chamber below it that's 200 feet deep,” he said. 

“It has spawned a lot of speculation about what other advanced projects might be being worked on in an underground facility like that.

“It is a good place to store advanced technology underground and that is partially why it was built to hide secrets from Soviet espionage. 

“Any other kinds of technology that Lockheed may be in possession of, that'd be a place that they could store it, essentially.” 

Located northwest of Victorville, Lockheed Martin's Helendale facility was designed during the Cold War to protect America's next-generation aircraft from the prying eyes of the Soviets. 

The facility is known to have several test pylons, radar arrays, and control stations to test the stealth technology of military aircraft. 

Speculations also indicate the unknown object could be America's SR-72 “Darkstar” – a top-secret US Air Force project that could revolutionise the military aircraft technology. 

Dubbed “Son of Blackbird”, it is thought to be the potential answer to a near-perfect plane as it's set up to be a super-fast, hypersonic high-altitude surveillance aircraft.

It is thought that next-generation aircraft could potentially reach speeds of Mach 6 (4000mph) – doubling its predecessor's top speed and introducing cutting-edge capabilities for modern combat scenarios. 

According to Airforce Technology, the aircraft will be a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft which will use state-of-the-art aerospace technology for long-range missions.

It will also be capable of hitting targets on any continent within an hour, provided it is equipped with hypersonic missiles, Interesting Engineering reports.

Lockheed Martin announced in 2018 that they are working on the SR-72 project, with a prototype expected to fly very soon.

The US Air Force and the Pentagon have never officially confirmed or denied the existence of the craft.

It is also not yet clear if Lockheed Martin has been given an official go-ahead by the USAF to complete a prototype for consideration.

Some fans have added the “Darkstar” moniker to the SR-72 name after a similar concept plane with the same name was seen in Top Gun: Maverick, which was released in 2022.

Aliens have warned humanity that we face destroying the planet in a breathtaking UFO discovery, which is being cited as "first contact."

The alarming caution from "far away in time and space" urges humans to take steps to protect the  planet. In a chilling series of phrases, experts have concluded that our intergalactic neighbors have deep seated fears for the future of  earth as human beings evolve.

Linguist Agnese Sartori claims to have deciphered the intergalactic words and unidentified hieroglyphic like symbols on the Columbian crash UFO - famously named the Buga Sphere. Italian Sartori painstakingly interpreted each etched symbol, using ancient languages, links to Sanskrit and her knowledge of ancient lingual archeology and literature.

Her conclusion is that the sphere's message relates to "oldest language spoken in some form on this planet."

Sartori explained, "I believe there's a message here. They're telling us, 'we entrust you with life, creation, universal harmony, everything that the sun, the moon, the stars, the cosmos, the primal vibration signifies, and you have the possibility to destroy it or save it. That for me is perhaps my interpretation, (which) could be the fundamental message of that sphere."



Sartori's conclusion features in a 30 minute broadcast, streamed by Beacon TV's website, explaining how she formulated meanings of the sphere's markings on its shell.

"In some way I believe that man can design destiny, because by making mistakes alone, one can decide that this planet will be destroyed in 100 years or in 100,000.

"I believe that man who is a co-creator because he's eternal also has a responsibility for the cosmos, because if something happens to earth, it will be a problem in the solar system and will have repercussions much further afield.

"I believe that man has a great responsibility, and what's happening now is a huge problem. People don't study anymore, they don't want to study."

Sartori stated the 31 etchings on the basketball shaped flying machine, not constructed on this planet, tease details of a flood.

"I believe that there are symbols here which can speak of the system of the earth or the cosmos, which has been modified through, for example, a flood. Because Indra speaks - that symbol - also of a flood. Perhaps it's included in the past of the delivery and the successive cycles that have passed on earth. I think so.

"In fact, many others who have studied Sanskrit and pre- Sanskrit speak of pre-law dates, but the flood is spoken of. There are many texts that speak of the flood."

In recent months extraterrestrial life investigators and scientists have delivered staggering conclusions about the Buga Sphere not being from our current civilization.

Organic material found dates back approximately 12,560 years. Tomography scans of the sphere have seen boffins conclude that the object has a transmitter mechanism inside the impenetrable ball.

Presently, scientists believe that the sphere may not just be sending messages into outer space, but also receiving communication. The advanced screening appears to raise questions too about potential unknown metals or compounds.

The basketball shaped flying machine, which seems to have not been constructed on this planet, is seamless - leaving experts baffled as to how to open it up.

Among those filming the study was TV presenter Jack Osbourne and Emmy nominated documentarian Serena DC and as part or a new TV series.

Both Jack and Serena along with scientists and experts before getting a closer look at the Buga Sphere.

That footage will form part of American Paranormal, an eight-part investigative docu-series about the paranormal and unexplained phenomena.



Jack, famous for hit series like Portals to Hell and The Osbournes Want to Believe, and Serena DC are trekking the world on a mission to find aliens or supernatural entities. And to deliver proof of life beyond our stars and delve into unsolved mysteries such as the infamous Peruvian mummies and Big Foot.

The father of four detailed how he is determined to prove "intelligent creatures occupying planets" have connected to earth and humanity." Serene explained how their visit with the spheres and Sartori's conclusion are a "pivotal moment in human discovery."

"If even half of the team's findings are real, what we are peering at is a threshold, where humanity could rewrite a chapter of our origin story and our place in the cosmos.

"If this translation is indeed accurate, it speaks of cosmic beginnings, of cycles of creation and destruction and of a solar event that divides worlds. Whether this is poetry, prophecy, or a record of something that truly happened long ago, we don't know yet.

"Further metallurgical analysis is now underway. Teams from several laboratories are studying the sphere's precise alloy composition to determine whether these metals are of earthly origin or something else entirely. Whatever its origin, perhaps we're being reminded that someone or something is watching over us."

Excited Jack, working with Beacon TV and Elysium Media, was "blown away" by what he experienced during the visit to the labs where the Buga Sphere is secretly held. He is holding back his full insight into the experience for the show, which airs next year.

But Jack expressed his belief in life in other galaxies, "I do believe that there are intelligent creatures occupying planets in this universe or occupying somewhere, whether it's in this universe or not, but I feel like there is a chance that we are the only living thing in this universe. But there are other living things in other universes that can come into ours."

Leading UFO journalist and award-winning Mexican TV host Jamie Maussan is the custodian of the sphere, leading this intriguing probe in Mexico. Lead scientist and engineer Rodolfo Garrido. NASA scientists and US university professors have also studied the craft leading to a series of conclusions. The enigmatic object is seen by many as a confirmation aliens have visited earth.

It made headlines when it was was spotted above Buga making movements impossible to conventional earthbound aircraft in March. Since crashing into power cables, scientists have spent months undertaking lengthy testing procedures. The initial conclusion was that the basketball-shaped flying machine was not constructed on this planet. The three layers of metal-like material and 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus were dated back back centuries.

A University of Georgia report stated organic material found inside the Buga Sphere is approximately 12,560 years old, predating the pyramids of Egypt by seven millennia.

In recent months, boffins have made a series of claims pointing to the flying object being not of this world. Radiologist Dr Jose Luis Velazquez reported finding "no welds or joints" which would typically indicate human fabrication.

His report noted, "It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin." Sartori boasts a long career in reading and translating texts of mythology and history of religions, philosophy, history of classical art, and archaeology of the mediterranean.

The sphere displays symbols that the team compared to ancient scripts, including runes, Ogham and Mesopotamian writing systems. The sphere's existence is controversial though, because there are no official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga. The government has tried to get the sphere back for their analysis without luck.

Australian Serena DC boasts a long track history of creating TV documentaries about many mysteries and unexplained things on the planet. She has enjoyed success with shows like Interview With The Extraterrestrial and Beyond The Grave.

AKRON − Theresa Caputo, a psychic who rocketed to fame through her TLC reality TV show, "The Long Island Medium," is heading to Northeast Ohio.

"Theresa Caputo Live! The Experience" will hit Nov. 8 at the Akron Civic Theatre.

"I've been touring for almost 15 years now," Caputo said. "Ever since I started doing 'Long Island Medium,' I decided to take the show on the road, so not only healing people in their homes every Sunday night, but also live and in person. The amazing thing about the live show is that you're in a space with thousands of people, and to watch someone heal in front of you and to watch the way Spirit moves me throughout the room is just absolutely incredible."

The highest-grossing film in Maddock's supernatural universe, Stree 2 earned an astounding Rs 875 crore globally. Released on August 15, 2024, it had one of the biggest opening days for a Hindi film and set new records for Rajkummar Rao. The movie also became famous for having one of the highest fifth-week collections in Indian cinema history, cementing its status as a fan favourite.



Released during Diwali 2025, Thamma crossed Rs 78.6 crore in India by its fifth day, surpassing the lifetime earnings of Bhediya. The horror-comedy, starring Ayushmann Khurrana and Rashmika Mandanna, blends folklore, humour and emotion, featuring Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Paresh Rawal and special appearances by Nora Fatehi and Varun Dhawan.



Munjya was released in June 2024 and became a commercial success with Rs 132 crore worldwide. Praised for its impressive visual effects and strong performances, the film proved that Maddock's supernatural universe could continue to expand with fresh ideas and engaging stories.



Released in November 2022, Bhediya grossed approximately Rs 90 crore in India. Audiences loved its unique mix of horror and comedy, and the movie's popularity has paved the way for an upcoming sequel in the Maddock universe.



Roohi, released in 2021, collected Rs 30.33 crore worldwide. While not as big a commercial hit as later films, it played a key role in building the foundation of Maddock's horror-comedy franchise, introducing audiences to its quirky and supernatural storytelling style.



The original Stree kickstarted Maddock's supernatural universe in 2018, earning Rs 180 crore worldwide. Its clever mix of horror and comedy captured audiences' imaginations and set the tone for future films in the franchise.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

14:30 JST, October 26, 2025

Three years have passed since the fatal shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and some people on social media are still claiming that the man indicted for the murder was not the sole perpetrator.

Instead, they claim there was a “true sniper.”

Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, was indicted on charges that include murdering Abe.

The former prime minister was fatally shot during a stump speech in Nara in July 2022.

Investigators have concluded that Yamagami was the sole perpetrator, and his defense team has also denied the involvement of multiple individuals.

The Nara District Court will hold the first hearing for the case on Tuesday.

Posts such as “He was not the sole perpetrator” and “It was an organized act of terror. The truth lies in power” continue to be made on social media.

The Yomiuri Shimbun used Social Insight, a tool for analyzing social media posts from data analysis firm User Local Inc., to examine posts on X with phrases such as “assassination of former Prime Minister Abe.”

The analysis found that more than 600,000 posts, including reposts, had been made since the incident took place as of this month. This year alone, the number of such posts so far totals about 150,000. Many posts in July this year, three years since the incident, were found to have used such terms as “truth” and “mysterious.”

In May, an organization claiming to have the goal of uncovering the truth of the incident held a meeting in Tokyo. The group's 79-year-old representative, who is a former Tochigi prefectural assembly member, said several hundred people attended the meeting.

“The government is covering up the truth,” the man told The Yomiuri Shimbun. “We will gather information and take action.”

The social media posts claim that some major points are suspicious.

They say that one of the doctors who attempted to save Abe at the hospital described injuries during a press conference that were inconsistent with the results of an autopsy conducted by the Nara Prefectural police.

Likewise, they claim a gunshot distinct from those made by the suspect's homemade gun can be heard in video footage of the incident.

However, according to senior officials of the Nara Prefectural Police and senior prosecutors, the prefectural police carefully investigated whether any third parties were involved and found no proof that any were.

The investigators found that the wounds on Abe's body were consistent with the shots fired by the suspect. Both the Nara Prefectural Police and the Nara District Public Prosecutors Office therefore determined that Yamagami had acted alone.

A senior official of the prefectural police admitted that the doctor's explanation was different from the autopsy results. However, the official went on to say that the autopsy results are accurate, as they describe the state of the body objectively.

“It's possible for observations made in an emergency while trying to save a patient's life to be different from the results of an autopsy,” the official said.

Regarding the gunshots, another senior police official said, “We analyzed the video footage, but only two gunshots can be heard, both of which were made by the suspect.”

Yamagami is expected to admit in court that he intended to kill Abe. Therefore, the involvement of multiple parties will not be an issue at trial.

“No one other than the accused participated in the incident,” a member of his defense team told The Yomiuri Shimbun clearly.

A doctor who performed the autopsy on Abe and a police officer who analyzed the suspect's homemade gun are among those who are scheduled to appear in the court hearings.

“These kinds of social media comments may tone down a bit once the accused admits to the charges and speaks about the details of the incident,” said Daisuke Tomo, professor at Kindai University and an expert on information ethics.

We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us — in our personal lives and as a society — we already have a degree of freedom from it. Challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

"Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good."

Oregon has for years struggled with a drug crisis, reporting one of the highest rates of substance use disorders in the US and ranking last in the nation for access to treatment. The problem is systemic, rooted in decades of failure to invest in the level of behavioral health services needed for people with mental illnesses and addiction. The Pacific north-west state's significant affordable housing shortage has compounded the challenges, as people languish on the streets without care. On 12 November 2024, Cameron Washam, 45, was lying on the street by Portland's Union Station, on the brink of death. He and his wife, Christina Bell, 47, had long struggled with homelessness and addiction. Workers from a Portland street outreach initiative coordinated by the Mental Health and Addiction Association of Oregon (MHAAO), a non-profit dedicated to peer recovery services, approached and offered help, saying they could immediately take them to a detox program. They entered detox, Washam got emergency surgery for his infection, and after eight days, they were placed in an outpatient program, then a sober recovery home. The outreach effort [is] called the Provider-Police Joint Connection Program. Since its launch, the program has connected 1,005 people to services, including 651 who received access to programs on the same day outreach teams met them and 159 who got into detox and treatment.

Authorities revealed this week that a man once named a person of interest in the disappearance of Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit was responsible for the 2006 killing of a Wisconsin woman and may have been responsible for other murders.

The Wood County Sheriff's Office announced that Christopher Revak was behind the death of Deidre Harm, officially closing a case that had gone unsolved for nearly two decades.

On Oct. 20, the Wood County Sheriff's Office shared a letter from District Attorney Jonathan Barnett on Facebook stating that he would have filed charges against Revak if he were still alive.

"I consider this case closed," Barnett wrote. "I believe I had enough to charge and, if Mr. Revak were still alive, win at trial."

Harm, a 21-year-old single mother, disappeared after a night out at a downtown Wisconsin Rapids bar June 10, 2006. Her remains were discovered five months later by hunters in a wooded area near Seneca, about 5 miles from downtown, according to WSAW.

"This may provide some closure for many but won't bring Deidre back," the Wood County Sheriff's Office and Wisconsin Rapids Police said in a joint statement. "Our thoughts and prayers will always be with Deidre's family."

Revak, a Wisconsin native and former EMT, died by suicide in a Missouri jail cell in July 2009, just one day after being charged with second-degree murder in the death of Rene Williams, 36, a mother of three from Mansfield, Missouri.

Williams was last seen March 13, 2007, at the Eagle Lodge bar in Ava, Missouri, where she worked. Revak was also at the bar that night, according to FOX 9.

In 2024, KCCI Des Moines reported that Iowa and Wisconsin investigators were taking a fresh look at Revak, who had long been suspected of multiple violent crimes before his death.

Notorious ‘Scorecard Killer' Linked To Decades-old Murder Nearly 45 Years Later

According to a recent documentary, police have examined whether Revak may have been connected to as many as five different homicides over a 14-year span, including the disappearance of Huisentruit.

Douglas County Sheriff Chris Degase, who investigated Williams' case, previously told Fox News Digital that Revak's confirmed link to Harm's killing deepened his concerns about the former EMT's violent history.

"When I started working on the Christopher Revak case, he was my suspect in the murder of Rene Williams," Degase said. "I didn't think it was his first go-around at it."

Degase told KY3 that forensic evidence linked Revak to Williams' disappearance.

"We had his DNA at the scene. We had her DNA inside his truck," he said. "I think the biggest thing was that they weren't able to find a body. They had no witnesses to come forward to say that she was dead."

Despite the lack of a body, investigators charged Revak with Williams' murder based on DNA results. Degase said his curiosity about similar crimes led him to uncover chilling parallels.

"It wasn't the first time Revak tried to abduct a woman in Ava," he said. "Actually, shortly after his arrest, I Google searched ‘women abducted from bars' in all the towns that he had lived in. And when I Google searched from Wisconsin Rapids, Deidre Harm came up."

That discovery prompted Degase to reach out to Wisconsin investigators, sharing his findings and helping connect the dots between cases.

"I don't believe in coincidences," he said. "I called the authorities out there and gave them the information I had."

Degase, who is featured in the documentary discussing the case, said Williams and Huisentruit remain missing, a detail that still haunts him. He didn't rule out the possibility Revak could have traveled to Iowa.

"Obviously, [Jodi] wasn't abducted from a bar, but I just thought it was odd," Degase said.

He added that Revak "had a dark side."

"We're dealing with what's possibly a serial killer," Degase told KY3. "During his day, he's doing his deed to society and helping people and saving people, but there was a dark side to Chris Revak."

Revak had also been a person of interest in the 1995 disappearance of Huisentruit, a 27-year-old morning anchor for KIMT-TV in Mason City, Iowa.

Huisentruit vanished around 4 a.m. on June 27, 1995, after calling a colleague to say she was on her way to work but never arriving. Police found signs of a struggle outside her apartment, including a pair of high heels and a bent car key near her car.

She was declared legally dead in 2001, though her body has never been found.

At the time, Mason City Police said there was no evidence linking Revak to the case. However, in 2024, investigators from Wisconsin and Iowa reconnected to compare notes about him, according to FindJodi.com.

Authorities had also looked into whether Revak's ex-wife once lived in the same house as one of the last people to see Huisentruit alive but determined she moved out six months before the anchor's disappearance.

Despite three decades of dead ends, then-Mason City Police Chief Jeff Brinkley said in June the department continues to receive and pursue leads year-round.

"We haven't put this down. We haven't stopped working. We have not stopped pursuing leads and information," Brinkley told FOX 9 at the time.

In 2024, officers searched a property in Winsted, Minnesota, following a tip, though no new evidence was found. Earlier this year, part of a 2017 search warrant was also unsealed.

"We're still hopeful the case will be solved and justice served — no matter how long it takes," Brinkley said.

Huisentruit's family continues to hold out hope for closure.

"The pain and anguish felt by us and all who loved Jodi are immeasurable," her family wrote in a statement on the Jodi's Hope Facebook page. "True peace will only come when Jodi is found and justice is served. We still choose to hope that one day soon it will happen."
