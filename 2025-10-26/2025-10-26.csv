EDITOR'S NOTE:  CNN FlashDocs unit tracks the theft, the investigation and the cultural fallout in “The Heist: The Louvre's Stolen Crown Jewels.” Watch tonight Sunday, October 26 at 8pm ET/PT on CNN. The special will also be available to stream via CNN's All Access subscription offering at launch on Tuesday, October 28.



            Police have arrested suspects in connection with the theft of priceless jewels from the Louvre museum, just as one attempted to leave the country, the Paris prosecutor's office said.
    


            Thieves last week targeted the Louvre's Apollo Gallery in a brazen daylight raid, fleeing with jewelry worth tens of millions in a matter of minutes.
    


            Scores of investigators have been involved in chasing down those suspected of the heist, which Louvre director Laurence des Cars called a “terrible failure.”
    


            French media first broke news of the arrests, with CNN-affiliate BFMTV reporting that two suspects in their thirties and known to police were detained on Saturday evening local time.
    


            At least two other individuals suspected of being involved in the heist remain at large, according to BFMTV.
    


            Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said “one of the men arrested was preparing to leave the territory from Roissy airport,” also known as Charles de Gaulle airport, a facility near Paris.
    


            The prosecutor did not confirm the number of arrests or say if any of the jewels were recovered.
    


            France's Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez congratulated the investigators for the arrests, who he said “have worked tirelessly, as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.”
    


            Thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre's upper floor last weekend, which houses the French Crown Jewels. They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window.
    


            In the course of a seven-minute heist, they broke into two high-security display cases and stole nine items, according to France's culture ministry. Among the items taken was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.
    


            The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million), Beccuau previously told French radio station RTL. Around 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt to track down those responsible for the heist, she said.
    


            One week after the heist, the investigation into the incident is accelerating, BFMTV reported Sunday.
    


            Following the daylight robbery, French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the heist exposed security failings at France's most famous museum.
    


            “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn't been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”

            Russia has successfully tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile and will work towards deploying the weapon, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday, which comes as Moscow launched its second deadly attack on Ukraine in two nights.
    


            The timing of the missile test is notable, coming the same week that a potential summit with US President Donald Trump broke down, and the White House placed sanctions on two of Russia's largest oil companies – some of the Trump administration's most tangible actions against Russia to date.
    


            Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, claimed the Burevestnik missile remained airborne for about 15 hours and covered a distance of around 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles). During the test, the weapon demonstrated “its high capabilities in evading anti-missile and anti-aircraft defences,” Gerasimov said.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin said, “We need to determine the possible ways of using it and start preparing the infrastructure for deploying this weapon,” adding that it's a product “no one else in the world has.”
    


            Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev said that the details of the “successful” missile testing had been conveyed to the Trump administration during his visit to the US, as well as recent battlefield updates.
    


            Last week, Russia also held a “planned” strategic nuclear forces drill under Putin's supervision. The Kremlin said the drill tested staff skills and the readiness of military command-and-control systems, adding that all objectives were met.
    


            It comes as Russia launched more than 100 drones on Ukraine overnight into Sunday, striking high-rise buildings in Kyiv as residents slept.
    


            A 19-year-old girl and her mother, 46, were among three people killed in air strikes on the Ukrainian capital, according to Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. A fur﻿ther 33 people were wounded, including seven children.
    


            “The youngest is four years old,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. Of those injured, eight were hospitalized, Klitschko said.
    


            The latest wave of violence came as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky Zelensky issued a fresh appeal for more Patriot missile defense systems, part of a broader efforts to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia's sustained aerial assault.
    


            On Saturday night, a fire erupted at a nine-story residential building in the capital's Desnianskyi region, where 13 people were rescued from the upper floors. Additionally, a Russian drone struck a 16-story high-rise, shattering windows from the first to the ninth floor, emergency crew said.
    


            Natalia Zura, 49, escaped from the burning house with her daughter Maria using a fire ladder.
    


            “We had a terrible night. We had to climb down the fire escape from the third floor. Thank you to our rescuers, our guardian angels. We are very grateful because we almost suffocated, we almost burned to death,” Zura told CNN.
    


            Olha Motianina, 34, had left Kyiv for a nearby village with her family because of the constant bombardment. On Sunday, she returned to her home in the city to find the windows shattered from the blast.
    


            “It's a very sad picture. People have died, and I don't know how to describe it. It's very sad and affects my mental state,” she said.
    


            Another drone struck a high-rise building in the Obolonskyi district of Kyiv, but firefighters said the site was not set ablaze.
    


            “Every Russian strike is an attempt to inflict as much damage as possible on ordinary life,” Zelensky said on Sunday.
    


            “This week, they've been striking residential buildings, our people, our children… these are the main targets for the Russians,” he added, noting that the Kremlin has unleashed nearly 1,200 drones, more than 1,360 guided aerial bombs and over 50 missiles on his nation in the past week.
    


            More than a hundred rescuers and police officers in Kyiv responded overnight into Sunday, checking the stability of the burned out high-rises as well as clearing debris and dismantling damaged structures, the interior minister said.
    


            Elsewhere in the city, crews continue painstakingly clearing debris from the previous night's attack.
    


            The magnitude of the attack and the extent of its damage was not immediately known. Klitschko did not confirm whether the buildings were directly hit or struck by falling debris from destroyed weapons.
    


            Meanwhile, Russian air defense systems destroyed two drones heading for Moscow, according to the city's mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Sunday.
    


            Six civilians were injured in Russia's Belgorod region due to Ukrainian strikes, according to local authorities there, including three in the city of Belgorod and three in the village of Dorogoshch.
    


            Ukraine needs a constant pipeline of weapons from its allies to defend against Russian barrages of missiles and drones – often several hundred in one night. Repeated deadly attacks have underlined the shortfall in Ukraine's air defenses.
    


            Another overnight attack Saturday killed at least four people in Ukraine, prompting Zelensky to ask for more Patriot missile systems “so that we can protect our cities from this horror.”
    


            Trump has been pushing for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia but those attempts have made little progress so far.
    


            After Trump had a phone call with Putin last week, he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced he was heading soon to Budapest for an in-person summit.
    


            Five days later, the summit was off and new sanctions on Moscow were on.
    


            “It just it didn't feel right to me,” Trump said Wednesday. “It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it.”
    


            Since then, the Kremlin has said it was wrong to talk about the cancellation of the meeting, according to Russian state media outlet Vesti.
    


            On Saturday, Trump struck a similarly pessimistic tone, saying he has no immediate plans to schedule a meeting with Putin and insisting that any summit will have to wait until a potential peace deal seems achievable.
    


            “I'm going to have to know that we're going to make a deal,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Asia. “I'm not going to be wasting my time. I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing,” he added.

Cambodia and Thailand have signed an extended ceasefire to end a deadly border clash that erupted earlier this year. The signing ceremony on Sunday was overseen by US President Donald Trump, who brokered the initial truce.

Longstanding tensions between the two Southeast Asian neighbors rooted in colonial-era border disputes erupted in July as both sides traded fire for five days and hundreds of thousands fled the border area. A Malaysia-hosted meeting then produced a truce – the first step toward ending the crisis. Trump later said he used trade talks with both nations to push for de-escalation.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul signed the expanded ceasefire on Sunday at the 47th ASEAN summit in Malaysia.

Building on July's truce, it sets a framework to ease tensions and secure lasting peace along the border. The deal calls for Thailand to release 18 captured Cambodian soldiers, both sides to withdraw heavy weaponry, begin demining, and curb illegal cross-border activities.

Following the signing, the Thai prime minister said border weapon withdrawals would begin “promptly,” alongside the release of Cambodian POWs, and announced a joint trade framework. His Cambodian counterpart praised the deal and vowed to uphold it, thanking Trump for his role. He added that he had nominated the US president for next year's Nobel Peace Prize.

The US president hailed the deal as “monumental” and “historic.” He also highlighted his own role in the agreement, telling reporters he was very good at making “peace deals” and that it was “almost a hobby.” After the ceremony, Trump signed a reciprocal trade deal with Cambodia and a critical minerals agreement with Thailand.

Since returning to office, Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving various conflicts across the globe. He cited his Gaza peace plan as his eighth such success but has at times confused his record, falsely claiming to have settled nonexistent disputes between Albania and Azerbaijan and between Armenia and Cambodia. He nevertheless welcomed this year's award going to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, congratulating her and noting his past support for her cause.

Former US Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she may make another bid for the presidency despite her 2024 election defeat to Donald Trump.

In an interview with the BBC on Saturday, Harris, 61, said she is certain the world will see a woman in charge in the White House “in their lifetime.”

Asked whether she could be the one, she replied: “Possibly,” adding that she has not made a decision on whether to run in 2028. “I am not done. I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it's in my bones. And there are many ways to serve. I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I'm doing right now.”

Harris was also pressed on her political odds in the White House race after bookmakers placed her behind celebrity figures such as actor and former pro wrestler Dwayne ‘The Rock' Johnson.

Harris remained unfazed, saying, “I've never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here in this interview.”

Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024 after Joe Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate with Trump, during which he appeared to stumble over his words and lose his train of thought, prompting concerns about his age and fitness for office. Harris went on to face Trump, who soundly defeated her in the November election.

With the next presidential race three years away, media outlets have speculated that possible Democratic contenders in the 2028 election could include Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Among the Republicans, Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are widely regarded as the most likely key contenders. Trump himself has hinted he might seek a third term, although the Constitution bars any president from being elected more than twice.

Department of Agriculture says no benefits will be issued in November and it would not draw on emergency reserves

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Saturday that food benefits under one of the country's biggest social assistance programs will not be issued in November amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.

The shutdown was in its 25th day at the time of the announcement, which came after more than 200 Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Friday called on USDA to draw on its emergency reserves to fund November food benefits.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress remain at an impasse over how to fund and reopen the federal government.

“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the USDA said in a post on its website. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued” 1 November.

More than 41 million depend on the monthly payments, according to the USDA. In some states, like New Mexico, dependence on the program is as high as 21% of residents, it said.

According to a memo seen by Reuters, the department indicated that it would not draw on emergency reserves to fund food benefits in November.

A statement from the leader of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the Trump administration had the opportunity to act sooner to ensure benefits don't run out.

“It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,” the statement from Sharon Parrott said, as reported by The Hill. “Instead, it may choose not to use them in an effort to gain political advantage” as Republicans seek to exert pressure on Senate Democrats to vote in favor of a spending bill that would reopen the federal government.

Governors in Louisiana and Virginia declared states of emergencies this week to make funds available to help with hunger relief in anticipation of Snap benefits not being issued in November.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Two House Republicans push justice department to investigate Zohran Mamdani's path to US citizenship

Two US House Republicans are pushing the federal justice department to investigate the path to citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate favored to win the 4 November election for New York City mayor.

Congressman Randy Fine of Florida and Andy Ogles of Tennessee – both staunch proponents of Donald Trump's presidential administration – have been leading the push, which has been condemned by Democratic officials and Muslim civil rights groups as “racist and anti-Muslim”.

Fine in recent days demanded the federal government “review every naturalization of the past 30 years – starting with Mamdani”.

Fine told the New York Post: “I just think we need to take a hard look at how these folks became citizens, and if there is any fraud or any violation of the rules we need to denaturalize and deport.”

He continued: “I know that there's a lot of us that are very, very concerned about the enemy within – people who have come to this country to become citizens, to destroy it.”

Meanwhile, since June, Ogles has pushed for a justice department investigation of Mamdani, with calls to deport him over claims that the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to which Mamdani belongs are a communist organization that he didn't disclose in his naturalization process.

A dual citizen of the US and Uganda, Mamdani has criticized the rhetoric aimed at him by Fine, Ogles and other Republicans by invoking the federal government shutdown which began on 1 October as well as his decisive victory in June's New York City Democratic mayoral primary.

“In a moment where Americans across the country are deeply fearful of whether they can afford the basic dignities of life, be it healthcare, be it groceries, be it their rent, the focus of the Republican party is to try and denaturalize the Muslim guy that won the New York City Democratic primary with the most votes in our city's history?” Mamdani told MSNBC's The Weekend: Primetime on Saturday. “It just speaks to the fact that for the Republican party, the only agenda they really have on offer is that of cruelty and punishment.”

Mamdani also criticized his main mayoral opponent, Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned while facing an impeachment investigation over sexual harassment allegations in 2021. Cuomo, who is the preferred candidate of New York City native Trump, suggested on a radio talk show recently that Mamdani would cheer a terrorist attack like the ones that killed thousands on 11 September 2001.

“God forbid another 9/11,” Cuomo said. “Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?”

The host, Sid Rosenberg replied, “He'd be cheering.”

Cuomo paused, laughed, and added, “That's another problem.”

Cuomo tried to distance himself from the interview, claiming, “I can see where if you took it seriously, it was offensive.” Cuomo's campaign has also received criticism for posting, then deleting, a racist AI generated video depicting “criminals for Zohran Mamdani”.

“I think Islamophobia is something that is endemic to politics across this country,” Mamdani added in the interview with MSNBC. “And we have seen it normalized. We have seen it accepted. And it has come to a point where to speak up about it is seen as if you are making it into an issue, whereas in fact you are naming that which already exists. And so much of this is driven from an unwillingness to recognize that Muslims belong here in the city.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Experts see move as Trump's latest attempt to shift power of the purse away from Congress and into executive branch

By ordering that US military personnel receive paychecks even though the government is shut down, Donald Trump is seeing to the needs of a politically untouchable constituency that has been caught up in the congressional logjam over federal spending.

But experts who spoke to the Guardian warn that he is doing so in a way that is almost certainly illegal and, if left unchecked, bodes ill for Congress's constitutional authority to control government spending. Some fear it could set the stage for the president to unilaterally fund other contentious decisions in the future, such as the deployment of the military on US soil.

“I'm with the people who believe that there's really no good legal justification for moving the money around in this way,” said Phil Wallach, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the separation of powers in the US government.

“There's no congressional authorization for troop payment for this new fiscal year. So it's going pretty far out on a legal limb, and just sort of daring anybody to do anything about it. Because, of course, substantially, nobody thinks it's very bad to pay the troops.”

The federal government shut down at the start of October after Democrats and Republicans in Congress failed to agree on legislation to extend funding beyond the end of September. About 700,000 federal workers have been furloughed, while hundreds of thousands of others continue to report to work, but are not getting paychecks.

Troops were paid during previous government shutdowns because Congress had either approved defense department spending, or passed bills specifically to guarantee their salaries, said Bobby Kogan, a former White House office of management and budget official who is now with the Center for American Progress, a liberal thinktank.

Congress took neither of those actions this time, though lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to get legislation addressing federal workers' pay through Congress, as recently as this week.

Last week, Trump acted unilaterally, repurposing a reported $8bn in defense department funds meant for research and development to pay the military in the middle of October. Kogan called the decision “super duper duper illegal” under federal law.

“If you try to spend money you have on the wrong purpose, you're in trouble. And if you try to spend money into a purpose that you don't have money for that purpose, then you're in trouble as well,” he said.

On Thursday, Trump said an unnamed “friend” had contributed $130m to pay service members during the shutdown, later revealed by the New York Times to be reclusive billionaire and Trump supporter Timothy Mellon. Sean Parnell, the chief spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed acceptance of the funds “under its general gift acceptance authority. The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members' salaries and benefits.”

Christopher Mirasola, a law professor at the University of Houston, said that the civil servants who carried out Trump's order to repurpose funds could theoretically be prosecuted for violating a law called the Antideficiency Act. But such prosecutions have never happened in the past, and he said in an interview he finds it difficult to believe Trump's justice department, or even another president, would carry them out.

“I'm just not sure if a future administration would have the appetite to bring career government officials who at that point would have suffered years of abuse at the hands of the administration for complying with something even if they knew that it was illegal,” Mirasola said.

Trump foes who tried to sue over it – think Democratic lawmakers or civil society groups – may have trouble proving that they were harmed by paying the troops, a necessary component for bringing a case, Kogan said.

“You're in tough places here to find standing under this supreme court, at least under the Trump administration,” he said.

The experts viewed Trump's move to pay troops as his latest attempt to shift the power of the purse away from Congress and into the executive branch, but differed over how significant it was in the long term. Since taking office, he has used a variety of methods to halt government spending on areas his administration opposes, including a controversial pocket rescission of foreign aid funds.

“I think the crisis will start to feel more acute if we start seeing the president moving money around to do things that are very politically controversial,” said Wallach, noting that paying US armed forces is “something that basically everybody agrees on”.

The ball is now in the Republican-controlled Congress's court to make clear that it is they who make the decisions about spending, Wallach said.

“I certainly don't think among GOP appropriators, they're like wanting to see the White House just take things over. I'm really quite certain that they're distressed by this dynamic and want to get away from it as fast as they can,” he said.

Kogan warned that Trump was launching an offensive against Congress's appropriations process, by which lawmakers, usually working in a bipartisan fashion, outline how much the government will spend, and on what.

“If the president can just completely ignore anything and everything, can spend money into existence, he can drain accounts and use them on whatever he wants, right?” Kogan said. “Like, what are we even doing there? That makes you an appropriations king.”

Such decisions may paradoxically make finding an agreement to reopen the government harder, by sapping the trust in Congress that any legislative deal Democrats sign on to will be honored by Trump.

“The whole point of the budget deal is to figure out how you're going to allocate your limited resources. We are going to figure out what we want to prioritize in the government, and if the president has complete and unilateral authority to ignore every part of that deal, how can you ever do appropriations? How can you ever make a funding deal?” Kogan.

Mirasola connected the pay decision to Trump's deployment of national guard troops into cities across the country, including Washington DC, Chicago and Portland. He views many of the federal laws that govern how the military may be used on US soil as outdated, and the main obstacle Trump faces is his ability to get Congress to pay for the soldiers.

“If my theory that appropriations are the most important limit on these domestic military deployments, if that's true, then moves like this to edge Congress out of the appropriations process [are] really a strike at one of the most significant amendments on the president's authority to use the military in the United States,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

KYOTO — Sightings of bears and animals believed to be bears are increasing in residential areas of Ukyo Ward, Kyoto, and close to Arashiyama, a nearby tourist spot.

A total of five sightings were reported over Friday and Saturday. No human injuries have been confirmed.

On Friday evening, two cubs were spotted in a bamboo grove near Uzumasa Nakayamacho. On the same day, two other sightings were reported around Hirosawa Pond, a popular spot for moon viewing.

Early Saturday morning, police received a report of a bear-like cub on a road about 800 meters west of JR Saga-Arashiyama Station, north of the World Heritage Site Tenryuji Temple and near the Bamboo Grove Path, which is popular with tourists.

An event attempting the Guinness World Record for the longest nagashi somen, where somen noodles flow down a split bamboo trough, distance was held in Niyodogawa Town, Kochi Prefecture, on Saturday. The goal of 4,133.59 meters was met, setting a new world record. The previous record of 4,031.76 meters had taken place in Taketa, Oita Prefecture, in 2023.

The event was planned by a group of young volunteers to mark the 20th anniversary of the town's municipal merger. Local businesses also took park, splitting about 1,000 bamboo poles to make troughs. The long trough was set over a town road with an elevation difference of about 350 meters to let water flow smoothly.

Shohei Takemura, 31, the event's executive committee chair, kicked off the attempt by gently placing the noodles into the water flow. About an hour later, the noodles began to pour into the goal basket and significantly exceeded the required 25 gram amount. Participants cheered when the official adjudicator declared the attempt successful.

With tears in his eyes, Takemura stated, “We have proven we can achieve the world's best even in a town facing population decline and a lack of young people.”

Editor's note: This article was updated after officials reported that a second incident occurred the following night on Oct. 25-26.

Lithuania has closed its last two operational border crossings with Belarus and the country's largest airport after another incident involving balloons launched from Belarusian territory, officials announced on Oct. 25. 

Air traffic at Vilnius Airport was halted until 2 a.m. local time amid the reported balloons, with officials announcing that the border will remain closed until the same time.

The incident marks the second occurred within 24 hours that the country has shuttered flight operations and closed border crossings, after Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene announced an initial incident involving balloons on Oct. 24. 

Ruginiene said that a large group of ""smuggling balloons"" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania, prompting the temporary suspension of operations at Vilnius and Kaunas airports.

The move comes after a series of airspace violations involving balloons carrying contraband cigarettes. On Oct. 5 and 21, Lithuanian authorities were forced to close the airspace above Vilnius, leading to the cancellation of dozens of flights.

""The State Border Guard Service has closed the Salcininkai and Medininkai border crossing points until noon tomorrow,"" Ruginiene wrote on Facebook following the Oct. 24 incident, citing national security concerns.

""The services are acting in accordance with the decisions taken at this week's National Security Commission meeting. Next week, the commission will meet again to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken and determine what else can be done,"" she said.

The latest incident marks the fourth such violation in a month.

Belarus, ruled by dictator Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, remains one of Moscow's closest allies and has provided Russia with political, economic, and military support during its full-scale war in Ukraine. 

Lithuania shares a 680-kilometer (420-mile) border with the country.

The closure follows a surge in suspicious aerial incidents across Europe, fueling fears of hybrid operations linked to Russia. In early October, Munich International Airport faced two consecutive disruptions over suspected drone activity. 

Similar incidents briefly grounded flights in Oslo and Copenhagen, while in September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that violated its airspace. Days later, Romania reported that a Russian drone had crossed its border but chose not to engage.

Ukrainian forces liberated two villages in eastern Donetsk Oblast about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of embattled Pokrovsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Oct. 26. 

The General Staff said that Ukrainian troops operating in the area cleared Kucheriv Yar and Sukhetske of Russian troops over the past 10 days. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claim. 

The General Staff's report comes nearly three months after Russian forces made a sudden 10-kilometer (6-mile) push in just days toward the key highway connecting Kramatorsk and Dobropillia in early August. Since the rapid Russian advance in the area, Ukrainian forces have taken back nine villages, and nine more have been cleared of Russian sabotage groups, the General Staff said in its Facebook post. 

Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState also shows the villages of Kucheriv Yar and Sukhetske as controlled by Ukrainian forces. The villages are about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Dobropillia, a town that Russian forces have heavily struck since the August breach.

Across the front, Russian forces continue to launch offensives on multiple sectors despite the Ukrainian claims that its troops have effectively stalled Moscow's momentum. 

Russian troops have already entered the long-embattled Pokrovsk, semi-encircling what used to be a key Ukrainian logistics hub, and are trying to further close in on the city to force a Ukrainian withdrawal. 

The General Staff acknowledged on Oct. 26 that Russia has accumulated about 200 servicemen in Pokrovsk, infiltrating small infantry groups, reporting shooting and drone battles in the city. 

The 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces acknowledged the Russian penetration to the railway on Oct. 20.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said he stands ready to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. and tried to reassure Canadians that he is taking steps to shore up the country's economy after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs by another 10 per cent.

Mr. Trump said this weekend he's hiking tariffs on Canadian imports after an Ontario government TV ad critical of his protectionist levies ran during the first game of the World Series.

Mr. Carney, who is in Malaysia meeting with member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said his government plans massive investments in Canada's economy and intends to shift as much trade as possible away from the United States, which has become a more unpredictable and unreliable partner since Mr. Trump took office in January.

“You'll be seeing within the course of the next two weeks an ambitious budget which makes generational investments in Canada,” Mr. Carney told reporters.

“And we are in the process of diversifying our trade relationships – the focus of our meetings here in Asia,” the Prime Minister said. “We have an intention to more than double our exports away from the United States over the course of the next decade.”

Opinion: Is Ford's ad to blame for Trump's 10-per-cent tariff hike? Please, it's an excuse

Mr. Trump, who has imposed a slew of tariffs on Canadian goods since March, had already ratcheted up tensions this past Thursday by breaking off negotiations aimed at resolving the trade war in response to the TV ad.

The 60-second TV spot uses footage from nearly 40 years ago of former U.S. president Ronald Reagan decrying American protectionism, saying such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.

Mr. Trump, who has said the Ontario ad misrepresents Mr. Reagan's comments, said he was raising tariffs by 10 per cent because Canada did not immediately stop running the ad as he wanted.

“Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” the U.S. President said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew to Malaysia on Air Force One.

The President has not yet issued any executive order to enforce the threatened 10-per cent-hike. It's not clear if this new levy would apply to all Canadian imports or a selection of them. And he has announced no date for this increase.

Both Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump were in Kuala Lumpur over the weekend to attend the ASEAN summit.

Speaking at the summit on Sunday, Mr. Carney, in an apparent reference to Mr. Trump, talked of the need for dependable allies in turbulent times.

“It makes ASEAN more important than ever. It underscores the importance of reliable partners who honour their commitments, who are there in tough times and when things are not working, work collaboratively to fix them.”

Carney pitches Asia on Canada as energy superpower

He told reporters he'd agreed with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of ASEAN, as well as next year's chair, Philippines President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., that Canada would conclude a free-trade deal with ASEAN member countries by next year.

Separately, Mr. Carney said he'd agreed with the Philippines to accelerate negotiations on a free-trade deal that would also conclude next year.

“Building at home, diversifying our trade relationships abroad, and being ready to work with the United States government as, and when, the time comes .”

After Mr. Trump said he would terminate trade talks, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose government paid for the ad campaign, said he would pull the ad after this weekend.

The ad is much shorter than Mr. Reagan's original address. It is edited, with certain passages presented out of order.

In Mr. Reagan's original speech, the late president defended imposing duties on Japan during a trade dispute over semiconductors. He alleged Japan was failing to enforce Japanese companies' violations of a trade agreement with the United States.

Watch the Government of Ontario's anti-tariff advertisement

But Mr. Reagan explained why tariffs are bad for the U.S. and hurt free trade, which is largely what the Ontario government quoted in its ad. 

However, Mr. Reagan also argued that his duties on Japan were justified “to stop unfair practices against American products,” while extolling the virtues of free trade overall.

The United States under Mr. Trump has imposed 35-per-cent tariffs on trade not covered by the United-States-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 

He has also imposed a number of sectoral tariffs that affect Canadian industry disproportionately, including a 50-per-cent levy on steel and aluminum and a 25-per-cent levy on automobiles.

Softwood lumber, too, has been hit hard. Canadian producers are facing levies totalling more than 45 per cent after the administration recently announced a new 10-per-cent tariff on lumber shipments into the U.S. on top of existing duties.

Last month, Mr. Trump set a date of Nov. 1 for imposing a 25-per-cent tariff on medium- and heavy-duty trucks, a measure previously announced along with tariffs on pharmaceuticals and furniture.

The Globe and Mail last week reported that Mr. Carney and Mr. Ford spoke to each other Thursday night and on Friday. The Prime Minister expressed his preference that the ad be pulled off the air.

This is at least the second time Mr. Trump has paused trade talks with Canada. 

In June, after Ottawa proceeded to enact a digital sales tax that would hit U.S. tech giants, the U.S. President broke off negotiations. He resumed them after Mr. Carney scrapped the tax.

Analysis: Trump's bizarre outrage over Ontario's anti-tariff ad is a symbol of his presidency

Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association in Canada, called the new 10-per-cent tariff the “latest in a series of unprovoked and unwarranted escalations in tariff policy with other sovereign nations.”

He said this will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers.

“Lost in the accountability loop here is the President's threat is really to charge American taxpayers billions of dollars because of a benign World Series ad he doesn't like.”

Former Alberta premier Jason Kenney, who also served in Stephen Harper's federal government, called Mr. Trump's reaction to the TV ad embarrassing.

“The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one minute ad,” Mr. Kenney said on X.

Mr. Carney underlined the fact that it's the Canadian government and nobody else, that conducts negotiations with the United States, an apparent reference to the fact the Ontario government, not Ottawa, produced the ad.

“The Government of Canada stands ready to build on the progress that we had been making in our negotiations, our discussions with our American counterparts, and we have a consistent focus in those discussions on doing the best deal for Canadian workers and their families,” he said. 

“It is the sole responsibility of the government of Canada to have those discussions with the United States, and it's the best way forward.”

Business Council of Canada president Goldy Hyder said Canada can't have premiers freelancing on the Canada-U.S. relationship.

“To have every sector, every province, every premier kind of weighing in on this. I don't see that behaviour in the United States,” Mr. Hyder said. “I don't see governor after governor on television,” he said. “You don't see that in Mexico.”

He acknowledged the Americans want to end the assembly of cars in Canada for the U.S. market, but said Canada has leverage. 

“We have cards to play – as the President likes to say – we have oil, we have gas, we have uranium, we have potash, we have critical minerals, and we need to play to our strengths and leverage those in a negotiation.”

Suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from Paris' Louvre museum, the Paris prosecutor said on Sunday, a week after the heist that stunned the world.

The prosecutor said that investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, adding that one of the men arrested was preparing to leave the country from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.

French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and arrested. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests and did not say whether any jewels had been recovered.

Thieves took less than eight minutes last Sunday morning to steal jewels valued at 88 million euros ($102 million) from the world's most-visited museum. French officials described how the intruders used a basket lift to scale the Louvre's façade, forced open a window, smashed display cases and fled. The museum's director called the incident a “terrible failure.”

Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. In her statement, she rued the premature leak of information, saying it could hinder the work of over 100 investigators “mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators.” Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends.

French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez praised “the investigators who have worked tirelessly, just as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.”

The Louvre reopened earlier this week after one of the highest-profile museum thefts of the century stunned the world with its audacity and scale.

The thieves slipped in and out, making off with some of France's crown jewels – a cultural wound that some compared to the burning of Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019.

The thieves escaped with a total of eight objects, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense.

They also took an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife, as well as a reliquary brooch. Empress Eugénie's diamond diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch – an imperial ensemble of rare craftsmanship – were also part of the loot.

One piece – Eugénie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds – was later found outside the museum, damaged but repairable.

News of the arrests was met with relief by Louvre visitors and passersby on Sunday.

“It's important for our heritage. A week later, it does feel a bit late, we wonder how this could even happen – but it was important that the guys were caught,” said Freddy Jacquemet.

“I think the main thing now is whether they can recover the jewels,” added Diana Ramirez. “That's what really matters.”

U.S. President Donald Trump at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Sunday. Officials from U.S. and China said the two countries have agreed on a trade framework, ahead of a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.Vincent Thian/The Associated Press

Top Chinese and U.S. economic officials agreed on the framework for a trade agreement on Sunday as U.S. President Donald Trump said he was confident of hashing out a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping when they meet in the coming days.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur for a fifth round of in-person discussions since May.

“I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,” Bessent told reporters.

Bessent told NBC's “Meet the Press” that he anticipated the agreement would defer China's expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets and avoid a new 100-per-cent U.S. tariff on Chinese goods threatened by Trump.

He said Trump and Xi would discuss soybean and agricultural purchases from American farmers, more balanced trade and resolving the U.S. fentanyl crisis, which was the basis of 20-per-cent U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.

China's Li said both sides had reached a “preliminary consensus” and will next go through their respective internal approval processes.

“The U.S. position has been tough,” Li said. “We have experienced very intense consultations and engaged in constructive exchanges in exploring solutions and arrangements to address these concerns.”

Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, his first stop in a five-day Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a face-to-face with Xi in South Korea on October 30.

After the talks, he struck a positive tone, saying: “I think we're going to have a deal with China”.

Both sides are looking to avert an escalation of their trade war after Trump threatened new 100-per-cent tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs starting on Nov. 1, in retaliation for China's expanded export controls on rare earth magnets and minerals.

Beijing and Washington rolled back most of their triple-digit tariffs on each other's goods under a trade truce, which is due to expire on Nov. 10.

The U.S. and Chinese officials said they discussed trade expansion, an extension of the truce, fentanyl, U.S. port entrance fees, rare earths, TikTok and more.

Li described the discussions as “candid”, while Bessent said they were “very substantial negotiations”.

Bessent said the truce could be extended, pending the president's decision, marking a second extension since it was first signed in May.

While the White House has officially announced the highly anticipated Trump-Xi talks, Beijing has yet to confirm that the two leaders will meet.

On the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit, Trump hinted at possible meetings with Xi in China and the United States.

“We've agreed to meet. We're going to meet them later in China, and we're going to meet in the U.S., in either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago,” he said.

Among Trump's talking points with Xi are Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, concerns around democratically-governed Taiwan which Beijing views as its own territory, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai.

The detention of the founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily has become the most high-profile example of China's crackdown on rights in Hong Kong.

Trump also said that he would seek China's help in Washington's dealings with Russia, as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds on.

Tensions between the world's two largest economies flared in the past few weeks as a delicate trade truce, reached after a first round of trade talks in Geneva in May and extended in August, failed to prevent the two sides from hitting each other with more sanctions, export curbs and threats of stronger retaliatory measures.

The latest round of talks has likely centred around China's expanded controls of rare earths exports that have caused a global shortage.

That has prompted the Trump administration to consider a block on software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, according to a Reuters report.

The German Police Union's call comes amid a debate over urban migration. Meanwhile, Munich is considering hosting the Olympics.

The German Police Union is urging the government to deploy more officers at railway stations and grant them wider powers to conduct checks, citing rising threats and declining public respect. 

The call follows Chancellor Friederich Merz's remarks linking urban safety concerns to failures in migration policy.

On Saturday, rallies were held in several German cities against the chancellor's remarks. 

Here are the latest headlines from Germany for the weekend of October 25–26:

Around 400,000 chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys have been culled at more than 30 commercial poultry farms following several outbreaks of avian influenza, Germany's animal health institute said on Sunday.

""We had similar figures in 2021, the strongest 'avian influenza year' to date. It is impossible to predict how the situation will develop, but the FLI [Friedrich Loeffler Institute] is expecting a further increase in outbreaks and cases,"" the institute's head, Christa Kühn said, adding: ""The situation remains highly dynamic.""

The northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and that of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, have seen the highest cull rates.

On Sunday, a district in Brandenburg announced that 130,000 more birds would be killed after bird flu cases were detected.  

There has also been preemptive culling of livestock in other states after the FLI confirmed cases of infection with the highly contagious H5N1 avian influenza virus.

Wild birds migrating to southern regions are seen as the main carriers of avian influenza, with cranes being affected this year more than usual.

This has been seen particularly in northwest Brandenburg, where they have been dying in large numbers during their normal stopover in the region on their way to France, Spain or North Africa.

Kühn said there was a low risk of infection for the general population but that those ""who come into contact with infected animals, such as the teams that clear affected poultry houses or collect dead wild birds, have a moderate risk of infection and therefore wear protective clothing."" 

The German Police Union (GdP) is calling for more federal officers at railway stations and wider powers to carry out checks, amid growing political debate over urban migration.

GdP chief Andreas Rosskopf, told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) editorial network that ""it is becoming increasingly dangerous, especially at the large railway stations in city centres, including for our colleagues. They are experiencing less and less respect and acceptance."" 

The call follows controversial remarks by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said migration policy failures have changed the face of German cities. Europeans are ""afraid to move around in public spaces"" due to migrants who do not obey the law, Merz said.

""More security at train stations also results in a better image of the city,"" Rosskopf said, referencing Merz's original remarks.

Federal police currently oversee borders, airports and train stations.

Rosskopf also called for police to be allowed to conduct random checks without suspicion.

The fallout continues after controversial remarks by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz over immigration.

The German Police Union is calling on the government to boost the police presence at railway stations and expand officers' powers there. 

While the union pointed to growing threats and a decline in public respect, it stopped short of directly linking the concerns to migration, though it did reference Merz's recent comments.

Meanwhile, in Munich, residents are weighing in on whether the city should launch a bid to host the Summer Olympics.

We'll be covering these stories and more from across Germany this Sunday.

We're pausing the blog now, but we'll be back with the latest news from Germany on Sunday. 

The two cooling towers at the former Gundremmingen nuclear power plant in southern Germany were demolished on Saturday.

The two 160-meter-high towers, consisting of a total of 56,000 metric tons of reinforced concrete, were brought down by controlled explosives.

As part of Germany's nuclear phaseout, the former Gundremmingen nuclear power plant was shut down at the end of 2021.

Since then, it has been undergoing decommissioning, which will continue into the 2030s.

Once decommissioning is completed, the operator RWE plans to use the site as a battery facility to store solar power. A photovoltaic plant and a new gas-fired power station are also planned.

According to a report in the Sunday newspaper Welt am Sonntag, ongoing challenges with the digitalization of the German Army's land forces could harm their operational readiness.

The digitalization program for land-based operations (D-LBO) is intended to link individual soldiers, vehicles, command vehicles, and mobile command posts through modern, secure digital networks.

Documents from the Defense Ministry and the Bundeswehr cited by the newspaper suggest that a proposed solution would preserve ""military operability"" but would require a ""temporary reduction in operational readiness.""

The Defense Ministry has repeatedly stated, in response to questions about radio system issues, that the project remains on schedule.

However, even after another test planned for November, the system will reportedly be suitable only ""for training and exercises,"" and not yet ready for combat use.

Profits at Porsche plunged by nearly 96% in the first nine months of 2025. The German carmaker attributed the decline to a change in strategy, shifting its focus back to combustion engines due to weak demand for electric vehicles.

Around 2,000 people braved the rain in Hamburg on Saturday to protest against Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comments on migration. 

Under the motto ""We are the cityscape!,"" demonstrators displayed slogans such as ""Standing together against racism and division"" and ""Merz out of our cityscape!"". 

The Left Party, Fridays for Future Hamburg, and smaller left-wing groups called for the demonstration.

The party accused Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of aligning its rhetoric with the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD).

""The CDU is going crazy — and with every new right-wing statement, Chancellor Merz is further ingratiating himself with the AfD,"" the Left Party said. 

The Hamburg AfD parliamentary group leader, Dirk Nockemann, had already criticized the call for the demonstration on Friday. 

He said: ""The professional outrage-mongers are once again taking to the streets for a fabricated reason. Yet everyone who walks through our cities with their eyes open knows: Since 2015, our country has become less safe, and many Hamburg streets are no-go areas in the evenings.""

According to a recent Politbarometer survey conducted by German public broadcaster ZDF, Merz is receiving predominantly positive feedback from the public for his latest statement.

63% of respondents agreed with the CDU chairman that there are problems in the urban landscape. 29% do not consider the statement justified.

Germany's poultry industry is calling for urgent action amid the rapid spread of bird flu.

The Poultry Industry Association of the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg is urging a nationwide mandate requiring free-range poultry to be kept in closed barns or coops to contain the highly contagious H5N1 virus.

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute reports that more than 200,000 birds have already been culled this fall, with cases rising sharply during the autumn migration. Migrating cranes, wild geese and ducks have been particularly affected.

Experts warn the outbreak could rival the severe wave of 2020, when more than 2 million birds were destroyed.

On Friday, Federal Agriculture Minister Alois Rainer said it was a ""top priority to prevent the spread of the virus, protect animals, and avert damage to our agriculture and food industry.""

He also mentioned ongoing talks with ministers from the federal states responsible for the issue.

Rainer's ministry has submitted a request to the European Union to raise the compensation limit for valuable animals that must be culled from €50 to up to €110 ($54 to $118).

Parties of both the center-right and the center-left are unintentionally strengthening far-right parties by repeating their ideas and rhetoric in a doomed attempt to shrink their support, according to a new study by the Berlin Social Science Center.

Chancellor Friederich Merz's recent remarks on Germany's ""cityscape"" are the latest example.

Read how the far-right are dragging the political center to their issues by clicking here. 

The number of deportations from Germany rose significantly in the first three quarters of 2025 compared to the same period last year.

Government figures obtained by the Left Party in the Bundestag show over 17,600 people were deported between January and September, compared with 4,706 in the same period in 2024.

Most people were sent to Turkey and Georgia.

Almost one in five deportees was under 18, and more than 300 were over 60.

Some opposition politicians have criticised the rise, warning of deportations to countries with poor human rights records. The government has not commented.

Demonstrations against Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent remarks on urban migration are expected to continue through the weekend.

During a visit to Potsdam last week, Merz spoke about his government's efforts to toughen migration policy. The primary aim, he said, was to continue combating what he called illegal immigration.

""But we still have this problem in our cityscape, of course, and that's why the federal interior minister is facilitating and carrying out large-scale deportations,"" he said.

The remark has drawn widespread criticism, including from members of his coalition government.

Merz, when asked by a journalist on Monday to clarify the comment, doubled down, saying, ""ask your daughters what I might have meant.""

On Wednesday, Merz clarified that he was referring to migrants without residence permits and jobs who do not comply with German laws.

In a survey commissioned by public broadcaster ZDF 63% of respondents said they agreed with the chancellor's statements, while 29% said they disagreed.

However, only 18% of respondents said refugees cause issues in their neighbourhood, with some 74% stating that they have not noted any significant problems or none at all.

Social Democrat and Deputy Chancellor Lars Klingbeil appeared to criticize Merz's choice of words in a speech to a trade union federation on Wednesday.

""I would like to live in a country in which politics builds bridges and brings society together, rather than dividing with language,"" Klingbeil said. ""And I will also say to you: I'd like to live in a country in which someone's appearance does not decide whether or not they fit in a city's image.""

Protests were planned on Saturday in Hamburg, Magdeburg and Nuremberg.

Several demonstrations have already occurred in recent days, with thousands taking part.

Guten Tag from DW's newsroom in Bonn and Danke schön for joining us to find out what Germany is talking about.

Migration is once again front and center this weekend, with several rallies planned in response to controversial comments made by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

His remarks have drawn sharp criticism, especially for appearing to imply that Germany's more diverse urban communities could be disproportionately affected by migrations.

That hasn't gone unnoticed. Many Germans have taken to the streets in protest, while others think Merz is simply speaking hard truths.

Some political observers believe this could be part of a broader strategy to counter the growing influence of the far right by taking a tougher stance on immigration.

A peace agreement, a royal visit, trade talks with China and Brazil, and a possible meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un — Donald Trump's five-day Asia tour has a lot going on. Stay with DW for the updates. 

This blog will bring you the latest news and analysis regarding Trump's trip to Asia on Sunday, October 26: 

The US has signed a number of deals on trade and critical minerals with four Southeast Asian partners as US President Donald Trump visits the region.

The flurry of signings comes as the US seeks, among other things, to diversify supply chains after China imposed tighter export curbs on rare earths.

In Kuala Lumpur, Trump signed reciprocal trade deals with Malaysian and Cambodian leaders and framework trade agreements with Thailand and Vietnam.

Among other things, Malaysia agreed to not ban or impose quotas on exports to the US of critical minerals or rare earth elements, the countries said, without specifying if that applied to raw or processed rare earths.

Malaysia had banned the export of raw rare earths to prevent the loss of resources, with an eye to the development of its downstream sector.

Meanwhile, Vietnam pledged to increase its purchase of US products to reduce a trade surplus that amounted to $123 billion (€106 billion) in 2024.

Under the deals, all four of the Southeast Asian countries agreed to remove trade barriers and give preferential market access to various US goods.

The deals also include agreements on digital trade, services and investments as well as promises by all four countries to protect labor rights and enhance environmental protections.

Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam also agreed to accept vehicles built to US motor vehicle safety and emissions standards, according to bilateral statements.

The US will maintain a tariff rate of 19% on most exports from Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia and 20% on Vietnam, the White House said, although those tariffs could be removed on certain products.

The region is one of the hardest-hit by the tariffs Trump has imposed on most countries since returning to the White House.

Trump nonetheless said the US intended ""to be a strong partner for many generations.""

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a productive meeting with US President Donald Trump at the ASEAN summit in Malaysia, according to Brazil's foreign minister.

Mauro Vieira said that Trump ordered the start of talks between the two countries. Brazil asked to pause tariffs during these discussions.

Trump increased tariffs on US imports of most Brazilian goods to 50% from 10% in early August, linking the move to what he called a ""witch hunt"" against the South American country's former President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro was convicted of attempting a coup in his country.

On Sunday,  in a push for leniency for Bolsonaro, he said he could reduce the tariffs. ""I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,"" he said.

Lula said he was optimistic relations between Brazil and the United States would advance.

Talks between top US and Chinese officials aimed at easing trade tensions have set the stage for a meeting between President
Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping, the US Treasury said.

China's top trade negotiator Li Chenggang and Vice Premier He Lifeng met US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on the sidelines of ASEAN summit.

""I would describe it as constructive, far-reaching, in-depth, and giving us the ability to move forward and set the stage for the leaders meeting in a very positive framework,"" Bessent said after two days of negotiations.

Bessent emphasized that any trade deals would be up to Trump and Xi, who are set to meet on Thursday. 

Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet signed an expansion of a ceasefire in the presence of US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

Trump helped broker the ceasefire to end their border conflict.

It builds on a truce reached three months ago after Trump called the then-leaders of the two countries.

He urged them to stop fighting or risk pausing their trade talks with the United States.

There were few details in the agreement on how it would be carried out, though it said the leaders agreed to establish an observer team made up of ASEAN member states ""with the objective of ensuring the full and effective implementation.""

Reporters are waiting in the room for the official peace pact between Cambodia and Thailand to be signed, that you can watch here.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the US and China were moving toward ""finalizing details"" as trade talks continued for a second consecutive day.

""I think we're moving forward to the final details of the type of agreement that the leaders can review and decide if they want to include together,"" Greer told reporters.

US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on Thursday in South Korea next week.



Meanwhile, China's top trade negotiator Li Chenggang and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng were in Malaysia meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

This is the second round of talks between parties, with a US Treasury spokesperson having told reporters Saturday the first day of talks was ""very constructive.""

A positive outcome would remove roadblocks for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

US President Donald Trump appeared to enjoy the welcome ceremony, with dancers and drummers, as he walked down the tarmac.

Trump was greeted by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim upon arrival, with the occasion marked by fanfare.

US President Donald Trump has just arrived in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia. Trump is expected to join a signing ceremony for the peace pact between Thailand and Cambodia.

The US president is scheduled to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before attending a working dinner of ASEAN leaders.

East Timor officially joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, on Sunday, becoming the regional bloc's 11th member.

The country will become the first new member to be inducted into ASEAN since the 1990s.

At a ceremony on Sunday, the flag of East Timor was added to the other 10 on stage at a formal ceremony in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.

Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao then told the other leaders that ""today, history is made."" ""For the people of Timor Leste this is not only a dream realized but a powerful affirmation,"" he said.

The little known Southeast Asian state is the poorest and the youngest country in the region, with integration of the country being hailed as a symbolic historic step for the bloc.

East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste was a Portuguese colony for over four centuries, before Indonesia's 1975 invasion.

The country achieved formal independence in 2000, after decades of struggle, following a UN-supervised referendum that overwhelmingly rejected continued integration with Indonesia. 

ASEAN membership provides East Timor, wedged between Indonesia and Australia, with access to the bloc's free trade deals, investment opportunities and a broader regional market. 

It is unusual for a US president to embark on an international trip during a government shutdown at home. But the talks with Asian allies build up to a meeting with China, the US' biggest economic rival. Why that matters:

Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is one of the leaders attending this year's ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur. 

DW takes a look at what Subianto has managed to do so far in his first year in office. 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced earlier this week that he will be joining the ASEAN summit to deliver an address virtually.

The Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim first broke the news, writing on social media that the Indian leader said Diwali celebrations were to continue in the country and he was not going to be able to attend the summit in person.

The news raised eyebrows since Modi has nearly always attended the summit in person since becoming prime minister in 2014.

And it comes as US President Donald Trump, who is attending this year's summit, escalates a trade war with India. Trump imposed additional tariffs in August on India, citing its continued purchases of cheap Russian oil.

US President Donald Trump posted to Truth Social that he will be meeting with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul when he lands in Malaysia, writing: 

""I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand. Sadly, the Queen Mother of Thailand has just passed away. I send my condolences to the Great People of Thailand. I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival. See you soon! President DJT""

Thailand was mourning thedeath of Queen Sirikit, who died late Friday, casting doubt over whether the Thai leader could go on to attend the regional summit.

Trump has pushed for Cambodia and Thailand to sign a peace agreement after having personally taken credit for resolving a deadly border conflict between the neighbors.

The White House earlier said that Trump would join a signing ceremony for a peace agreement between the countries, with Trump having clarified that he was keen to do so ""immediately upon arrival."" 

ASEAN foreign and economic ministers came together Saturday to lay the groundwork for the 47th summit that opens Sunday.

""As the international landscape becomes increasingly dominated by contestation rather than consensus, division rather than dialogue, ASEAN finds itself at a crossroads,"" Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts.

""Our space for neutrality and centrality is narrowing, particularly in areas such as trade, technology and regional security arrangement,"" he said. ""We must continue to act as the speakers and not the spoken for.""

ASEAN heads of state and government are set to gather to focus on regional security, economic resilience and maritime disputes.

The discussions take place as US tariffs and shifting global trade patterns loom large over discussions.

The meeting will then be followed by two days of high-level engagements with key partners, including China, Japan, India, Australia, Russia and South Korea. 

During his first term, Trump attended the annual  ASEAN summit just oncein 2017, in the Philippines.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A White Evangelical Christian man tried to save my soul. It didn't go as planned","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/us/white-evangelical-third-space-lessons-cec","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:00:03 GMT","


            On a balmy summer evening, I approached a brownstone apartment in a leafy Chicago suburb and made a split-second decision that would change the direction of my life.
    


            At the time I was a 20-year-old college sophomore, bursting with the zeal of a new Christian convert. I was carrying a thick leather Bible filled with underlined passages celebrating God's love for all humanity. I had memorized a New Testament passage, which declared, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave or free, male nor female — for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”
    


            I was there because I heard an evangelical church hosted a home Bible study every Wednesday night and, being new in town, I wanted to make friends.
    


            Then I peeked in the apartment's front bay window and saw something that made my heart sink. My finger froze over the doorbell, and I started to edge away from the door.
    


            “Damn,” I muttered to myself as I spied a group of casually dressed people sitting in the living room, chatting amiably with Bibles resting on their laps. “Nothing but White people.”
    


            I had never been in the home of a White person before. I had grown up in an inner-city Baltimore neighborhood where seeing White people was like spotting Bigfoot. My mother was White, but I had no contact with her family and had only recently met her for the first time. Her relatives shunned me because my father was Black, and they thought people of different races should stay apart. I dreaded being the only Black guy in the room and assumed that the White people inside would not make me feel welcome.
    


            But I also hated the thought of allowing fear to control me, so I rang the doorbell. A skinny, young White man with thinning blonde hair and a droopy mustache answered the door with a bright smile and a hearty “Welcome.” I walked inside and I found salvation — not in a deity or a biblical doctrine but in something else: an unexpected friendship.
    


            That story, which took place in the late 1980s, may sound like it comes from a bygone era. And in many ways, it does. Many Americans no longer see church as a place for healing. They see churches as places that hurt people by demonizing outsiders and covering up abuse. And, fair or not, White evangelical Christians are viewed by many as the group that inflicts the most pain.
    


            For many non-White Americans, immigrants and LGTBQ people, the term “White evangelical Christian” has become a synonym for intolerance. Many White evangelicals are hostile to non-White immigration and belong to denominations that condemn homosexuality. About 81% of White evangelicals voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They are also among the most ardent supporters of White Christian nationalism, a false teaching that claims the US was explicitly founded as a Christian nation.
    


            For more than 20 years as a journalist, I've written my share of critical stories about White evangelicals. But I told those stories while harboring a secret of sorts: White evangelicals helped save me and my family — not in a religious sense, but in ways I'm still digesting more than three decades after it happened.
    


            The young man who opened the door to the Chicago brownstone was the first person to show me that other side of White evangelicals. His name was Paul, and he was an illustrator from a small Midwestern town I've long forgotten. When we met I was attending Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, D.C., and was in Chicago for a summer internship.
    


            I probably would have never met him in another walk of life. But we hit it off quickly. We shared a love of comic books, and we were the same age, unlike many of the older people in the Bible study. Paul exuded gentleness and an approachability that I liked. He was not what I expected.
    


            Of course, he tried to convert me. He belonged to an evangelical movement which believed that all other Christian denominations and other religions were illegitimate. Evangelicals are loosely defined as Christians who often share a “born-again” personal conversion, believe they're supposed to spread their faith to others and take the Bible either literally or seriously.
    


            I never accepted Paul's narrow definition of faith, and he didn't push it hard. I sometimes even wonder if he believed it. It was what happened after Bible study that converted me.
    


            I was at an anxious time in my life. I had massive insecurities because I had grown up poor and spent much of my time in foster homes. Many of my childhood friends were headed to prison or strung out on drugs. I struggled to believe I had a future.
    


            Paul had this uncanny ability to sense my moods, and after Bible study he'd linger to chat. We talked about our hopes, our girlfriends and our anxieties over having a career. Our conversations would often end with Paul clasping my brown hands with his pale, freckled hands and saying, “Let's pray about it, brother.”
    


            This was a strange new world for me. I never expected I would express my vulnerability to a White man and hold his hands in prayer. But when I heard Paul pray aloud, asking God to guide me, I could tell he cared about me.
    


            Over time, I stopped seeing him as a racial category. He became simply Paul, my friend, the guy I hung out with. I soon joined his church and during worship, I'd see White, Black and brown church members hug, hang out after service, and date.
    


            I experienced something that summer that I still struggle to put into words. Paul was the first person to show me how good it felt to be proven wrong — to discover your assumptions about someone you've prejudged were baseless. I remember these lyrical moments in and outside of church settings, when I was singing hymns, praying and laughing with White evangelicals, that I felt a strange physical sensation. A tiny, warm glow would well up in my heart and spread through my body. It was that electric moment of human connection when you discover that someone you once saw as an enemy is now becoming your friend.
    


            I continued to experience those sensations in subsequent years as my career took me around the country. In Washington, Los Angeles and Atlanta, I made it a point to only join multiracial congregations. I befriended more White evangelicals who defied expectation. One was Peter, a computer nerd, who refused to move his wife and young daughter out of his Atlanta neighborhood though it had gone from White to virtually all-Black. He thought racial prejudice was a sin and that abandoning his new neighbors would betray his faith.
    


            Another friend was an evangelical pastor who grew up in the Jim Crow South believing that Black people were subhuman. But he was converted — by Black people. He joined a church ministry after high school that assigned him and a childhood buddy to an anti-poverty program in Harlem. There, he made friends with Black people for the first time.
    


            He eventually founded a multicultural church where White and non-White members not only shared pews, but the power to make decisions about the church's direction.
    


            My friend told me what changed him and his friend in Harlem were not deep conversations with Black people about politics or faith. Instead it was mundane activities, such as sharing meals.
    


            “That changed everything,” he told me. “It was just our daily life with African American people. They acted like regular people, which was shocking at first. That was the place where I crossed over.”
    


            These weren't “Kumbaya” relationships — we often disagreed, sometimes loudly, over politics and theology. But our friendships endured. And these friends didn't just change me; we changed one another.
    


            And then something else happened that I never expected: I was swept up in a religious movement that gave me even more hope.
    


            It was called the “racial reconciliation movement,” and it spread throughout the White evangelical community in the 1990s. I joined evangelical churches that participated in this movement during much of my young adulthood, and I attended rallies arranged by the “Promise Keepers,” an evangelical men's movement designed to foster racial healing.
    


            I still remember standing in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta next to weeping White men as they raised their hands together with Black and brown men and sang and prayed. And I remember watching in awe as C-Span televised images of at least 600,000 evangelical men filling the Washington Mall in 1997 for the “Stand in the Gap” rally.
    


            I was a religion reporter in 1995 when I watched the nation's largest evangelical denomination — the Southern Baptist Convention, which was formed in the mid-19th century to defend slavery — publicly apologize for its historic defense of slavery and racial segregation.
    


            These were mountaintop moments. It seemed like the nation was finally shedding its original sin, racism. We were living up to our national creed, “Out of Many, One.” We were becoming the mythical America that the poet Langston Hughes described as “the land that never has been yet - And yet must be.”
    


            Joining the racial reconciliation movement helped prepare me for something even more dramatic: Not long after, the White relatives who had rejected me at birth began to contact me.  What followed were years of confrontations and anger. My White relatives were capable of acts of raw racism. But by now I had practice reaching across racial divides, and we somehow found a way to become a genuine family.
    


            How that happened is complex, but it culminated with my maternal grandfather — the same man who refused to contact me when I was a child and referred to my father as “that n*gger”— apologizing to me for his racism in an astonishing act of repentance that still boggles my mind. And my mother's sister — a person who once believed interracial marriage was bad for both White and Black people and who voted for President Trump — ended up supporting Black Lives Matter.
    


            What made this family reconnection possible? There were many reasons, but Paul, the skinny illustrator I met in Chicago, played a pivotal role. Through those Bible studies and other experiences with White evangelicals, I had acquired the patience and the spiritual tools I needed to forge bonds with people who were different.
    


            My White relatives were, despite their blind spot on race, devout Roman Catholics. We shared the same language of grace and quoted the same scripture about forgiveness: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Our mutual faith became a bridge to one another, not a barrier.
    


            Only now do I realize there was another vital factor that led to my conversion on both race and faith. And it had nothing to do with religion. It's called a “third space.”



            A third space is a location where people spend time together in community away from their first and second places: home and work. The term was coined by the late sociologist Ray Oldenburg to describe those areas where we forge relationships with people unlike ourselves.
    


            My third space was a church, but the same dynamics could happen in a mosque, synagogue or in other third-space communities, such as a 12-step program, a jazz band or a softball league.
    


            Third spaces furnish the connective tissue that hold a multifaith and multiethnic democracy together, Oldenburg said.
    


            “There must be places in which people can find and sort one another out across the barriers of social difference,” he said. “There must be places akin to the colonial tavern visited by Alexander Hamilton, which offered, as he recorded, ‘a genuine social solvent with a very mixed company of different nations and religions.'”
    


            But third spaces, like the colonial tavern, are disappearing from America. Churches are emptying out across the country, despite an uptick in membership in recent years.  On Sunday mornings I often drive by grand churches with nearly empty parking lots. My congregation is full of gray-haired members (including me), and I want to do a cartwheel whenever I see a young person visit.
    


            This retreat from church mirrors a larger retrenching. Americans are isolating themselves into digital cocoons. Participation in civic groups has plummeted; movie theaters are closing; people increasingly shop online instead of going to stores. Many of us interact more with smartphones and social media than we do with other human beings.
    


            When I walk through my neighborhood at night I see deserted streets, empty front porches and blue glows from televisions flickering on bedroom walls. We can now curate our daily lives like our streaming video queues — we only expose ourselves to ideas and people we're comfortable with.
    


            Something else is disappearing: the hopefulness I felt in many of the White evangelical churches I attended as a young man. The racial reconciliation movement has been obliterated. Promise Keepers collapsed and has been rebooted as a partisan battering ram. Many non-White people abandoned White evangelical churches after the George Floyd racial reckoning.
    


            The most toxic phrase one can use today when talking about racial justice is not critical race theory, DEI or reparations. Its “racial reconciliation” — a term dismissed by both the left and the right as an absurd fantasy. I once had a White editor tell me after reading an essay I wrote about reconnecting with my White relatives, “This story isn't angry enough.”
    


            The reasons behind why so many White evangelicals abandoned racial reconciliation is complex, but my quick take is this: Some were terrified of becoming a racial and a religious minority in a rapidly changing nation, so they acted out of fear instead of faith.
    


            I've seen this shift up close. When Black membership at a White evangelical church I attended in Atlanta passed the 50% threshold, White members fled the church so quickly that they practically left skid marks in the pews. The church became all-Black within about five years, save for the White senior pastor and his family.
    


            This shift has forced me to ask a painful question: Was I a fool for trusting White evangelicals? Did all the public prayers, the bro-hugs and the hymns we sang together mean nothing? Do most evangelicals worship Whiteness instead of Jesus?
    


            Did I walk through a door in Chicago that summer that's now closed?
    


            I'd ask Paul these questions today if I could find him. The evangelical church in Chicago I joined is still going strong. I recently checked its website, and its membership and leadership appear even more diverse today. But I lost contact with Paul after we both graduated from college. It took me years to appreciate his friendship and what it did for me, and I didn't have the words to tell him that at the time. I didn't even bother to get his last name.
    


            I sometimes wonder where Paul is now. Is he still opening doors to the stranger?
    


            I'm also left with some other difficult questions. Will I ever experience the “warm, tiny glow” I first felt in that Chicago Bible study and at those Promise Keepers rallies? Will I ever feel that hopeful again?
    


            And as I read today's headlines, which warn of a potential civil war as American soldiers and masked ICE officers sweep through American cities, I also wonder this:
    


            Will any of us ever feel that way again?
    


            —–

            British police have arrested an asylum-seeker who was mistakenly released from prison on Friday while serving a 12-month sentence for sexual assault following a “fast-moving and complex” manhunt.
    


            Ethiopian national Hadush Kebatu was jailed in September for the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl while staying at the Bell Hotel in Epping, England – a hotel just outside of London used by the government to help house asylum seekers.
    


            “Hadush Kebatu, who was released in error from HMP Chelmsford on Friday morning, has been arrested,” London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement Sunday.
    


            He was arrested by officers in the Finsbury Park area of London at around 8:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET), police said.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that Kebatu will be deported from the UK following his arrest and vowed to make sure “this doesn't happen again.”
    


How British hotels became a flashpoint for a furious immigration debate



            Kebatu's case fuelled a wave of anti-migrant demonstrations across the country in August, with some holding protests outside the Bell Hotel – fueled by those on the far-right – which turned violent.
    


            On Friday, Essex Police said it was informed by the UK's prison service at 12:57 p.m. local time (7:57 a.m. ET) of an “error” surrounding the release of an individual.
    


            Police quickly launched a manhunt for Kebatu, with British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy also announcing an “urgent investigation” into the mistaken release.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — On the northern bank of Argentina's Riachuelo River, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since libertarian President Javier Milei scrapped import restrictions.

Streets in the Puerto Madero financial district in Buenos Aires bustle with bankers who praise Milei for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve sushi and steak to Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.

On the opposite side of the polluted Riachuelo waterway, Veronica Leguizamon, 34, has only a few eggs, a carton of milk and a handful of bread rolls left in her pantry.

Clutching a Tupperware container, she braved heavy rain last Friday to carry home dinner for her four daughters from a soup kitchen in her neighborhood of Isla Maciel — a daily routine since Milei slashed subsidies for public services and unwound price controls on staple foods.

“It's not like we used to have so many luxuries, but before we could choose a meal,” she said. “Now we have to depend on others to know if we'll eat or not.” 

The contrasting fortunes of these Buenos Aires neighborhoods just over a kilometer apart illustrate the tensions polarizing the Argentine electorate in Sunday's nationwide congressional midterms.

As millions of voters headed to the polls Sunday, their vastly different perceptions of the economy stand to determine whether Milei succeeds — and whether the Trump administration presses on with a financial rescue plan for its cash-strapped ideological ally. 

“Within my little circle, everyone's happy with how things are going,” said Fernanda Díaz, 42, who runs a yacht rental company in Puerto Madero. “When I step outside it, I see people worried about making it to the end of the month.” 

Commenting on the midterm elections, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to rescind a $20 billion aid package for Argentina if Milei suffers a defeat at the hands of a “socialist or communist.”

Trump was apparently referring to Argentina's loosely populist movement known as Peronism that helped deliver the economic shambles that Milei inherited in late 2023. 

Reckless public spending under a succession of Peronist governments — including that of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, now serving house arrest for corruption — brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults.

“We needed a major change,” said Díaz, who, before launching her yacht business, lost her job as a top executive when Chilean retail group Falabella shut down its Argentine operations over high inflation, import restrictions and a wildly oscillating exchange rate under the previous Peronist government. “I voted for Milei's government and was really enthusiastic at first.”

Markets shudder at the thought of a Peronist return.

When the Peronist coalition beat Milei's libertarian party by a landslide in last month's Buenos Aires provincial elections, investors panicked that the president's free-market overhaul was losing support and rushed to pull capital out of the country. 

In an extremely rare move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue — selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks, signing a $20 billion credit line and promising another $20 billion in aid from private banks, rather than U.S. taxpayers. Assets jumped on each of the Trump administration's announcements. 

Having dodged a currency crisis, Milei and his supporters were, briefly, ebullient. 

“I'm proud of the U.S. support. It helps us grow stronger,” said Luciano Naredo, 28, a high-end car salesperson in Puerto Madero. “I think Argentina is finally taking its rightful place in the world.”

But Trump's warning that the U.S. could pull assistance unnerved markets. Investors are hedging against more turbulence.

Although Isla Maciel has long been a Peronist stronghold, 42% of the wider Avellaneda municipality voted for Milei as president in 2023, betting on the wild-haired political outsider to stabilize the economy and end triple-digit inflation.

Wielding a diesel-fume-spewing chain saw at rallies, Milei cut tens of thousands of government jobs, slashed state spending and burned through foreign exchange reserves to shore up a chronically depreciating peso.

Inflation dropped — in fulfillment of Milei's flagship campaign promise.

But almost two years into his economic overhaul, purchasing power has dropped, too. With inflation still hovering around 32% annually, residents of Isla Maciel have watched the value of their wages, pensions and welfare payments shrivel. 

“You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,” Epifanía Contreras, 64, said as she packed her plastic bowl with rice and peas at the Foundation of Isla Maciel soup kitchen, referring to her $200 monthly pension. “The situation is getting worse and worse. It's not fair.” 

Volunteers serving sopa paraguaya, a custardy cornbread, to a stream of regulars on Friday said demand has more than doubled in the past year. Those who once picked up occasional meals when tight on cash now turn up hungry. 

“People are coming out of real need,” said Maria Gomez, a volunteer cook. ”It's chaos.”

A third fewer residents of the Avellaneda municipality supported Milei's libertarian party in last month's provincial election than in 2023, expressing nostalgia for the redistributive policies of the opposition Peronist party despite its more recent reputation for financial ruin.

Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, said Argentina faced a “critical election in the midst of a complex economic climate” as he cast his ballot in the city of La Plata.

“Where is this resolved, or where does it begin to be resolved?” he asked of the nation's economic troubles. “At the ballot box.”

Milei has vowed in campaign speeches to press on with his harsh austerity program. But his chain saw prop, once a rally staple, hasn't been trotted out in months. 

Voting on Sunday in Buenos Aires' middle-class Almagro district with his sister under heavy security, Milei shook hands with supporters who shouted, “Go president!” and left without making statements to the press.

Most polls predict a tight race between Milei's La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances) party and the Peronist Fuerza Patria coalition. Half of Argentina's lower house, or 127 seats, and a third of the Senate, or 24 seats, are up for grabs.

Currently controlling less than 15% of Congress, Milei's government hopes to win enough seats to defend its austerity measures, uphold presidential vetoes and impose labor and tax reforms.

The stakes are high. A defeat for Milei could pile more pressure on the peso and force a painful devaluation of the currency's controlled exchange rate, raising inflation and undermining the president's main achievement. 

Weary Argentines are bracing for impact.

“Each new government comes in, criticizes the last one, promises to do things differently and ends up being the same or worse,” said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate. “This country moves in cycles.”

Soon after he stepped out of the plane, U.S. President Trump displayed his signature dance moves to Malaysian performers on Sunday. He arrived in Malaysia to attend the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.

President Donald Trump is heading for Asia for the first time this term, a trip where he is expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to de-escalate a trade war.

About 200 protesters gathered in a anti-trump protest co-organized by multiple groups, NGOs and civil society as the U.S. president attended the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hosted in Kuala Lumpur.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A trade deal between the United States and China is drawing closer, officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday as they reached an initial consensus for President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to aim to finalize during their high-stakes meeting.

Any agreement would be a relief to international markets even it does not address underlying issues involving manufacturing imbalances and access to state-of-the-art computer chips.

Beijing recently limited exports of rare earth elements that are needed for advanced technologies, and Trump responded by threatening additional tariffs on Chinese products. The prospect of a widening conflict risked weakening economic growth worldwide.

China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters that the two sides had reached a “preliminary consensus,” while Trump's treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was “a very successful framework.”

Trump also expressed confidence that an agreement was at hand, saying the Chinese “want to make a deal and we want to make a deal.” The Republican president is set to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia. Trump reiterated that he plans to visit China in the future and suggested that Xi could come to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Florida.

Bessent told CBS' “Face the Nation” that the threat of additional higher tariffs on China was “effectively off the table.” In interviews on several American news shows, he said discussions with China yielded initial agreements to stop the precursor chemicals for fentanyl from coming into the U.S., and that Beijing would make “substantial” purchases of soybean and other agricultural products while putting off export controls on rare earths.

The progress toward a potential agreement came during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in Kuala Lumpur, with Trump seeking to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker. 

Yet his way of pursuing deals has meant serious disruptions at home and abroad. His import taxes have scrambled relationships with trading partners while a U.S. government shutdown has him feuding with Democrats.

At the summit, Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement during a ceremony attended by Trump. His threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year. 

Thailand will release Cambodian prisoners and Cambodia will begin withdrawing heavy artillery as part of the first phase of the deal. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart.

“We did something that a lot of people said couldn't be done,” Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a “historic day,” and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates “the building blocks for a lasting peace.”

The president signed economic frameworks with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The United States wants to rely less on China, which has used limited on exports of key components in technology manufacturing as a bargaining chip in trade talks. 

“It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said.

Trump attended this summit only once during his first term, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January. 

This year's event was a chance for Trump to reengage with nations that have a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people. 

“The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,” Trump said. He described his counterparts as “spectacular leaders” and said that “everything you touch turns to gold.”

Trump's tariff threats were credited with helping spur negotiations Thailand and Cambodia. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people.

The president threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped. A shaky truce has persisted since then.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, saying at the summit that “it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.”

Trump met Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Kuala Lumpur, who was also attending the summit. There has been friction between them over Brazil's prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, the country's former president and a close Trump ally. Bolsonaro was convicted last month of attempting to overturn election results in his country.

During their meeting, Trump said he could reduce tariffs on Brazil that he enacted in a push for leniency for Bolsonaro.

“I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,” he said. 

While Trump was warming to Lula, he avoided Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The president is angry with Canada because of a television advertisement protesting his trade policies, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would raise tariffs on Canada because of it.

One leader absent from the summit was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during Trump's first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.

ROME (AP) — The man who just took charge of Rome's top tourist attraction wants to set the record straight: the Colosseum won't be hosting any electronic dance music parties on his watch.

Simone Quilici, director of the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, shared his plan to bring concerts to the almost 2,000-year-old amphitheater in an interview with an Italian newspaper earlier this month, and social media proceeded to do what it all too often does. “Massive raves” were imminent, multiple accounts trumpeted alongside AI-generated images of multicolor light beams shooting from the arena into the heavens.

Quilici told The Associated Press that he heard complaints from archaeologists and ordinary Romans, dismayed their cultural heritage could be so desecrated. Even electronic music fans expressed concern online about the damage a whomping bass beat would inflict on an ancient structure that continues yielding new wonders, like the emperor's secret passage that opens on Oct. 27.

Concerts must respect the Colosseum as a “sacred space,” Quilici said, as it is integral to Roman identity and has become imbued with religious significance. Today, it is the site of the Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession during Easter, traditionally presided over by the pope.

“The music must be carefully controlled. I mentioned certain artists — not by accident — who haven't been ‘rock' for some time, who play calm music and attract a calm audience, because the important thing is that it's not a wild crowd,” Quilici, 55, said Friday in his first interview with foreign media since taking over on Oct. 20. “I joked about rock in moderation — that's what I meant, a more subdued kind of music. But it was reported the opposite of what I said.”

Concerts could be acoustic or jazz, he said, offering Sting as an example. The amphitheater could host poetry readings, dance performances and theater productions once the existing small platform is expanded. Also in the plans: historical reenactments of gladiatorial battles rooted in academic research.

“There are people who are extremely knowledgeable about daily life in past eras, with a remarkable level of scientific accuracy. So these activities are very welcome within the Colosseum park,” Quilici said. He stressed such presentations would be the antithesis of the shabbily costumed centurions who besiege the Colosseum by night, posing for photos with tourists and then harassing them for payment.

The Colosseum's first concerts and performances will take place in no less than two years, he added. 

Only a handful of concerts have taken place within the Colosseum over the years, including Ray Charles in 2002, Paul McCartney in 2003 and Andrea Bocelli in 2009. All were billed as special events and audience numbers were severely restricted.

“Unfortunately, as everyone knows, tourism is a commercial activity — an industry that does not always connect with culture,” he said on the Colosseum's uppermost balcony. “Bringing cultural activities into the mix would enrich this place, making it not only a site to visit, but also a place where one can experience and enjoy artistic events.”

Peering down into the arena's ruins from high above, the bustle of tourists brings to mind the cross-section of an anthill. The Colosseum had almost 9 million visitors last year, up from 7 million the year before, according to data provided by the park. 

Even in October, well outside the high tourist season of summer, the place was packed. 

That's partly due to the Vatican's Jubilee year, held once every quarter-century, which continues to draw large tour groups of pilgrims. It's also because the Colosseum is one of just two must-see spots for short-staying tourists, along with Vatican City, and “already is at maximum capacity,” Quilici said.

Therein lies the other great ambition for his tenure: inducing tourists to go elsewhere. 

The park he oversees includes not just the Colosseum, but also other sites directly adjacent like the Roman Forum, which was the heart of the ancient city's society, and Palatine Hill, where Rome was founded and the emperor's palace is located.

Tickets lasting 24 hours include all three destinations. Still, one-third of buyers visit only the Colosseum, according to park data. If Rome's an open-air museum, as is often said, that's like catching a glimpse of Leonardo da Vinci's “Mona Lisa” through the crowd at the Louvre, then leaving without even looking at the other masterpieces in the room.

“Last year, tourists in Rome didn't stay just two and a half days; their visits increased to four days. So there's also the opportunity to use the Colosseum as a starting point for exploring less-visited places,” he said.

Likewise, relatively few visitors go to the nearby Circus Maximus, the sprawling grounds of Rome's high-adrenaline chariot races, depicted in the 1959 film “Ben-Hur.” The Appian Way, known as “the queen of roads,” goes even more overlooked, despite becoming a UNESCO world heritage site last year. Its giant paving stones provide passage into a golden countryside that evokes long-gone centuries and provides welcome respite from Rome's tourist-thronged center. 

Both the Circus Maximus and the Appian Park, which Quilici administered before the Colosseum, are free to visit. 

All these sites and more are near to one another, though somewhat disjointed – archaeological islands mostly separated by busy roads. Quilici hopes to create new access points to his park as well as connections with others to better manage the crowds and establish one consolidated area for exploration and discovery. 

“It's a collective effort, one that requires cooperation from all the different administrations,” he said. “However, it's more a matter of management than of infrastructure costs. Choices that sometimes can be simple decisions like limiting traffic — not necessarily involving major expenses, but rather a courageous choice to restore life to the heart of the city of Rome.”

LONDON (AP) — London police said Sunday they arrested a convicted sex offender and asylum-seeker who was mistakenly released from prison in a blunder that has embarrassed the government.

The Metropolitan Police said Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area in north London. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would be deported as soon as possible.

Before he was released in error, Kebatu had already been in the national news because his arrest earlier this year over the sexual assault of a teenage girl triggered a wave of angry anti-migrant protests in London and other cities.

Authorities said they were alerted Friday afternoon that Kebatu was released by mistake at a prison in Chelmsford, Essex, and was seen catching a London-bound train there. British media reported that he was wrongly categorized as a prisoner due to be released, instead of being sent to an immigration detention center.

The migrant was sentenced in September to 12 months in prison for five offenses, including the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in July in Epping, on the outskirts of London, just over a week after he had arrived in England by boat.

Thousands of people protested outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, northeast of London, where he was staying along with other newly arrived migrants. Multiple protests targeting other hotels housing migrants followed in British cities and towns, with some demonstrations attended by far-right activists and spilling into disorder.




The group Stand Up to Racism also rallied in counterprotests.

The Prison Service said prison officer has been removed from discharging duties while an investigation takes place.

Government officials have described the mistaken release as an “egregious failure.” Justice Secretary David Lammy said he ordered prisoner release checks to be strengthened immediately, and an investigation will find out what went wrong and who was accountable.

“This man was behind bars because of serious sex offenses,” Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Sky News Sunday before Kebatu's arrest. “He is not meant to be in this country. In fact, what was supposed to be happening is he was meant to be transferred for deportation. So the idea that he's loose on our streets is incredibly serious. It is a serious failure.”

The issue of unauthorized migration — especially the tens of thousands of migrants crossing the English Channel in overloaded boats to reach the U.K. — has risen to the top of the political agenda in Britain. 

More than 36,900 people have made the dangerous crossing from France to the U.K. so far this year, figures show, surpassing the total number recorded in the whole of 2024. Efforts by authorities in Britain, France and other countries to crack down on people smuggling gangs or deter migrants from coming have so far been unsuccessful.

The government's policy of using hotels to house migrants who are awaiting a decision on their asylum status has also come under heavy criticism.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Thousands of pilgrims turned out Sunday in Romania's capital for the consecration of religious paintings inside the world's largest Christian Orthodox church that was being opened after 15 years of construction. 

Worshippers and officials arrived in droves at the People's Salvation Cathedral, known as the National Cathedral, which at its highest point stands more than 125 meters (410 feet) and has an inner capacity for 5,000 worshippers in the deeply Orthodox country. The cathedral's opulent interior is covered with frescoes and mosaics depicting saints and icons.

Proposals for a national cathedral in the country of about 19 million people had been put forward for more than a century, but its fruition was hampered by two world wars and the decades of communist rule, which sought to suppress religion. The Romanian Orthodox Church has called the cathedral “a symbol of national identity.”

Romania is one of the most pious countries in the European Union, with around 85% of the population identifying as religious. 

Situated behind the hulking Palace of the People built by the late communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, construction for the cathedral finally began in 2010, and its altar was consecrated in 2018. It has so far cost a reported 270 million euros ($313 million), with a majority drawn from public funds, and some works are yet to be completed.

Traffic was restricted for Sunday's service, which was attended by President Nicusor Dan and Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan. Many worshippers watched via TV screens set up outside the cathedral.




The cathedral's mosaics and iconography cover an area of 17,800 square meters (191,000 square feet), according the cathedral's website. 

Daniel Codrescu, who has spent seven years working on the frescoes and mosaics, told The Associated Press that much of the iconography has been inspired by medieval Romanian paintings and others from the Byzantine world.

“It was a complex collaboration with the church, with art historians, with artists, also our friends of contemporary art,” he said. “I hope (the church) is going to have a very important impact on society because … it's a public space.”

With one of the largest budget deficits in the EU, not everyone in Romania was happy about the cost of the project. Critics bemoan that the massive church has drawn on public funds, which could have been spent on schools or hospitals.

Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, said the project was a “waste of public money” but said it could offer a “boost to national pride and identity” for some Romanians.

“The fact that they have forced, year after year, politicians to pay for it, in some cases taking money from communities that really needed that money, indicates it was a show of force, not one of humility and love of God,” he said. “Economically, it might be OK in the long term as it will be a tourist attraction.”

Rares Ghiorghies, 37, supports the church but said the money would be better spent on health and education as “a matter of good governance.” 

“The big problem in society is that most of those who criticize do not follow the activities of the church,” he said.

David Beckham waved to his fans while walking the green carpet at the Earthshot Prize Awards in Boston on Friday.

Victoria Beckham was nearly forced to shut down her namesake fashion brand after falling victim to irresponsible spending that left her company ""tens of millions in the red.""

In Netflix's new documentary, titled ""Victoria Beckham,"" the former Spice Girl — who, throughout the three-part series, gave viewers a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to prepare for a show at Paris Fashion Week — got candid about leaning on her husband, David Beckham, for financial assistance in the early years of her company's launch and detailed the ""mind-blowing"" decisions that nearly cost her her brand.

""This business is everything to me. It's absolutely who I am. But it's been a hell of a journey,"" she said in the documentary. ""I almost lost everything, and that was a dark, dark time. I used to cry before I went to work every day because I felt like a firefighter. We were tens of millions in the red.""

""Yes, I'm going home to my husband, but I'm going home to my business partner as well. And so I would talk to him about it. I had to. He was invested. And I hated it. I absolutely hated it.""

David said they both looked at their investments within the company, and came to the conclusion that something had to change.

""We both sat there and we looked at what I'd invested, and I think part of that conversation broke my heart because Victoria is a proud woman,"" David said.

""When we met, she was a lot richer than me. She actually bought our first house in Hertfordshire, known as Beckingham Palace,"" he added. ""So for her to have to come to me and say, ‘Can I have some — we need some more money. The business needs more money,' that was hard for both of us because I didn't have the money to keep doing this, and eventually I was like, ‘This cannot continue.'""

Victoria said the ""entire house was crashing down.""

""I was losing my business. I needed outside investment. I needed someone to help me,"" she said.

The former pop star eventually connected with outside investor David Belhassen, who claimed the state of the company was a ""disaster"" at the time.

VICTORIA BECKHAM ADMITS SHE BECAME 'VERY GOOD AT LYING' AS FAME TOOK TOLL ON HER HEALTH

""I had never seen something as hard as that to fix,"" he said.

""For years, she had people telling her what she wanted to hear. I remember one of the expenses was the office plants. She loved plants,"" Belhassen said. ""And it was costing her £70,000 a year. And then there was someone who was coming to water the plants for £15,000 a year – and that's only the beginning. So I went to her and I decided to just tell the truth, exactly the way it is, and I didn't know how she'd react.""

""I said, 'Victoria, we have to change everything, restructure the business, and that's going to be painful,' and when I finished she just listened, and she left a little silence,"" he recalled.

Victoria admitted it was difficult to hear the truth.

""I hadn't been to business school, I'd come from an entertainment background… I didn't realize it at the time, but the waste was mind-blowing. I mean, I had 15 different linings for the insides of the outerwear. People thought that I was used to getting the best… bizarre things like flying chairs from one side of the world to the other.""

""I hear it now and I'm horrified, but I allowed that to happen,"" she said. ""I think part of the problem was people were really afraid to tell me no. There's a power to be honest, the power of celebrity. People thought I wasn't used to hearing no.""

""I needed to put Victoria Beckham into Victoria Beckham,"" she said.

And that, she did.

Elsewhere in the documentary, Victoria also opened up about one of the toughest challenges she's faced — her past eating disorder.

""People felt it was OK to criticize a woman for her weight, for what she's doing, for what she's wearing,"" David said in the documentary. ""There were a lot of things happening in TV then that won't happen now. That can't happen now.""

""My Victoria that I knew, sits at home in a tracksuit, smiling, laughing, having a glass of wine. That started to go purely because of the criticism that she was getting,"" he added.

While recalling a 1999 incident in which a TV host asked her to step on a scale on live television to confirm her weight was ""back to normal"" six months after giving birth to her first child, Victoria admitted the whole ordeal affected her deeply.

""I was weighed on national television when Brooklyn was 6 months old,"" she said in the documentary. ""Get on those scales on television. Have you lost weight? And we laugh about it, and we joke about it when we're on television, but I was really, really young and that hurt.""

During the live television segment in question, ""Don't Forget Your Toothbrush,"" host Chris Evans said, ""A lot of girls want to know, because you look fantastic again, how did you get back to your shape after birth?""

VICTORIA BECKHAM DEFENDS 'VERY TRADITIONAL' APPROACH TO RAISING CHILDREN AMID FAMILY RIFT RUMORS

After Victoria detailed her exercise regime, Evans asked Victoria, ""Is your weight back to normal? Can I check? Do you mind?""

That experience alone left Victoria feeling as if she wasn't enough.

""I really started to doubt myself and not like myself,"" she said in the doc. ""And because I let it affect me, I didn't know what I saw when I looked in the mirror. You lose all sense of reality. I'm just very critical of myself. I didn't like what I saw.""

""I've been everything from Porky Posh to Skinny Posh,"" she continued. ""I mean, it's been a lot. And that's hard. I had no control over what was being written about me, pictures that were being taken. And I suppose I wanted to control that. I could control it with the clothing and I could control my weight, and I was controlling it in an incredibly unhealthy way.""

""When you have an eating disorder, you become very good at lying,"" she added. ""And I was never honest about it with my parents. I never talked about it publicly. It really affects you when you are being told constantly you're not good enough. And I suppose that's been with me my whole life.""

At one point, the businesswoman broke down in tears to David as they discussed her reasoning behind all that she does.

""But who are you trying to prove this to?"" David asked.

""Maybe a lot of it to you,"" said Victoria, who admittedly accepted financial aid from David while establishing her brand in the early years. ""I feel bad about all that times when I had to ask you to help me out.""

""You don't have to prove it to me ever,"" he said, to which Victoria responded, ""No, but I want to, myself. I want to. When I saw your face and the kids' faces backstage after the last show, it was not the first time, but it was a real moment for me where I could see how proud of me you were. I've still got so much that I want to do.""

""I think you're trying to prove it to yourself,"" said David. ""Not to me. Maybe you're so stubborn in the fact that you are trying to prove everybody wrong.""

""Yeah, success. It feels good. I'm not going to lie,"" she said. ""I am proud, and I'm not ashamed to say that I'm ambitious, and I've still got a lot that I want to do.""

""So you're not stopping yet?"" David asked.

""I'm not stopping yet,"" she quipped.

Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Lamar Jackson's 1-6 record against the Kansas City Chiefs, and Caleb Williams' comeback road win against the Las Vegas Raiders. 

The NFL is investigating how the Baltimore Ravens handled superstar quarterback Lamar Jackson's injury designation before Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears.

Jackson, who has been battling a hamstring injury, was expected to return to the Ravens' offense this week coming off their bye. However, the two-time league MVP was ruled out against the Bears prior to Sunday's 1 p.m. start. He was a full participant in Friday's practice, which signaled that he would play Sunday. But on Saturday, he was ruled out.

The Ravens could be subject to league discipline if they are found to have violated the league's injury report policy.

""The league will look into this,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told ESPN on Saturday. ""The league reviews any matter involving a change to a player's status.""

The Ravens released their own statement on the matter, saying they contacted the league office before making the call on Jackson.

RAVENS STAR KYLE HAMILTON FEELS TEAM CAN STILL WRITE 'GREAT STORY' DESPITE 1-5 START TO SEASON

""Upon further evaluation today and after conferring with the league office, because Lamar didn't take any starter reps in practice, we updated our report to reflect his practice participation,"" the statement read.

ESPN added that, while Jackson was considered a full participant on Friday, he was running with the scout team while Tyler ""Snoop"" Huntley was running with the starting offense.

Huntley was set to start on Sunday over Cooper Rush, who was the starter for the Ravens since Jackson went down. He was, however, benched during the blowout loss to the Los Angeles Rams prior to the bye week for Huntley, as he struggled to get the offense going.

Jackson's injury couldn't come at a worse time for the Ravens, as they sit at 1-5 in what has been one of the most shocking developments for a Super Bowl hopeful this season.

It's no secret how much of a loss Jackson is due to his play-making abilities. Safety Kyle Hamilton recently gave Fox News Digital an optimistic outlook for the Ravens, who need to put together a win streak if they wish to make the playoffs. But he knows how much Jackson factors into those hopes.

""Lamar's our quarterback, and he's the guy who puts butts in seats in the stadium, sells tickets and wins games for us,"" Hamilton said. ""Obviously, we contribute to that as well defensively and supporting guys on the offense. But, at the end of the day, [No.] 8 is what makes this thing go.""

The Ravens will be forced to lean on Huntley, who is 3-7 over his career as a backup for Jackson. He has thrown an even seven touchdowns to seven interceptions over those 10 games that span five seasons.

Since 2018, the Ravens are 4-12 without Jackson at quarterback with a current six-game losing streak.

Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports the latest on the investigation into the Louvre heist.

Multiple suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris last weekend, French officials said Sunday.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, including one man who was taken into custody as he was about to leave the country from Charles de Gaulle airport.

Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests, though French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and taken into custody. She did not say whether the jewels had been recovered.

Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at 88 million euros ($102 million) — a high-profile heist that sparked a national reckoning and stunned the world.

The crew of thieves used a basket lift to scale the Louvre's façade, forced open a window, smashed display cases and fled, according to French officials. The Louvre's director Laurence des Cars acknowledged there was a ""terrible failure"" in the museum's security.

Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. She said the premature leak of information could hinder the work of over 100 investigators ""mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators."" 

Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends.

The thieves slipped away with a total of eight objects, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense. They also stole an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife, and a reliquary brooch. Empress Eugénie's diamond diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch — an imperial ensemble of rare craftsmanship — were also part of the loot.

Eugénie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on how concerned people should be about bird flu spreading on 'Fox Report.'

A Georgia chicken producer is working to stop the spread of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), more commonly known as bird flu, after becoming the third commercial operation in the state to test positive this year.

The Gordon County producer noticed signs of illness on Wednesday and reported it to the Georgia Poultry Laboratory Network on Thursday, according to a Georgia Department of Agriculture press release.

The following day, Georgia Department of Agriculture's Emergency Management and State Agricultural Response Teams ""deployed to the affected premises to conduct depopulation, disposal, cleaning, and disinfection.""

The facility housed about 140,000 broiler chickens.

For at least the next two weeks, state officials say, all commercial poultry operations within a 6.2-mile radius are under quarantine and will undergo surveillance testing.

""This poses a serious threat to Georgia's #1 industry and to the thousands of Georgians whose livelihoods depend on poultry production,"" Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler J Harper said in a statement. ""Our team is working around the clock to contain the spread and protect our flocks.""

CDC DECLARES BIRD FLU EMERGENCY OVER AS EXPERTS WARN OF POSSIBLE FALL RESURGENCE

Last week, the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy Research and Innovation Office (CIDRAP) reported a commercial turkey farm in Swift County ""that houses 34,000 birds is the site of the latest outbreak to hit the top turkey-producing state in the nation.""

A commercial egg-layer farm in Indiana with nearly 20,000 birds also recently reported a bird flu outbreak, CIDRAP reported.

HPAI was first confirmed in a commercial flock in the U.S. on Feb. 8, 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS).

Data from the agency says over the last 30 days, 64 flocks have been confirmed infected, impacting nearly 3.5 million birds.

Canvassers in Brooklyn's Prospect Park defended Zohran Mamdani's vision for New York City in interviews with Fox News Digital on Sunday.

NEW YORK – Progressive stars Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are teaming up with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani Sunday night for a ""New York is not for sale"" rally at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York City.

The high-profile campaign event comes nearly one week before Election Day, as New Yorkers head to the polls for the first weekend of early voting, closing out a contentious mayoral battle where Mamdani's unanticipated success has landed him on the national stage.

""Zohran Mamdani is modeling a different kind of politics,"" Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate and longtime progressive leader, said in a statement ahead of the rally. 

The trio of self-identified Democratic socialists have invigorated the Democratic Party's progressive base at a time when Democrats are still grappling with devastating losses in 2024 amid growing discontent with President Donald Trump's sweeping, second-term agenda.

When Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez teamed up for the ""Fighting Oligarchy"" tour earlier this year, they sparked sizable buzz, firing up thousands of Democrats at rallies across the United States who had been left without a clear party leader.

""As mayor, he will not run a top-down, billionaire-funded, consultant-driven administration. Instead, Zohran will be a champion for the working people of New York,"" Sanders said.

Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have campaigned alongside Mamdani in his bid to lead the nation's most populous city. 

On Friday night, Sanders appeared for a virtual ""Get Out the Vote"" event with Mamdani. Last month, Sanders and Mamdani teamed up for a ""Fighting Oligarchy"" town hall in Brooklyn.

Ahead of the Brooklyn town hall event, the two progressive leaders marched alongside union members in Manhattan's Labor Day parade. That afternoon, Mamdani posed for a photo with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez in Astoria, Queens, amassing millions of views.

Sanders, a two-time Democratic presidential nominee runner-up, was an early endorser of Mamdani's primary campaign, along with Ocasio-Cortez. Their endorsements helped Mamdani consolidate progressive support in the 11-candidate field during the final weeks of the primary race.

Mamdani's primary upset triggered a political earthquake as the democratic socialist handily defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was widely expected to secure the Democratic nomination.

Mamdani's cross-endorsement with fellow progressive New York City Comptroller Brad Lander cleared the path for Mamdani to consolidate support against Cuomo through ranked-choice voting.

Cuomo has since launched an independent campaign, teeing up a competitive and contentious general election battle. 

Since Mamdani secured the Democratic nomination, Trump has labeled him a ""100% Communist Lunatic,"" and ""my little communist,"" ushering Mamdani onto the national political stage. Mamdani has rejected the moniker, maintaining that he identifies as a democratic socialist, like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. 

As Trump began criticizing Mamdani, New York Democrats chose to withhold their endorsements of the socialist candidate, who has made a slew of ambitious campaign promises, like fast and free buses, city-run grocery stores and free child care, all of which he plans to pay for by raising taxes on corporations and the top 1% of New Yorkers. 

After months of withholding their endorsements, Gov. Kathy Hochul finally endorsed Mamdani last month and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries finally affirmed his support in a statement Friday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has still yet to endorse.

Pressure had been mounting since Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June for Mayor Eric Adams, who was also running as an independent, or Cuomo to drop out of the race to consolidate support against Mamdani. Adams dropped out and endorsed Cuomo on Thursday. 

That pressure reached a boiling point last week as billionaires, including Red Apple Media CEO John Catsimatidis and hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman, called on Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to drop out of the race in order to clear a pathway to victory for Cuomo.

The latest Fox News survey, conducted Oct. 10-14, ahead of the first general election debate last week, revealed that Mamdani has a substantial lead in the race. According to the poll, Mamdani has a 21-point lead among New York City registered voters with 49% of voters backing Mamdani, while 28% go for Cuomo and 13% favor Sliwa.

Mamdani also rose above the 50% threshold among likely voters, garnering 52% support, while Cuomo picked up 28%, and Sliwa received just 14%.

The Permitting Council is pressing ahead with President Donald Trump‘s priority of expediting key infrastructure projects, such as mining, despite the government shutdown. 

The government shutdown is in its fourth week, leaving many federal agencies with furloughed employees. However, the Permitting Council, a federal agency responsible for guiding essential infrastructure projects through the permitting process, continues its efforts to advance them.

Emily Domenech, executive director of the Permitting Council, told the Washington Examiner, “We're still coming to work and making sure things are getting built, and we have the results to show that this is a worthwhile endeavor.” 

The council oversees the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41) program, which supports the permitting process for infrastructure projects within several economic sectors, including transportation, semiconductors, and renewable energy.

The Trump administration has used the program to help mining projects obtain permits, strengthening the domestic supply of critical minerals and rare earths needed for sectors such as defense and energy. 

Since the shutdown, Domenech noted that some projects have completed their processes, including the Caldwell Canyon Mine Project in Idaho, which will mine phosphate.

She added that three new mineral projects have been added to the council's FAST-41 in the past month, including the Burnt Rock Exploration Project in Nevada and the Copper Creek Exploration Project in Arizona. The first two projects were added to the council's Transparency Dashboard, allowing the public and private sectors to monitor progress, but without access to the full benefits of the program.

Additionally, the council added the Kilbourne Graphite Project in New York to the list of covered projects that receive the full benefits of the council.

“We did not slow down at all,” Domenech said. “We really did work with the [Office of Budget and Management] and the White House ahead of time to say, ‘hey, look, we're going to prioritize moving projects that are in the President's priority sectors.'”

She added, “So we're continuing to work on those projects regardless of what Congress decides to do this week.”

Most of the council's activities are funded through the Environmental Review Improvement Fund, which supports federal environmental review processes for various projects.

As part of the fund, the council has transfer authority, allowing it to move funding to other federal agencies to assist with permitting. Domenech said, for example, that the council helped fund staff who worked on mining projects in the Department of Agriculture because it did not have a large, robust staff. 

“We have the ability to transfer our funding that keeps us open during the shutdown to these other federal agencies as needed, if it's required, to bring folks back from furlough,” Domenech said. 

Domenech said the council has brought back about a dozen of its own employees from furlough. However, more than three dozen employees at other agencies have returned to work as a result of the council emphasizing their key role in the permitting process.

A private sector adviser engaged in the critical mineral sector told the Washington Examiner, “From where I stand, the government shutdown hasn't materially affected the federal government's critical mineral development activities.”

They added, “The critical mineral portfolio cuts across multiple departments and, of course, the White House, and the senior-level officials driving it are all ‘essential employees.'”

The Trump administration has leaned on the FAST-41 program, which began during former President Barack Obama's second term, to help streamline the permitting process for critical infrastructure projects. During the Biden administration, only one mining project was on the program's dashboard. The council now manages 47 mining projects. 

EPA TO UNVEIL NEW CYBERSECURITY TOOLS TO PROTECT US WATER SYSTEMS

The Trump administration has made it a priority to bolster the domestic supply of critical minerals and rare earths to reduce the United States's reliance on China, which controls the majority of the supply chain. 

“We are looking to focus on sectors that were either sort of been under assault by the previous administrations … or were forgotten,” Domenech said. “I think the mining sector really is that forgotten sector that did not get attention from previous administrations, even when maybe it should have.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The NBA Indictments Are Not What They Seem","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/nba-illegal-gambling-charges/684687/","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The government is calling its illegal-gambling charges a major case. It's more like small potatoes.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The National Basketball Association is now slime-identified with a crew of upstanders known as “Spook,” “Peso,” “Vez,” “Sugar,” “Black Tony,” “Scruli,” and “Doc,” thanks to the strenuous efforts of FBI Director Kash Patel to generate a headline. “Current and Former National Basketball Association Players and Four Other Individuals Charged in Widespread Sports Betting and Money Laundering Conspiracy,” Patel's press office blared last week. At a podium flanked by prosecutors as he announced arrests tied to the charges, Patel said, “The fraud is mind-boggling.” But read the actual indictments—which tell a different, much thinner story—and you might begin to suspect that the nation's top cop was running a small con of his own.

Patel got his headlines. A front-pager in The New York Times led with “N.B.A.” in describing the arrests for ““gambling schemes,” as did an article in The Washington Post, which announced that NBA “figures” had been arrested in the probe into “a mob-run rigged poker scheme.” But the indictments are startling for their paucity compared with the charges described in Patel's boasts. Out of the more than 30 people charged by federal prosecutors for illicit-gaming offenses, just three are associated with the NBA, and most of the evidence has nothing to do with basketball games. The most prominent arrest was of Chauncey Billups, the Portland Trail Blazers' head coach, who is not directly accused of basketball-related wrongdoing but rather of wire fraud and money laundering in allegedly acting as a celebrity front man in a crooked Las Vegas poker game in 2019. What Patel and prosecutors did not say is that at the time, Billups was not even employed by the league or any of its teams.

Insider sports gambling is a legitimate crisis for the NBA and should not be minimized. Another NBA figure indicted is the Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, charged with involvement in a wagering scheme in which he supposedly faked a foot injury to underperform. Even that alleged offense is somewhat old news: The league investigated Rozier in 2023 after a sudden flurry of money on him rang alarm bells, but it cleared him when physicians said he showed a genuine foot inflammation. Rozier sat out the last several games of that season amid rumors of suspension, but the league said in a statement that his absence had nothing to do with gambling suspicions and was the result of the legitimate injury: “Any assertion that the NBA had anything to do with Terry Rozier not playing games following his departure from the game on March 23, 2023, is categorically false. Per team doctors, Rozier had a real foot injury confirmed with an MRI.” He has been under federal investigation ever since, and the league has cooperated. (After last week's indictments, the NBA put Billups and Rozier on “immediate leave.”)

A third NBA indictee is the 49-year-old former player and coach Damon Jones, also alleged to have acted as a celebrity front and to have shared inside information with bettors to cash in on wagers. Jones has not been formally associated with the league since 2018 but is a former teammate and coach of the Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James; they played together with the Cleveland Cavaliers and are said to remain close.

The rest of those charged seem to have zero connection to the league. They are low rollers and a handful of alleged mob-family middlemen with names such as “Lou Ap” and “The Wrestler,” accused of running a rigged poker ring that prosecutors say fleeced card players out of at least $7 million. That hardly ranks as the organized-crime bust of the century. A study by the American Gaming Association estimated that this year, illegal and unregulated gambling wagers will amount to more than $673 billion; of that, sports betting will account for about $84 billion.

It's not unusual for prosecutors and cops to put high-profile indictments on display in the name of deterrence. But in this case, they came perilously close to a smear, positioning the NBA figures squarely alongside those from La Cosa Nostra: the Gambinos, Luccheses, Bonannos, and Genoveses. Patel also likened the NBA to Wall Street. “Let's not, you know, mince words,” he said. “This is the insider-trading saga for the NBA.”

But where Patel and the prosecutors promise a lion, out pops a mouse. The contents of the indictments involving the NBA figures are surprisingly paltry: Billups is mentioned only a handful of times; he is alleged to have served as a “face card,” a celebrity player who enticed marks to a gaming table equipped with high-tech devices, such as X-ray card readers, to direct winning hands. The Department of Justice's detention letter quotes suggestive texts that allegedly were sent between accused organizers and participants, including one mentioning Billups by name: “The one guy on the end acted like he wanted Chauncey to have his money! He was star struck!” Another appears to show a person claiming that participants in the game knew “all the signals.”

Billups's attorney Chris Heywood denied the charges in a statement, calling his client, a five-time All-Star who won an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004, “a man of integrity.” He continued: “To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.”

Rozier's attorney Jim Trusty also issued a statement: “A long time ago we reached out to these prosecutors to tell them we should have an open line of communication. They characterized Terry as a subject, not a target.” He added: “Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.”

It will be interesting to see which charges stick. Some may. The indictment against Rozier reads like “gang that couldn't shoot straight” stuff. It alleges that on March 23, 2023, when Rozier was playing for the Charlotte Hornets, he told another defendant that he would pull himself early from a game against the New Orleans Pelicans, allowing bettors down the chain to cash in on prop bets: wagers on whether he would meet certain statistical thresholds in points, rebounds, and other categories. Jones is similarly accused of trading on his friendships for information to tip off bettors. According to the indictment, Jones was aware that “Player 3,” clearly identifiable as LeBron James, had a sore ankle on February 9, 2023, and would likely not play against the Milwaukee Bucks; Jones is alleged to have written in a text message, “Get a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out!”

Keith O'Brien: Sports can't survive prop bets

Some opinionators believe that the NBA had this coming. Since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting in 2018, the league has embroiled itself in a matrix of relationships with sports-betting operators, including its official partners DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM. It even allows sports books inside some arenas. But it's hardly the only league with these partnerships, or these problems, and doesn't deserve a special taint of corruption. Both soccer and tennis have had match-fixing scandals. The National Football League and Major League Baseball have significant partnerships with sports books, and players have served suspensions for betting.

The NBA's real problem is more long-term and amorphous: The outsize impact of a great player in a sport that puts just five men on the floor at a time means that performance manipulation is easier than in some other sports. That reality, combined with apps that offer ever more convenience and minutiae to bet on in real time, invites corruption. But this landscape can also criminalize innocent behavior.

Every gambler seeks inside information, and not all of it would be a federal crime to act on. Does someone have a timely bonus clause that will kick in if a certain threshold is reached? Whose masseuse has been fired? Who is feeling sore? What constitutes inside information is an especially problematic question in pro leagues with an infinitude of assistant trainers, private physios, and other towel bearers who can easily gossip over a sprained toe, innocently.

Then there is this: Many NBA players sit themselves out, or play limited minutes, to manage the physical toll of an 82-game season, with its repetitive pounding and extreme muscle loads. (The 2025 playoffs saw a spate of injuries, especially to Achilles tendons of high-profilers, including Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, and Tyrese Haliburton. Stephen Curry sat out some of the postseason with a hamstring strain.) Resting does not constitute “tanking,” doing less than one's best. It's a commonsense measure to try to conserve the physical resources of men who have only so many high-level seasons in them.

For Billups, one of the most serious elements in the indicting documents is something he was not actually charged with: Prosecutors suggest that as a head coach, he may have offered inside information that he intended to sit some of his typical starters for a game against the Chicago Bulls on March 24, 2023. This is where real trouble lurks for the league, in the indefinable area of what constitutes actionable inside info for bettors, and how quickly in this day and age they can get their money down.

According to the indictment, Billups mentioned to another defendant, Eric Earnest, that he would withhold his usual starters against the Bulls because the Trail Blazers had given up on the season and the team was hoping to increase its odds of getting “a better draft pick” in the forthcoming NBA draft. Earnest, the indictment states, then shared the info with another bettor, who in turn shared it with others, resulting in multiple bets being placed on the game, worth about $100,000. The Blazers lost, 124–96.

Charles Fain Lehman: Legalizing sports gambling was a huge mistake

You can read that scenario as a tank and a fix. But the indictment does not allege that Billups played any role in the bets or profited from them. Everyone in the basketball world knew that the Trail Blazers were out of the playoff hunt, and that, with just 10 games remaining, they were likely to shut down their starters—not only for the sake of those players' long-term health but also to foster younger players, and perhaps improve the team's chances of drafting the phenom Victor Wembanyama.

In a statement about the indictments, a spokesperson for the National Basketball Players Association said, “The integrity of the game is paramount to NBA players, but so is the presumption of innocence, and both are hindered when player popularity is misused to gain attention.” It will get only harder for athletes to defend their innocence as gambling tech proliferates. In-game live betting now means that every second of minutiae can represent a bet—and a potentially questioned motive. Who will score next? Will it be a two pointer or a three? Players have faced vile fan reactions and even death threats for their failure to satisfy bettors in the moment. The majority of the NBA's players have expressed unhappiness with this state of affairs, and with associations with sports books in general. A poll by The Athletic showed that only 34 percent of players believe gambling partnerships are good for the league.

The NBA indictments are small game compared with the bigger picture of a multibillion-dollar vice industry aided by new technology that can enhance twitching addictiveness, and enable cheating. But the league is not without ways to defend itself, or to cleanse its reputation. It has the sway to demand that its sports books eliminate prop bets. If FanDuels and DraftKings won't agree, the NBA should simply withhold the data and statistics that they have been providing to sports books. The league should also continue to lobby lawmakers for a federal ban on prop bets, as a matter of the game's health and that of its fan base. The NBA is being made an example of, unfairly. Its response should be to set an example.

Thanks to Kalshi, a so-called prediction market, sports betting is now legal everywhere—even where it isn't.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Americans who want to bet on sports have many options. There's DraftKings, FanDuel, ESPN Bet, Caesars, and BetMGM. There's also BetRivers, Hard Rock, bet365, Fanatics, and Bally Bet. But none of those platforms are available in the 17 states where online sports betting remains illegal, including California and Texas.

Kalshi, a prediction market, doesn't have that limitation. Gamblers can use it to wager on the outcome of sporting events in all 50 states. That's because, in the eyes of American law, Kalshi is not a gambling company at all; it's an exchange that facilitates the trading of legitimate financial products. Over the past year, the company has added sports to the range of events that can be wagered on, while arguing that it is beyond the reach of any state-level gambling ban. It maintains that it can be regulated only by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But under the second Trump administration, the CFTC has shown no interest in cracking down. The result is that sports betting is now legal everywhere—even in the states where it isn't.

Futures contracts have been around in the United States since the late 1800s. Midwestern farmers planted and harvested grain at roughly the same time every year, and then everyone went to Chicago to sell. This sudden abundance of grain would cause prices to plummet. Middlemen swooped in to help. They'd buy the grain and store it nearby, selling it for a profit in the winter. This helped to stabilize prices, but some buyers wanted more certainty: a set amount of grain at a set price at a set date, so they could plan ahead. Middlemen obliged, writing contracts for the future delivery of grain.

Soon after, people began trading the contracts. A bakery might buy a grain contract from a distillery. Farmers could buy the contracts, too, to hedge their bets: A Michigan farmer might buy a grain contract from a Wisconsin farmer, so that if Michigan had a bad harvest, he'd still have some grain to sell. Speculators joined the party. If the cereal market was growing, a savvy market-watcher might notice, scooping up grain contracts that would be worth more later. That serves a useful economic function. Without these middlemen, the price of grain might stay artificially low for a long time, and then spike once everyone notices the growth. The speculator provides liquidity and, with it, stability.

Keith O'Brien: Sports can't survive prop bets

At some level, the speculator is gambling. “All you're doing is betting on whether the price of grain will go up or down,” Karl Lockhart, a law professor who studies prediction markets, told me. As futures markets matured, states tried to step in, and politicians introduced anti-options bills. The federal government, however, intervened repeatedly to save the nascent industry. “It seems to us an extraordinary and unlikely proposition that the dealings which give its character to the great market for future sales in this country are to be regarded as mere wagers,” Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote in a 1905 decision.

With the government's blessing, the futures market continued to evolve. People began trading currency futures in the '70s, betting on the fluctuations of the pound or the franc or the Mongolian tugrik. Soon after, markets were created allowing banks to buy and sell bets on future interest rates. The banks were hedging, much like the hypothetical Michigan farmer—if interest rates went up, they'd be hurt, so they would bet on interest rates going up, and then their losses wouldn't be so big. Other financial firms would take the other side of the bet. Were they gambling? Maybe, but they were also helping banks stay solvent.

Hedging opportunities are everywhere, and they don't always require a contract to buy or sell an underlying asset. In what's known as an event contract, a company might bet on a specific adverse development, such as its competitors merging. Kalshi, founded in 2018, specializes in event contracts, a category that it interprets very broadly. (The word kalshi means “everything” in Arabic.) When Tarek Mansour, the company's CEO and one of its co-founders, was interning at Goldman Sachs in 2016, he told me, clients would ask the bank to design a way to hedge against Brexit or a Donald Trump presidency. (Imagine you run a company that makes offshore wind turbines, Trump's least favorite thing in the world. If you had bet on a Trump victory last year, you'd be in better financial shape now.) Political betting was technically illegal, though the government tolerated it in small amounts, on sites run by academics and nonprofits for research purposes. Then, in 2023, Kalshi declared its intention to introduce political markets in which users could bet on which party would control Congress.

The Biden-era CFTC decided Kalshi's political expansion was prohibited because it involved “gaming and activity that is unlawful under state law” and was “contrary to the public interest.” Kalshi challenged the CFTC's order in federal court. The judge ruled in Kalshi's favor, reasoning that if betting on elections were to count as gambling, then so would betting on the weather, or a merger, or an earnings report, or interest rates. At issue, fundamentally, was where the line between gambling and investing really lies.

The Biden CFTC appealed the court's ruling. Kalshi, in its response to the appeal, tried to make the boundary between futures trades and gambling clearer. (After Trump took office, the CFTC would drop the appeal.) A bet is gambling only “if it is contingent on a game or a game-related event,” Kalshi's lawyers at Milbank and Jones Day argued in a filing last November. “The classic example is a contract on the outcome of a sporting event.” Political betting isn't gambling, the argument went. Sports betting is gambling—and that's not what Kalshi was offering its customers.

Less than three months later, Kalshi announced that customers could bet on the Super Bowl. When I asked about this discrepancy, Mansour told me that the legal filing had been written by “outside counsel” and that what it expressed was “not our view.” Today, Kalshi is mostly a sports-betting company, but one whose users can live anywhere and need to be at least 18 years old, rather than the typical 21. Since football season started, early last month, sports betting has accounted for more than 90 percent of the activity on the platform. A freshly signed licensing deal with the NHL allows Kalshi to use team logos and names instead of soliciting bets on “New York J at Cincinnati,” as it still does for football.

Kalshi users can wager on more than just the outcome of a game. A football bettor, for example, could bet on the margin of victory, how many passing yards one of the quarterbacks will have, or how many rushing yards one of the running backs will have. They could even combine these three bets into a parlay, where the odds of winning are lower, but the payout for winning is higher. Kalshi calls this a “combo,” perhaps to avoid using the no-no gambling term parlay.

Charles Fain Lehman: Legalizing sports gambling was a huge mistake

The day after Kalshi rolled out its combos, the stock prices of DraftKings and FanDuel's parent company each fell more than 10 percent. Kalshi knows that investors and customers think of it as a gambling company; in fact, its advertising encourages them to. One Kalshi social-media ad announces “BREAKING NEWS: SPORTS BETTING IN TEXAS IN NOW LEGAL” and that “Kalshi has legalized sports betting in all 50 states.” (When I asked Mansour about this kind of advertising, he said, “The minute we basically saw them, we basically took them down.” This type of ad was first spotted in February, and Kalshi re-upped them as recently as last month.)

Kalshi insists that it is not a sportsbook, but rather an exchange that matches buyers and sellers of legitimate event contracts. Some of the events just happen to be sports, rather than mergers. A sportsbook makes money when you lose, which puts its incentives directly at odds with the interests of the user. Kalshi, by contrast, makes its money from fees.

Even setting aside the formalism of the distinction, this argument is undermined by the fact that a subsidiary, Kalshi Trading, does take bets against customers. So does a partner, Susquehanna International Group, which provides a “market making” service for Kalshi by being on the other side of users' bets. The same goes for Kalshi's army of decentralized market makers who are compensated in return for providing “liquidity” to the market. All of these entities make money when ordinary users lose their bets.

Tim Ford is a sports bettor on Kalshi. He uses an algorithm to determine probabilities for game outcomes, then buys or sells contracts that deviate from those probabilities. He has made more than $100,000 over the past month this way, according to Kalshi's public leaderboard. (His handle is CSPTRADINGonX.) Ford, who lives in Texas, doesn't defend the morality of Kalshi's end run around the state's gambling laws. But without the company, he would be significantly poorer. “At the end of the day, they are certainly effective,” he told me. Kalshi facilitates more than $900 million in bets a week, keeping a steep percentage in fees (more than 5 percent for a $20 bet). Earlier this month, it announced that it had raised more than $300 million at a $5 billion valuation; now investors are trying to get in at a $10 to $12 billion valuation. The personal-investing platform Robinhood has embedded Kalshi's prediction markets into its savings app.

Kalshi's rise has not been without controversy. Last November, FBI agents raided the home of the CEO of Polymarket, Kalshi's biggest competitor. Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, was being investigated for allegedly allowing Americans to use its platform in violation of a settlement with the CFTC. (In July, the company said that the probe had been dropped, and the CFTC has since declared that it can legally operate.) Following the raid, two white Kalshi employees persuaded the retired NFL player Antonio Brown to tweet “this nigga seem guilty.” (“This was a mistake,” Mansour told me.)

If Kalshi's marketing can be disorganized, its legal strategy is not. To help navigate the regulatory environment, Kalshi employs Donald Trump Jr. as a strategic adviser, and has hired as its lawyer the Democratic superstar Neal Katyal, who has argued in front of the Supreme Court more than 50 times. The company argues that it's not subject to state gambling bans, because they are preempted by the presence of federal law regulating futures contracts.

That argument is being tested in court. In response to cease and desist letters, Kalshi sued Nevada, New Jersey, and Maryland in the spring, asking courts to prevent the states from cracking down on them. According to Andrew Kim, a lawyer who has been tracking the litigation, the company has since added Ohio to the list and has been sued by the state of Massachusetts, three Indian tribes in California as well as one in Wisconsin, and private plaintiffs in seven states. In at least two instances, Kalshi has won preliminary injunctions to allow it to keep operating while the cases proceed.

If states can't stop so-called prediction markets from facilitating sports betting, who can? According to Kalshi, no one besides the CFTC (or, in theory, Congress). The company classifies the transactions on its platform not as wagers but as “swaps,” which the post–Great Recession Dodd-Frank financial reform law charges the CFTC with regulating. To qualify as a swap under the law, the event being bet on must be of “potential financial, economic, or commercial consequence.”

This requirement has led Kalshi to interesting places. Super Bowl bets must be swaps, Kalshi's lawyers argue, because the winning team generates additional revenue. Whether a player scores a touchdown in a particular game, Mansour told me, has economic consequences for the player's sponsorship deal. Even parlays have economic consequences, Mansour explained, because sportsbooks offer parlays and could use Kalshi to hedge by taking the other side of the bet.

If Kalshi's bets are swaps, then regulating them is the CFTC's job and no one else's. This is very convenient for Kalshi. Four of the five CFTC commissioners have resigned since January, and the last one remaining on the commission, which is bipartisan by law, is a Republican who announced she'd leave as soon as Trump's pick for chair, Brian Quintenz, was confirmed. Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, is on the board of Kalshi.

On September 30, the eve of the government shutdown, there was finally some action. Six senators posted an open letter to the acting chair of the CFTC asking her to stop allowing sports-prediction markets. Trump pulled his nomination of Quintenz after the Winklevoss brothers told him that Quintenz would be too hard on crypto. And CFTC staff issued their first guidance on sports-prediction markets. In a letter to all approved exchanges, they wrote that they “are aware that certain registered entities and registrants are listing or facilitating the trading or clearing of sports-related event contracts, or may be interested in the future in doing so.” Their advice? “State regulatory actions and pending and potential litigation, including enforcement actions, should be accounted for with appropriate contingency planning, disclosures, and risk management policies and procedures.” The letter perfectly closed the buck-passing loop. States had tried to regulate sports-prediction markets. The courts had suggested that responsibility belongs to the federal government. Now the federal government was telling the sports-prediction markets to beware of the states and the courts.

For now, the industry, its investors, and its gamblers are in limbo. If they'd like to hedge, Polymarket is taking bets on whether the Supreme Court will accept a case on sports-event contracts by July 2026.

Will AI stretch our minds—or stunt them?

The fretting has swelled from a murmur to a clamor, all variations on the same foreboding theme: “Your Brain on ChatGPT.” “AI Is Making You Dumber.” “AI Is Killing Critical Thinking.” Once, the fear was of a runaway intelligence that would wipe us out, maybe while turning the planet into a paper-clip factory. Now that chatbots are going the way of Google—moving from the miraculous to the taken-for-granted—the anxiety has shifted, too, from apocalypse to atrophy. Teachers, especially, say they're beginning to see the rot. The term for it is unlovely but not inapt: de-skilling.

The worry is far from fanciful. Kids who turn to Gemini to summarize Twelfth Night may never learn to wrestle with Shakespeare on their own. Aspiring lawyers who use Harvey AI for legal analysis may fail to develop the interpretive muscle their predecessors took for granted. In a recent study, several hundred U.K. participants were given a standard critical-thinking test and were interviewed about their AI use for finding information or making decisions. Younger users leaned more on the technology, and scored lower on the test. Use it or lose it was the basic takeaway. Another study looked at physicians performing colonoscopies: After three months of using an AI system to help flag polyps, they became less adept at spotting them unaided.

But the real puzzle isn't whether de-skilling exists—it plainly does—but rather what kind of thing it is. Are all forms of de-skilling corrosive? Or are there kinds that we can live with, that might even be welcome? De-skilling is a catchall term for losses of very different kinds: some costly, some trivial, some oddly generative. To grasp what's at stake, we have to look closely at the ways that skill frays, fades, or mutates when new technologies arrive.

Our chatbots are new: The “transformer” architecture they rely on was invented in 2017, and ChatGPT made its public debut just five years later. But the fear that a new technology might blunt the mind is ancient. In the Phaedrus, which dates to the fourth century B.C.E., Socrates recounts a myth in which the Egyptian god Thoth offers King Thamus the gift of writing—“a recipe for memory and for wisdom.” Thamus is unmoved. Writing, he warns, will do the opposite: It will breed forgetfulness, letting people trade the labor of recollection for marks on papyrus, mistaking the appearance of understanding for the thing itself. Socrates sides with Thamus. Written words, he complains, never answer your particular questions; reply to everyone the same way, sage and fool alike; and are helpless when they're misunderstood.

Of course, the reason we know all this—the reason the episode keeps turning up in Whiggish histories of technology—is that Plato wrote it down. Yet the critics of writing weren't entirely wrong. In oral cultures, bards carried epics in their heads; griots could reel off centuries of genealogy on demand. Writing made such prowess unnecessary. You could now take in ideas without wrestling with them. Dialogue demands replies: clarification, objection, revision. (Sometimes “Very true, Socrates” did the trick, but still.) Reading, by contrast, lets you bask in another's brilliance, nodding along without ever testing yourself against it.

Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares: AI is grown, not built

What looks like a loss from one angle, though, can look like a gain from another. Writing opened new mental territories: commentary, jurisprudence, reliable history, science. Walter J. Ong, the scholar of orality and literacy, put it crisply: “Writing is a technology that restructures thought.” The pattern is familiar. When sailors began using sextants, they left behind the seafarer's skycraft, the detailed reading of stars that once steered them safely home. Later, satellite navigation brought an end to sextant skills. Owning a Model T once meant moonlighting as a mechanic—knowing how to patch tubes, set ignition timing by ear, coax the car's engine back to life after a stall. Today's highly reliable engines seal off their secrets. Slide rules yielded to calculators, calculators to computers. Each time, individual virtuosity waned, but overall performance advanced.

It's a reassuring pattern—something let go, something else acquired. But some gains come with deeper costs. They unsettle not only what people can do but also who they feel themselves to be.

In the 1980s, the social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff spent time at pulp mills in the southern United States as they shifted from manual to computerized control. Operators who had once judged pulp by touch (“Is it slick? Is it sticky?”) now sat in air-conditioned rooms watching numbers scroll across screens, their old skills unexercised and unvalued. “Doing my job through the computer, it feels different,” one told Zuboff. “It is like you're riding a big, powerful horse, but someone is sitting behind you on the saddle holding the reins.” The new system was faster, cleaner, safer; it also drained the work of its meaning.

The sociologist Richard Sennett recorded a similar transformation at a Boston bakery. In the 1970s, the workers there were Greek men who used their noses and eyes to judge when the bread was ready and took pride in their craft; in the 1990s, their successors interacted with a touch screen on a Windows-style controller. Bread became a screen icon—its color inferred from data, its variety chosen from a digital menu. The thinning of skills brought a thinning of identity. The bread was still good, but the kitchen workers knew they weren't really bakers anymore. One told Sennett, half-joking, “Baking, shoemaking, printing—you name it, I've got the skills.” She meant that she didn't really need any.

The cultural realm, certainly, has had a long retreat from touch. In the middle-class homes of 19th-century Europe, to love music usually meant to play it. Symphonies reached the parlor not by stereo but by piano reduction—four hands, one keyboard, Brahms's Symphony No. 1 conjured as best the household could manage. It took skill: reading notation, mastering technique, evoking an orchestra through your fingers. To hear the music you wanted, you had to practice.

Then the gramophone took off, and the parlor pianos started to gather dust. The gains were obvious: You could summon the orchestra itself into your living room, expand your ear from salon trifles to Debussy, Strauss, Sibelius. The modern music lover may have been less of a performer but, in a sense, more of a listener. Still, breadth came at the expense of depth. Practicing a piece left you with an intimate feel for its seams and contours. Did your kid with the shiny Victrola get that?

That sense of estrangement—of being a step removed from the real thing—shows up whenever a powerful new tool arrives. The slide rule, starting in the 17th century, reduced the need for expertise at mental math; centuries later, the pocket calculator stirred unease among some engineers, who feared the fading of number sense. Such worries weren't groundless. Pressing “Cos” on a keypad got you a number, but the meaning behind it could slip away. Even in more rarefied precincts, the worry persisted. The MIT physicist Victor Weisskopf was troubled by his colleagues' growing reliance on computer simulations. “The computer understands the answer,” he told them when they handed him their printouts, “but I don't think you understand the answer.” It was the disquiet of an Egyptian king, digital edition, convinced that output was being mistaken for insight.

In what Zuboff called “the age of the smart machine,” automation was mainly confined to the workplace—the mill, the industrial bakery, the cockpit. In the age of the PC and then the web, technology escaped into the home, becoming general purpose, woven into everyday life. By the 2000s, researchers were already asking what search engines were doing to us. You'd see headlines such as “This Is Your Brain on Google.” Although the panic was overplayed, some effects were real. A widely cited study found that, in certain circumstances, people would remember where a fact could be found rather than the fact itself.

In truth, human cognition has always leaked beyond the skull—into instruments, symbols, and one another. (Think of the couples you know: One person remembers birthdays, the other where the passports live.) From the time of tally bones and to the era of clay tablets, we've been storing thought in the world for tens of millennia. Plenty of creatures use tools, but their know-how dies with them; ours accumulates as culture—a relay system for intelligence. We inherit it, extend it, and build upon it, so that each generation can climb higher than the last: moving from pressure-flaked blades to bone needles, to printing presses, to quantum computing. This compounding of insight—externalized, preserved, shared—is what sets Homo sapiens apart. Bonobos live in the ecological present. We live in history.

Adrienne LaFrance: The six main arcs in storytelling, as identified by an A.I.

Accumulation, meanwhile, has a critical consequence: It drives specialization. As knowledge expands, it no longer resides equally in every head. In small bands, anyone could track game, gather plants, and make fire. But as societies scaled up after the agrarian revolution, crafts and guilds proliferated—toolmakers who could forge an edge that held, masons who knew how to keep a vault from collapsing, glassblowers who refined closely guarded recipes and techniques. Skills once lodged in the body moved into tools and rose into institutions. Over time, the division of labor became, inevitably, a division of cognitive labor.

The philosopher Hilary Putnam once remarked that he could use the word elm even though he couldn't tell an elm from a beech. Reference is social: You can talk about elms because others in your language community—botanists, gardeners, foresters—can identify them. What's true of language is true of knowledge. Human capability resides not solely in individuals but in the networks they form, each of us depending on others to fill in what we can't supply ourselves. Scale turned social exchange into systemic interdependence.

The result is a world in which, in a classic example, nobody knows how to make a pencil. An individual would need the skills of foresters, saw millers, miners, chemists, lacquerers—an invisible network of crafts behind even the simplest object. Mark Twain, in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, imagined a 19th-century engineer dropped into Camelot dazzling his hosts with modern wonders. Readers went with it. But drop his 21st-century counterpart into the same setting, and he'd be helpless. Manufacture insulated wire? Mix a batch of dynamite? Build a telegraph from scratch? Most of us would be stymied once we failed to get onto the Wi-Fi.

The cognitive division of labor is now so advanced that two physicists may barely understand each other—one modeling dark matter, the other building quantum sensors. Scientific mastery now means knowing more and more about less and less. This concentration yields astonishing progress, but it also means grasping how limited our competence is: Specialists inherit conceptual tools they can use but can no longer make. Even mathematics, long romanticized as the realm of the solitary genius, now works like this. When Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem, he didn't re-derive every lemma himself; he assembled results that he trusted but didn't personally reproduce, building a structure he could see whole even if he hadn't cut each beam.

The widening of collaboration has changed what it means to know something. Knowledge, once imagined as a possession, has become a relation—a matter of how well we can locate, interpret, and synthesize what others know. We live inside a web of distributed intelligence, dependent on specialists, databases, and instruments to extend our reach. The scale tells the story: The Nature paper that announced the structure of DNA had two authors; a Nature paper in genomics today might have 40. The two papers announcing the Higgs boson? Thousands. Big science is big for a reason. It was only a matter of time before the network acquired a new participant—one that could not just store information but imitate understanding itself.

The old distinction between information and skill, between “knowing that” and “knowing how,” has grown blurry in the era of large language models. In one sense, these models are static: a frozen matrix of weights you could download to your laptop. In another, they're dynamic; once running, they generate responses on the fly. They do what Socrates complained writing could not: They answer questions, adjust to an interlocutor, carry on a conversation. (Sometimes even with themselves; when they feed their own outputs back as inputs, AI researchers call it “reasoning.”) It wasn't hard to imagine Google as an extension of memory; a large language model feels, to many, more like a stand-in for the mind itself. In harnessing new forms of artificial intelligence, is our own intelligence being amplified—or is it the artificial kind that, on little cat feet, is coming into its own?

We can't put the genie back in the bottle; we can decide what spells to have it cast. When people talk about de-skilling, they usually picture an individual who's lost a knack for something—the pilot whose hand-flying gets rusty, the doctor who misses tumors without an AI assist. But most modern work is collaborative, and the arrival of AI hasn't changed that. The issue isn't how humans compare to bots but how humans who use bots compare to those who don't.

Alex Reisner: AI is coming for YouTube creators

Some people fear that reliance on AI will make us worse in ways that will swamp its promised benefits. Whereas Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, sanguinely imagines a “country of geniuses,” they foresee a country of idiots. It's an echo of the old debate over “risk compensation”: Add seatbelts or antilock brakes, some social scientists argued a few decades ago, and people will simply drive more recklessly, their tech-boosted confidence leading them to spend the safety margin. Research eventually showed a more encouraging result: People do adjust, but only partially, so that substantial benefits remain.

Something similar has seemed to hold for the clinical use of AI, which has been common in hospitals for more than a decade. Think back to that colonoscopy study: After performing AI-assisted procedures, gastroenterologists saw their unaided rate of polyp detection drop by six percentage points. But when another study pooled data from 24,000 patients, a fuller picture emerged: AI assistance raised overall detection rates by roughly 20 percent. (The AI here was an expert system—a narrow, reliable form of machine learning, not the generative kind that powers chatbots.) Because higher detection rates mean fewer missed cancers, this “centaur” approach was plainly beneficial, regardless of whether individual clinicians became fractionally less sharp. If the collaboration is saving lives, gastroenterologists would be irresponsible to insist on flying solo out of pride.

In other domains, the more skillful the person, the more skillful the collaboration—or so some recent studies suggest. One of them found that humans outperformed bots when sorting images of two kinds of wrens and two kinds of woodpeckers. But when the task was spotting fake hotel reviews, the bots won. (Game recognizes game, I guess.) Then the researchers paired people with the bots, letting the humans make judgments informed by the machine's suggestions. The outcome depended on the task. Where human intuition was weak, as with the hotel reviews, people second-guessed the bot too much and dragged the results down. Where their intuitions were good, they seemed to work in concert with the machine, trusting their own judgment when they were sure of it and realizing when the system had caught something they'd missed. With the birds, the duo of human and bot beat either alone.

The same logic holds elsewhere: Once a machine enters the workflow, mastery may shift from production to appraisal. A 2024 study of coders using GitHub Copilot found that AI use seemed to redirect human skill rather than obviate it. Coders spent less time generating code and more time assessing it—checking for logic errors, catching edge cases, cleaning up the script. The skill migrated from composition to supervision.

That, more and more, is what “humans in the loop” has to mean. Expertise shifts from producing the first draft to editing it, from speed to judgment. Generative AI is a probabilistic system, not a deterministic one; it returns likelihoods, not truth. When the stakes are real, skilled human agents have to remain accountable for the call—noticing when the model has drifted from reality, and treating its output as a hypothesis to test, not an answer to obey. It's an emergent skill, and a critical one. The future of expertise will depend not just on how good our tools are but on how well we think alongside them.

But collaboration presupposes competence. A centaur goes in circles if the human half doesn't know what it's doing. That's where the panic over pedagogy comes in. You can't become de-skilled if you were never skilled in the first place. And how do you inculcate basic competencies in an age when the world's best homework machine snuggles into every student's pocket?

Those of us who teach have a lot of homework of our own to do. Our old standbys need a rebuild; in the past couple of years, too many college kids have, in an unsettling phrase, ended up “majoring in ChatGPT.” Yet it's too soon to pronounce confidently what the overall pedagogical effect of AI will be. Yes, AI can dull some edges. Used well, it can also sharpen them.

Consider a recent randomized trial in a large Harvard physics course. Half of the students learned two lessons in the traditional “best practice” mode: an active, hands-on class led by a skilled instructor. The other half used a custom-built AI tutor. Then they switched. In both rounds, the AI-tutored students came out ahead—by a lot. They didn't just learn more. They worked faster, too, and reported feeling more motivated and engaged. The system had been designed to behave like a good coach: showing you how to break big problems into smaller ones, offering hints instead of blurting out answers, titrating feedback and adjusting to each student's pace.

Charlie Warzel: AI is a mass-delusion event

That's what made the old-style tutorial system powerful: attention. I remember my first weeks at Cambridge University, sitting one-on-one with my biochemistry tutor. When I said, “I sort of get it,” he pressed until we were both sure that I did. That targeted focus was the essence of a Cambridge supervision. If custom-fitted in the right way, large language models promise to mass-produce that kind of attention—not the cardigan, not the burnished briar, not the pensive moue, but the steady, responsive pressure that turns confusion into competence.

Machines won't replace mentors. What they promise to do is handle the routine parts of tutoring—checking algebra, drilling lemmas, reminding students to write the units, and making sure they grasp how membrane channels work. This, in theory, can free the teacher to focus on other things that matter: explaining the big ideas, pushing for elegance, talking about careers, noticing when a student is burning out.

That's the upbeat scenario, anyway. We should be cautious about generalizing from one study. (A study of Turkish high-school students found no real gains from the use of a tutor bot.) And we should be mindful that those physics students put their tutor bot to good use because they had in-class exams to face—a proctor, a stopwatch, a grader's cold eye.

We should also be mindful that what works for STEM courses may not work for the humanities. The term paper, for all its tedium, teaches a discipline that's hard to reproduce in conversation: building an argument step by step, weighing evidence, organizing material, honing a voice. Some of us who teach undergrads have started telling ambitious students that if they write a paper, we'll read and discuss it with them, but it won't count toward their grade. That's a salve, not a solution. In a curious cultural rewind, orality may have to carry more of the load. Will Socrates, dialogue's great defender, have the last word after all?

Erosive de-skilling remains a prospect that can't be wished away: the steady atrophy of basic cognitive or perceptual capacities through overreliance on tools, with no compensating gain. Such deficits can deplete a system's reserves—abilities you seldom need but must have when things go wrong. Without them, resilience falters and fragility creeps in. Think of the airline pilot who spends thousands of hours supervising the autopilot but freezes when the system does. Some automation theorists distinguish between “humans in the loop,” who stay actively engaged, and “humans on the loop,” who merely sign off after a machine has done the work. The second, poorly managed, produces what the industrial psychologist Lisanne Bainbridge long ago warned of: role confusion, diminished awareness, fading readiness. Like a lifeguard who spends most days watching capable swimmers in calm water, such human supervisors rarely need to act—but when they do, they must act fast, and deftly.

The same dynamic shadows office work of every kind. When lawyers, project managers, and analysts spend months approving what the system has already drafted or inferred, they become “on the loop,” and out of practice. It's the paradox of partial automation—the better the system performs, the less people have to stay sharp, and the less prepared they are for the rare moments when performance fails. The remedy probably lies in institutional design. For example, a workplace could stage regular drills—akin to a pilot's recurrent flight-simulator training—in which people must challenge the machine and ensure that their capacities for genuine judgment haven't decayed in the long stretches of smooth flight.

Reserve skills, in many cases, don't need to be universal; they just need to exist somewhere in the system, such as those elm experts. That's why the Naval Academy, alarmed by the prospect of GPS jamming, brought back basic celestial-navigation training after years of neglect. Most sailors will never touch a sextant on the high seas, but if a few of them acquire proficiency, they may be enough to steady a fleet if the satellites go dark. The goal is to ensure that at least some embodied competence survives, so that when a system stumbles, the human can still stand—or at least stay afloat.

The most troubling prospect of all is what might be called constitutive de-skilling: the erosion of the capacities that make us human in the first place. Judgment, imagination, empathy, the feel for meaning and proportion—these aren't backups; they're daily practices. If, in Jean-Paul Sartre's fearful formulation, we were to become “the machine's machine,” the loss would show up in the texture of ordinary life. What might vanish is the tacit, embodied knowledge that underwrites our everyday discernment. If people were to learn to frame questions the way the system prefers them, to choose from its menu of plausible replies, the damage wouldn't take the form of spectacular failures of judgment so much as a gradual attenuation of our character: shallower conversation, a reduced appetite for ambiguity, a drift toward automatic phrasing where once we would have searched for the right word, the quiet substitution of fluency for understanding. To offload those faculties would be, in effect, to offload ourselves. Losing them wouldn't simply change how we work; it would change who we are.

Most forms of de-skilling, if you take the long view, are benign. Some skills became obsolete because the infrastructure that sustained them also had. Telegraphy required fluency in dots and dashes; linotype, a deft hand at a molten-metal keyboard; flatbed film editing, the touch of a grease pencil and splicing tape, plus a mental map of where scenes lived across reels and soundtracks. When the telegraph lines, hot-metal presses, and celluloid reels disappeared, so did the crafts they supported.

Another kind of de-skilling represents the elimination of drudgery. Few of us mourn the loss of hand-scrubbing laundry, or grinding through long division on paper. A neuroscientist I know swears by LLMs for speeding the boilerplate-heavy business of drafting grant proposals. He's still responsible for the content, but if his grant-writing chops decline, he's unbothered. That's not science, in his view; it's a performance demanded by the research economy. Offloading some of it gives him back time for discovery.

Alex Reisner: The end of publishing as we know it

Occupational de-skilling can, in fact, be democratizing, widening the circle of who gets to do a job. For scientists who struggle with English, chatbots can smooth the drafting of institutional-review-board statements, clearing a linguistic hurdle that has little to do with the quality of their research. De-skilling here broadens access. Or think of Sennett's bakery and the Greek men who used to staff the kitchen floor. The ovens burned their arms, the old-fashioned dough beaters pulled their muscles, and heavy trays of loaves strained their back. By the '90s, when the system ran on a Windows controller, the workforce looked different: A multiethnic mix of men and women stood at the screens, tapping icons. The craft had shrunk; the eligible workforce had grown. (And yes, their labor had grown cheaper: a wider gate, a lower wage.)

We often lose skills simply because tech lets us put our time to better use and develop skills further up the proverbial value chain. At one of Zuboff's pulp mills, operators who were freed from manual activity could spend more time anticipating and forestalling problems. “Sitting in this room and just thinking has become part of my job,” one said. Zuboff called this reskilling: action skills giving way to abstraction and procedural reasoning, or what she termed “intellective skills.” Something similar happened with accountants after the arrival of spreadsheet programs such as VisiCalc; no longer tasked with totting up columns of numbers, they could spend more time on tax strategy and risk analysis.

More radical, new technologies can summon new skills into being. Before the microscope, there were naturalists but no microscopists: Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek had to invent the practice of seeing and interpreting the invisible. Filmmaking didn't merely borrow from theater; it brought forth cinematographers and editors whose crafts had no real precedent. Each leap enlarged the field of the possible. The same may prove true now. Working with large language models, my younger colleagues insist, is already teaching a new kind of craftsmanship—prompting, probing, catching bias and hallucination, and, yes, learning to think in tandem with the machine. These are emergent skills, born of entanglement with a digital architecture that isn't going anywhere. Important technologies, by their nature, will usher forth crafts and callings we don't yet have names for.

The hard part is deciding, without nostalgia and inertia, which skills are keepers and which are castoffs. None of us likes to see hard-won abilities discarded as obsolete, which is why we have to resist the tug of sentimentality. Every advance has cost something. Literacy dulled feats of memory but created new powers of analysis. Calculators did a number on mental arithmetic; they also enabled more people to “do the math.” Recorded sound weakened everyday musical competence but changed how we listen. And today? Surely we have some say in whether LLMs expand our minds or shrink them.

Throughout human history, our capabilities have never stayed put. Know-how has always flowed outward—from hand to tool to system. Individual acumen has diffused into collective, coordinated intelligence, propelled by our age-old habit of externalizing thought: stowing memory in marks, logic in machines, judgment in institutions, and, lately, prediction in algorithms. The specialization that once produced guilds now produces research consortia; what once passed among masters and apprentices now circulates through networks and digital matrices. Generative AI—a statistical condensation of human knowledge—is simply the latest chapter in our long apprenticeship to our own inventions.

The most pressing question, then, is how to keep our agency intact: how to remain the authors of the systems that are now poised to take on so much of our thinking. Each generation has had to learn how to work with its newly acquired cognitive prostheses, whether stylus, scroll, or smartphone. What's new is the speed and intimacy of the exchange: tools that learn from us as we learn from them. Stewardship now means ensuring that the capacities in which our humanity resides—judgment, imagination, understanding—stay alive in us. If there's one skill we can't afford to lose, it's the skill of knowing which of them matter.

The decay of Google, Amazon, and Facebook are part of a larger trend.

TikTok and airlines have something in common with your search engine, your grocery app, and (increasingly) your car: They start out great, lock you in, and then quietly get worse while you keep using them. That very familiar decline now has a catchy name: “enshittification.”

Cory Doctorow has been writing about this for decades as a journalist, activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and science-fiction author. His new book, Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It, is a field guide to how platforms decay, why they get away with it, and what it will take to reverse course.

I invited Doctorow onto The Gray Area to map the lifecycle of a platform, explain the policy choices that made today's tech feudalism possible, and outline the structural fixes that could make the internet (and the economy around it) less extractive and more humane.

As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What is “enshittification”? Give me the cleanest definition.

At the descriptive level, it's a pattern in how platforms go bad. First, they're great to end users. Then they find ways to lock those users in — switching costs, network effects, contracts, DRM — and once users are stuck, the company makes the product worse for them to extract more value. Next, they use that surplus to woo business customers (advertisers, sellers, creators), lock them in, and start making the product worse for the business side too. Eventually, everyone is trapped and the platform turns into a pile of crap. You can see this in places as different as Google, Facebook, Uber, and Amazon.

The more interesting question is: Why now? Greed isn't new. Venture capital isn't new. What changed were the constraints on firms, especially the degree of competition and the legal environment that lets platforms “twiddle” the experience for each user, while blocking users and rivals from pushing back.

When did the “great enshittification” begin? Can you put a stake in the ground?

There are obvious post-enshittification moments. In 2019, for example, the Google antitrust case records show an internal clash: Google had 90 percent market share in search, growth had stalled, and an executive pitched a strategy to make search worse so users would have to run multiple queries and see more ads. That's enshittification in a nutshell — and we all kept using Google anyway.

But it's not a single date. The defining feature isn't “things got worse” — it's “things got worse and we stayed.” The preconditions — consolidation, policy choices, and legal shields — built up over years.

Why do we keep using products after they get worse? Why not just leave?

“Platforms can constantly tweak what you see and what you pay, while users and independent developers are barred from looking under the hood or restoring balance.”

The galaxy-brain answer blames consumers for “shopping wrong,” or says, “If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.” That's not it. The real story is diminished constraint [on market consolidation]. It's hard to take your business elsewhere when there is nowhere else to go.

That was policy-driven. For decades, antitrust enforcers embraced the Chicago School idea that monopolies are efficient and should be punished only if prices go up for consumers — not when a company buys its most dangerous rival. Facebook's purchase of Instagram is the classic example. Mark Zuckerberg literally wrote that people were leaving Facebook for Instagram and that buying Instagram would keep them as Facebook users even if they never touched Facebook again. That's an antitrust admission in plain English. And yet the Obama administration waved it through, just as the Bush and Trump administrations green-lit their own waves of consolidation.

You emphasize that this corrosion is especially intense on platforms. Why are platforms such fertile soil for enshittification?

Because platforms sit between two groups that need each other: end users and business customers. That intermediation is useful, and most of us don't want to process payments or write our own mail servers just to publish a newsletter. But digital platforms have a unique superpower: They can change the business logic on a per-user, per-interaction basis. I call this “twiddling.”

Combine that with legal shields, and you get a one-way ratchet. Anti-circumvention laws (think DMCA §1201) make it illegal to reverse-engineer or “mod” an app or device to inspect, verify, or override what it's doing — even for lawful purposes like price comparison or accessibility. Platforms can constantly tweak what you see and what you pay, while users and independent developers are barred from looking under the hood or restoring balance.

Is this just a platform story, or is everything enshittifying?

It's spreading. When Jeff Bezos wants to change Amazon Fresh prices, he moves a slider. When he wants to change a Whole Foods shelf, he needs an army with price guns — unless the shelf labels are e-ink tags, which are rolling out everywhere. Once a sector is digitized, it's platformized — and the twiddling follows. That's how you get “dynamic” prices for fast food or “surge” pricing at the drive-thru. Even when companies walk back the PR, the trial balloon shows what's technologically trivial and what's hard for us to detect without the legal right to inspect the software.

Let's ground this in a few case studies. Facebook feels like the poster child. How did it enshittify?

Early Facebook wooed users by promising reverse-chronological feeds from the people you chose — no surveillance, no “boosted” junk. Users piled in. Then the collective-action trap kicked in: you love your friends, you hate the platform, but you can't coordinate a mass move. The larger Facebook gets, the harder it is to leave.

Once users were locked, Facebook twiddled to please business customers: “Give us a little money and we'll target your ad to exactly who you want.” “Publishers, put teasers on Facebook and we'll stuff them into eyeballs that didn't ask to see them; you'll get a free traffic funnel.” That locked the businesses in, too — a monopsony, where one buyer dominates sellers.

Then came the second squeeze: Ad targeting fidelity declined, fraud rose, and prices went up. Procter & Gamble famously cut $200 million in “programmatic” (surveillance) ads and saw no drop in sales, because so much of that spend was disappearing into the fraud hole. Meanwhile, users' feeds filled with paid content until what they asked to see was homeopathic residue. Everybody hated it; almost nobody left. That brittle equilibrium — “I hate this place but can't stop visiting” — is where platforms mint money.

How did Amazon enshittify?

Start with the demand side. In a consumption-driven economy with rising inequality, a shrinking share of households buys a disproportionate share of stuff, and most of those households have Prime. If you sell goods, you have to be on Amazon, and you have to pay to be found on Amazon.

Amazon's ad business — it was about $32B when I wrote the book; it's now north of $50B — isn't “advertising” in the classic sense. It's payola: Pay to be placed at the top of search results. That means the top result is often not the best price or best quality; it's who paid the most. On average, the first result is about 29 percent more expensive than the actual best deal; the entire top row is about 25 percent pricier; the true best buy is often buried around result 17 — into page two. Sellers game this by, say, selling four-packs instead of 10-packs so they look cheapest on a per-item sort, while the unit price is worse. Amazon knows unit sizes. It could let you sort by unit price. It doesn't.

“Structural problems need structural fixes.”

Then there's “most-favored nation” clauses: If you [as a goods-selling business] raise prices on Amazon to recoup Amazon's junk fees, you have to raise them everywhere else, including your own site. That's how Amazon's economics spread off-platform. And on the lock-in side, digital goods (Kindle books, Audible audiobooks, video) are wrapped in DRM; you [as a customer] leave Amazon, you lose your library. Prime pre-pays your shipping, and subscription mechanics (one credit per month) nudge you to keep using the store you've already funded. Exclusivity deals make rivals' catalogs worse by design.

What about the “you don't have to use Amazon” objection, because you can always just shop somewhere else?

There are switching costs and there's the scorched earth enshittification leaves behind. Uber is instructive: It subsidized rides to kill off taxis, then raised prices. In cities like mine, there might be a dozen cabs left; buses cut service because “everyone takes Uber”; on a 115-degree day, your “choice” is an Uber Black at $96 for a mile and a half or…walking with a suitcase. The alternatives exist — they just suck more now.

That's why I tell people: Don't moralize your shopping cart. Zephyr Teachout makes this point well: If you skip a labor rally at the warehouse because you're driving around looking for artisanal poster markers, so your sign won't be “tainted” by Amazon, Jeff Bezos wins. You are not an ambulatory wallet. Structural problems need structural fixes.

Your book points to four buckets: antitrust, regulation with teeth, interoperability (the right to move between services and jailbreak your stuff), and worker power. Which is most achievable right now?

In the US, the antitrust coalition that briefly united Ted Cruz and Elizabeth Warren has mostly evaporated; the vibe is transactional. I'm more optimistic about foreign antitrust — the EU, UK, and others are motivated to reduce their dependence on American platforms, especially when US firms admit they can't guarantee EU state secrets won't be reachable under secret US orders. That geopolitical incentive produces muscular cases and new rules (see the EU's DMA/DSA).

Worker power is also ripening. Tech workers are realizing they're workers — not “founders in waiting.” The average Silicon Valley engineer generates about $1 million in revenue; now there've been hundreds of thousands of layoffs, and management is dangling AI as a way to make you feel replaceable. When bosses aren't afraid of you, you get Foxconn-style treatment. Unions are the answer. Yes, the administration has kneecapped the NLRB, but that misunderstands the history: Unions didn't arise because law permitted them; law permitted unions because workers organized anyway. If you've fired the referees, there are no rules left — and solidarity across sectors becomes even more powerful.

What is enshittification doing to our politics?

It breeds trauma and nihilism. Ask a vaccine skeptic why they're skeptical: “Pharma is greedy and would kill us for a nickel; the FDA is captured and will let them.” In the wake of the opioid crisis — where the Sacklers made tens of billions while communities were gutted — that's not an irrational story. Regulatory capture is downstream of monopolization: When there are five firms, they sing from the same hymn sheet; when there are 500, regulators hear discordant demands. Capture produces failure; failure produces trauma; trauma makes people vulnerable to grifters who tell them to tan their perineum and eat horse paste.

People say the answer is “restore trust” in agencies. I think the answer is “make the agencies trustworthy” — and the only way to do that is to break up the firms that captured them and restore healthy rivalry.

Are we nearing a tipping point where the pendulum swings back toward consumers and sanity?

There's a finance maxim called Stein's Law: “If something can't go on forever, it will stop.” You can only extract so much rent before there's nothing left. What comes next is up for grabs. I don't do predictions; the future isn't a place we discover, it's a place we make.

What gives me hope is what my friend James Boyle says about “ecology.” Before that word entered the lexicon, you could care about owls and I could care about the ozone layer, and we'd both be “right” without realizing we were on the same side. A shared frame reveals a common cause. Today, the shared frame is the fight against consolidated corporate power. If we connect the dots — between your crappy search results, your locked-down car, your exploding drug prices, your brittle supply chains, and your polarized feeds — we can build a coalition with enough mass to change the rules.

Her divisive new album was all part of her agenda. She's a mastermind.

Even with 38 ways to buy it, Taylor Swift's fans aren't living for The Life of a Showgirl.

When Swift dropped her 12th studio album earlier this month, people were already primed to hate it. As part of her rollout, she released a concerning amount of products around the release. From “The Shiny Bug Vinyl Collection” to the “Showgirl Cardigan Boxed Set,” many people weren't excited to fork over more money for an exclusive version of her album.

Then came the music.

The 12-track record got mixed reviews; it was divisive even among her biggest fans. Some critics said it was cringey, disappointing, and that her music has “never been less compelling.” Upon this reception, Swift said, “I have a lot of respect for people's subjective opinions on art. I'm not the art police.”

Ann Powers, a music critic at NPR, says this is all part of the Taylor Swift agenda. Powers makes the case that at the height of her success, Swift is now playing a villain on purpose. We spoke with her about Swift's showgirl mentality, hyper-personal lyrics, and why she'll likely come out stronger on the other end of this record's hate train.

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

The Life of a Showgirl was released three weeks ago. Has your thinking evolved at all?

I found it really interesting to observe the backlash against Taylor Swift, which is more intense this year and with this release than it was with her previous release. I'm most interested in how both critics and the general public are now responding to Taylor in a very different way than they did even about the Eras Tour. I imagine her clinging to a giant pendulum as it swings back and forth.

And this is possibly inevitable with anyone of her stature. But I really think we're seeing it play out that Taylor Swift has become the avatar for so many of our anxieties, so many of our dissatisfactions.

But two things happened with his album. The first is that there are so many variants: There's a Target exclusive, “Crowd Is Your King” vinyl; there's the hairbrush that falls apart; there's a “Tiny Bubbles in Champagne” collection. 

And then there's the fact that a lot of people, when the album first dropped, decided they didn't really like it. How do we square those two things? Do those two facts depend on one another?

They're in a relationship with one another. I'm not sure if they depend on one another. What's interesting about the backlash [to] the album itself is that it seems to have been triggered by the leak of the lyrics for a particular song, “Actually Romantic,” which is the song that allegedly is aimed at the pop star Charli XCX. And I think the timing of that leak was a big negative for the reception of this album.

But it's not like: and then we realized that Taylor Swift is rich. How did everyone become so irritated about the same thing?

This has been building for a while. After The Tortured Poets Department came out, I've started to see more and more online chatter about Taylor Swift's wealth, her social status, and her choice to continue to write songs in which she is the “underdog,” even though she is so on top of the world. Not coincidentally, this was going on as a larger backlash has been brewing against very wealthy Americans in general.

And Taylor's response is what exactly?

Well, Swift did a small number of interviews upon the release of the record, and in one of them, on The Zane Lowe Show on Apple Music, she basically said, “I'm not the art police. I am okay with how anyone responds to this album.”

And that has been a notable part of this backlash. It's not only professional critics, it's not only online trolls who never liked Taylor Swift anyway. A lot of very diehard Taylor fans are also publicly raising doubts about their hero.

A lot of people have asked whether a person can create great art when they are rich and happy. I remember when Cowboy Carter came out, and there was this line in one of the songs where Beyoncé talked about being overworked and overwhelmed. And that line really triggered people. This is a similar type of pushback. 

Beyoncé did something very smart and very deft. She did it out of conviction, which is that at a certain point in her career, she stopped speaking so much personally as representatively. She started connecting her personal stories with the history of racism and oppression. She's continued to do that. Also uplifting her family, uplifting her community, as she's defined it. She has managed to sort of make her music bigger than herself — make her art bigger than herself.

Consider that next to Taylor Swift. She has very much clung to autobiography as the center of what she does. And it's harder to kind of figure out how exactly she would have consciously and righteously made herself representative of anything or anyone besides herself.

Beyoncé is, you're arguing, very clearly evolving. What do you make of the critique that this album is an example — not that Taylor Swift isn't a great artist, but that she's not growing?

I find it strange that being a pop star and producing albums is sort of being talked about as if it is a life journey of self-improvement. Did we ask that of Mick Jagger? I don't necessarily think we did. Another thing is: I don't have any problem with someone writing songs about adolescence for their whole life. That's fine with me.

Now do you want to hear my theory about the record?

You're damn right I do.

I don't think Taylor Swift made this record to make more money. Does she need the money? Obviously not. She's a capitalist. I do think, however, that she's very interested in controlling her public narrative and controlling the narrative that she's building through her albums. She's very focused on her music being the center of everything.

And I think she made this record because she is now in a happier place in her life. She needed a marker on the highway that said, “Hey, I'm happy now. I'm in control. I have power. I no longer feel the way I felt when I was wallowing in my own misery.”

So do I blame her for that? No, I don't blame her for that. I get it completely. But let's recognize it for what it is. It's a marker on her highway. She's going to go somewhere else pretty soon.

It's cuffing season for chipmakers.

As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars.

There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner.

One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a ""big cost,"" adding, ""If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company.""

It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening.

Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley.

It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a ""semi-retirement"" mode.

""A lot of them have families,"" one Nvidia employee said, ""and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'""

The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

""Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years,"" said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi.

One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, ""Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement.""

In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000.

Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million.

In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000.

Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each.

One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a ""lottery winner syndrome,"" meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere.

""The golden handcuffs are RSUs,"" the former Broadcom employee said. ""No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities.""

Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent.

Nvidia said that ""RSUs promote retention"" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years.

Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is ""below the technology industry benchmark."" It cited equity awards as a ""powerful long-term retention incentive,"" saying it has ""historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees.""

The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — ""are just resting and vesting."" The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings.

According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to ""front-load"" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent.

It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts.

Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK.

""In private conversations I've had with others,"" another former Broadcom employee said, ""they're quite pleased with RSUs.""

In a 2009 interview, a 25-year-old Mark Zuckerberg offered a grand prognosis on the human condition. ""You have one identity,"" the Facebook founder said. ""The days of you having a different image for your work friends or coworkers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly. Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.""

At the time, his five-year-old social network was shaping the identities of more than 350 million people. Like Sergey Brin and Larry Page with their mission to ""organize the world's information"" with Google, like Steve Jobs when he put the internet in our pockets, Zuck was becoming something of the world's new Minister of Thought — influencing how humans conceived of themselves and one another as they communicated at an unprecedented scale.

Today, 16 years and arguably several identities later (from the hoodie-wearing ""I'm CEO, bitch"" wunderkind to the suit-wearing presidential prospect to the shirtless jiu jitsu-fighting MAGA beefcake), Zuck is starting to cede that title to another tech leader who is shaping human cognition at perhaps an even grander scale, Sam Altman.

ChatGPT, just three years old, has more than 800 million weekly users, at least 40 times Facebook's audience three years in. OpenAI is now the most valuable private company worldwide. Ten percent of the world's adults use its flagship chatbot on a monthly basis — for writing emails and scouring the web, planning trips, decoding medical mysteries, or finding love.

Where Zuck taught us to post, Altman teaches us to prompt. If the past twenty years were about curating who we are, the next may be about creating who we want to be.

Facebook rewired how we see ourselves and each other. Posts, pokes, photos, and likes stitched together a specific digital avatar. Instagram gave us filters. The feed's ranking systems rewarded the glossiest slice of life — the latté foam art and dopamine décor. Zuckerberg promised to ""bring the world closer together."" He didn't say we'd show up unvarnished.

Altman's world is generation, not just presentation. Filters that boost saturation and darken edges have been supplanted by ""Ghiblified"" photo edits. Sora lets users turn rough ideas into hyperreal videos. I cast myself in a fake space opera; Mark Cuban tap danced with the late Ginger Rogers. These tools don't polish reality so much as draft new versions of it.

I've seen the appeal up close. My husband, historically terrible at gifts, recently nailed it on my birthday: gold hoops and a Catbird necklace with our daughter's initial. His confession — ""I used ChatGPT"" — felt both cute and slightly disorienting. If a bot is co-authoring intimacy, what else are we outsourcing? Holiday cards, wedding toasts, and homework may be just the start.

The office is already there. Studies suggest generative tools can speed up knowledge work and lift quality, especially for low performers. Emails became more polished, decks more dazzling. That power also comes with a catch: more ""workslop"" to sift and lower productivity if misused.

There's a bigger platform shift underneath all of this. Facebook's feed once redistributed attention outward. Publishers lived and died by referral traffic. AI flips the model. Large language models ingest the open web and answer queries in its place. Where Zuckerberg built a web of people and links, Altman built a funnel. The user asks, it synthesizes. That convenience is already hitting publishers.

Zuckerberg started Facebook to connect his Harvard class. His ambitions went global. Facebook groups knit together new parents, bird watchers, English learners, and Bronies. The company has expanded internet access in developing countries.

The same algorithms that brought us closer also sorted us apart. Ranking systems fed people more of what they already agreed with, hardening echo chambers. Critics accused Facebook of supercharging conspiracies and ""fake news"" — around elections, the environment, and health.

Altman isn't auditioning as a great communitarian. His concerns lie with the human-to-machine connection.

People are consulting ChatGPT as ""a sort of therapist or life coach,"" Altman said, a trend he admitted made him feel ""uneasy."" Others are falling in love with the chatbot. Soon, a gated adult mode will offer erotica for personalized fantasy on demand. That's the shift from the public square to private rooms.

Early evidence points to extreme tradeoffs. In March, a study from OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab found that ChatGPT heightened feelings of loneliness in a group of power users. Last month, parents of two teens who died by suicide after talking to chatbots testified to Congress about the technology's harms.

Zuckerberg still regulates humanity's attention; Meta has some 3.5 billion daily active users across its products. He has credited fast-improving algorithms with putting content people actually want in front of them, increasing time spent on the company's apps in the second quarter. Altman is moving into intention, the first — and in some cases final — draft of what we say and do.

Zuckerberg isn't ceding the future to Altman. He's desperately trying to catch up: billions in capex for data centers and chips, Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressive, NBA superstar-level offers to poach researchers. In July, Facebook published a new manifesto: ""personal superintelligence for everyone,"" essentially echoing the frontier Altman staked out.

There's upside. Coauthoring with machines can widen who gets to sound sharp, ship better work, or just be kinder in the group chat. There's also creep. The more we rely on a model as our first reader and first responder, the easier it is to mistake its output for our own thinking.

In the age of social media, we shaped and curated our identity — or identities — for the computer. In the age of AI, the computer is starting to shape and curate our identities for us.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Annie Liao, a 24-year-old startup founder based in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.

After raising $1.75 million in the pre-seed round for my startup last year, I quit my job and moved from Australia to San Francisco to go all in as a solo founder.

The reality of being a solo founder has been a lot harder than I thought it would be. It can get lonely and difficult at times, but living with a built-in support system of other founders helps. We all uprooted our lives, left behind our loved ones, and moved here to build startups, so we think of each other like family.

Now I'm living in a hacker house, where our dining table is covered in laptops and monitors instead of flowers — and it's one of the best decisions I've made.

After raising the pre-seed funding for Build Club, an AI learning hub aimed at democratizing access to AI education, I now have a team of five who work around the world, but I live in San Francisco.

I've always wanted to live in San Francisco. It's the beating pulse of AI, and there are so many insanely ambitious and talented people to be surrounded by.

You can literally walk into a coffee shop and end up in a two-hour deep dive conversation about AI agents or someone's YC application. Everyone's dreaming big, and you can feel that optimism in the air. It's a nice place to build a startup.

What surprised me most about San Francisco was how generous people are with their time. It's a real ""pay it forward"" culture, and people actually want to see each other win.

Of course, there are downsides. Some streets don't feel safe, and the contrast between incredible wealth and deep struggle is hard to ignore. Plus, I think Australia has better healthcare and is just more chill.

During a visit to San Francisco before I moved, I met the person who ran Mission Control, one of San Francisco's oldest hacker houses, and she told me they had empty rooms available. I later moved there for my first few months in San Francisco.

I met three other founders there, and we decided to move into a more intimate place. We named our hacker house ""The Stables"" because it's our place of stability in San Francisco and because it's a breeding ground for unicorns. As a solo founder, I don't have a cofounder to tell everything to, so living with other founders has been really important.

I've probably leaned on my housemates too many times, whether for emotional support or even to share an employee. We've had some really great moments together. The day before one of our launches, we stayed up late, and one of my roommates bought us food to celebrate.

We also cook for each other when possible or go out to dinner together. We're all very time-poor and come home exhausted, so it's convenient to be able to knock on someone's door to ask if they want to grab dinner. Every Sunday, we even go on a hike together to step away from work and touch some grass, which is always a highlight of my week.

Our shared spaces definitely get messy, especially during busy periods, but we like to clean together. There's also less privacy and quiet than if I lived alone, but it's just nice to have people around.

When I look at founders on social media, they often only show the highlights, but living with other founders has been very humanizing and comforting. For example, you might see online that a founder raised a successful pre-seed round, but in reality, they're crying on the couch of the hacker house because an employee they really wanted said no.

I remember there was one time when all of us were having really rough weeks — one of us was fundraising their round, and everyone else was working until 1 a.m. every day. We were all locked in, and our laptops and monitors were everywhere.

I usually wake up at 6:30 a.m. and spend my mornings doing deep work. My team is split across time zones, so my afternoons consist of calls with people in other regions. When I return home in the evening, I usually have more calls with team members who come online even later.

Then, my roommates and I might cook together or go for a walk around the park to de-stress. Most nights, we end by lighting candles in the living room, playing deep house music, and coworking until 12 or 1 a.m.

Most people in San Francisco are very tech-obsessed, so I don't like to spend more than two months here at a time. I usually go back to Australia to spend time with my family and ground myself, or I go to a place like Bali, where there's a focus on well-being.

The hardest part about being away from Australia is definitely the distance, both personally and professionally. Many of our early supporters and part of our team are still in Australia, and our customer base is split between there and the US.

My whole family's back home. When my niece was born, I wish I could've just teleported back. However, the balance has helped me stay a bit more sane and appreciate both places more.

Emma Stone, 36, is regarded as one of the best actors of her generation. She's been nominated for four Oscars and won two in the best actress category (""La La Land"" in 2017 and ""Poor Things"" in 2024).

Her range is seemingly unlimited, tugging at hearts in the rom-com ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" (2011), playing tennis legend Billie Jean King in ""Battle of the Sexes"" (2017), and even getting a taste of the superhero genre starring opposite Andrew Garfield in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012) and its sequel.

Stone's latest movie, ""Bugonia,"" marks her fourth feature film collaborating with director Yorgos Lanthimos. In it, Stone plays a CEO who is abducted by two conspiracy theorists who believe she is an alien. Like her previous work with Lanthimos, ""Bugonia"" is being praised by critics and holds an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of publication.

But Stone hasn't always been a critical darling. Here's a breakdown of the best and worst movies in Stone's career, according to the critic rankings on Rotten Tomatoes.

Critics Score: 89%

This spoof on the zombie genre stars Stone as a survivor of the zombie apocalypse who teams with three others on a cross-country trip to find a sanctuary zone.

Critics Score: 91%

In Alejandro G. Iñárritu's ambitious dark dramedy, Stone plays Sam, a recovering addict and the daughter of actor Riggan (Keaton). The two try to re-establish their broken relationship when Sam works as an assistant on Riggan's Broadway show.

Critics Score: 91%

An aspiring actress (Stone) and a struggling jazz pianist (Gosling) fall in love while pursuing their dreams in Damien Chazelle's breathtaking musical. Stone would go on to win her first best actress Oscar for the role.

Critics Score: 92%

In this outlandish Yorgos Lanthimos tale set in Victorian London, Stone plays Bella Baxter, a woman who died by suicide who is brought back to life thanks to a scientist (Willem Dafoe) who replaces her brain with that of an infant. Bella then takes on life in childlike wonder.

Critics Score: 93%

Marking the first time Stone worked with Lanthimos, this dark comedy set in 1700s England features Stone and Weisz as cousins who engage in absurd antics to outdo each other and become the favorite of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman).

Critics Score: 30%

Stone teamed with ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer for this gangster movie starring Gosling, Josh Brolin, Nick Nolte, and Sean Penn as infamous real-life mob boss Mickey Cohen. Critics and audiences were less than enthusiastic.

Critics Score: 27%

Early in Stone's career, she signed on to this romantic comedy headed by McConaughey and Jennifer Garner with a plot based on Charles Dickens' classic, ""A Christmas Carol."" (Yes, you read that correctly.) Needless to say, the movie was hammered by critics.

Critics Score: 20%

Not only is this movie writer-director Cameron Crowe's lowest-rated score on Rotten Tomatoes, but Stone was also thrust into a whitewashing controversy for playing a character who is part Chinese, which she is not in real life.

Critics Score: 9%

This big-screen version of the legendary comic strip stars Owen Wilson voicing Marmaduke. Stone voiced Mazie, an energetic Australian Shepherd.

Critics Score: 5%

Stone joined the likes of Richard Gere, Kate Winslet, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, and Elizabeth Banks to star in this anthology comedy made up of 14 short movies. Some critics regard it as one of the worst movies ever made.

With only two points separating Spain's football giants after nine games in La Liga, the first El Clásico of the season gives both a chance to assert their dominance. To help you see who comes out on top, we've compiled this guide on where to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, no matter where you are this weekend.

Thankfully for any soccer fan who hates to see one team in a country dominate, you never quite know what way the topsy-turvy Real Madrid vs. Barcelona rivalry will turn next. Barcelona currently hold the bragging rights in Spain, having done the double over their fierce rivals on the way to taking back the La Liga crown last season and beating them 3-2 in a memorable Copa del Rey final.

But it's Xabi Alonso's side who have started fastest this time around, with talismanic striker Kylian Mbappé already notching up 10 league goals. They recovered from a thumping 5-2 loss across the capital to Atlético to overcome Villarreal and Getafe domestically. And now it seems even Jude Bellingham has got his mojo back, with his lone goal inspiring Los Blancos to a win over Juventus in the Champions League during the week.

It may still be early in the season, but Hansi Flick will know that a win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to leapfrog Real will be a massive psychological boost to Robert Lewandowski, Ferran Torres, and co. To see if the champions can pull it off, follow the information below to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona live streams in the US, UK, Spain, or anywhere else you happen to be in the world this Sunday.

US: ESPN2

Spain: 

Access streaming anywhere:

Keen watchers of La Liga in the US have options when it comes to where to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona on Sunday, with ESPN2 the main linear channel carrying El Clásico. If you don't already have access to ESPN channels, then a subscription to the ESPN streaming service is an affordable choice. Its entry-level ESPN Select tier (formerly ESPN Plus) costs $13 a month on a rolling basis and will let you watch the game on a wide variety of devices.


                      ESPN Select, formerly ESPN Plus, offers select coverage from ESPN properties. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year.
                    

If sports are your thing, then you could also consider going for a more comprehensive ESPN Unlimited plan instead. From $30 a month, it includes everything that the various ESPN channels have to offer, so that means action from the NFL, NBA, and WWE in addition to Spain's best soccer. And, for a limited time, you can save 40% when you bundle with Disney Plus and Hulu.


                      ESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.
                    

DirecTV MySports also offers an array of premium sports channels. The month-to-month provider offers CNN, FS1/FS2, NBA TV, NFL Network, Golf Channel, and TNT alongside ESPN Unlimited, all for $70 a month, with a $10 discount off your first two months. MySports comes with a five-day free trial for first-time customers.


                      DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. 
                    

Fubo Sports is another sports-focused cable replacement product featuring ESPN Unlimited alongside 29 channels. Not sure if Fubo is for you? Try before you buy with its 5-day free trial. It costs $56 a month, but you can get $10 off your first month.


                      The new Fubo Sports + News pack is only available in select areas. It combines 20+ major sports channels (including the new ESPN Unlimited) and select local networks (ABC, CBS, and FOX).
                    

Premier Sports has the exclusive rights to show 2025/26 La Liga matches — including this Real Madrid vs. Barcelona encounter — in the UK on TV and online. It will air on the network's Premier Sports 1 channel. Premier Sports costs £17 a month on a rolling basis, with annual subscriptions costing £120 upfront or £12 a month. If you already have a pay-TV plan from any of the following providers, you can choose to add Premier Sports through those: Sky TV, Virgin Media, and Amazon Prime Video.

In Spain, you have the choice of where to stream this Real Madrid vs. Barcelona match in La Liga. Firstly there's Movistar's La Liga plan that costs €35 a month and includes live action from the country's top two tiers. While certain DAZN plans will also give you access to El Clasico. The most affordable is DAZN Fútbol that currently costs just €10 a month thanks to a special limited-time offer.

Considering the size and status of La Liga and its big two teams, Spanish football is now shown in many countries worldwide. But you may find yourself in a country this weekend that doesn't broadcast it. Or perhaps you already pay for a subscription service that would normally show Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, but it's blocked because you've traveled overseas. Both are frustrating scenarios that can be alleviated by using a VPN, or virtual private network.

VPNs allow you to spoof your IP address so that your smartphone, laptop, or other streaming device thinks it's in another country altogether. They're really secure, too, thanks to their military-grade encrypted tunnels. NordVPN is so secure and easy to use that it's easy to recommend for streaming soccer and anything else. You can try it out before you properly commit, too, thanks to its 30-day money-back guarantee. Read our NordVPN review to find out more, click through below, and subscribe straight away.


                      NordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.
                    

Note: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.

My husband and I live in a four-bedroom, two-bath house with our three young adult children — ages 18 to 22 — and two of their significant others. This type of living arrangement has pros and cons.

The sink and trash cans are full every time you turn around, but there are also additional helping hands. Our driveway looks like a used car lot, but there is no shortage of people who can grab a gallon of milk on their way home. In many ways, it's like living in a hostel where people come and go at all hours of the day and night. You share the same roof, but everyone lives very separate lives.

To be clear, this was never part of the grand life plan. But with the cost of living being what it is, my husband and I faced a choice: let our oldest son move out and live in his car with his girlfriend (which was their plan), or let them move in with us while they save for their own place. Then our future son-in-law joined the party so he could save dorm costs, finish college, and afford to tie the knot and move out by the end of the year.

In situations like this, where alone time exists only as a theoretical concept, self-care is no longer a luxury — it's a matter of survival. I've integrated three self-care rituals into my lifestyle that, I believe, have kept me sane.

For me, sunshine and movement are essential. Daily walks are nonnegotiable as they reconnect me with nature and remind me that the world is bigger than my overflowing house. I find sanctuary in outdoor chores or carrying my laptop to the porch.

I have my smartwatch remind me if I haven't stepped away from my computer in the last hour. When I get that buzz, I don't just cycle the laundry — I step outside to water the plants, check the mail, or go for a walk.

Anything I can do to catch some extra sunshine is a good thing.

My second self-care ritual is setting intentional boundaries to safeguard my marriage. This includes weekly date nights that don't bust the budget. We may share a homemade meal or lock ourselves away to watch a show together, and during these times, we consider ourselves ""off-duty."" It's just about disconnecting from the demands of the people living in our house and reconnecting with each other.

And, yes, sometimes life happens and we get interrupted by perceived emergencies, but we are more able to roll with the punches when we know another break is within reach.

As a special treat this year, we threw in a road trip. For six blissful days, we left our laptops at home, only checked our phones once each morning, and were otherwise completely off duty.

These breaks are not about ignoring family; they're about protecting the partnership that will outlast our current living situation.

My third self-care ritual is releasing my own personal pressure valve by venting to someone. Without it, I get a little twitch in my right eyelid, and I get snappy. Eventually, something small, like a half-drank water bottle that was abandoned in the living room (again!), sets me off.

So I've learned to vent before that happens. This is often a conversation with my husband or a close friend around a campfire. Each session starts with a mutually agreed-upon question: Do you need advice, or are you just venting?

That simple question changes everything.

Having someone to listen releases the steam that is building inside me and allows me to breathe without the person listening feeling like they need to ""fix"" something.

What all of these rituals have in common is that I intentionally integrate them into everyday life. I don't hide that these things are requirements for my sanity. I say, ""I can't do that until after my walk,"" or ""I would love to do that with you, but tonight is my off-duty night. Does tomorrow work?""

The more I normalize these pauses, the more the household respects them. As a bonus, the consistent modeling of self-care encourages others to self-reflect on their own self-care needs.

In a busy home, carving out space for yourself is more of a mental game than a physical one. When I take these small but consistent steps, I notice that I'm calmer and kinder. I respond rather than react.

That's not just better for me. It's better for everyone.

I'm addicted to my car.

Even in a densely-packed city like San Francisco, I couldn't imagine getting around without it.

But I also hate my car.

It's a little silly to think that I need to start and stop a couple-ton vehicle just to drive a few minutes to my friend's house or to grab groceries. I also think about the painful amount of money I've spent due to a cracked wheel from a pothole, flattened tires from a perfectly placed nail, or the driver who sideswiped me after they blew a red light. That was all within the past year.

If I could get rid of my car, I would.

ALSO, a startup that began as a skunkworks inside Rivian is trying really hard to replace our large vehicles — at least for some trips.

""The name ALSO is very intentional. It's not an either-or proposition,"" Ben Steele, ALSO's chief commercial officer, told me. ""I think what we're really seeking to do with our products is to say to people: 'The unexamined choice of just defaulting to a car? We want to reframe that for you.'""

I met the executives of ALSO on a Saturday afternoon at their office in Palo Alto, just across the street from Rivian's office, where they gave me a chance to try the product: a $4,500 e-bike. ALSO is calling it the T-MB for ""Transcendent Mobility Bike.""

Chris Yu, the president of the startup, told me that the ""genesis"" behind ALSO was simple: ""Why doesn't that magical experience you get out of a Rivian exist in anything smaller than a car?""

Having seen the bike up close and hearing the executives talk about the TM-B, I can clearly see where Rivian's vertically integrated approach and even the design language are ingrained into the bike.

Yu said the startup is growing, from about 75 employees in March to over 150 employees today. ALSO is building a second office, located less than a mile away.

Here's a closer look at the TM-B and the executives behind ALSO.

Yu has an extensive background in biking.

He told me he raced competitively in college and continued to do so throughout his years at Specialized Bicycle Components, a bike manufacturer, where he spent more than 10 years and led the company as the chief product and technology officer.

Yu's not doing much racing these days, but he still bikes often with his son.

Yu said he'd take his son to school on the back of his bike, one of the use cases ALSO kept in mind for the development of the TM-B. Both the father and son are intimately aware of the pain points for e-bikes.

""Every other bike that we've used when we hit potholes and the speed bump in his school parking lot, he'd always get bounced around, and he always just thought that was the norm,"" Yu said.

""The payload capacity to carry a 75-pound kid on the back does not exist,"" he added.

Yu said that the TM-B was designed with a one-bike-fits-all approach. He said that one of the first pain points for consumers is deciding which type of e-bike to buy in the first place.

""We wanted to build in as much breadth of personality, utility, and capability into one platform as much as possible to remove that kind of initial friction and pain point,"" Yu said.

I had the opportunity to try the launch edition, which has a starting price of $4,500. The base edition will start under $4,000. ALSO plans to launch in 2026.

The TM-B stands apart from most e-bikes on the market due to its pedal-by-wire system. That means the pedals aren't mechanically linked to a chain that moves the tires. Instead, the pedals are attached to a generator, which provides the power to move you forward.

That also means there's no gear shifting in the traditional sense. There is a manual mode where you can ""shift"" gears, and you'll feel a haptic feedback on the pedals that indicates when you're changing gears.

I found that this propulsion system made going up a hill seamless. The bike didn't require much more pedaling effort when I went up a hill.

The TM-B is a class 3 bike, giving a pedal-assist speed of up to 28 mph and a throttle that assists the rider for up to 20 mph.

A standard battery pack delivers up to 60 miles of range. The large battery pack provides up to 100 miles of range.

The regenerative braking system can extend the range by around 25%, according to the company.

Riders can also use the battery as a portable charger for their electronic devices.

Much like a Rivian, a rider can walk up to the TM-B to turn on the bike since it's connected to the user's phone.

It's a ""software-defined"" bike, Yu said, which allows for over-the-air updates and an easy user experience straight out of the box.

At around 70 pounds, the TM-B is not a traditional bike that a rider would lug up several floors of their apartment building.

Yu said the company envisions riders treating the bike more like a car that you could feel comfortable leaving inside a parking structure.

Kelly Veit, VP of software, said the bike is equipped with Wi-Fi, LTE, and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) connectivity for location tracking purposes and anti-theft protection.

If the bike senses motion, the owner is alerted on their phone. If the bike is stolen, the owner can track its location and ""brick"" it, making it essentially unrideable.

ALSO executives showed me three attachments: one for the solo rider, one that allows for up to 75 pounds of payload, including a small child or groceries, and a ""bench"" for more comfortable riding.

All the modular seat attachments are equipped with lights on the back that also serve as turn signals.

For bikers, that means no longer having to stick their arm out to indicate when they're about to make a turn.

The headlight serves as a daytime running light and a turn signal.

Yu said that the light can also indicate the battery charge status and show the progress of over-the-air updates.

The throttle on the TM-B is set to a maximum speed of 20 mph, as per federal regulations for e-bikes, allowing the bike to reach that speed without pedaling.

Saul Leiken, director of product line, said the bike was designed to accelerate ""basically as fast as a car can coming off of a stop sign.""

""I'm not talking a zero to 60 type of thing,"" he said, ""but if you're running a little late to work, that allows you to ride with traffic instead of being in traffic's way.""

Yu said the throttle is helpful to quickly move out of intersections.

Due to its fewer moving parts, Yu said the frequency of servicing the T-MB should be much lower than that of traditional bikes.

The president said ALSO is working on several ways for riders to bring in their bikes: a ""small brick-and-mortar footprint across the country,"" a mobile service fleet, and a network of authorized service providers.

Additionally, ALSO can notify users via telemetry if there is an issue with the bike, he said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Erin Smith, a 47-year-old a freelance marketer and founder of the travel blog Gluten-Free Globetrotter, who moved to Montreal in 2024. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I was born and raised in New York and spent my last twenty years living in Brooklyn. I just didn't want to be anywhere else.

Not even in 2016, when I moved with my then-boyfriend, who is now my husband, to Santa Cruz. Even though it was beautiful there, I just wasn't happy. I had to get back to the city, back to New York. So we moved after only two and a half years in California.

I thought I wouldn't be moving again, but in 2024, my husband got a really good job opportunity in Montreal. He's an agronomist who works in indoor agriculture. He had the opportunity to help start up a greenhouse division for a national company there, which was right up his alley.

As you can imagine, there's not a lot of agriculture in New York City. I'm a freelance marketer and can work from anywhere, but for my husband, it really was the perfect job at the perfect time.

We had to wait for my son to finish the school year in New York, so from January to July, we focused on planning the move.

The thought of leaving New York was really hard. I mean, all my friends and family are there. And even though Canada isn't geographically far from New York, it's still a different environment — especially Quebec, which is a French-speaking province.

I kept thinking back to when we moved to California, which hadn't been a good fit for us. ""Oh God, this is going to happen again,"" kept running through my mind. This, plus the overwhelming feeling of how much we'd have to learn about Quebec, led me to hire a relocation coach.

She's a digital nomad who's lived all over the world, and she helped me a lot — not so much with the logistics of moving, but more with realizing that the things that were important to me in New York would still be important to me in Canada, and that there are ways to incorporate them into my new life.

We visited Quebec a few times before our move to scout out neighborhoods and schools. It was important for me to visit during the winter because it's very cold and snowy here, which I wasn't used to living in New York City.

Our last visit before the move was in April, and we literally had a week to find a place. Unlike in New York, where you can find a rental at any time of year, in Montreal, many leases start on July 1 and run through the end of June the following year.

My husband works in rural Quebec, and we couldn't live there for many reasons, but we're very happy with where we landed. We live in a great neighborhood in Westmount, in the southwest part of Montreal. We're right near a metro station and can walk to downtown Montreal from our apartment. I feel very lucky.

When we moved, our goal was to spend less on rent than we did in New York. In Brooklyn, we lived in a duplex with a backyard, which is pretty rare there — we got really lucky during COVID-19, when everyone was leaving the city. We paid about $3,500 there; here I'm paying roughly $1,000 less. While we've lost our outdoor space, we gained a washer and dryer, a luxury I never had in 20 years of living in Brooklyn.

Quebec's primary language is French, so navigating the region's bureaucracy and school system has been challenging.

In Montreal, there are two main school boards, one English and one French. We needed specific paperwork to qualify for the English system. My son now attends an English school with a French immersion curriculum.

Making friends here hasn't been easy, either. Because I work for a New York-based company, I've really had to put myself out there to meet people. Most of my community has come from meeting other parents through my kid's school organizations and connecting with our neighbors.

The biggest challenge we've faced has been setting up our finances. Since we had no financial history in Canada, we had no credit. Even basic things like getting a credit card or opening a bank account took about six to eight weeks to sort out.

The cost of living here is pretty comparable to New York. We spend about the same on groceries, and while we're saving on housing, my husband spends more on gas because he's commuting and driving farther outside the city. I, however, work from home.

I have been living with celiac disease for over 40 years. In Canada, it has been much easier to eat gluten-free due to the country's food regulations and labeling laws. And thanks to my work with gluten-free restaurants and brands — and my blog — I already had a built-in gluten-free community when I moved here.

I've never lived in a place with socialized healthcare, so there has been a huge learning curve in finding doctors and handling prescriptions. I have to use Google Translate for everything.

Health insurance is affordable here. We no longer pay out of pocket for coverage, which is a big change — in New York, health insurance for a family of three costs almost as much as rent.

It's different from province to province, but in Quebec, you're required to have an assigned family doctor. Since moving here, I've had to see a few specialists for checkups, and the service has been covered. Sometimes, I still find myself waiting for a bill to show up, and it never does.

Something else that surprised me about the medical system here is that you can actually make an appointment with a pharmacist, and they can prescribe medication if you have proper test results.

I really love Montreal and I'm happy here. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. Life feels calmer — the city is beautiful, cleaner, and safer. People here are so much nicer; they have this polite, laid-back attitude.

Our Canadian visas last for three years, but we hope to extend them. For now, I'd like to stay as long as possible.

A year ago, I probably would've wanted to move back to New York. But now, especially with our child in school, I don't want to disrupt that. I also don't know if we could afford to go back.

I'll always see myself as a New Yorker first and an American second; that's my identity through and through. But in New York, I never really felt like I could slow down. In Montreal, we're not in that constant, heightened state anymore. Life here just feels different.

Top Chinese and U.S. economic officials on Sunday hashed out the framework of a trade deal for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize that would pause steeper American tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls and resume U.S. soybean sales to China, U.S. officials said. 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the talks on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur had eliminated the threat of Trump's 100% tariffs on Chinese imports starting November 1. Bessent said he expects China to delay implementation of its rare earth minerals and magnets licensing regime by a year while the policy is reconsidered.

Chinese officials were more circumspect about the talks and offered no details about the outcome of the meetings.

Trump and Xi are due to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, to sign off on the terms. While the White House has officially announced the highly anticipated Trump-Xi talks, China has yet to confirm that the two leaders will meet.

""I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,"" Bessent told reporters after he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang for a fifth round of in-person discussions since May. Bessent said he anticipates that a tariff truce with China will be extended beyond its November 10 expiration date, and that China will revive substantial purchases of U.S. soybeans after buying none in September in favor of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina.

U.S. soybean farmers ""will feel very good about what's going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years"" once the deal's terms are announced, Bessent told the ABC program ""This Week.""

Greer told the ""Fox News Sunday"" program that both sides agreed to pause some punitive actions and found ""a path forward where we can have more access to rare earths from China, we can try to balance out our trade deficit with sales from the United States.""

China's Li Chenggang said the two sides reached a ""preliminary consensus"" and will next go through their respective internal approval processes.

""The U.S. position has been tough,"" Li said. ""We have experienced very intense consultations and engaged in constructive exchanges in exploring solutions and arrangements to address these concerns."" Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, his first stop in a five-day Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a face-to-face with Xi in South Korea on Thursday.

After the talks, Trump struck an optimistic tone, saying: ""I think we're going to have a deal with China."" Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs, starting on Nov. 1, in retaliation for China's expanded export controls on rare-earth magnets and minerals. China and the United States rolled back most of their triple-digit tariffs on each other's goods under a trade truce due to expire on Nov. 10.

The U.S. and Chinese officials said that in addition to rare earths, they discussed trade expansion, the U.S. fentanyl crisis, U.S. port entrance fees and the transfer of TikTok to U.S. ownership control.

Bessent told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program that the two sides have to iron out details of the TikTok deal, allowing Trump and Xi to ""consummate the transaction"" in South Korea.

On the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit, Trump hinted at possible meetings with Xi in China and the United States.

""We've agreed to meet. We're going to meet them later in China, and we're going to meet in the U.S., in either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago,"" Trump said. Among Trump's talking points with Xi are Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, concerns around democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai.

The detention of the founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily has become the most high-profile example of China's crackdown on rights in Hong Kong. Trump also said that he will seek China's help in U.S. dealings with Moscow, as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on.

Tensions between the world's two largest economies flared in the past few weeks as a delicate trade truce, reached after a first round of trade talks in Geneva in May and extended in August, failed to prevent the United States and China from hitting each other with more sanctions, export curbs and threats of stronger retaliatory measures. China's expanded controls on rare earths exports have caused a global shortage. That has prompted the United States to consider a ban on software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, according to a Reuters report.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he had a positive meeting on Sunday with U.S. President Donald Trump, and their respective teams will start ""immediately"" to discuss tariffs and other matters.

Trump and Lula spoke on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in a meeting to overcome tensions between Brazil and the United States after Trump increased tariffs on U.S. imports of most Brazilian goods to 50% from 10% in August.

""We agreed that our teams will meet immediately to advance the search for solutions to the tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian authorities,"" Lula said in a social media post following the meeting. 

Trump had linked the tariff move to what he called a ""witch hunt"" against Jair Bolsonaro, the South American country's former president. The U.S. government also put sanctions on a number of Brazilian officials, including Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the trial that led to Bolsonaro's conviction for attempting a coup.

Ahead of the meeting on Sunday, though, Trump said he could reach some agreements with Lula.

""I think we should be able to make some pretty good deals for both countries,"" Trump said.

Lula previously described the tariff hike as a ""mistake,"" citing a $410 billion U.S. trade surplus with Brazil over 15 years.

Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said negotiations will start immediately to work on solutions and a meeting with the U.S. delegation was planned for Sunday.

""We will establish a negotiation schedule and establish the sectors we will talk about so that we can move forward,"" Vieira told journalists at the summit, adding that Brazil had requested that tariffs be suspended during the negotiation process.

It was not immediately clear if the United States agreed to the request.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were present at the meeting, Vieira said.

""We hope to conclude bilateral negotiations that address each of the sectors of the current American (tariffs on) Brazil in the near future, in a few weeks,"" Vieira added.

Bolsonaro was not mentioned in the meeting, said Marcio Rosa, the executive secretary for Brazil's ministry of development, industry and commerce, who stood next to Vieira. Higher U.S. tariffs on Brazilian goods have begun reshaping the global beef trade, pushing up prices in the United States and encouraging triangulation via third countries such as Mexico, while Brazilian exports to its biggest beef market, China, are booming.

Brazilian beef industry group Abiec said it viewed the meeting between the two leaders as a positive step.

""The understanding between the two countries can preserve the competitiveness of the Brazilian product, guarantee predictability for exporters and expand the presence of (Brazilian) beef in the North American market,"" it said in a statement.

Globally, Brazil's total beef exports, including fresh and processed meat, edible offal and tallow, generated $1.92 billion in revenue in September, with volumes reaching 373,867 metric tons, up 49% in value and 17% in volume year-on-year.

Brazilian coffee industry group ABIC said it was confident in the historic partnership between the two countries. Brazil is the world's top coffee producer and exporter, while the United States is the biggest importer.

""The recent meetings between the presidents of the United States and Brazil have been more positive, and at ABIC we are optimistic,"" ABIC president Pavel Cardoso said in a statement.

Suspects have been arrested over the brazen jewelry heist at the Louvre, just as one of them was about to fly out of France, the Paris prosecutor said on Sunday.

Two men in their 30s and originally from the capital's Seine-Saint-Denis suburb - which includes some of the country's most deprived areas - were detained on Saturday evening, according to Le Parisien newspaper, which first broke the story.

They were known to French police and one of the suspects was about to fly to Algeria from Charles de Gaulle airport, the newspaper said.

There was no indication on Sunday that any of France's stolen crown jewels had been recovered.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not say how many people were arrested or give any more details about them. In a statement, she deplored the fact that information about their arrest was leaked.

""This revelation can only hinder the investigative efforts of the 100 or so mobilized investigators, both in the search for the stolen jewelry and for all the perpetrators. It is too early to provide any specific details,"" Beccuau said.

Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, under public pressure to deliver results a week to the day after the robbery, congratulated investigators in a tweet, but gave no more details.

Four hooded thieves made off with eight precious pieces worth an estimated $102 million from the Louvre's collection on October 19, exposing security lapses at the world's most-visited museum.

They broke in using a crane to smash an upstairs window during opening hours and escaped on motorbikes.

News of the robbery reverberated around the world, prompting soul-searching in France over what some regarded as a national humiliation.

The stolen treasures included a tiara and an earring from the jewelry of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense from the early 19th century.

The crown of Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, was found damaged outside the museum. The thieves apparently dropped the piece, made of gold, emeralds and diamonds, as they made their getaway.

Built in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace used to be the official residence of the kings of France, until Louis XIV abandoned it for Versailles. It was turned into a museum for the royal art collection in 1793, four years after the French Revolution.

Its vast collection of masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo, attracted 8.7 million visitors last year.

The stock market has been volatile lately as investors study the latest twists and turns in the the U.S.-China trade war as well as earnings of major American companies. Despite those challenges, investors can also choose to focus on stocks of companies that can navigate short-term pressures to deliver strong, long-term returns.

Tracking top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick some attractive stocks, as the recommendations of these experts are based on in-depth analysis of a company's business fundamentals, opportunities and challenges.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This first stock pick is social media company Pinterest (PINS), scheduled to announce third-quarter results on November 4. Heading into those numbers, TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge reiterated a buy rating on Pinterest and a $44 price target. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Pinterest, giving it an ""outperform"" rating and a price target of $40.

Blackledge expects Pinterest Q3 revenue grew by 16.6% versus the year-earlier quarter, in line with the Street's consensus estimate and toward the high end of the company's own guidance. ""We expect EBITDA growth of 20% y/y, outpacing rev growth, driven by modest [cost of revenue] and R&D leverage,"" said Blackledge.  

The 5-star analyst remains confident about his mid-teens, year-over-year revenue growth estimate through the second half of 2025 and 2026, partly supported by continued adoption by advertisers of PINS' Performance+ campaign tools.

Following a digital ad check call with an agency that runs more than $4 billion annually in managed advertising spending, Blackledge noted that ad spend on Pinterest rose 63% year-over-year in Q3 2025, a slight slowdown compared to 66% in the prior quarter. A TD Cowen expert noted that solid uptake continues in PINS' Performance+ campaign types.

In fact, some advertisers have shifted all their Pinterest spending to Performance+. Blackledge said Performance+, rolled out in late 2024 with automated creative tools, has expanded to include automated bidding tools and other artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automated features.

Blackledge ranks No. 522 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.5%. See Pinterest Statistics on TipRanks.

Next up is ride-sharing and delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a buy rating on UBER along with a 12-month price forecast of $150 after hosting a quarterly webinar with Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy and The Driverless Digest Dude, where they discussed the latest trends across rideshare, delivery and autonomous vehicle (AV) ecosystems. Like Mahaney, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on UBER stock, with an ""outperform"" rating and a price target of $108.

Campbell was constructive about rideshare supply dynamics, given solid and stable driver economics, Mahaney noted. Campbell continues to see consistent demand and strong driver supply, particularly at Uber, which he described as operating near ""all-time highs."" Despite robust supply, pricing continues to be high, reflecting sustained demand elasticity and limited alternatives for consumers, particularly for airport and nightlife rides. 

The top-rated analyst also highlighted Campbell's commentary about early-stage shifts in AV partnerships — particularly Alphabet's Waymo's evolving first-party vs third-party strategy and Uber's expanding AV integration roadmap.

Mahaney further noted stable driver economics and widening platform margins. Notably, Uber's ""decoupling"" of rider fares and driver payouts is driving incremental profit margin expansion, even with steady driver income.

Through incremental feature innovation, Uber is focused on enhancing ecosystem ""stickiness."" Uber's recent ""Only on Uber"" event rolled out small feature updates, including tip guarantees and safety enhancements. While not transformative, Mahaney said Campbell sees these efforts as part of Uber's ""broader push to create alternative income channels for drivers as AVs grow share over time.""

Mahaney ranks No. 473 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13%. See Uber Technologies Financials on TipRanks.

General Motors (GM) jumped 15% on Tuesday after the Cadillac and Buick parent beat the Street's revenue and earnings expectations despite a slight decline in sales. GM also raised its forward guidance, citing a lower-than-expected tariff impact.  

Following the Q3 results, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on GM and raised his price target to $76 from $67. By comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $66 and an ""outperform"" rating on GM.

""We remain positive with reduced tariff burden/risk, improved profitability and [internal combustion engine] SUV/pickup onshoring tailwinds through C26E+,"" said Rakesh.

The 5-star analyst noted that GM raised its 2025 guidance for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted free cash flow, driven by a smaller-than-expected impact from  tariffs, and said GM is rolling back some of its electric vehicle (EV) plans to boost profitability. That involves GM's sale of its Michigan EV battery plant stake to LG Energy, while keeping two battery plants, and transitioning its Orion plant to gas engine production from an EV focus by 2027.

Rakesh believes that smaller EV losses, tariff challenges and warranty costs, and a higher combustion engine mix, will support GM's target to return to 8% to 10% EBIT margin in the North America business. Other tailwinds include $5 billion in deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise models, with about 70% gross margins, combined with a stable average selling prices.

Rakesh ranks No. 67 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.8%. See General Motors Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Relations between the the U.K. and European Union are arguably at the best they've been since the Brexit vote in 2016 but there's an ongoing cold front between the neighbors over a ban on continental cheese and meat imports.

In April, Britain banned people from bringing all dairy products and a range of meats from the EU into the country for personal consumption, saying the prohibition was needed in order to prevent the possible spread of Foot and Mouth Disease among British livestock after outbreaks in Europe earlier this year.

British holidaymakers travelling to the continent were warned not to bring home foodstuffs such as cheese, chorizo, Serrano ham or sandwiches containing any of a wide range of banned products, even if they were sealed or bought in duty-free shops at airports. The ban extends to cakes, biscuits and chocolate containing a high level of unprocessed dairy products or fresh cream.

Those found with banned items were told they'd have to surrender them at the border, or have them seized and destroyed. Anyone flouting the restriction could receive a £5,000 fine (around $6,700), the government said.

The Brits' ban did not apply to commercial food imports because they undergo more stringent biosecurity requirements, such as heat treatment and veterinary health certificates, the U.K. said.

Cheese shops in Paris — and particularly those situated around the Gare du Nord where Eurostar trains travel to and from the U.K. — say the restrictions have hit sales to a vital customer base.

""Tourists are very important, and especially English people,"" Alexandre Vilaca, founder and manager of Fromagerie Ferdinand in Paris, told CNBC, noting that when he opened his cheese shop eight years ago, he had chosen the Gare du Nord neighborhood for its international visitors.

""These past few years, it was very important to have English clients. We vacuum-packed the cheese so they could travel easily to the U.K., and we started to have regular clients who used to pass by our shop in order to bring some gifts to the families and friends ... But a few months ago, clients told me that it was forbidden to bring cheese back home,"" he said.

""And it's had a huge impact on our sales to U.K. clients,"" he added.

Vilaca said the ban was largely nonsensical, given that the French authorities were ""very, very strict"" about sanitary controls and regular checks on cheese producers, their products and their distribution. English cheese producers Vilaca worked with were also upset by the ban, he noted.

""We are proud when clients take home some souvenirs, maybe some wine, some cheese — a bit of France in their bags, so to speak. So we don't understand [the ban], we are quite upset and it is bad news because, in terms of business, it's not great.""

Temporary bans on continental food products entering or exiting the U.K., or vice versa, are nothing new and it's worth noting that the EU introduced a permanent ban on Brits bringing animal and dairy products, for personal consumption, into the bloc following Brexit for the same reasons: to prevent the spread of diseases.

Foot and Mouth Disease, or FMD, is a serious concern for a close-knit continent like the EU as it can spread very quickly, particularly given the region's interconnected agricultural market and multiple transmission routes.

FMD does not pose a risk to humans but is highly contagious to cattle, sheep and pigs, with the disease able to spread rapidly among livestock, with devastating consequences.

Outbreaks of FMD were confirmed in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia earlier this year but they were contained after the countries' rapidly implemented animal health control measures in the affected establishments, including the culling of livestock and protection and surveillance zones.

Those emergency measures were lifted after Germany was declared free of FMD in April, and Hungary and Slovakia have seen no new outbreaks since April.

In late July, the U.K. government's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in an assessment that ""while the incursions of FMD into Europe earlier in the year were undoubtedly concerning, there have been no further reports since April, suggesting that the situation in Hungary and Slovakia is under control.""

While the report's authors said the risk of incursion of FMD to the U.K. was, in July, was considered a 'low (rare but can occur)' risk, the report cautioned that FMD can remain undetected for several months.

The U.K. government told CNBC that, despite the containment of European FMD outbreaks, the ongoing ban on personal imports of cheese and many meats aimed to protect British farmers and U.K. food security.

""Earlier this year, we took immediate action to ban personal imports of meat and dairy from Europe after a wave of foot and mouth cases. We are also investing £1 billion [$1.3 billion] in a new National Biosecurity Centre to boost our world leading facilities and protect our farmers, food supply and economy,"" a spokesman for Defra told CNBC.

""We will do whatever it takes to protect our farmers from animal disease,"" the spokesperson added.

Almost six months into the ban, however, and questions are being asked whether the ongoing restrictions are excessive, and no longer necessary.

Defra stressed its not alone in implementing the current restrictions, and is only doing what the EU has been doing for several years, since Brexit, as standard practice.

Asked when the ban might be lifted, given that cases of FMD are now contained on the continent, Defra said the government's ""FMD response remains under constant review"" and that it will ""retain restrictions in England while personal imports of affected products pose biosecurity risks to Great Britain.""

The U.K. and EU have learned the hard way what an outbreak of FMD can cause.

The 2001 epidemic, which first broke out in the U.K. before spreading to the continent, had a devastating impact on the British farming community with over six million animals having to be destroyed and estimated to have cost the U.K.'s public and private sector a combined £8 billion.

In the EU, four million animals were destroyed and the outbreak is estimated to have cost member states 2.7 billion euros in terms of eradication measures and compensation to farmers.

The U.K.'s last outbreak, in 2007, only affected eight farms but was estimated to have cost £147 million overall, due to large-scale livestock movement bans.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett said Sunday he, too, has ""felt pain"" from China refusing to buy U.S.-grown soybeans during a trade conflict with President Donald Trump because ""I'm actually a soybean farmer.""

Bessent's comment came during an interview with ABC News' ""This Week,"" where he said that trade negotiations with China in the past two days had led to a ""substantial framework"" that he believed would alleviate American soybean farmers' concerns about the boycott.

Trump is set to meet later this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

Bessent, a former hedge fund executive whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be around $600 million, was asked about the soybean boycotts on ""This Week"" host Martha Raddatz, who noted that ""American farmers have really suffered.""

China in 2023 and 2024 bought more than half of the soybeans grown in the U.S., accounting for nearly $12.8 billion in 2024.

But after Trump ignited a trade war with Beijing earlier this year, China stopped buying soybeans.

""Do you see a real light at the end of the tunnel there, they may allow soybeans again?"" Raddetz asked.

Bessent replied, ""Martha, in case you don't know it, I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain, too.""

Bessent's government financial disclosure shows that he owns soybean and corn farmland in North Dakota that has an estimated worth of between $5 million and $25 million.

On that disclosure, Bessent said the farmland generates between $100,000 and $1 million in rental income for him annually.

The Treasury secretary told Raddatz on Sunday, ""I think think we have addressed the farmer's concerns, and I'm not going to get ahead of the president, but I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public, that our soybean farmers will feel very good about what's going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years.""

In this article

FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines started pouring customers Champagne Bollinger in its top-tier lounges and cabins this fall. But at headquarters, it's not time to celebrate — yet.

American has fallen behind large rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in the post-Covid luxury travel boom that has taken Seoul spa vacations and 40th birthday bashes abroad out of the chat and armed millions of consumers with high-end rewards credit cards.

In the first nine months of this year, Delta made $3.8 billion and United made $2.3 billion. American made $12 million. That means that American, which offers more flights than any other airline, according to OAG, accounted for just 2% of the profit the biggest three U.S. carriers generated so far in 2025.

American ranked last in a J.D. Power's North American airline customer satisfaction ranking this year. The carrier has also been working to undo damage from a failed business-travel sales strategy.

And American, which branded itself the ""on-time machine"" in the 1980s, in the first half of this year ranked ninth out of 10 airlines for on-time arrivals, according to the Department of Transportation.

The airline is trying to change all of that and uplift its brand after strategy errors, some skittishness about spending, and at times being late to capitalize on industry trends, like travelers' willingness to pay up to sit in bigger seats, according to current and former executives and industry watchers.

To make that happen, CEO Robert Isom will have to rally American's more than 130,000 employees around the airline's plans and win over both customers and investors. American's stock is down 20% this year through Friday's close, compared with modest gains posted by Delta and United.

Last week, however, some investors noticed a change within American, whose fourth-quarter profit forecast surpassed Wall Street analysts' expectations. Shares rose more than 16%, their biggest weekly percentage gain in almost a year.

""You're going to have a three-month period where you have to be crystal clear on your story,"" said Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham, referring to the airline's leaders.

The bigger changes are going to take time and money.

""American hasn't been paying attention to the customer for the longest time,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group travel consulting firm. ""I believe there is the beginning of a meaningful turnaround … but a large airline like American is not going to be turned around overnight.""

American has tasked Heather Garboden — who has worked for more than two decades at American and US Airways, including roles in the cargo and finance departments, and now is chief customer officer — with leading a lot of a nose-to-tail revamp of the nearly century-old airline.

""Fifteen years ago, I don't think in the industry, there was much of a belief that customer experience … really drove a differentiation between airlines. I think everyone felt it was price and schedule, and that's it,"" she said in an interview. ""That has changed, and we understand that.""

American fell behind with both retailing fares and technology compared with large U.S. rivals. At Delta, the most profitable U.S. airline, its executives were early to notice how customers were paying up for pricier first-class seats, precious real estate it and other airlines used to give away to frequent flyers as free upgrades. Now, offering buy-ups is more common among all three, and American is looking for more ways to sell those seats and to make sure its planes have enough of them to offer.

One challenge for American has been that it was last of the big three airlines to complete a mega merger in 2013 when it combined with US Airways, while Delta and United had years-long head starts to get through their integrations and improve their products.

Garboden spent much of her career in the finance departments and said it's tough to provide that team with the return-on-investment of something like Champagne but that it's still important.

""Customer experience, it's not just Champagne. It's not just a nice seat. It's not just having the best lounge,"" she said. ""It's the whole holistic view of it, and from end to end, [how] we want it to feel.""

Including new aircraft, American expects its capital spending to total $3.8 billion this year, and rise to about $4.5 billion next year, the carrier said Thursday. It said it has nearly $37 billion in total debt, and plans to cut that down by about at least $2 billion before 2028.

One example of how things have changed: American's management team nearly a decade ago decided to remove seat-back screens from its aircraft, saving money on the equipment (and the fuel-sucking weight they add to the plane) because at the time they said customers would likely use their own mobile phones, tablets or laptop to watch entertainment.

United, some of whose senior leadership team, including its chief executive, Scott Kirby, came from American, has done the opposite and is in the process of adding thousands of screens to narrow-body planes both new and old, including Bluetooth technology for wireless headphones.

American might be changing its tune. ""I think of where the technology was a decade ago, and where it can be today, or even a few years from today,"" Garboden said. ""Hopefully the complexity is less.""

American is working to make its website and app better, with features like a way to toggle between paying for tickets with cash or miles, Garboden said, among other revamps that executives hope will drive sales — and paid upgrades. Another goal: using artificial intelligence and allowing customers to search for vacation themes, such as ""best wine tasting in spring"" instead of searching for flights between cities, she said.

American is also in the middle of a push to refresh many of its longer-haul premium cabins and announced on Thursday that it will refurbish its Boeing 777-200 aircraft with a new business class, adding to an upgrade, first unveiled three years ago, of its larger Boeing 777-300 jets.

""That is a big deal for us because extending the lives of those and putting those into service really gives us a capital spending holiday in terms of fleet replacement,"" Isom said in an earnings call with analysts on Thursday. ""So it's a win-win-win for our customers, for our company and, most certainly, our investors.""

Those plans are made years in advance, and high demand, supply chain problems and long certification wait times have delayed plusher cabins, exasperating airline executives.

On Thursday, American's first Airbus A321 XLR, a long-range narrow-body plane it plans to fly across the country and, eventually to Europe, touched down at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. On all three aircraft types, it will do without first class in favor of a larger business class. For flights over the Atlantic it can cost $600 in the back and well over $6,000 up front.

The new suites that feature sliding doors, larger screens and a palette of dark browns, navy blue and tan, started flying this year on some of American's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, subset P, for ""premium.""

Meanwhile, the union that represents American's attendants is pushing the carrier add more crew members on board to cater to the larger business-class cabins.

""Staff your airplanes the way a world-class airline should — and deliver a competitive onboard experience in every cabin,"" the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the pilots' union and unions at the carrier said in a message on Friday that was sent to staff but directed at the carrier, targeting the airline's underperformance compared with rivals.

American's updates even have it rethinking beverages throughout the plane. The airline signed a coffee provider deal with Italy's Lavazza recently, and to test out the brews, it brought airplane water to its headquarters in Fort Worth so staff could evaluate what it would taste like brewed on board. Lavazza made the cut.

The airline on Thursday named Nat Pieper as is chief commercial officer, a nearly three-decade airline veteran who's worked at Alaska Airlines and Delta and who Isom described as ""exactly the kind of leader we want at American."" American fired its former CCO, Vasu Raja, last year after his business-travel strategy backfired and sparked outrage from travel agencies.

There are signs of progress.

""Exiting this year, we expect to have fully recovered the revenue share that was lost by our prior sales and distribution strategy,"" Isom said Thursday.

American also just inked a new credit card deal with Citi and last week said it would introduce a new mid-tier card, with a $350 annual fee.

American Airlines was an industry leader for decades. It was the first to launch a frequent flyer program, AAdvantage. Loyalty programs, which in large part make money from selling frequent flyer miles to banks, have now become the lifeblood of many airlines.

The airline this year announced new measures to improve reliability. One change: five additional minutes of boarding time. An American spokeswoman said that helps avoid bottlenecks and last-minute gate-checked bags, which she said are down 25% since May 1.

Some of American's challenges are fairly recent. A federal judge in 2023 blocked American's regional tie-up with JetBlue Airways, leaving it without a partner in key, wealthy markets like Boston and New York, where United and Delta had made inroads.

United this year scooped up a partnership with JetBlue that allows customers to earn and burn miles on each others airline, but stops short of coordinating schedules or routes. It took effect on Thursday, as American was reporting its third-quarter results.

American dominates its fortress hubs in Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina, profitable operations, though it has fallen behind in the Northeast. Other companies have looked to the Sun Belt for growth as the population there grew.

United and Delta executives have credited some of their success to having lots of flights in big coastal hubs with affluent travelers, though United has also built up flying in key markets like Denver, Houston and Chicago.

While American has been reluctant to make big investments, United's CEO Kirby earlier this month told investors that the airline is plowing more than $1 billion a year into improving customer experience.

United recently started flying planes with free Wi-Fi provided by SpaceX's Starlink, following Delta and JetBlue in making the service complimentary. American plans to roll out complimentary Wi-Fi next year for most of its fleet.

United said such investments take years.

""We have built up a generational lead on this front,"" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview, adding that new products are coming in the next few years. (He declined to provide details.) ""We think it's substantial, and I don't want to give an inch of that ground up, no matter what our competitors do to innovate over the next decade.""

Some customers, however, continue to value the convenience American offers them, and have remained loyal.

Todd Bryan, 41, who has Executive Platinum status on American, said he chooses the carrier in large part because it has the most frequencies out of where he lives, in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

The 41-year-old sales account manager who works in the consumer packaged goods industry, said he gets upgraded on most of his flights, but he has noticed that American has been more aggressive about offering buy-ups with cash or miles.

Even though he's usually at the top of the list, he now considers taking the offer instead of gambling on a free upgrade on personal trips if ""it feels cheap enough that I assume someone else would buy it too.""

Gold's record-breaking run took a breather this week, snapping an eight-week winning streak as traders took profits ahead of the Federal Reserve's October policy decision.

The retreat has eased safe-haven demand and, for the first time in weeks, tilted some attention back toward risk assets including bitcoin BTC$113,736.52.

Spot gold fell more than 6% from its all-time high above $4,380/oz touched on Monday, settling near $4,120 by the weekend. The pullback was driven by profit-taking, heavy exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows, and a shift in tone around US–China trade relations.

Officials from both countries said they reached a “preliminary consensus” on key trade issues, easing fears of a new tariff cycle that had fueled the metal's climb.

“The threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods is effectively off the table,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday, after two days of talks in Malaysia set the stage for a broader deal between President Trump and President Xi Jinping.

The softer macro backdrop, combined with expectations that the Fed will cut rates by another 25 basis points this week, took the shine off gold's parabolic rally. Silver and platinum also slid sharply in signs of a reset before Wednesday's decision.

But the timing may prove fortuitous for BTC.

After lagging gold for most of the quarter, Bitcoin has gained over 5% in the past week, reclaiming the $113,500 level and breaking free from a narrow, month-long range.

The move comes as the BTC/gold ratio — a measure of Bitcoin's relative value against the yellow metal — flashed its most oversold reading in nearly three years earlier, according to CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole.

The ratio's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped to 22.20 last week, below its February low and the weakest since November 2022. Historically, such extremes in the BTC/gold ratio have coincided with local bottoms for Bitcoin, often followed by periods of outperformance as traders rotate back into higher-beta assets once macro fear subsides.

Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong has rejected the idea that cryptocurrencies are too expensive for new entrants.

“You don't need to buy a full Bitcoin or ETH to get started,” Armstrong said Sunday on X. “You can start buying and holding crypto with a few dollars. It's never too late.”

Armstrong's remarks come as Bitcoin trades over $100,000 and Ethereum near $4,000, figures that are likely to intimidate potential investors. For investors seeking significant returns, it may also feel like the train has left the station. This sentiment is often cited as a reason some investors engage in speculative trading of assets like memecoins, which lack utility and are prone to rapid booms and busts.

According to several cryptocurrency executives and top market watchers, however, it is still early to get into cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.

“Until Bitcoin hits $500K, it is still early,” Bitwise investment chief Matt Hougan said in a November 2024 memo. This view, which SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has since shared, is based on Bitcoin's digital gold narrative.

The idea is that if the narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold takes off, a mature Bitcoin would have half the market share of gold, which Hougan, at the time, estimated would push the asset to $500,000.

In the same vein, Gemini Space Station Inc. (NASDAQ:GEMI) co-founder Tyler Winklevoss said last month that “it's still very much the bottom of the first inning” for Bitcoin. He said he expected Bitcoin to trade at $1 million if it disrupts gold.

Similarly, Armstrong has recently said that Bitcoin would trade at $1 million by 2030. Reiterating this prediction in a Fox Business interview last month, he cited growing regulatory clarity in the U.S. as one of the reasons for his confidence. He also cited President Donald Trump‘s establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and institutional flows from spot BTC exchange-traded funds.

“There's a lot of positive tailwinds for Bitcoin, and there's never going to be more than 21 million Bitcoin ever made in the world, and lots of pools of capital still haven't gotten access to it,” Armstrong told Fox Business. “So that tells me this thing has a long way to run.”

Bitcoin was most recently trading at $108,000. The asset has fallen 14% below its record high of $126,000 amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China, casting doubt on its store-of-value status. Comparatively, gold has surged to new price records above $4,000.

The recent entry of two high-leverage long positions totaling $29 million by a major whale address 0xC50a indicates that market confidence is increasing despite persistent volatility. At an entry price of $111,658, the whale initiated a 40x long on 149 BTC, which is worth $16.65 million, and a 10x long on 284,501 HYPE tokens, which are worth $12.49 million.

What's up with Bitcoin?

The price of Bitcoin is currently trading close to $111,800, which is just above the whale's entry point. This move coincides with a weak but improving price structure. The position is currently slightly negative (-$14,600 unrealized PnL), but the aggressive leverage indicates that 0xC50a anticipates a short-term breakout above $112,000-$114,000, a resistance zone that is home to a large number of short liquidations. The 200-day moving average or black line has served as a powerful dynamic support for multiple sessions, and Bitcoin is still holding steady above it on the daily chart at $108,200.BTCUSDT Chart by TradingView"">

Following the steep correction earlier this month, the recovery from that level indicates a resurgence of buyer interest. There is still potential for a more robust upward push before Bitcoin becomes overbought, according to the RSI at 48, which indicates neutral momentum. At approximately $112,400 and $114,100, the 50-day and 100-day moving averages continue to be significant short-term obstacles.

Foundation behind rally

A close above these lines might start a quick rally toward the $118,000-$120,000 range, which has historically caused significant profit-taking. With the size of the whale's position and exposure to leverage, even a slight change in price could result in significant liquidations. The trade is structurally safe unless there is a significant macro shock as the liquidation price for the Bitcoin long is set close to $53,000.

The fact that this move was made at a time when the market was consolidating indicates that smart money is getting ready for an increase in volatility. The next few sessions may signal the beginning of a new recovery leg if Bitcoin keeps up its momentum above $110,000 with whale activity serving as a leading indicator of rekindled market confidence.

Bitcoin BTC$113,736.52 has long been described as “digital gold”, and, like the precious metal, is often pitched as a hedge against inflation. But new data from NYDIG suggests that the narrative doesn't hold up.

In its weekly digest, NYDIG's Global Head of Research Greg Cipolaro found that inflation isn't a reliable factor driving bitcoin's price. Monthly correlation data shows that bitcoin's relationship to inflation is both inconsistent and weak.

“We know the community likes to pitch bitcoin as an inflation hedge, but unfortunately, here, the data is just not strongly supportive of that argument,” Cipolaro wrote. “The correlations with inflationary measures are neither consistent nor are they extremely high.”

Gold, the traditional inflation hedge, doesn't fare much better. Its correlations with inflation have often been negative and fluctuate from one period to the next.

This challenges the conventional view that rising inflation automatically boosts gold prices, with Cipolaro himself writing that it's surprising that for gold, inflationary measures are inversely correlated.

So what moves bitcoin and gold? Real interest rates and money supply.

For gold, falling real interest rates, those adjusted for inflation, have long signaled price gains. Bitcoin, although relatively new to financial markets, is now exhibiting a similar pattern.

Cipolano found bitcoin's inverse relationship with real rates has strengthened in recent years, likely a result of its growing integration into the broader financial system.

The takeaway, according to NYDIG: investors should stop thinking of bitcoin as an inflation hedge.

Instead, it behaves more like a measure of global liquidity, moving in response to interest rates and the flow of capital, not the cost of groceries or gasoline.

“If we were to summarize how to think about each asset from a macro factor perspective, it is that gold serves as a real-rate hedge, whereas bitcoin has evolved into a liquidity barometer,” Cipolaro concluded.

Ethereum continues to display choppy price action, remaining confined within a critical range as both buyers and sellers await a decisive breakout. Further consolidation is likely before a clear directional move takes shape.

By Shayan

On the daily timeframe, Ethereum's consolidation phase has extended, with volatility and momentum both fading. Price action remains trapped within a crucial range defined by the 100-day moving average and the flag pattern's upper boundary near $4.1K. This region represents a key supply zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts.

On the downside, the flag's lower boundary, aligning with the $3.5K demand zone, acts as the primary support where buyers have consistently defended. Until a breakout occurs, Ethereum is expected to continue consolidating within this structure, absorbing order flow and building liquidity. A confirmed bullish breakout above $4.1K could likely trigger an impulsive rally toward a new all-time high (ATH).



The 4-hour timeframe reveals Ethereum fluctuating inside a symmetrical triangle, reflecting ongoing market indecision and equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The asset is currently trading just below the triangle's upper boundary near $4K, with momentum still insufficient for a confirmed breakout.

This compression pattern signals a liquidity buildup phase, where traders are positioning ahead of a potential volatility expansion. If bulls manage to push above the upper trendline, a rally toward $4.1K and potentially $4.6K could follow. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would expose the $3.4K demand zone once again. Until confirmation, Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within this narrowing range — a setup that typically precedes a sharp directional breakout.



By Shayan

The 1-month liquidation heatmap for Ethereum reveals a dense liquidity pocket forming above the $4.8K swing high, situated directly beyond the current symmetrical consolidation structure. This area corresponds to a significant cluster of resting short liquidations, implying that if Ethereum reclaims the mid-range near $4.1K–$4.3K, a rapid move to absorb this overhead liquidity could follow.

Below the current price, the $3.5K range displays relatively weaker liquidation density, indicating that much of the downside liquidity was already cleared during last week's sell-off, though a smaller residual cluster remains. This configuration reinforces the idea that Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within its present consolidation range until one of these liquidity pockets is decisively tested.

Overall, the heatmap confirms that short-term volatility will remain concentrated within the $3.4K–$4.8K corridor, with the upper range carrying a slightly higher probability of being targeted first due to the larger liquidity concentration above current levels.

During the European session, Ethereum (ETH) is showing a slightly bullish bias, trading at around $3,984 level with a 24-hour trading volume of $16.5 billion. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $480.9 billion, gained 1.04% over the past day. 

Despite recent market volatility, ETH's ability to maintain higher lows suggests growing trader confidence as it inches closer to a potential breakout.

The recent price action signals that buyers are quietly regaining control, as ETH consolidates within a tightening range between $3,920 and $4,115 – a zone that typically precedes major directional moves.

On the 4-hourly timeframe, the ETH/USD is shaping up for a possible symmetrical triangle breakout. Typically, a breakout of such a pattern triggers sharp price swings, particularly in the same direction where it is breaking out now. 

In this case, ETH is breaking out to the upside. The 20-day EMA ($3,935) has nearly crossed above the 50-day EMA ($3,926), a short-term bullish signal indicating momentum may soon accelerate.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 58, suggesting mild bullish bias without overbought conditions, leaving room for continued upside. Recent candlestick formations, spinning tops, Doji candles, and a bullish engulfing pattern, underscore a tug of war between bulls and bears, with momentum slowly tipping toward buyers.

Ethereum price prediction is likely to be bullish if ETH breaks above $4,115, the next resistance lies at $4,298 and $4,550, supported by historical Fibonacci levels. A rejection at current levels, however, could drag ETH toward $3,712 or $3,510, where demand has previously emerged.

For traders, a breakout above $4,115 offers a favorable long opportunity, targeting $4,298–$4,550, with a stop below $3,920. Conversely, a drop under $3,920 could open the door for short-term bearish setups toward $3,510.

Ethereum's tightening price structure reflects volatility buildup – a condition often followed by sharp expansion moves. Whether it's a bullish surge or a bearish pullback, this breakout is likely to define ETH's direction heading into November 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin Takes the Lead as Altcoin Enthusiasm Dwindles","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/bitcoin-leads-altcoin-enthusiasm-decline","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 11:19:31 GMT","

In the ever-evolving universe of cryptocurrency, a significant upheaval is taking place. The once-thriving altcoin speculation is now being overshadowed by a tidal wave of institutional interest in Bitcoin. This shift is more than just a trend; it has resulted in an alarming $800 billion decline for retail altcoin investors, marking a crucial turning point. As liquidity in altcoins dwindles and market conditions shift dramatically, traders are left grappling with how to revamp their strategies in this new territory.

The fallout from these changes is staggering: retail traders entrenched in altcoins are collectively staring down a remarkable $800 billion loss. Previously, these investors thrived during the exhilarating peaks of altcoin seasons, but now they face an acute liquidity crisis. Institutional investors are redirecting their resources towards Bitcoin, rendering the diversification benefits once attributed to altcoins nearly meaningless. This drastic decline serves as a stark warning, urging crypto aficionados to reconsider their investment tactics in a landscape that has become increasingly treacherous.

The surge of institutional investment in Bitcoin illustrates a significant transformation in the crypto marketplace. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs offers a well-regulated and secure investment pathway, extending beyond simple transactions. These ETFs reflect a strategic pivot toward financial stability in a market replete with uncertainty. The growing disparity between Bitcoin's solid worth and the volatile nature of altcoins casts a formidable pall over historical capital displacement within the crypto ecosystem.

Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio's recent alarmist statements have only intensified worries surrounding the state of altcoins. His assertion, “The era of altcoins is over in the foreseeable future,” reverberates within a community already wrestling with skepticism. As market liquidity evaporates, traders are taking a hard look at their portfolios, favoring more stable investment avenues. An unsettling realization is settling in: the speculative allure of altcoins may no longer guarantee the once-promising returns.

The increasing allure of Bitcoin ETFs is not just a fleeting fad; they are essential in solidifying Bitcoin's position while exerting additional stress on liquidity-strapped altcoins. Experts are raising red flags, suggesting that the current volatility demands a recalibration of investment strategies—one attuned to the shifting realities of the digital currency landscape. In an environment where Bitcoin is increasingly perched as a safe harbor, the path for altcoins is fraught with uncertainty and potential peril.

According to insights from 10x Research, impending regulatory reforms could exacerbate the challenges facing altcoins. Heightened scrutiny from regulators threatens to introduce new operational risks that could jeopardize these digital currencies' sustainability. The maturation process of the cryptocurrency market is steering focus toward compliance and stability, further consolidating Bitcoin's preeminent status. Projections indicate that while Bitcoin may continue to thrive, the outlook for altcoins might remain clouded with hurdles.

The ascendance of Bitcoin heralds a seismic shift within the cryptocurrency landscape, casting a long shadow over altcoins and leaving retail investors in the lurch with disheartening losses. As traders confront a reality rife with challenges and uncertainties, the call for innovative investment strategies has never been more urgent. Bitcoin stands resilient as a cornerstone of the crypto landscape, buoyed by institutional backing and a path toward regulatory alignment, while the future appears increasingly dire for altcoins. Navigating this new frontier requires not just caution, but also strategic acumen—and as the crypto tide continues to turn, understanding these emerging dynamics is crucial for anyone looking to thrive in this volatile arena.

XRP (XRP/USD) ended the week with an impressive 11.4% gain, outperforming most major altcoins and reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $2.62, up 2.63% in the past 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $3.68 billion.

XRP ranks #4 globally, commanding a market cap of $157.4 billion and a circulating supply of over 60 billion coins.

The steady climb in XRP's price comes amid renewed optimism in the broader crypto market and increased institutional engagement, driven by Ripple's ongoing expansion in global payments. However, technical indicators suggest that XRP may still be consolidating before confirming its next major move.

Despite the week's strong performance, XRP's chart structure remains cautious. The token is forming a descending triangle pattern, defined by lower highs near $2.71 and a flat base at $2.26. This formation typically signals waning bullish strength and potential continuation of a corrective phase if resistance levels fail to break.

Key signals include:

For XRP to regain momentum, it must decisively break above $2.72. Failure to do so could confirm resistance, pulling the price back toward $2.26 or even $2.02, where historical demand has previously stabilized the market.

From a trading standpoint, XRP price prediction is at a technical crossroads. Short-term traders are closely monitoring the $2.70–$2.72 zone for a breakout confirmation. A successful close above this level could open the path toward $3.15, aligning with prior swing highs. Conversely, rejection at this resistance could reintroduce bearish momentum.

Trade Outlook:

In summary, while XRP's 11.4% weekly gain underscores growing optimism, the token remains technically constrained within a descending triangle. A clear breakout will be needed to confirm whether this rally marks the start of a larger recovery or just another pause before the next pullback.

With the crypto market on the prowl for its next breakout chance, investors are diverting interest from more recognizable altcoins such as Ripple (XRP) and into fresh DeFi crypto gems with lots of room to expand. One of them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is in Phase 6 of its presale, having sold over 75% and raising over $17.95 million. Starting from $0.01 in Phase 1, the MUTM token has now increased to $0.035, an increase of 250%. 

Its price will continue to launch at $0.06, showing a consistent growth plan that favors early birds. MUTM's dual-lending environment of Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools enables borrowing, lending, and earning on a single platform with ease, providing real-world use case utility that XRP can't match. As investors hunt for the top crypto to buy today, Mutuum Finance is a low-entry, high-reward opportunity to outperform legacy altcoins as the next big DeFi crypto breakout of 2025.

Ripple (XRP) is trying investors' patience once more. Following the establishment of support above $2.25, XRP briefly tried to follow Bitcoin and Ethereum into a recovery, breaking above $2.50, but bears are now firm at the $2.55 resistance level. Trading below $2.42, bulls require a clean break above $2.55 to threaten $2.65–$2.70, while the $2.32–$2.27 area is still key support; loss of this area could have XRP vulnerable to further declines in the $2.20 area. Near-term momentum is deteriorating but overall structure implies a turn if buyers reappear. While traders wait for XRP's next moves, many are also researching emerging DeFi crypto projects with strong fundamentals and enormous upside potential, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining more attention for the next market cycle.

Mutuum Finance remains in presale, with robust momentum from over 17,450 token holders and $17.95 million generated. The presale has also completed five phases and is currently in Phase 6, with over 75% of this phase sold already. The token began at $0.01 in Phase 1 and has grown to $0.035, a 250% rise. The subsequent phase will increase the price by another 20%, whereas the official launch price is pegged at $0.06, which is a 600% profit from the first phase and double the current price.



For a new crypto, with almost 17,500 holders is not a mean feat. Investors are supporting the project as it builds a DeFi crypto lending and borrowing protocol with excellent chances of adoption. Some big investments have already taken place, and to reward the best supporters, the team introduced a Top 50 leaderboard, which offers MUTM bonuses to the largest investors according to their rank. This introduces a competitive and fun factor to the presale.

The team also revealed on their official X account that the development of the lending protocol has commenced, with a release of testnet in Q4 2025. This shows that progress is not just happening on the presale side of things but also on the development of the actual platform, increasing investor confidence and credibility in the roadmap.

The listing of the token should coincide with the full launch of the platform, as per the roadmap. Synchronizing the events may enhance the prospects of getting listed on prominent CEXs and DEXs, garner attention, and onboard more users, benefiting the overall growth of the protocol.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top DeFi crypto project with tangible real-world utility and early-stage growth prospects. With more than 17,450 investors and $17.95 million in funds raised, its two-token lending ecosystem enables users to lend, borrow, and earn easily, providing useful financial utility that older altcoins such as Ripple (XRP) simply cannot compete with. As Phase nearly 6 concludes and the token is ready for its next price step, early adopters can reap the rewards of both strategic positioning as well as the platform's long-term adoption potential. For those investors looking for what's the best crypto to buy with real-world DeFi use cases, MUTM is a growth, engagement, and long-term returns project designed for the changing 2025 crypto market.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin a stark reminder that while blockchain security prevents even a majority of validator collusion from stealing on-chain assets, this protection vanishes completely when users trust validators with off-chain tasks.

He noted that if 51% of validators collude or fall victim to software bugs, they cannot steal assets stored on-chain, but this ironclad protection vanishes the moment users trust validators with tasks beyond the blockchain's direct control.

Regular reminder:A key property of a blockchain is that even a 51% attack *cannot make an invalid block valid*. This means even 51% of validators colluding (or hit by a software bug) cannot steal your assets.However, this property does not carry over if you start trusting…— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) 

The warning particularly highlights a critical but often misunderstood boundary in blockchain architecture. 

While on-chain funds remain cryptographically protected even under majority-attacker attacks, any off-chain activity that relies on validator honesty leaves users vulnerable to manipulation with no recourse.The Security Boundary Blockchain Can't Cross

Blockchain protocols enforce strict validation rules that every node independently verifies by checking transaction signatures, preventing double-spending, and ensuring that state transitions follow the protocol logic. 

This decentralized verification means colluding validators cannot forge transactions or create invalid blocks that steal user funds. 

The system's distributed nature ensures that even majority control cannot override these fundamental safeguards.Source: 

However, this protection breaks down when validators handle off-chain tasks like oracle data feeds, governance decisions, or restaking services. 

These activities fall outside the blockchain's algorithmic enforcement and rely instead on validator honesty. 

A colluding majority could provide false data or manipulated outcomes without the cryptographic proofs that protect on-chain transactions.

Users affected by such off-chain collusion have no automatic dispute-resolution or recovery mechanism. 

The blockchain cannot verify or contest decisions made beyond its consensus layer, leaving victims without the recourse that makes on-chain assets fundamentally secure.Why Off-Chain Trust Amplifies Risk

Traditional blockchain verification requires computers to perform 100 times as much work as the original calculation. 

However, when users move funds off-chain, through custodial wallets, centralized exchanges, or validator-controlled computations, they surrender the blockchain's built-in protections. 

Off-chain systems lack the independent verification that every on-chain node provides, leaving them vulnerable to majority validator manipulation.

The distinction matters because blockchain consensus operates through algorithmic rule enforcement that no single party controls.Source: 

Off-chain activities depend on coordinated behavior and validator integrity, but not on protocol-level verification. 

Smart contracts that rely on validator-provided oracle data could yield incorrect outcomes if a majority colludes to report false information, potentially causing financial losses that on-chain mechanisms cannot prevent or reverse.

When whether his warning referenced restaking protocols like EigenLayer, Buterin the platform addresses this vulnerability through slashing mechanisms using its own token. 

Eigenlayer relies on slashing (for subjective criteria using its own token) for this exact reason— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) 

This economic penalty system provides some protection but cannot match the cryptographic guarantees that secure on-chain block validity against majority attacks.Balancing Privacy with Blockchain's Transparency Shield

Buterin's security reminder comes as Ethereum pursues major privacy improvements that are different from the network's traditionally transparent nature. 

Earlier this month, he detailed GKR, a cryptographic technique that verifies calculations 10 times faster than traditional methods while enabling zero-knowledge proofs, allowing computers to prove calculations are correct without revealing the underlying data.

The Ethereum Foundation also launched a 47-member Privacy Cluster in September to make network privacy default rather than optional, addressing concerns that public blockchains expose too much financial information. 

Aside from enterprise demand, Vitalik sees it as the only way to global adoption, especially for Ethereum.

❓️ Imagine if your bank account had a public URL. That's the reality of crypto today, and why it ""will never scale beyond a niche,” says Petro Golovko. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) 

Just recently, while speaking with Cryptonews, industry expert Petro Golovko compared current blockchain transparency to the pre-encryption internet era, arguing that systems exposing salaries and account balances remain “unusable for regular people and impossible for institutions.” 

The initiative aims to enable private transactions, selective identity disclosure, and improved user privacy experience without sacrificing the verification mechanisms that prevent validator manipulation.

However, the privacy push creates an apparent paradox. If transactions become private, how can the network maintain the transparent verification that protects against off-chain manipulation, Buterin warned about? 

The solution lies in cryptographic techniques like GKR that allow verification of transaction validity without exposing transaction details, preserving the blockchain's core security property where invalid blocks remain rejected even under majority attacks, while shielding sensitive financial data from public view.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has cautioned that the blockchain's cryptographic guarantees stop where external trust begins.

On October 26, Buterin explained that even a 51% attack cannot validate an invalid block. This means that even if a majority of validators collude or experience a software bug, they cannot seize users' funds or forge transactions.

This is because each blockchain node independently verifies new blocks and automatically rejects any that break the protocol's rules. This decentralized verification protects Ethereum from false ledger entries, even under majority control.

However, Buterin emphasized that this security guarantee only applies to the blockchain's protocol.

According to him, the moment users rely on validators for tasks outside that framework—such as bridging assets, verifying real-world data, or confirming off-chain events—they enter a zone where trust replaces math.

In that realm, if 51% of validators agree on a false statement, the network itself offers no recourse.

Buterin's remarks have reignited debate within the developer community. Many are now questioning how much control validators should hold as blockchains adopt complex features like bridges, oracles, and off-chain attestations.

Polygon's Chief Technology Officer, Mudit Gupta, supported the warning.

However, he explained that while validators can't alter Ethereum's state, they can ""steal money"" through maximal extractable value (MEV) or even enforce censorship.

Meanwhile, others disagreed with Buterin's position.

Seun Lanlege, co-founder of Polkadot's Hyperbridge, argued that validator influence runs deeper. He warned that a malicious majority could manipulate block propagation or isolate nodes through eclipse attacks.

This exposes a structural vulnerability that extends beyond MEV or censorship.

Adding another perspective, MultiversX core developer Robert Sasu urged teams to minimize reliance on off-chain components altogether.

""Make and move everything onchain. Directly in a decentralised L1,"" he stated.

In his view, any reliance on centralized systems like bridges, oracles, or price feeds invites manipulation. True resilience, he argued, comes from designing decentralized, permissionless, and composable systems that minimize trusted intermediaries.

A proposed XRP Ledger amendment, Batch (XLS-56), is generating excitement among developers and validators alike.

One pseudonymous XRP validator, Vet, has shared his experience testing the Batch functionality on the dev net, where multiple transactions, including minting and payments for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), can be bundled and executed automatically.

The amendment, according to Vet, enables creation of a fully peer-to-peer NFT-to-NFT trading platform, allowing users to perform a barter-like NFT swaps in a single transaction. 

For instance, one could trade five of their NFTs for two NFTS owned by another party, all processed simultaneously to ensure atomicity and security, Vet said on X, suggesting a game-inspired interface, similar to the classic RuneScape, to make this NFT-to-NFT trading more engaging and intuitive for users.

As of writing, the Batch amendment has achieved 68.57% consensus among validators, with 80% required for activation. XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain used by Ripple to build cross border payments solution. 

The Batch amendment introduces atomic transaction capabilities to the XRP Ledger, allowing multiple operations to be grouped and executed simultaneously as a single unified transaction.

It takes the all or nothing approach – either all transactions in the group are completed successfully or none are, thereby eliminating the risk of partial execution failures.

This principle of atomicity has its roots in computer science and database management, where a sequence of operations is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Therefore, an atomic process means that the entire set of transactions is either fully executed or entirely rolled back to ensure data integrity. 

Atomicity on XRP Ledger could be valuable in complex NFT trades or swaps involving multiple steps, facilitating the development of sophisticated NFT marketplaces.

""This new amendment drastically changes the functionality of the XRP Ledger by allowing the grouping and ordering of up to 8 transactions into a single batched operation. It also introduces atomic execution via ALLORNOTHING as one of its execution modes for batched transactions,"" Teucrium said in a Substack post.

A total of four batch modes are supported: ALLORNOTHING, ONLYONE, UNTILFAILURE, and INDEPENDENT. The availability of four modes will ensure flexibility in how multiple transactions are executed as a group, helping developers choose the best approach for their use case.

Key Takeaways

Binance listed two new spot assets, GIGGLE and F, applying the Seed Tag due to high volatility risks, requiring users to pass awareness quizzes.

GIGGLE is a charitable memecoin whose 5% transaction fee is instantly converted to BNB to fund the non-profit Giggle Academy.

F, the SynFutures DeFi token, faces risk until 2028 from a long vesting schedule on 88% of its 10 billion supply, causing potential selling pressure.

Binance officially listed both GIGGLE and F as new spot assets and applied the Seed Tag to both. They established multiple trading avenues for these new assets. Specifically, traders access the market through USDT, USDC, and TRY pairs. This includes: GIGGLE/USDT, GIGGLE/USDC, GIGGLE/TRY, F/USDT, F/USDC and F/TRY.

Source: Binance

The listing process follows a strict schedule. Users could begin depositing GIGGLE and F one hour before trading started. Binance also supported these tokens on its Binance Alpha Market initially. However, the tokens delisted from Alpha upon official spot trading commencement. Withdrawals for both assets open one day after trading begins. Binance charges zero listing fees for both GIGGLE and F.

Giggle Fund (GIGGLE) establishes a novel category: a memecoin that directly channels transactional value into tangible social good.

Operating on the BNB Smart Chain, GIGGLE's entire economic structure supports Giggle Academy, a global non-profit entity focused on providing free, high-quality education. The public endorsement and involvement of former Binance CEO, CZ, who champions the academy's mission, has significantly enhanced the token's credibility.

$11,000,000 in hard currency (#BNB) donated to @GiggleAcademy in less than 20 days to spread free education to the world. Power to crypto for good, Power to $giggle. https://t.co/jc00i8zVIy pic.twitter.com/P38ikSnDL4

— CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 10, 2025



GIGGLE successfully reframes the memecoin narrative from pure speculation toward demonstrable, verifiable public welfare. Consequently, this creates a powerful flywheel effect: trading activity directly fuels educational expansion. As a result, this clear utility differentiates it from traditional memecoins, lending it a higher degree of legitimacy in the eyes of socially conscious investors.

GIGGLE's token design emphasizes radical transparency and inherent scarcity. Developers hard-capped the total supply at an ultra-low 1,000,000 GIGGLE. The project deliberately bypassed traditional token launch models; founders allocated zero tokens to themselves or private investors.

This instantaneous conversion is a critical protective measure for protecting charity, stabilizing token price, and supporting the funding mechanism. This charity-first model elevates GIGGLE above standard speculative tokens, attaching its trading success directly to global educational outreach. The project's momentum, driven by rapid fundraising milestones and community excitement, fuels its high-risk, high-reward profile highlighted by the Seed Tag.

SynFutures (F) fuels one of the most ambitious projects in decentralized finance: a DEX designed to serve as full-stack financial infrastructure for derivatives trading. It aims to simplify the complexities of derivatives trading, making it accessible while maintaining the robust features required by professional traders via its novel Oyster AMM.

SynFutures champions permissionless access, allowing any user to list and trade perpetual futures contracts on virtually any underlying asset. In contrast, this represents a massive departure from existing centralized platforms. 

Source: SynFutures

The F token acts as the crucial economic anchor for the entire SynFutures ecosystem. Holders exercise direct governance rights, deciding the protocol's future evolution. Active participation yields rewards, including staking rewards, trading incentives, and ecosystem utility.

The total supply of F is 10,000,000,000. However, the supply distribution severely impacts its scarcity.

The success of F hinges on whether its technological differentiation can generate enough sustained revenue to outpace the vesting inflation. To be clear, this includes the hybrid Oyster AMM/Order Book and cross-chain RWA capabilities. The risk is constant and transparent for all future holders until 2028.

These two listings showcase Binance's willingness to support innovation at opposite ends of the spectrum: GIGGLE leverages radical token scarcity for social good, while F builds complex, multi-year institutional infrastructure balanced against a heavy vesting load. Both demand deep trader education, as the Seed Tag reflects.

NEW YORK, NY, October 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Korean artist BDKim (Kim Dae-Yong) announced a special project celebrating world peace and APEC 2025 through his official website (www.Daum.ai) on October 22, 2025.

Kim suspended all artistic activities following the declaration of martial law in South Korea on December 3, 2024. As political stability returned, he resumed his work and launched the nationwide art tour project ""BDKim – Art on the Move.""

As part of this initiative, a 1.2-ton wing-body truck has been transformed into a mobile gallery and has been touring the country since October 3.

The journey will culminate in Gyeongju, where leaders of the 21 APEC member economies will gather. At the Mojeon Stone Brick Pagoda at Bunhwangsa Temple in Gyeongju, Kim will unveil two 2.5-meter original canvases, the truck installation, and dozens of video and NFT artworks.

The canvas works include previously unreleased pieces originally created for an exhibition atop Mount Baekdu one year ago.

The NFT video artworks — titled ""Dancing Flags of Peace"" — reinterpret the national flags of APEC member economies and are dedicated to their leaders and citizens. Each piece is a five-second video composition expressing the harmony of Yin and Yang energies.

Importantly, the NFTs do not rely on external URL links; instead, the digital assets are directly uploaded and permanently preserved on-chain through a third-generation Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain node.

This fully decentralized blockchain technology — SASEUL PoW Chain, independently developed over seven years by Artifriends Co., Ltd. (CEO Jeongwoo Lee) — has been recognized for its technological integrity through its listing on the BitMart exchange and is preparing for a hard fork.

In 2023, Elon Musk emphasized on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast that NFTs depending on off-chain URLs are inherently vulnerable, stating that digital artworks such as JPEGs must be encoded directly onto the blockchain.

Reflecting this principle, Kim noted that his entire collection is stored securely and immutably on-chain, to be presented as gifts to APEC nations and shared publicly through social media.

In addition to the NFT dedication works, three supplementary video versions (6-second, 30-second, and 2-minute cuts) have already been delivered to the embassies of all 21 member economies, accompanied by official invitations to national leaders and relevant officials.

Kim explains that ""Beyond the Whole World"" and ""Dancing Flags of Peace"" embody the energy of peace and the origins of primordial art for the future spiritual era — a cultural legacy for generations to come.

Looking ahead, Kim plans to present the complete five-piece set of ""Beyond the Whole World"" — including three previously unreleased works, totaling 12 meters — at Mt. Baekdu in North Korea, together with artists from across the world.

This peace-themed international exhibition is expected to draw significant attention within the global art community. News about BDKim's planned Mount Baekdu exhibition was previously reported by North Korea–related media outlets, referring to his intention rather than an ongoing project.

As the contemporary art world faces stagnation, whether BDKim's artistic universe will illuminate a new path remains to be seen — yet growing global attention is already turning toward his next steps.# # #

Kyrgyzstan has rolled out a new stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Kyrgyzstani som, while confirming plans to issue a central bank digital currency and explore a digital asset reserve.

The KGST stablecoin will run on the BNB Chain, and BNB (BNB) would be included in the crypto reserve if launched, according to former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao, who attended the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies' second meeting on Friday with President Sadyr Japarov.

The first meeting took place around April, when CZ became a strategic adviser for Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee.

Local media outlet KG24 said Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee must ensure the KGST stablecoin is listed on international platforms and submit proposals for creating a national crypto reserve within two months.

Kyrgyzstan's latest moves highlight how crypto adoption is advancing at the nation-state level by experimenting with stablecoins and CBDCs to modernize payments, improve financial inclusion, boost transparency, and attract investment.

Japarov also advised the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to continue crafting a legislative framework for virtual assets and for the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic to begin pilot testing of the digital som.

Kyrgyzstan moves forward with CBDC plans

The pilot will run in three stages, building on the National Bank's demo of the digital som platform built with Build Block TECH. It will first connect commercial banks to enable transfers, then link the Central Treasury for social and government payments, and finally test offline and low-connectivity transactions ahead of a national rollout.

""After successfully piloting all three phases, the platform will be rolled out nationally and scaled,"" Kyrgyzstan's top bank said. 

The National Bank initially said in April that it wouldn't make a decision on whether to issue a CBDC until the end of 2026. 

While over 100 nations have initiated CBDC projects, only three CBDCs are currently live — the Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria's e-Naira and Jamaica's JAM-DEX, data from cbdctracker.org shows.

Education is also a focal point for Kyrgyzstan

Meanwhile, Japarov also advised the Ministry of Science, Higher Education, and Innovation to submit proposals on how it intends to develop digital financial literacy plans and train specialists in the blockchain and AI industries.

CZ said Kyrgyzstan would integrate Binance's education arm, Binance Academy, with 10 of its top universities and “fully localize” the Binance app across the south Asian country.

Bolivia's Central Bank released a report exploring a wholesale CBDC, the digital Boliviano, to modernize payments and counter stablecoin growth.

The Central Bank of Bolivia issued its first report evaluating a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Consequently, the bank is looking at implementing the “digital Boliviano.” This initiative aims to get the country's entire financial system modernized in effect. Therefore, the report represents a significant step towards a possible digital currency.

The bank also recognizes the potential benefits of such currency. A CBDC would enable private banks to efficiently optimize high-value transactions. Moreover, it could not only revamp the sovereignty of the Bolivian Boliviano, but also revamp the sovereignty of the fiat currency. This is extremely important in a more digital world. Thus, efficiency and monetary control are addressed in the study.

In this first phase of evaluation, the bank considered different models. Specifically, it concluded the wholesale, interbank currency would be most useful in the beginning. This model only deals with transactions between financial institutions. Therefore, it would create an optimization of the internal processes of the payment system directly. This affects key financial players in the country.

The report's use of stablecoins as a key factor is highlighted. For this reason, a central bank probably considers a CBDC a necessary countermeasure. It aims to keep monetary control in the digital age effectively. Furthermore, the fact that a wholesale CBDC is a controlled environment in which to test. This is because it allows the bank to test the impact of the technology safely.

Moreover, the focus on the optimization of internal payment systems is strategic. It targets existing inefficiencies within the traditional infrastructure of traditional banking institutions head-on. Therefore, near-instant settlement between banking institutions could cut through operational friction dramatically. This improvement improves the overall resilience of the financial sector in a short time.

In essence, the digital Boliviano hopes to improve high-value transaction speed. This improvement could reduce costs to participating financial institutions to a significant level. Ultimately, such benefits would trickle down the entire Bolivian economy. The bank is seriously considering these possible advantages at the moment.

Additionally, the report highlights the role of fiat currency sovereignty. The emergence of private digital currencies is a challenge at the global level. Therefore, central banks are considering CBDCs to reclaim their role. Bolivia's exploration fits this international trend well. This move is aimed at ensuring the successful completion of monetary stability in long-term.

The move to favor a wholesale model is a well-thought-out move. A retail CBDC comes with complex issues such as public acceptance and privacy issues. In contrast, an interbank system makes for a focused and controlled implementation in the first place. This way, there are minimal immediate risks taken for the broader financial system.

What's more, the potential integration with existing payment systems is critical. The report suggests the CBDC has the potential to improve existing infrastructure efficiently. This prevents the whole overhaul right now. As a result, the transition may be less abrupt and less disruptive on the whole. The bank is focusing on practicality when making its assessment.

In conclusion, Bolivia is taking a proactive approach to digital currency innovation in the present moment. The potential existence of a digital Boliviano can modernize the financial system considerably. But the central bank is being circumspect.

On October 24, the head of state held a meeting with the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies, instructing the launch of the “stable coin” and considering its listing on international platforms.

The agency was tasked with presenting proposals for creating a state cryptocurrency reserve within two months.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) participated in the meeting. On October 26, the businessman confirmed the successful launch of the national stablecoin and the imminent CBDC pilot.

CZ added that Kyrgyzstan is laying the groundwork for creating a cryptocurrency reserve, which includes BNB.

“Yes, both will be used for government payments and so on,” Zhao clarified.

According to him, Binance is a minority investor in the national initiative. The exchange will provide government consultation and infrastructure development.

Back in April, the founder of Binance became an advisor to the Kyrgyz government on cryptocurrency and blockchain matters.

Oops, something went wrong

Kyrgyzstan has launched a new stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the national currency, the som, marking its latest step toward broader crypto adoption.

Key Takeaways:

Kyrgyzstan launched its first national stablecoin, KGST, pegged 1:1 to the som and built on the BNB Chain.

Former Binance CEO CZ attended the launch and confirmed plans for a future national crypto reserve and a CBDC pilot.

The National Bank will test the digital som in three phases before deciding on a full rollout by 2026.

The government also confirmed plans to pilot a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and establish a national crypto reserve.

The new stablecoin, KGST, operates on the BNB Chain, with BNB itself likely to be part of the future crypto reserve, according to former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.

Zhao joined Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov on Friday during the second meeting of the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies.

He has served as a strategic adviser to the country's crypto committee since April.

Local outlet KG24 reported that Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee has been tasked with ensuring KGST's listing on international exchanges and submitting concrete proposals for a national crypto reserve within two months.

The move is part of a larger effort to leverage blockchain and digital assets to modernize the financial system, attract foreign investment, and promote transparency in government and banking operations.

The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic confirmed it will conduct a three-phase pilot of the digital som, building on its earlier demo with Build Block TECH.

The pilot will begin by linking commercial banks for interbank transfers, followed by integration with the Central Treasury for government and social payments.

The final stage will test offline and low-connectivity transactions before a national rollout.

“After successfully piloting all three phases, the platform will be rolled out nationally and scaled,” the central bank said.

Despite its progress, the bank reiterated that it will decide whether to issue a CBDC only after completing evaluations by 2026.

More than 100 countries are currently exploring CBDCs, but only three, the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, Nigeria's e-Naira, and Jamaica's JAM-DEX, are live, according to CBDCTracker.org.

President Japarov also directed the Ministry of Science and Higher Education to develop digital financial literacy programs and train blockchain and AI specialists.

CZ announced that Binance Academy will partner with 10 leading Kyrgyz universities and fully localize the Binance app in the country.

The announcement came days after Donald Trump pardoned CZ, who had faced charges related to anti-money laundering violations during his time as Binance CEO.

Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering violations at the crypto exchange back in 2023.

Binance agreed to pay over $4 billion in forfeiture, while Zhao was ordered to pay $50 million in fines in order to resolve the landmark crypto case.

The Binance founder also agreed to step down from his role as Binance CEO, though this week's presidential pardon may open the doors for him to return to the position.

The Federal Reserve is making waves with its latest initiative. They've introduced a new payment pathway for the digital currency firms. This is a major change for those issuing stablecoins and other crypto companies looking to tap into the Fed's payment systems. It's a big deal since it's poised to transform traditional banks' role in the crypto world, but it also raises questions about how regulatory compliance will unfold.

At the Federal Reserve's Payment Innovation Conference on October 21, a new payment account model was introduced. This one specifically targets stablecoin issuers and cryptocurrency firms. The best part? These companies can now connect directly to the Fedwire and ACH systems. However, this access doesn't come with all the bells and whistles like earning interest on deposits or emergency lending.

This is a nod back to the concept of ""narrow banking"", which is all about focusing strictly on payments and steering clear of credit creation. Right now, stablecoin issuers are relying on traditional banks for token redemption facilitation. With this initiative, eligible companies could hold their reserves right at the Fed, using central bank money to back their digital currencies.

Narrow banking is seeing a revival in the crypto world, and it's all about stabilizing the system. By separating the payment functions from traditional lending, it aims to create a more secure environment. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, believes this fixes past mistakes by the Fed that had limited payment-oriented banks. The new pathway should lead to faster redemptions and fewer liquidity problems that often arise between banks and their partners.

However, there are still challenges. Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, raised a valid concern about the diminishing need for traditional banks if stablecoins like Tether lessen their reliance on them. To tackle these risks, the Fed has proposed some measures, including restrictions on non-interest-bearing accounts and balance limits.

As the Fed moves to balance regulatory compliance with the burgeoning demand for innovation in the crypto sector, the implications of this new payment pathway are significant. While there's no official timeline for regulatory changes, Waller has directed Fed staff to gather input from stakeholders. The GENIUS Act, which has been in effect since July, set federal standards for stablecoins but didn't facilitate Fed access. This innovative model aims to fill that gap.

The focus on crypto-specific management of dollar flows shows the continuing impact of digital assets on financial regulations and liquidity. As digital banking for business evolves, the importance of adhering to crypto business regulations will only grow. This shift will significantly reframe the financial landscape, promising faster redemptions while coming with restrictions like interest limitations and balance caps.

The integration of cryptocurrency into payroll systems is advancing, with businesses exploring crypto payroll solutions. Stablecoins are emerging as the hot new salary trend, allowing employees to choose digital assets as their payment method. This is not just a trend; it's a movement towards promoting financial inclusion and enhancing cross-border payments.

As digital banking for business continues to grow, businesses must navigate the evolving regulatory environment while seizing the benefits of crypto payments. The rise of Web3 banking is indicative of how technology is reshaping traditional banking practices.

In summary, the Fed's new payment pathway is set to reshape the role of traditional banking, diminishing its role in payment facilitation. This change is bound to foster fintech and crypto innovation, leading to a more direct, efficient, and competitive financial ecosystem. With the lines between traditional banking and cryptocurrency blurring, businesses need to adapt to these changes while adhering to compliance. 

The future of banking is here and it's closely linked to cryptocurrency and digital payments. As we progress, the implications of these changes will continue to unfold, steering the financial world for years to come.

Bolivia's Central Bank released a report exploring a wholesale CBDC, the digital Boliviano, to modernize payments and counter stablecoin growth.

The Central Bank of Bolivia issued its first report evaluating a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Consequently, the bank is looking at implementing the “digital Boliviano.” This initiative aims to get the country's entire financial system modernized in effect. Therefore, the report represents a significant step towards a possible digital currency.

The bank also recognizes the potential benefits of such currency. A CBDC would enable private banks to efficiently optimize high-value transactions. Moreover, it could not only revamp the sovereignty of the Bolivian Boliviano, but also revamp the sovereignty of the fiat currency. This is extremely important in a more digital world. Thus, efficiency and monetary control are addressed in the study.

In this first phase of evaluation, the bank considered different models. Specifically, it concluded the wholesale, interbank currency would be most useful in the beginning. This model only deals with transactions between financial institutions. Therefore, it would create an optimization of the internal processes of the payment system directly. This affects key financial players in the country.

The report's use of stablecoins as a key factor is highlighted. For this reason, a central bank probably considers a CBDC a necessary countermeasure. It aims to keep monetary control in the digital age effectively. Furthermore, the fact that a wholesale CBDC is a controlled environment in which to test. This is because it allows the bank to test the impact of the technology safely.

Moreover, the focus on the optimization of internal payment systems is strategic. It targets existing inefficiencies within the traditional infrastructure of traditional banking institutions head-on. Therefore, near-instant settlement between banking institutions could cut through operational friction dramatically. This improvement improves the overall resilience of the financial sector in a short time.

In essence, the digital Boliviano hopes to improve high-value transaction speed. This improvement could reduce costs to participating financial institutions to a significant level. Ultimately, such benefits would trickle down the entire Bolivian economy. The bank is seriously considering these possible advantages at the moment.

Additionally, the report highlights the role of fiat currency sovereignty. The emergence of private digital currencies is a challenge at the global level. Therefore, central banks are considering CBDCs to reclaim their role. Bolivia's exploration fits this international trend well. This move is aimed at ensuring the successful completion of monetary stability in long-term.

The move to favor a wholesale model is a well-thought-out move. A retail CBDC comes with complex issues such as public acceptance and privacy issues. In contrast, an interbank system makes for a focused and controlled implementation in the first place. This way, there are minimal immediate risks taken for the broader financial system.

What's more, the potential integration with existing payment systems is critical. The report suggests the CBDC has the potential to improve existing infrastructure efficiently. This prevents the whole overhaul right now. As a result, the transition may be less abrupt and less disruptive on the whole. The bank is focusing on practicality when making its assessment.

In conclusion, Bolivia is taking a proactive approach to digital currency innovation in the present moment. The potential existence of a digital Boliviano can modernize the financial system considerably. But the central bank is being circumspect. It focuses on stability and control in this critical evaluation process. The eyes of the world's financial community will be focused on the progress of Bolivia.

Nino Paoli is a Dow Jones News Fund fellow at Fortune on the News desk.

The White House has released a list of donors for the Trump administration's new ballroom construction project, following a historic East Wing demolition that began this week.

The estimated cost of the 90,000-square-foot build has topped $300 million, up from its July estimate of $200 million. President Donald Trump has insisted it will not come out of taxpayers' wallets. 





A list released by White House officials and reviewed by Fortune shows all 37 donors footing the bill instead—and it includes some of the nation's largest tech companies, companies with government contracts and members of the administration. 





Their private, tax-deductible donations will be made to the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall. The White House did not release the size of the donations for all 37 listed. Trump has previously said he will pay for some of the project, though his name doesn't appear on the list. 





1. Meta Platforms




CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously attended a White House dinner for tech leaders in September, where he pledged at least $600 billion in investments in the U.S. by 2028. Meta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, frequently engages with federal digital policy initiatives and AI oversight forums.





2. Apple


The company announced plans in August to invest $100 billion in domestic manufacturing, aligning with Trump's wishes to reshore industrial work. CEO Tim Cook also attended the White House dinner last month and has maintained a close relationship with the administration.





3. Amazon 


Founded by Jeff Bezos, the e‑commerce and cloud‑computing company has major federal contracts with the Pentagon and has cultivated a new relationship with the administration through intense lobbying.




4. Google


 The search giant's parent company agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a dispute with Trump earlier this year over his YouTube ban following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Alphabet pledged $22 million of the settlement money to go toward the ballroom construction.





5. Lockheed Martin 


The defense contractor is a major supplier for Pentagon programs and has received $33.4 billion in federal contract awards in 2025 alone, according to USA Spending. The company is reportedly contributing more than $10 million to the ballroom.





“Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,” a spokesperson told Fortune.




6. Microsoft


The software and cloud provider has multibillion-dollar federal contracts, including AI partnerships integral to U.S. cybersecurity strategy.





7. Comcast 


The parent company of NBCUniversal faces scrutiny from Trump, who called for the Federal Communications Commission to revoke NBC's license in August. He accused NBC and fellow broadcaster ABC, owned by Disney, of being “two of the worst and most biased networks in history.”





8. Altria




The parent company of tobacco brand Marlboro and one of the country's largest tobacco firms has pushed for less FDA oversight of e-cigarettes. A subsidiary of the company, Altria Client Services, is a donor to Republican PACs. 





9. Coinbase 


The popular crypto exchange platform is headed by CEO Brian Armstrong, who has supported Trump's push for looser crypto regulation and dollar‑pegged stablecoins.





10. Palantir Technologies


The data‑analytics company has had a surge in major federal surveillance and border‑security contracts under the Trump administration.




11. T‑Mobile 


The telecommunications giant's merger and licensing agreements were reviewed favorably during Trump's first term. “Trump Mobile,” a Trump Organization-branded cell service, runs on the company's network. 





12. Ripple 


The blockchain‑payments network has an interest in Trump's push to position the  U.S. as a digital‑asset finance hub.





13. Hard Rock International 




The Seminole-owned casino and hotel brand's chairman, Jim Allen, once served as a vice president of operations at the Trump Organization.





14. Tether America


The crypto stablecoin issuer has supported Trump's “digital‑dollar alternative” framework. 





15. Union Pacific Railroad 


The freight‑transportation company is hoping to merge with Norfolk Southern under a Republican-led SEC.




16. Micron Technology 


The U.S. chip manufacturer was celebrated by the White House this year after announcing a $200 billion investment in the country.





17. Caterpillar 


The heavy‑machinery manufacturer is viewed by the administration as symbolic of the “Made in America” push.





18. Booz Allen Hamilton 




The defense and cybersecurity contractor said in its second-quarter earnings call that 90% of its $7.2 billion made in bookings in the quarter came from national security work.





19. HP 


The computer hardware maker gave $50,000 to Trump's 2025 inaugural committee and has received contracts from the U.S. military and other departments.





20. NextEra Energy 


The top renewable‑energy utility's CEO, John Ketchum, previously said he agrees with the administration's focus on bringing jobs back to America, but has also criticized Trump's efforts to boost the coal industry.




21. Reynolds American 


The tobacco conglomerate's PAC gave $25,000 to a Trump fundraising committee in 2016.





22. The Adelson Family Foundation 


The philanthropic arm of the late Sheldon Adelson, a casino mogul and longtime Republican donor, is now run by his widow, Miriam, who is another big GOP donor and received the Medal of Freedom from Trump during his first term.

The industrial metals investor was convicted in the early 2000s of violating U.S. sanctions on Cuba, and a 2023 pardon request to President Biden was denied.





24. Betty Wold Johnson Foundation


The charitable organization funded by the Johnson & Johnson heiress is known for gifts to education, health and civic projects.





25. Charles and Marissa  Cascarilla

28. Benjamín Leon Jr.




The Cuban-American Miami healthcare entrepreneur and philanthropist donated over $3 million to Trump's 2024 campaign run and was nominated by Trump in January as U.S. Ambassador to Spain and Andorra. His nomination is pending Senate confirmation.

Ferrari makes history by organizing the first auction of a legendary racing car, the 499P Hypercar, exclusively in crypto. This initiative, combining technological innovation, AI, and automotive tradition, aims to attract a new generation of investors. Analysis of an auction that could revolutionize the luxury market.

One year after its arrival in Europe with BTC payments, Ferrari announces an exceptional auction for its 499P Hypercar, triple winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, reserved for its most exclusive clients. To participate, bidders must use a dedicated digital token, the Ferrari 499P Token, created especially for the occasion. This crypto token, developed in collaboration with the Italian fintech Conio, will allow members of the Hyperclub – a closed circle of 100 endurance enthusiasts – to submit bids on a secure platform.

The process is quite simple:

Accepted cryptos include bitcoin, ethereum, and USDC, with automatic conversion to fiat currency to facilitate exchanges. The auction, scheduled for 2027, is part of the World Endurance Championship, adding a sporting and prestigious dimension to the event. Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a key role in this auction. Algorithms will analyze real-time data to detect trends, prevent fraud, and optimize participant experience.

The auction for Ferrari's 499P Hypercar continues the brand's crypto strategy, which already accepts payments in bitcoin, ethereum, and USDC for its new vehicles since 2023. By choosing an iconic racing car like the 499P, the Italian brand specifically targets crypto-millionaires and technology enthusiasts, a rapidly growing market.

The Ferrari 499P Token is not just a payment tool. It symbolizes Ferrari's commitment to innovation and modernization of its processes. By integrating blockchain and AI, Ferrari shows how luxury can adapt to new investor expectations. All this while preserving its prestige. This initiative places the brand as a pioneer, ahead of competitors like Lamborghini or Porsche, who are only beginning to explore crypto payments.

This auction raises an important question: can cryptos and AI become standards in the luxury sector? Ferrari shows that these technologies allow modernization of sales processes while attracting a young and wealthy clientele. The Ferrari 499P Token, coupled with AI analysis tools, offers a tailored and secure experience.

However, challenges remain. Cryptocurrency volatility and regulatory uncertainties could deter some investors. Yet, Ferrari appears determined to overcome these obstacles, leveraging its prestige and expertise. Experts believe this initiative could become a benchmark! This would pave the way for other similar auctions in the luxury world.

Ferrari thus reinvents luxury auctions by integrating crypto and AI, proving that tradition and innovation can coexist. This initiative poses questions about the future of high-end transactions: will cryptocurrencies become essential?

Home - Crypto Presales - Inside BlockDAG's Over $430M Digital City: Hybrid DAG + PoW Tech Powers a New Blockchain Civilization!

The conversation around digital assets is changing, and BlockDAG is leading that transformation. It isn't just launching a currency, it's constructing an entire digital metropolis. Priced at $0.0015 for a limited time, and with over $430 million raised, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers far more than a traditional crypto entry; it's an opportunity to own a piece of a functioning digital economy before the world moves in.



Instead of buying into a single product, participants are effectively taking part in a self-sustaining city's economy. As more builders and users join, its ecosystem expands in both value and utility. This approach reshapes what digital ownership can mean, positioning BlockDAG as the blueprint for a new kind of online civilization.

At its core, BlockDAG serves as the operating framework for decentralized growth. It tackles the long-debated “Blockchain Trilemma,” ensuring no compromise between speed, security, and decentralization. The platform achieves this balance through its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work architecture.

Unbreakable Security: Using the proven Proof-of-Work mechanism, BlockDAG ensures immutability and resistance to attacks.



Unmatched Throughput: The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure enables parallel transaction confirmations, achieving speeds of up to 15,000 transactions per second.











This dual-layer design allows for smooth scalability while maintaining Bitcoin-grade reliability. It forms the groundwork for next-generation decentralized applications, offering developers a system capable of handling both enterprise-scale demands and community-driven projects with ease.

Unlike projects that rely on distant promises, BlockDAG's infrastructure is already active. Key components of this “digital city” are operational, establishing credibility and reducing the uncertainty typical of new launches.

The Power Grid: The Awakening Testnet is live, demonstrating performance and security under real conditions.

Roads and Bridges: Full EVM compatibility lets developers seamlessly migrate or deploy decentralized applications.

A Growing Population: Over $430 M raised and more than 3.5 million X1 mobile miners are already engaged, ensuring widespread adoption and early participation.

This combination of live technology and a growing community makes BlockDAG more than a concept; it's a functioning digital environment, ready to scale. Developers and users aren't waiting for promises; they're already contributing to a network that's operational and expanding daily.

At the heart of BlockDAG's city lies a thriving economy driven by real demand. Its native currency, BDAG, powers all on-chain activities, acting as the system's essential utility. The more people and applications that interact within the ecosystem, the greater the natural demand for BDAG, creating sustainable, built-in growth.

Fuel for dApps: All decentralized applications on the network use BDAG for execution and smart contracts.

Commerce and Transactions: From in-game assets to DeFi platforms, BDAG functions as the medium of exchange across the city.

Scalable Demand: As adoption accelerates, usage increases organically, ensuring continuous economic expansion.

This self-reinforcing model transforms BlockDAG into more than a blockchain; it becomes a living economy, where currency and utility move hand in hand.

The project's foundation of trust and transparency is reflected in its $430 million presale success, backed by 312,000+ holders. Each milestone has added proof that this is a movement with tangible traction and real-world support.

Massive Community Trust: A historic presale that continues to draw strong global participation.

Global Visibility: A multi-year partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team amplifies its global recognition, aligning the brand with speed, precision, and endurance.

High ROI Potential: With the presale price locked at $0.0015 until Genesis Day, and a projected listing price of $0.05, early participants could see a 32x potential upside based on fundamentals, not speculation.












This alignment of marketing scale, verified technology, and widespread adoption positions BlockDAG to be one of the defining projects of the coming market cycle.

BlockDAG isn't just building another network; it's laying the foundation for a digital civilization. Its hybrid DAG + PoW design provides the infrastructure, the live testnet and mining community validate its operation, and the thriving presale community adds financial strength. Every element, from the ecosystem's architecture to its cultural partnerships, reinforces one idea: this isn't a speculative asset, it's a functioning digital city in progress.

By bridging real-world structure with blockchain performance, BlockDAG represents the next phase of digital expansion. The opportunity to join before its official Genesis Day on November 26 offers a moment to claim a position within a growing, self-sustaining ecosystem.

Bitcoin BTC$113,707.66 has long been described as “digital gold”, and, like the precious metal, is often pitched as a hedge against inflation. But new data from NYDIG suggests that the narrative doesn't hold up.

In its weekly digest, NYDIG's Global Head of Research Greg Cipolaro found that inflation isn't a reliable factor driving bitcoin's price. Monthly correlation data shows that bitcoin's relationship to inflation is both inconsistent and weak.

“We know the community likes to pitch bitcoin as an inflation hedge, but unfortunately, here, the data is just not strongly supportive of that argument,” Cipolaro wrote. “The correlations with inflationary measures are neither consistent nor are they extremely high.”

Gold, the traditional inflation hedge, doesn't fare much better. Its correlations with inflation have often been negative and fluctuate from one period to the next.

This challenges the conventional view that rising inflation automatically boosts gold prices, with Cipolaro himself writing that it's surprising that for gold, inflationary measures are inversely correlated.

So what moves bitcoin and gold? Real interest rates and money supply.

For gold, falling real interest rates, those adjusted for inflation, have long signaled price gains. Bitcoin, although relatively new to financial markets, is now exhibiting a similar pattern.

Cipolano found bitcoin's inverse relationship with real rates has strengthened in recent years, likely a result of its growing integration into the broader financial system.

The takeaway, according to NYDIG: investors should stop thinking of bitcoin as an inflation hedge.

Instead, it behaves more like a measure of global liquidity, moving in response to interest rates and the flow of capital, not the cost of groceries or gasoline.

“If we were to summarize how to think about each asset from a macro factor perspective, it is that gold serves as a real-rate hedge, whereas bitcoin has evolved into a liquidity barometer,” Cipolaro concluded.

As the Solana ecosystem is preparing for the upgrade to come at the end of this year or in early 2026, Repetny shares how he thinks this shift could expand validator participation and improve decentralization, even as higher hardware demands loom.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Solana's upcoming Alpenglow upgrade could mark a turning point for the network's staking economy. CoinDesk sat down with Michael Repetny, CEO of Marinade Labs, the firm that supports Solana's liquid staking protocol Marinade, to discuss how the update aims to change the economics of running a validator on Solana, significantly lowering the barrier to entry.

As the Solana ecosystem prepares for an upgrade at the end of this year or in early 2026, Repetny shares his thoughts on how this shift could expand validator participation and improve decentralization, even as higher hardware demands loom.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.



CoinDesk: Talk to me about the state of Solana staking – what are the most pressing issues right now in this area, in your opinion?

Michael Repetny: So when we started Marinade, there were 700 validators on Solana, with 11 of them big enough to potentially halt the network.

Then we launched Marinade during the first few years, the number of validators grew to 2000 so it looked great. Right now we are below 1000 validators again active on Solana.

I think there are other signals [on the health of Solana staking]. Another way of looking at it is if you look at the concentration of the stake, which is, if you get one-third of that stake to shut down, Solana stops working.

It takes right now around 20 of the biggest violators to do that, or also it takes two countries and it takes two data centers right now. Those are like different ways to look at it. So, it is not ideal.

We would rather see hundreds of bad quality validators than thousands of them with people just running potatoes.

And with the ETFs and with institutional interest, I think that centralization is becoming a greater risk.

At Marinade, we're trying to make sure that we have a viable option for validators to stake in a responsible way.



Solana has a major upgrade coming called Alpenglow. How will it affect the staking ecosystem?

We are hopeful, and it should impact the staking and validator economics. There is a proposed change to just cut down the vote fees for validators (vote fees are incurred by validators when they vote on processing SOL on the blockchain). So this is a huge one, because right now, if you want to run a validator, just to get it started, you need to pay about $5,000 a month.

Of those $5,000, about $4,000 is spent on just the voting fees. So as you can see, 80% of the cost today to spin up your validator is vote fees. Alpenglow aims to turn the vote fees to be much less. This is super exciting, and should make it much more accessible to start their own validator because the cost will go down



Will there be any changes to Solana validator rewards?

One way to look at it is to cut the cost of running a validator. Alpenglow is really about increasing the bandwidth and reducing latency.

We hope to see more saturated blocks when we pack them better, which should also improve the economics of the validators by packing the blocks.

Another benefit to that would be that if you increase the bandwidth and reduce the latency, then there is a shorter time for arbitrage and malicious maximum extractable value (MEV). This means if there's less time to manipulate the ordering of the transactions, there's going to be less toxic and malicious MEV happening, which is great for users.



Are there any tradeoffs for validators with Alpenglow?

Maybe eventually the hardware cost might go up. There may be a higher requirement on the end validators to make sure that they still keep up with the network, as there will be more transactions coming in. Maybe with the more requirements on them, there could be a trade-off. Other than that, I don't know. There will be problems, but we have to see once we are there.



How does Alpenglow tie back to Marinade's mission?

It makes it more accessible to spin up just more validators. The threshold for being break-even is way lower.



So Alpenglow is coming at the end of the year or maybe early next year – is this going to be a really big transformation or just another upgrade? And where does Solana head after that?

It's one of the pieces that need to be sorted out for Solana to be and stay competitive with things like Hyperliquid or decentralized exchanges.

Solana is working on fixing the protocol with Alpenglow, fixing the infrastructure with new projects like DoubleZero, fixing the software clients and optimizing Firedancer. All those things, hopefully now, are all coming together.

A six-month timeframe might not be enough for the results to show, but once it's out there, it's hopefully going to unlock use cases that wouldn't be available on Solana at present.

Hopefully, there will be more economic activity, which should translate to more revenue, and hopefully that pie grows.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin Tops $113K, SOL, ADA, ETH Jump as US–China Trade Progress Lifts Risk Appetite","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/26/bitcoin-tops-usd113k-sol-ada-eth-jump-as-us-china-trade-progress-lifts-risk-appetite","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 12:56:38 GMT","

Bitcoin climbed above $113,000 in late Asian hours Sunday, its highest in nearly two weeks, as traders welcomed signs of progress in US–China trade talks that eased fears of another tariff spiral.

Top negotiators from both nations said they had reached a “preliminary consensus” on several contentious issues — including export controls, fentanyl, and shipping levies — while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS that President Donald Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods is “effectively off the table.”

The comments came after two days of talks in Malaysia and ahead of a planned Trump–Xi meeting to finalize a broader deal.

That risk sentiment across global markets. US and Asian equity futures advanced, and gold pulled back slightly from recent highs as traders rotated back into risk assets.

Crypto joined the move higher, with ether ETH$4,065.55 adding 2.6% to trade near $4,060, while BNB and Solana SOL$199.32 gained roughly 4.5% each. XRP jumped 2.3% to $2.64, extending last week's rally tied to ETF optimism. Tron's TRX was the lone major token in red, down 2.9%.

The broader crypto market cap rose 1.8% to $3.72 trillion, CoinGecko data shows, reversing some of the declines that followed this month's liquidation cascade.

Analysts say the easing trade rhetoric has given traders breathing room after weeks of macro-driven volatility.

With the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting less than a week away, a sustained breakout likely depends on how dovish the central bank's tone turns. For now, relief on the geopolitical front has been enough to let crypto exhale — and keep bitcoin's October from ending in its worst since 2015.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","BTC, XRP, SOL, ETH Week Ahead: Fed Rate Decision, Mag 7 Earnings, Trump-Xi Summit to Move Markets","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/26/bitcoin-bid-xrp-tops-200-day-average-as-fed-rate-cut-looms-mag-7-earnings-trump-xi-summit-eyed","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 14:41:16 GMT","

Major cryptocurrencies are trading higher, with key events, including Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate decisions, and earnings reports from influential Mag 7 stocks lined up for the week ahead.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 4% on Wednesday, bringing the total easing since September last year to 150 basis points.

The CME Fed funds futures are pricing in near certainty that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday and at its December meeting.

The consensus anticipates further rate cuts next year, supporting a continued bullish trend for bitcoin and the wider crypto market.

Bitcoin is already showing strength, rising 1.7% over the past 24 hours to $113,600, extending its three-day winning streak. The upswing follows signs of seller exhaustion near the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently placed at $108,800.

Prices, however, have yet to surpass the 50-day SMA at $114,250, a widely recognized barrier that must be overcome to restore near-term bullish momentum.

Other major tokens, such as XRP$2.6366, ether ETH$4,065.55, and solana SOL$199.32, have risen by 3% over the past 24 hours. Payments-focused XRP has risen past its 200-day SMA at $2.60, hinting at renewed bullishness in momentum.

The upcoming Fed rate decision will be issued without economic forecasts or interest rate projections, making Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference the key event to watch.

Powell is likely to reiterate the September message that downside risks to the job market have become more concerning, while tariff-induced inflation is expected to be transitory and short-lived.

The dovish talk will likely bolster hopes for additional easing over the coming months, potentially adding to upward momentum in risk assets.

Powell will most likely get questioned about the impact of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown on its economic and interest rate projections.The chief, however, is likely to downplay the shutdown while sticking to September economic forecasts, which showed prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025 and then falling to 2.6% in 2026. September forecasts also showed the jobless rate averaging 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and eventually falling to 4.3% by 2027.

Note that labor market weakness began before the ongoing government shutdown, so the absence of fresh jobs data due to the shutdown is unlikely to prompt Powell to reverse the September guidance prioritizing labor concerns over inflation.

According to Scotiabank, a more meaningful development could come from the Fed's balance sheet following Powell's recent speech, in which he indicated that conditions are nearing the point at which to end quantitative tightening (QT) or the balance sheet runoff program that began in 2022.

""Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions. We may approach that point in coming months,"" Powell said.

The banking system's reserves recently fell below $3 trillion, breaching a level widely perceived as ample and signaling tighter liquidity conditions.

While a potential end to quantitative tightening (QT) does not guarantee an immediate resumption of balance sheet expansion or quantitative easing (QE), it could nevertheless boost optimism across crypto social media.

On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will issue a policy statement with Governor Ueda taking centre stage following the rate decision.

The central bank is expected to keep rates steady. However, fresh economic and interest rate forecasts could breed market volatility. ""Markets are priced for no rate change at this meeting but about half of a quarter-point cut in December and full cut pricing by early 2026 at either the January or March meetings,"" Scotiabank said in a market note.

Apple, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Microsoft – members of the famed Mag 7 group – are among the key tech names set to announce their earnings this week.

Traders will closely examine these reports for insights into AI-related tech spending, which has been a major driver behind the rise in risk assets since 2023. Any signs of a slowdown in this spending could trigger increased risk aversion in the market.

The U.S.-China trade tensions eased Sunday after both sides announced that a trade deal was nearing between the world's two largest economies.

The comments came days after the White House confirmed that President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in person on Thursday in South Korea. This highly anticipated meeting will take place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. 

The positive soundbites ahead of the meeting have raised expectations for a potential trade deal, meaning any disappointment could trigger a risk-off reaction among investors.

 A stablecoin is now live in Kyrgyzstan, which confirmed plans to launch a CBDC and explore a national crypto reserve after meeting with strategic adviser Changpeng Zhao. 

Kyrgyzstan has rolled out a new stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Kyrgyzstani som, while confirming plans to issue a central bank digital currency and explore a digital asset reserve.

The KGST stablecoin will run on the BNB Chain, and BNB (BNB) would be included in the crypto reserve if launched, according to former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao, who attended the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies' second meeting on Friday with President Sadyr Japarov.

The first meeting took place around April, when CZ became a strategic adviser for Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee.

Local media outlet KG24 said Kyrgyzstan's crypto committee must ensure the KGST stablecoin is listed on international platforms and submit proposals for creating a national crypto reserve within two months.

Kyrgyzstan's latest moves highlight how crypto adoption is advancing at the nation-state level by experimenting with stablecoins and CBDCs to modernize payments, improve financial inclusion, boost transparency and attract investment.

Japarov also advised the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to continue crafting a legislative framework for virtual assets and for the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic to begin pilot testing of the digital som.

The pilot will run in three stages, building on the National Bank's demo of the digital som platform built with Build Block TECH. It will first connect commercial banks to enable transfers, then link the Central Treasury for social and government payments, and finally test offline and low-connectivity transactions ahead of a national rollout.

""After successfully piloting all three phases, the platform will be rolled out nationally and scaled,"" Kyrgyzstan's top bank said. 

The National Bank initially said in April that it wouldn't make a decision on whether to issue a CBDC until the end of 2026.

While over 100 nations have initiated CBDC projects, only three CBDCs are currently live — the Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria's e-Naira and Jamaica's JAM-DEX, data from cbdctracker.org shows.

Meanwhile, Japarov also advised the Ministry of Science, Higher Education, and Innovation to submit proposals on how it intends to develop digital financial literacy plans and train specialists in the blockchain and AI industries.

CZ said Kyrgyzstan would integrate Binance's education arm, Binance Academy, with 10 of its top universities and “fully localize” the Binance app across the south Asian country.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ancient DNA reveals the deadly diseases behind Napoleon's defeat","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251026021727.htm","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 08:39:02 GMT","

Scientists from the Institut Pasteur have conducted a genetic analysis of the remains of soldiers who retreated from Russia in 1812. Their work uncovered traces of two disease-causing pathogens -- those behind paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever -- which match the symptoms described in eyewitness records from that time. The findings were first shared as a preprint on bioRxiv on July 16, 2025, and later published in the journal Current Biology on October 24.

Investigating the Mystery of the 1812 Retreat

Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, known as the ""Patriotic War of 1812,"" ended in one of history's most disastrous retreats. To better understand what role disease may have played in this collapse, researchers from the Institut Pasteur's Microbial Paleogenomics Unit partnered with the Laboratory of Biocultural Anthropology at Aix Marseille University. The team analyzed the DNA of 13 French soldiers exhumed in 2002 from a burial site in Vilnius, Lithuania, uncovered during archaeological excavations led by the Aix-Marseille University group. Using next-generation sequencing technology on ancient DNA, they searched for genetic traces of infectious organisms.

The researchers detected two distinct disease agents: Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (serovar Paratyphi C), which causes paratyphoid fever, and Borrelia recurrentis, the bacterium responsible for relapsing fever. The latter is transmitted by lice and produces alternating periods of fever and recovery. Although different, both infections can cause severe fever, exhaustion, and digestive distress. Their combined impact could have intensified the soldiers' suffering at a time when cold, hunger, and poor sanitation were already taking a heavy toll.

Genetic Evidence From Napoleonic Soldiers

Out of the 13 soldiers examined, DNA from S. enterica Paratyphi C was found in four individuals, and B. recurrentis was detected in two. This marks the first direct genetic confirmation that these pathogens were present in Napoleon's army. Their exact contribution to the enormous death toll remains uncertain, but the findings complement earlier research that identified Rickettsia prowazekii (the cause of typhus) and Bartonella quintana (responsible for trench fever), both long suspected of spreading through the ranks during the retreat.

Because only a small number of samples could be analyzed compared to the thousands of remains in Vilnius, researchers cannot yet determine how widespread these infections were. The tested soldiers represent a tiny fraction -- 13 out of more than 3,000 bodies at the site and roughly 500,000 to 600,000 troops who took part in the campaign, of whom about 300,000 died during the retreat.

Understanding the Past to Protect the Future

""Accessing the genomic data of the pathogens that circulated in historical populations helps us to understand how infectious diseases evolved, spread and disappeared over time, and to identify the social or environmental contexts that played a part in these developments. This information provides us with valuable insights to better understand and tackle infectious diseases today,"" explains Nicolás Rascovan, Head of the Microbial Paleogenomics Unit at the Institut Pasteur and last author of the study.

To achieve these results, the team worked in collaboration with scientists from the University of Tartu in Estonia to develop an innovative authentication workflow involving several steps, including a phylogeny-driven interpretive approach for the highly degraded genome fragments recovered. This method enables scientists to accurately identify pathogens even if their DNA only yields low coverage, in some cases even indicating a specific lineage.

""In most ancient human remains, pathogen DNA is extremely fragmented and only present in very low quantities, which makes it very difficult to obtain whole genomes. So we need methods capable of unambiguously identifying infectious agents from these weak signals, and sometimes even pinpointing lineages, to explore the pathogenic diversity of the past,"" he adds.

Linking History and Disease

The team's results closely match the historical descriptions of the fevers that swept through Napoleon's forces. This connection strengthens the theory that infectious diseases contributed to the disastrous outcome of the 1812 campaign, along with other factors such as exhaustion, starvation, and the brutal Russian winter.

Napoleon's 1812 campaign ultimately ended in defeat, forcing a massive withdrawal that devastated his army. The Russian forces reclaimed Moscow, marking a turning point that dealt a fatal blow to Napoleon's military ambitions.

From counting sheep to trying white noise or using weighted blankets, people have explored countless ways to improve their sleep. Poor sleep, however, continues to take a serious toll, influencing heart and metabolic health, memory, learning, productivity, emotional balance, and even relationships.

Now, scientists say one surprisingly effective aid for better sleep might already be on your grocery list. Researchers from the University of Chicago Medicine and Columbia University discovered that eating more fruits and vegetables during the day was linked to more restful, higher-quality sleep later that night.

""Dietary modifications could be a new, natural and cost-effective approach to achieve better sleep,"" said co-senior author Esra Tasali, MD, director of the UChicago Sleep Center. ""The temporal associations and objectively-measured outcomes in this study represent crucial steps toward filling a gap in important public health knowledge.""

Exploring How Diet and Sleep Interact

Previous studies have shown that getting too little sleep can drive people toward unhealthier eating patterns, often higher in fat and sugar. Yet, despite how sleep influences well-being and productivity, scientists have known far less about the reverse -- how diet affects sleep itself.

While earlier research linked greater fruit and vegetable intake with people reporting better sleep, this study was the first to show a same-day relationship between diet and objectively measured sleep quality.

For the research, healthy young adults logged their daily food intake using an app and wore a wrist monitor that tracked their sleep. The scientists analyzed a measure called ""sleep fragmentation,"" which captures how often a person wakes up or shifts between lighter and deeper stages of sleep during the night.

What the Researchers Found

The results showed that daily eating habits were strongly connected to how well participants slept that night. Those who ate more fruits and vegetables -- and consumed more complex carbohydrates such as whole grains -- experienced longer periods of deep, undisturbed sleep.

According to the team's analysis, people who met the CDC recommendation of five cups of fruits and vegetables per day could see an average 16 percent improvement in sleep quality compared with those who ate none.

""16 percent is a highly significant difference,"" Tasali said. ""It's remarkable that such a meaningful change could be observed within less than 24 hours.""

What Comes Next

Future research will investigate whether the relationship is causal, explore the biological mechanisms involved, and test the results in broader and more diverse groups. Still, the researchers say current evidence strongly supports making fruits, vegetables, and whole grains a daily habit for better long-term sleep health.

""People are always asking me if there are things they can eat that will help them sleep better,"" said co-senior author Marie-Pierre St-Onge, PhD, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep & Circadian Research at Columbia. ""Small changes can impact sleep. That is empowering -- better rest is within your control.""

""Higher daytime intake of fruits and vegetables predicts less disrupted nighttime sleep in younger adults"" was published in Sleep Health: The Journal of the National Sleep Foundation in June 2025. Co-authors include Hedda L. Boege (Columbia), Katherine D. Wilson (University of California San Diego), Jennifer M. Kilkus (UChicago), Waveley Qiu, (Columbia), Bin Cheng (Columbia), Kristen E.

Researchers at Trinity College Dublin have uncovered what they call a ""universal thermal performance curve"" (UTPC), a pattern that appears to apply to every living species on Earth. This curve describes how organisms respond to changes in temperature, and it seems to hold true across the entire spectrum of life. According to the scientists, the UTPC effectively ""shackles evolution"" because no species appears capable of escaping its influence on how temperature affects biological performance.

The Hidden Pattern Linking All Species

Temperature affects every form of life, but the UTPC connects what once seemed to be countless unrelated data sets. It combines tens of thousands of performance curves that describe how efficiently species function at different temperatures. The researchers found that this universal pattern applies not just to all organisms, but also to all kinds of performance metrics -- whether measuring lizards sprinting on a treadmill, sharks swimming in open water, or bacteria dividing under a microscope.

Rising Heat and Falling Performance

The study revealed a consistent trend in how organisms respond to warmth:

These findings, published in the journal PNAS, suggest that species may face greater limits than previously thought when adapting to global climate change. As most regions continue to warm, the window of viable performance for many species could shrink.

One Curve, Many Temperatures

Andrew Jackson, Professor in Zoology in Trinity's School of Natural Sciences, and co-author,said: ""Across thousands of species and almost all groups of life including bacteria, plants, reptiles, fish and insects, the shape of the curve that describes how performance changes with temperature is very similar. However, different species have very different optimal temperatures, ranging from 5oC to 100oC, and their performance can vary a lot depending on the measure of performance being observed and the species in question.""

""That has led to countless variations on models being proposed to explain these differences. What we have shown here is that all the different curves are in fact the same exact curve, just stretched and shifted over different temperatures. And what's more, we have shown that the optimal temperature and the critical maximum temperature at which death occurs are inextricably linked.""

""Whatever the species, it simply must have a smaller temperature range at which life is viable once temperatures shift above the optimum.""

The Unbreakable Law of Thermal Performance

Senior author, Dr. Nicholas Payne, from Trinity's School of Natural Sciences, added: ""These results have sprung forward from an in-depth analysis of over 2,500 different thermal performance curves, which comprise a tremendous variety of different performance measures for a similarly tremendous variety of different species -- from bacteria to plants, and from lizards to insects.""

""This means the pattern holds for species in all major groups that have diverged massively as the tree of life has grown throughout billions of years of evolution. Despite this rich diversity of life, our study shows basically all life forms remain remarkably constrained by this 'rule' on how temperature influences their ability to function. The best evolution has managed is to move this curve around -- life hasn't found a way to deviate from this one very specific thermal performance shape.""

Searching for the Exceptions

""The next step is to use this model as something of a benchmark to see if there are any species or systems we can find that may, subtly, break away from this pattern. If we find any, we will be excited to ask why and how they do it -- especially given forecasts of how our climate is likely to keep warming in the next decades.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Glaciers' secret cooling power won't last much longer","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251025084606.htm","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 04:44:21 GMT","

Glaciers are pushing back against global warming by chilling the air that flows over their surfaces. But how long can this natural defense last? Researchers from the Pellicciotti group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have reexamined a massive global collection of glacier data. Their study, recently published in Nature Climate Change, reveals that glaciers will likely reach their maximum self-cooling ability within the next decade. After that, near-surface temperatures will rise sharply, speeding up melting across the world's ice fields.

Thomas Shaw remembers a particular summer day in August 2022 vividly. The postdoctoral researcher in Francesca Pellicciotti's lab at ISTA was high in the Swiss Alps under clear skies and a comfortable 17 degrees Celsius. Yet he stood atop the Glacier de Corbassière, more than 2,600 meters above sea level, taking measurements to assess the glacier's condition.

Although global air temperatures continue to climb, the surfaces of many glaciers appear to be warming more slowly. Some, such as the immense Himalayan glaciers, even send cold air streaming down their slopes, cooling the valleys below. This natural refrigeration may seem like a sign of resilience, but scientists say it's only temporary.

Shaw's new study indicates that glaciers' cooling response will reach its height in the 2030s. ""The more the climate warms, the more it will trigger the glaciers to cool their own microclimate and local environments down-valley,"" says Shaw. ""But this effect will not last long, and a trend shift will ensue before the middle of the century."" After that point, melting and fragmentation caused by human-driven warming are expected to intensify, with glaciers heating faster near their surfaces and shrinking at an accelerating pace.

Large glaciers and cold winds

Studying these effects in some of the world's most isolated regions is no small task, especially since field data are scarce. This lack of information makes it difficult for scientists to fine-tune climate models. When Pellicciotti's team first examined records from a weather station 5,000 meters up Mount Everest, they were astonished. ""Upon examining the data thoroughly, we understood that the glaciers were reacting to the warming air in summer by intensifying their temperature exchange at the surface,"" Pellicciotti says. The vast Himalayan glaciers cool enormous air masses that slide downslope under gravity, creating what scientists call katabatic winds. Similar patterns are seen at other major glaciers around the world.

Scientists going out of their way

To better understand this phenomenon globally, Shaw designed a new statistical model that could work even where data were limited. ""We compiled data from past and recent projects across our research group, pooled them with all published data, and reached out to other researchers to request that they share with us their unpublished data,"" says Shaw. ""Using this unprecedented dataset, we reassessed the physical processes to find generalizable aspects and developed a statistical framework that can give us a glimpse into the evolution of glacier cooling worldwide.""

Peak cooling

Shaw and the team compiled an inventory of hourly data from 350 weather stations located on 62 glaciers worldwide, representing a total of 169 summer-long measurement campaigns. They specifically examined the ratio of near-surface temperature to ambient, non-glacier temperature right above each station and analyzed it over space and time. ""We call the difference in temperature 'decoupling,' because it seems at odds with the warming of ambient temperatures,"" says Shaw. They showed that, on average, the near-surface temperature on mountain glaciers worldwide warmed 0.83 degrees Celsius for every degree rise in ambient temperature.

They also investigated the glacier properties most likely to limit the decoupling effect, such as the presence of a debris mantle on the lower part of a glacier, and refined their model with this information. By modeling future projections, they demonstrated that this cooling effect will peak between the 2020s and 2040s, before the glaciers' steady mass loss leads to their large-scale retreat, reversing the cooling trend. ""By then, the worn-out and considerably degraded glaciers will 'recouple' to the steadily warming atmosphere, sealing their fate,"" says Shaw.

Accepting the loss and coordinating future actions

While the projection paints a bleak future for the world's majestic water towers, there are pragmatic consequences if the current trend continues. ""Knowing that the glaciers' self-cooling will continue a little longer could buy us some extra time to optimize our water management plans over the next decades,"" says Shaw.

However, the team is fully aware that they can neither salvage nor recover the world's mountain glaciers. ""We must accept the committed ice loss and put our full efforts into limiting further climatic warming rather than into ineffective geo-engineering strategies such as seeding clouds and covering glaciers. These are like putting an expensive Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The coming decades are a time for reflection, effective water management, and action to change public consciousness about human-caused climate change."" The researchers further underline the need for coordinated global climate policies to drastically reduce emissions and safeguard human life on Earth from the unforeseeable effects of global warming. ""Every bit of a degree counts,"" says Shaw, echoing the words that scientists have been stressing for decades.

A groundbreaking study is taking a fresh look at one of science's oldest questions: how did life arise from nonliving material on early Earth? Researcher Robert G. Endres of Imperial College London has created a new mathematical framework suggesting that the spontaneous appearance of life may have been far less likely than many scientists once believed.

The Improbable Odds of Life Emerging Naturally

The research examines how extraordinarily difficult it would be for organized biological information to form under plausible prebiotic conditions. Endres illustrates this by comparing it to trying to write a coherent article for a leading science website by tossing random letters onto a page. As complexity increases, the probability of success quickly drops to near zero.

To explore the issue, Endres applied principles from information theory and algorithmic complexity to estimate what it would take for the first simple cell, known as a protocell, to assemble itself from basic chemical ingredients. This approach revealed that the odds of such a process happening naturally are astonishingly low.

Why Chance Alone May Not Be Enough

The findings suggest that random chemical reactions and natural processes may not fully explain how life appeared within the limited time available on early Earth. Because systems naturally tend toward disorder, building the intricate molecular organization required for life would have been a major challenge.

Although this doesn't mean that life's origin was impossible, Endres argues that current scientific models may be missing key elements. He emphasizes that identifying the physical principles behind life's emergence from nonliving matter remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in biological physics.

Considering a Speculative Alternative

The study also briefly considers directed panspermia, a controversial idea proposed by Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel. This hypothesis suggests that life could have been intentionally introduced to Earth by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. While Endres acknowledges the idea as logically possible, he notes that it runs counter to Occam's razor, the principle that favors simpler explanations.

Rather than ruling out natural origins, the research provides a way to quantify how difficult the process may have been. It points to the potential need for new physical laws or mechanisms that could help overcome the immense informational and organizational barriers to life. The work represents an important move toward a more mathematically grounded understanding of how living systems might arise.

A Continuing Mystery

This study is a reminder that some of the most profound questions in science remain unanswered. By merging mathematics with biology, researchers are beginning to uncover new layers of insight into one of humanity's oldest mysteries: how existence itself began.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hippos once roamed frozen Germany with mammoths","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251026021740.htm","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 12:30:51 GMT","

Hippos, now found only in sub-Saharan Africa, managed to survive in central Europe far longer than anyone previously believed. A new analysis of ancient bones shows that hippos lived in the Upper Rhine Graben between about 47,000 and 31,000 years ago, during the depths of the last ice age. The findings come from an international research team led by the University of Potsdam and the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim in collaboration with the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie, and were recently published in Current Biology.

Extinction Timeline Rewritten

Until recently, scientists thought the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) disappeared from central Europe roughly 115,000 years ago, when the last interglacial period ended. However, the new study -- conducted by researchers from the University of Potsdam, the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim, the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie Mannheim, ETH Zurich, and several international partners -- reveals that hippos actually persisted in the Upper Rhine Graben of southwestern Germany tens of thousands of years later, well into the middle of the last ice age.

The Upper Rhine Graben serves as a vital record of ancient climate conditions. Animal bones buried for millennia in layers of gravel and sand offer rare windows into the past. ""It's amazing how well the bones have been preserved. At many skeletal remains it was possible to take samples suitable for analysis -- that is not a given after such a long time,"" said Dr. Ronny Friedrich, a specialist in age determination at the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie.

Genetic and Radiocarbon Clues

Researchers examined numerous hippopotamus fossils using both genetic and radiocarbon dating methods. Ancient DNA sequencing revealed that these Ice Age hippos were closely related to modern African populations and were part of the same species. Radiocarbon dating confirmed their presence during a warmer phase of the middle Weichselian glaciation, when conditions temporarily allowed the animals to survive in central Europe.

Further genome-wide analysis showed that the European hippo population had extremely low genetic diversity, suggesting it was both small and geographically isolated. Fossil evidence also revealed that these warm-adapted hippos lived alongside cold-climate animals such as mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses -- an unusual ecological mix that highlights the complexity of Ice Age environments.

Rethinking Europe's Ice Age Ecosystem

""The results demonstrate that hippos did not vanish from middle Europe at the end of the last interglacial, as previously assumed,"" summarizes first author Dr. Patrick Arnold. ""Therefore, we should re-analyze other continental European hippo fossils traditionally attributed to the last interglacial period.""

Prof. Dr. Wilfried Rosendahl, general director of the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim and project leader of ""Eiszeitfenster Oberrheingraben"" is convinced that ice age research still holds many exciting questions: ""The current study provides important new insights which impressively prove that ice age was not the same everywhere, but local peculiarities taken together form a complex overall picture -- similar to a puzzle. It would now be interesting and important to further examine other heat-loving animal species, attributed so far to the last interglacial.""

The research was carried out as part of the ""Eiszeitfenster Oberrheingraben"" project, supported by the Klaus Tschira Stiftung Heidelberg. This interdisciplinary effort aims to shed light on climate and environmental evolution in the Upper Rhine Graben and southwestern Germany over the past 400,000 years. The study focused on Ice Age bones from the Reis collection, housed at the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen, which continue to reveal remarkable insights into Europe's dynamic prehistoric world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Dinosaurs were thriving when the asteroid struck","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251026021732.htm","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 15:07:02 GMT","

For much of the past century, scientists thought dinosaurs were already in decline long before the asteroid impact that ended their reign 66 million years ago. However, a new study published in Science by researchers from Baylor University, New Mexico State University, The Smithsonian Institution, and several international partners challenges that long-standing belief.

The findings reveal that dinosaurs were not fading away at all -- they were thriving.

A final flourish in the San Juan Basin

In northwestern New Mexico, layers of ancient rock hold clues to a lively, previously overlooked chapter of Earth's history. Within the Naashoibito Member of the Kirtland Formation, scientists found evidence of rich dinosaur ecosystems that continued to flourish until just before the asteroid struck.

High-precision dating determined that fossils from these rocks are between 66.4 and 66 million years old, placing them right at the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, when the global extinction event occurred.

""The Naashoibito dinosaurs lived at the same time as the famous Hell Creek species in Montana and the Dakotas,"" said Daniel Peppe, Ph.D., associate professor of geosciences at Baylor University. ""They were not in decline -- these were vibrant, diverse communities.""

Dinosaurs in their prime

The fossil evidence from New Mexico tells a strikingly different story from what many had assumed. Instead of dwindling, dinosaurs across North America were thriving in distinct regional communities. By analyzing ecological and geographic patterns, researchers found that dinosaur populations in western North America were divided into separate ""bioprovinces"" shaped primarily by regional temperature differences rather than by mountains or rivers.

""What our new research shows is that dinosaurs are not on their way out going into the mass extinction,"" said first author Andrew Flynn, Ph.D. '20, assistant professor of geological sciences at New Mexico State University. ""They're doing great, they're thriving and that the asteroid impact seems to knock them out. This counters a long-held idea that there was this long-term decline in dinosaur diversity leading up to the mass extinction making them more prone to extinction.""

Life after impact

The asteroid impact brought the age of dinosaurs to an abrupt end, but the ecosystems they left behind became the foundation for a new evolutionary chapter. Within just 300,000 years, mammals began rapidly diversifying, developing new diets, sizes, and ecological roles.

The same temperature-related patterns that once defined dinosaur ecosystems continued into the Paleocene epoch, guiding how life recovered after the disaster.

""The surviving mammals still retain the same north and south bio provinces,"" Flynn said. ""Mammals in the north and the south are very different from each other, which is different than other mass extinctions where it seems to be much more uniform.""

Why this discovery matters

This discovery offers more than just a look into the distant past. It underscores both the resilience and fragility of life on Earth. Conducted on public lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the research highlights how protected landscapes can unlock vital insights into how ecosystems respond to global upheaval.

By refining the timeline of the dinosaurs' final days, the study reveals that their extinction was not a slow decline but an abrupt, catastrophic end to a flourishing era of life -- cut short by chance from beyond the sky.

About the authors

In addition to Peppe and Flynn, the research team included scientists from Baylor University, New Mexico State University, the Smithsonian Institution, the University of Edinburgh, University College London and multiple U.S. and international institutions.

Funding 

This research was supported by the National Science Foundation, European Research Council, Royal Newton International Fellowship, Geologic Society of America Graduate Research Grant, Baylor University James Dixon Undergraduate Fieldwork Fellowship (AGF), the European Union Next Generation, the British Ecological Society and the American Chemical Society -- Petroleum Research Fund.

The researchers would like to thank the Bureau of Land Managementfor providing collecting permits and supporting the research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Real Estate Is Entering Its AI Slop Era","https://www.wired.com/story/real-estate-is-entering-its-ai-slop-era/","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

As you're hunting through real estate listings for a new home in Franklin, Tennessee, you come across a vertical video showing off expansive rooms featuring a four-poster bed, a fully stocked wine cellar, and a soaking tub. In the corner of the video, a smiling real estate agent narrates the walk-through of your dream home in a soothing tone. It looks perfect—maybe a little too perfect.

The catch? Everything in the video is AI-generated. The real property is completely empty, and the luxury furniture is a product of virtual staging. The realtor's voice-over and expressions were born from text prompts. Even the camera's slow pan over each room is orchestrated by AI, because there was no actual video camera involved.

Any real estate agent can create “exactly that, at home, in minutes,” says Alok Gupta, a former product manager at Facebook and software engineer at Snapchat who cofounded AutoReel, an app that allows realtors to turn images from their property listings into videos. He said that between 500 and 1,000 new listing videos are being created with AutoReel every day, with realtors across the US and even in New Zealand and India using the technology to market thousands of properties.

This is one of many AI tools, including more familiar ones like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, that are quickly reshaping the real estate industry into something that isn't necessarily, well, real.

“I've been at a few conferences over the past few weeks, and just anecdotally speaking, we'll ask out of 100 people in the audience how many are using AI, and I'd say 80 to 90 percent of people raise their hand,” says Dan Weisman, the director of innovation strategy at the National Association of Realtors, the largest real estate trade association in the US. “We are seeing this huge uptick in people using it.”

Like most industries, the biggest names in this one are rushing to embrace a wave of generative AI products making big promises about increasing productivity, cutting costs, and revolutionizing every aspect of the consumer experience. But when it comes to renting or buying a home, which are typically the costliest parts of adult life, the use of AI-generated photos, videos, and listing descriptions can make the process feel even riskier.

Elizabeth, a homeowner in rural Michigan who did not want her last name used due to privacy concerns, keeps an eye on local real estate listings to stay abreast of her own home's value.

“About two or three weeks ago was the first time that I've truly seen actual pictures of a house fed through AI,” she says. The first thing that stuck out to her was that the images in the listing had a yellowish hue, which has become a colloquially recognized sign of AI to the point that there are now other AI tools that purport to “UnYellow” AI-generated images.

“And then, as I was scrolling through the photos, I noticed that some things just weren't making sense. There were stairways leading to nowhere,” Elizabeth says. “In general, it just looked cartoonified.”

Her suspicions were confirmed when she came across a second listing for the same property and saw the original images that had been transformed. In the edited versions, kitchen cabinets were missing, backyard pavement was replaced by grass, and windows were dramatically resized. Elizabeth posted the two sets of images on Reddit in the popular “mildly infuriating” subreddit, and more than 1,200 people commented.

“This is misleading. It's distorting the features of the house,” she continued. She says real estate listings often use a fish-eye lens to make rooms look bigger, but with AI “we've entered a whole new realm.”

Elizabeth isn't alone. Examples of consumer outrage over potentially AI-driven misleading listings have cropped up all over social media in recent months, from a New York City apartment listing on StreetEasy where a tiny loft became a master bedroom to an edited house facade, complete with a new roof, in Detroit. WIRED reached out to the real estate agent behind the New York City listing and has not received a response. A real estate agent whose number was included on the Detroit listing said the images were made by a broker and posted prematurely and that she wasn't sure if AI was used.

Still, industry leaders aren't necessarily concerned, and some say the profit margin makes the tools a no-brainer.

“Why would I send my photos of an empty room to a virtual stager, have them spend four days and send it back to me at a charge of 500 bucks when I can just do it in ChatGPT for free in 45 seconds?” asks Jason Haber, a licensed realtor and cofounder of the American Real Estate Association. “We've done virtual renderings for 20 years, so the fact that you can just do it now on AI, there was a whole cottage industry of virtual renderings and those people are now looking for a new job.”

In his position leading an association with over 22,000 members, Haber stresses that real estate professionals must disclose the use of AI, just like virtual staging has been disclosed in the past. Deceptive real estate practices can lead to fines and lawsuits, and the National Association of Realtors has advised realtors that the legal territory around using AI-generated images is still “murky.” The organization's code of ethics prohibits using misleading images.

Haber said there are telltale signs of an “epidemic” of lazy AI use in the industry that outsiders may not be able to spot. Specifically, Haber says that ChatGPT “almost always” inserts the word “nestled” into copy it generates for real estate listings. The phrases “nestled in a prime location,” “nestled in the heart of the city,” and “nestled between two other homes” can be evidence of agents copying and pasting directly from the AI chatbot, he wrote on Instagram.

Haber says while he embraces technology, it's not an excuse to “check your brain at the door.”

“If you become just a toll taker, you're not a really good agent. You have no differentiation, you're not creative, you're just another agent,” Haber says.

Gupta, the cofounder of the AI real estate video generator, says as social media has become a primary avenue to reach consumers, high-quality videos that can hold their attention have become crucial. Using AutoReel could save “$500 to $1,000” and up to a week's turnaround time from professional videographers, he claims.

“When we started this two years ago, we kind of got a no from customers,” Gupta says. “In 2024, they started saying ‘tell us more.' And then this year, they've been asking How do I get started?”

But not everyone in the industry is entirely convinced. Nathan Cool, a real estate photographer who runs an educational YouTube channel with almost 100,000 subscribers, has experimented with AI tools, including AutoReel. He still feels like shooting vertical video is an easy and cheap add-on to his other services, although some productions can be more involved and costlier.

Plus, there's the continuous issue of AI hallucinations. Gupta says that AutoReel is trained on millions of real property videos and has been fine-tuned to avoid inserting things that aren't there—generating videos that zoom in versus rotate to try to stop the AI from creating features that aren't really there. In a single test run with real photos from a real estate listing, this worked, although uploading the edited images from the listing Elizabeth found resulted in AutoReel adding in a fake couch.

But even when the AI products are realistic enough to fool consumers, Cool says that many everyday people are already sick of AI-generated videos in their social media feeds, and looking for a home raises the stakes.

“People that want to buy a house, they're going to make the largest investment of their lifetime,” he said. “They don't want to be fooled before they ever arrive.”

Your browser wants to manage your passwords. Maybe it's to make your browsing experience more seamless in the hotly competitive browser wars, or maybe it's a response to the popularity of password managers. Regardless of the reason, you've undoubtedly seen hundreds of pop-ups offering to save your credentials as you browse online.

A few years back, that wasn't the best idea, but times have changed. The world's most popular browser, Google Chrome, now has a fairly robust password management tool, as does Apple's Safari, including security options that shut down the most common criticisms of browser-based password managers. If you aren't using a password manager, and you're reusing the same few passwords with an extra capital letter or exclamation point, storing unique passwords in your browser is more secure than what you're doing. Still, browser-based password managers pose an inherent problem, one that isn't solved with better authentication methods or superior encryption.

Your browser's password manager isn't as secure as a commercial, third-party password manager, or so the story goes. There's some truth to that sentiment, but it requires nuance. In reality, your browser's password manager is very secure, and using it is far superior to jotting down passwords in your notes app or using the same password across websites.

I'll get to the security issues next, but we need to start with where browser password managers are today. I'll be looking at Chrome and the Google Password Manager, not to pick on Google, but because it's overwhelmingly the most popular browser in the world. Google has also continually updated Chrome's password manager, and it's in a much better place than it used to be.

First, encryption. The main difference between Google's Password Manager and a commercial password manager isn't what encryption is used, but rather how it's used. A password manager like Proton Pass uses zero-knowledge encryption. That means that, although the service holds your encrypted passwords, it doesn't hold the key to decrypt those passwords.

By default, Google manages your encryption key, but it allows you to set up on-device encryption, which functions similarly to a zero-knowledge architecture. Your passwords are encrypted before being saved on your device, and you manage the key. Regardless of how the encryption works, Google uses AES, which is still the gold standard for security among password managers.

It was trivial to decrypt Chrome passwords previously, requiring little more than a Python script and knowledge of where the files are stored. But even there, Google has pushed the security bar up. App-bound encryption has invalidated those methods, and cracking passwords is far more involved than it used to be. Further, Google has integrated with Windows Hello. If you choose, you can have Windows Hello protect your passwords each time you log in by asking for your PIN or biometric authentication.

Other browsers aren't as secure. Firefox, for instance, makes it clear that, although passwords saved in Firefox are encrypted, “someone with access to your computer user profile can still see or use them.” Brave works in a similar way, though I suspect most people using Brave are using a third-party password manager (and probably a VPN) already.

Regardless, storing your passwords in even a less secure browser like Firefox is leaps and bounds better than not using a password manager at all. And the browsers at the forefront of market share, Chrome and Safari, have vastly improved their security practices over the past few years. The problem isn't encryption—it's putting all your eggs in one basket.

OpSec, or operational security, is normally a term used when talking about sensitive data in government or private organizations, but you can look at your own security through an OpSec lens. If you were an attacker and wanted to swipe someone's passwords, how would you go about it? I know where I'd look first.

Even with better security measures, the goal of a browser-based password manager is to get people using password managers. That has to be balanced against how easy the password manager is to use. In a blog post announcing changes to Google's authentication methods from Google I/O this year, the company mentions reducing “friction” seven times, while “encryption” isn't mentioned at all. That's not a bad thing, but it's a testament to how these tools are designed.

You don't need to pick out words from a blog post to see this focus. Google gives you the option to turn on Windows Hello or biometric authentication with the Google Password Manager. Each time you want to fill in a password, you'll need to authenticate. That's undoubtedly more secure than not authenticating each time, but the setting is turned off by default. It creates friction.

Without this setting turned on, anyone with access to a logged-in PC could pop into your browser, head to the settings, and see (and even export) your passwords in plaintext. If I had access to someone's PC and wanted to steal passwords, the first place I'd head is the browser password manager.

More concerning is the target on the back of your Google account. Just a couple of months back, Gmail suffered a data breach, and although no sensitive information was stolen, Google urged 2.5 billion users (around a third of the global population) to update their passwords. If an attacker can successfully take over your account, it's not a great idea to give them your passwords in addition to unbridled access to your email and any services you've linked your Google account to.

Account takeovers happen, largely due to phishing, according to Google. Again, looking through an OpSec lens, it's not the best idea to lock the passwords for all your accounts behind an account that's a high-value target. That's not a dig at Google. It's just the reality of having a single account that's so pervasive in online life.

There are ways to prevent an account takeover from happening, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device-bound authentication methods like passkeys. Both Google and Apple offer these options to increase your account security. If we're looking at risk mitigation, however, storing your passwords in a third-party password manager gives you another layer of protection beyond locking down a single, high-value account.

Security is first and foremost when looking at password managers, but let's not miss the forest for the trees. A commercial password manager comes with a lot more features and functionality.

Proton Pass, for instance, gives you access to email aliases to reduce the likelihood of your email address leaking in a breach. 1Password gives you Travel Mode to clean up your vaults while traveling. Bitwarden lets you take your entire vault off the internet if you want, with a self-hosted option. That's not to mention the variety of data you can store in a third-party password manager, including encrypted documents and notes, and custom entries for whatever other data you want to store.

A dedicated password manager like NordPass allows you to share your entries. You can share passwords stored in the Google Password Manager and iCloud Keychain, but only within their own ecosystems. With a third-party password manager, I can, for example, share my Wi-Fi password with someone even if they don't have an account.

Using any password manager is better than using none, so if you're avoiding your browser's password manager because you've heard it's unsafe, and as a result, use the same password across websites, stop. Your browser is more secure. But for folks who don't mind a bit of friction for better security, a third-party password manager is the way to go.

Security cameras can be spammy, blowing up your phone with useless notifications. Manufacturers have been battling this issue with AI detection, but Google's Gemini assistant takes things to a whole new level in its latest Nest Cams.

The Nest Cam Indoor (Wired, 3rd Gen) and Outdoor (Wired, 2nd Gen) may not look new (apart from the Berry red indoor model), but they finally make the jump to 2K resolution, empowering a new level of AI insight, more accurate detection, and better animated notifications.

I've been testing both side by side with the previous generation Nest cameras for the last two weeks, and they clearly represent a leap in quality. But the Google Home app overhaul and hardware improvements were long overdue, and the infusion of Gemini AI is only partially successful, with top-tier features requiring a hefty subscription.

The new Nest Cam Indoor and Nest Cam Outdoor boast the easiest setup experience I've encountered. Simply plug them in (the Nest Cam Indoor comes with a 10-foot USB-C cable, the Nest Cam Outdoor has an 18-foot weatherproof cable), scan the QR code sticker on the front of each camera with the Google Home app, connect to Wi-Fi, and you're up and running in no time (both support 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands). The elegant magnetic mount for the Nest Cam Outdoor needs a couple of screws, while my Nest Cam Indoor is perched neatly on a shelf.

While Google has lagged behind competitors for years with its 1080p cameras, support for HDR and a high frame rate helped keep the last-gen Nest cams relevant. That said, the jump to a 2560 x 1400 resolution with a wider 152-degree diagonal field of view is a clear and immediate upgrade. This resolution bump also enables 6X digital zoom, so the Nest Cams can serve up notifications that zoom in on the subject of each animated alert. These notifications show a few frames of each event, making it far easier to decide whether you need to tap through and watch the full video. You can also zoom in on the live feed and crop the view to stay focused on a specific area, like a garden gate or path.

Both cameras detect more activity and alert more accurately and swiftly than their predecessors. The range seems to be better, too. For example, my indoor camera faces a side door, and it can pick up people across the street and zoom in on them as they walk by. I don't necessarily want it to do that, but the reach is impressive. It's more successful with the outdoor camera, as only the newer model picks up on me entering the back door of the distant garage compared to the prior generation. The outdoor camera is also far faster to alert and upload accessible video than the old battery-powered model (this is generally true for wired cameras).

The cameras get six hours of cloud video history at no extra cost (up from three for the previous generation), but that's your allotment without an expensive subscription. On that note, Google has killed off Nest Aware in favor of the two-tier Google Home Premium: Standard is $10 per month or $100 per year, and Advanced is $20 per month or $200 per year.

Google's Home Premium subscriptions include everything you got with Nest Aware (30 days of video history, Familiar Faces, and garage door, package, smoke and CO alarm detection) and Nest Aware Plus (60 days of video history or 10 days of 24/7), but Standard also includes Gemini Live on compatible smart speakers and displays, and the option to create automations by typing what you want in the Home app. This last feature works well if you have a bunch of smart home devices set up in Google Home, and you can tell it to do things like “turn on the lights at sunset” or “have the side door camera trigger the outside lights.” It's far easier than using the old script editor.

The cream of the AI goodies requires the Advanced subscription. This adds descriptive notifications, so instead of “person detected,” you get messages like “person walks up stairs” or “cat is on the table” instead of “animal detected.” The searchable video history using the Ask Home search bar is genuinely handy; you can ask questions like “who opened the back door last night?” or “Did FedEx deliver a package today?” and jump straight to the event. You also get daily summaries with Home Brief, giving you an often weirdly comical digest of highlights from the day.

​Some folks feel AI is overhyped, but it has made tangible improvements to home security cameras in the last few years. When I started testing them, it was common to get alerts from branches blowing in the breeze, passing birds or moths, and sometimes seemingly nothing at all. AI is pretty good at detecting people now, and animal, vehicle, and package detection are standard in most security cameras.

Google's cloud-only approach enabled it to take things further faster than most with facial recognition, though it's no longer unique, with competitors like Amazon, Eufy, Lorex, and Wyze all offering similar features. Google has stepped things up again with Gemini, and the hardware bump to a 2K resolution provides the AI more data, enabling more descriptive and accurate alerts. This is a growing trend across the industry; Amazon also just unveiled a new line of 2K and 4K Ring cameras with facial recognition and a new Search Party feature to help you find your lost dog.

As smart as Google's Nest cameras are, the AI is far from totally accurate. It regularly confuses my kids, much to their annoyance, and, while both have long hair, it's not a mistake a person would make. I also get pretty regular alerts that I am at the front door when I'm sitting at my desk, because it struggles to tell me apart from any other bald, bearded bloke. Gemini is also convinced my colleague's dog is a cat. Making these mistakes is understandable, but it's frustrating that, even after he corrected Gemini, telling it he has a dog and not a cat, it continues to make the same error.

​Ultimately, there's a beta feel to these new AI features—and they are in early access. You are helping to train it (you can give thumbs-up or down feedback). I'm sure it will improve, but I wouldn't rush to drop $20 per month for these features alone. Home Premium Advanced is a much easier sell if you're already paying for Nest Aware Plus.

The Home Premium Standard plan will be enough for most folks, but it's tough to justify unless you have at least a couple of Nest cameras and a doorbell. At least Standard is bundled in with some Google One subscriptions. The extra monthly fee for Advanced seems like a step too far, and it's only bundled with Google's most expensive AI Ultra plan ($250 per month).

Stepping back to the camera hardware, there's no doubt that both offer tangible improvements over the previous generation. The Google Nest Cam Indoor (Wired, 3rd Gen) is the smartest indoor security camera, but the upgrades felt more useful to me in the Google Nest Cam Outdoor (Wired, 2nd Gen). The caveat for anyone upgrading from the battery-powered version is that you must run the cable to a power outlet, though I suspect Google will release a 2K outdoor battery camera before long (maybe even a version with a floodlight).

Ultimately, these slick and elegant security cameras are easy to recommend. But they are up against many cheaper, comparable video quality indoor security cameras and similarly priced wireless, solar-powered, pan/tilt outdoor cameras that can record locally. If you're cool with plugging in, using Google Home, and the price and subscription, they may still be the better choice for you.

I test-ride electric kick scooters as a part of my job. They're fantastic to ride and zip around town, but they are not cool nor particularly comfortable. You're standing on this L-shaped object, like a meerkat on wheels. Motorcycles, on the other hand? There is no other category of vehicle that oozes this much style, especially one that looks like Maeving's new RM2.

If you love the roar of a motorbike and the smell of petrol, this electric motorcycle is probably not for you. Seb Inglis-Jones, Maeving's cofounder, tells me the company is after a demographic of people who perhaps want something more robust than an electric bicycle but not as intense as a gas-powered bike. Someone who may actually prefer the practically silent ride experience (read: me). However, you still need a motorcycle license in the US to ride.

The Maeving RM2 opens up for preorder today in the US for $10,995, a small jump from the prior RM1S and a bigger price bump from the original RM1. They'll ship in January 2026. It shares the same powertrain as the RM1S, hitting a top speed of 70 miles per hour with an 80-mile range.

However, the RM2's calling card is the bench seat, so you can finally ride with a passenger. The tank is shorter and wider to accommodate the pillion seat, but you can enjoy a more upright sitting experience. An added boon: You can also add a rear rack and top box for helmet storage.

Maeving's RM2 comes in red.

Maeving was founded in the UK right before the pandemic by Inglis-Jones and Will Stirrup, neither of whom had a background in motorbikes (or vehicles, for that matter). The duo decided to build a company together after meeting at university, with two stipulations. They didn't want to start a business right out of college with no experience, and whatever they built should in some way help combat climate change. Stirrup went to work in the finance world after college, and Inglis-Jones dove into a sales and marketing career.

When they were ready, the pair settled on electric motorcycles after seeing the massive electrification in China, and they wanted to bring that to the West. And while the original idea was to start an import business, they quickly realized the quality wasn't what they expected. “The bikes they're making over there are built to a much stricter price ceiling,” Inglis-Jones says. “That's not because they can't make amazing quality products.”

He also says it's not just about the technological advances in electrifying a motorbike. Style matters, too. These two-wheeled vehicles are a lifestyle choice, and people take pride in ownership.

“China has been making gas bikes for years, but they haven't captured the imagination of the European and US markets,"" Inglis-Jones says. ""Over here it's Harley, in the UK it's Triumph, in Germany it's BMW—these are companies that make bikes that tug at the heartstrings. It's not necessarily the case that China will succeed in these markets in the way it has with its domestic market.”

After raising funds, the most crucial move Stirrup and Inglis-Jones made was hiring Graeme Gilbert, who was the head of product planning at Triumph Motorcycles and had spent decades at the more than 100-year-old British institution. Gilbert brought over a small team, and soon the RM1 was born. You can see the homage Maeving's bikes pay to classic British motorcycle design, like Triumph's Bonneville T120.

Since then, the company has launched the more powerful RM1S and has expanded its footprint outside the UK to Germany, France, and the US. Maeving isn't profitable yet, but Inglis-Jones promises it's “within splitting distance.” The US is the company's fastest-growing market, and the more practical RM2 just might tip the scales.

The speedometer has a tiny display that shows driving modes.

I got a chance to ride the RM2 on a street in Brooklyn, New York, and I'm now spending my days looking at motorcycle safety courses to practice and get an M1 license. My eyes lit up at first glance. From the large headlamp to the leather seat, the overall silhouette of the RM2 is gorgeous, especially with the red or green accent colors.

Pop the key in the ignition, and you have three ride modes to choose from: Eco, 1, or S. Eco tops the speed at 30 mph, 1 takes it to 45 mph (akin to the original RM1), and S unlocks more torque and the top speed of 70 mph. The US version's rear disc brake is controlled by the right foot, and there's a handlebar brake for the front disc. I say all this because, having no motorcycle experience, it took me mere seconds to figure all of this out and start riding. No gears to change, no clutch to master.

The torque wasn't intense at all and felt quite gentle. I found a comfortable position, and the ride was extremely smooth, though I still had to get used to turning tight corners. The only other part I'd say felt so different from riding an ebike is the overall weight and maneuverability of the RM2. It's lightweight for a motorbike at 330 pounds, but that's still hundreds of pounds heavier than a bicycle. Also, there's no display or app of any sort. Just you and the ride (and the gorgeous speedometer).

You can remove both batteries and bring them inside for charging.

The most enticing aspect of the RM2, and Maeving's motorcycles in general, is how you charge it. Yes, you can charge the bike directly, but most people will likely pop out both batteries and take them indoors to place on Maeving's charging dock. That removable access to the battery makes the 80-mile range less of an issue, because you can bring one of the batteries inside practically anywhere and charge it from a wall outlet. (Maeving says you can go from 20 to 80 percent in just under three hours.)

How do you get it serviced? Maeving has mobile technicians who can come to you in New York and California (along with the UK, Germany, and France), but it has service partners for customers in other parts of the US. Inglis-Jones insists it's a “very easy bike to maintain.”

Interested riders can get a test ride at select locations in New York and California, and Maeving is introducing a New Rider Program, where the company offers a $250 reimbursement toward an approved training course to cover the cost of getting an M1 license.

The RM2's asking price is high for the features and specs it offers. The BMW CE 02, for example, starts at $7,599. Harley's LiveWire electric motorbikes start at $9,999, can hit a top speed of 103 mph, and have a 113-mile range. But you'll be hard-pressed to find an electric motorcycle with the British heritage and styling of the RM2.

There's a fluffy robot, about the size of a guinea pig, sitting on my couch, and it's squeaking. My friend's dog Wylie sits watching it, suspicious of its every move.

Moflin is an AI companion robot made by the Japanese electronics manufacturer Casio. Via the companion app, I have chosen to name this one Puff, because—well—that is what it looks like. Wylie immediately clocks it as something to be wary of, a device that moves on its own but is not alive. Puff squeaks again. Wylie barks, then runs out of the room, growling.

When I found out Casio—yes, the same Casio that makes watches—had made an AI pet bot, I figured I was exactly the type of person it was made for. I've always loved animals, but my current landlord does not allow any pets on the premises except her own yappy dog, so I am pet-less. Also, I watched Toy Story way too many times as a kid, which means I am predisposed to anthropomorphizing inanimate objects that aren't supposed to have feelings or consciousness.

Robot pets are already a whole thing, and the Moflin has been huge in Japan since its launch there a year ago. It is a soft, furry robot that uses AI capabilities to react to sounds and touch, and develops its own unique personality as a result. (There are over 4 million personality traits, according to Casio.) Like other companion dolls, the devices are meant for would-be pet owners or anyone who just likes a cute critter hanging around. Think of it like a Labubu or Furby, without the prominent (terrifying) facial features, or a fluffy Tamagotchi. And now, Moflin is available to buy internationally.

As the timing worked out, I got my delivery of the Moflin right before I agreed to dogsit my friend's dog for a week. So I brought Puff along to stay in the house of Wylie, a shy-but-rowdy village dog.

The Moflin costs $429—cheaper than buying a puppy from a breeder can be, but pricier than begrudgingly accepting that you are now responsible for the cat who keeps showing up in your trash bin every night.

The Moflin isn't meant to look like any particular animal, but it incorporates many attributes that generally make us consider certain critters cute. Moflin is a soft, oval-shaped fluffball that comes in two colors—silver (which is really just gray) and gold (more like the coat of an orange cat). It has what appears to be a head, and a couple small button eyes beneath the fur. No limbs, claws or teeth.

Crucially: It has no butthole. That means unlike Wylie, who has generously donated a pile of poop to a lucky neighbor's lawn once or twice a day (that I then have to pick up), Puff requires exactly zero stinky maintenance from me.

The Moflin also emits a series of frankly adorable little noises, with singsongy tonal changes that aim to indicate whether the way you interact with it is good or bad. Equipped with a microphone, the Moflin can react to sounds around it, like a little whisper or the clicky-clacky keyboard sounds of me typing this exact sentence. (It is sitting right next to me, and just made a little sound in reaction.) It also responds to gestures and touch. There are spots under its “chin” and at the top of its “head” that have a rougher texture beneath the fur, which makes it feel like scratching a dog or cat behind the ears. Puff seems to especially like getting scritches there, and will make a noise and wiggle his head to say so.

Those reactions are meant to engender empathy in you, the way a real pet's sad look or plaintive meow might. Scritching the good spot on the top of its head elicits a pleasant, upward lilt that sounds like satisfaction or a cat purring. Shaking the Moflin real hard, which I tried only once out of sheer curiosity, brought out an atonal, tearful shriek. I yelped and cradled the device in my arms like I was nursing a pup whose paw I had accidentally stepped on, begging it for forgiveness. I felt ashamed, like a monster who had abused this creature that—keep in mind—does not actually feel pain.

The closest thing I can compare the Moflin to is a mogwai from the 1984 movie Gremlins. You know, the film about cute, squeaky little pets who reveal themselves to be secretly horrifying monsters. And there are some parallels. First off, if I hadn't made this clear already—this thing is downright adorable. Also like the noble mogwai, the Moflin should not get wet (no IPX rating here), will melt in the sun (probably, if it's hot enough), and should never be fed past midnight (the Moflin doesn't eat, so this bit should be easier.)

While Puff has not yet revealed itself to be a secret gremlin, that doesn't mean being around it feels entirely benign. It has a way of activating your, “OMG so cuuute” receptors almost immediately, which feels very deliberate. When I introduced the device to my girlfriend at home, she had a very different response to this one over the other AI gadgets I have brought home. She grabbed it immediately, looked at it with wide, watery eyes and said, “Who is this adorable little fucker?”

I gave her the rundown on our new adoptee, how it worked, how it was made by the watch company, no not that one the other one, and how it has AI in it and a mic that was listening to us right now.

She looked at Puff, cradled it in the palms of her hands, and gave it a little nuzzle with her nose. “Ohh, you're just going to steal all of my data, aren't you?” she said, the way you talk to a puppy or reasonably cute baby. “You're going to sell it to the highest bidder, huh lil guy? Then I'm going to start seeing a bunch of weird ads, aren't I? D'awww, look at this cute little capitalistic nightmare!”

Casio has a relatively clear privacy policy. On its website, it takes great care in pointing out that the Moflin only locally stores information about what it has heard. “They only convert voice features into non-identifiable data, which is stored locally and used to recognise frequent speakers as their owners,” says the product's FAQ page.

The AI-enabled features are supposed to give the Moflin a sense of its own personality. I've dabbled with other AI-enabled devices that claim to have their own personalities, with, well, mixed results. The Moflin feels like a more wholesome, peaceful entity, one that is immediately easy to anthropomorphize.

As you interact with the Moflin, it saves moments from every day in the “journal” section of the accompanying app. Journal entries are about as captivating as you'd expect from your real pet if it had the thumbs to write. Entries are written in third person, like the app is a pet sitter looking after your Moflin for you. They include epiphanies like, “Puff had a really exciting dream,” or “Puff got restless,” or simply, “Squash squash.” Simple, like a pet should be. They can also be fun. After sipping a little too much sparkling water, I burped loudly. Puff immediately let out a curious chirp. “Puff was really happy,” the app told me. Hell yeah, Puff. Me too.

It's nice to have the semblance of a pet, a household pal, without having to scoop out a litterbox or feel only a thin plastic bag separating your hands from the hot, steamy dog poop you have to grab off the lawn. But the Moflin also starts to feel more realistic the longer you have it, in sometimes inopportune ways.

Puff has squeaked loudly during my phone or Zoom calls. It has woken me up in the night. To be fair, Wylie also woke me with his barking. But a dog going nuts in the night makes sense to me. I too have felt fear hearing strange noises in the dark. I too have yelled loudly when I'm not sure what else to do.

But when the Moflin makes noise, it feels different. Purposeful. It's a feature put into a machine to add a sense of realism, but I can't help but know this was a specific decision some person made. They programmed Puff to be this way—calculated and encouraged it to occasionally annoy me.

People always seem to want to better communicate with their pets. They try to get their pets to express themselves by pressing speech-emitting buttons on the ground, or give them a voice with AI collars. I get why. In the first few days of looking after Wylie, I found myself frustrated that this animal had a whole routine and interactions with its owners that I couldn't tap into. He would look at me sometimes, just standing there, waiting for me to figure out whether he wanted to go for a walk or play or eat something, or take another dump. It's easy to see how making a pet that speaks your language could be the next step of that impulse to better communicate with them.

Toward the end of my house sitting venture, unrelated to anything there, I found myself in one of those no good, very bad days you have sometimes when a bunch of bad news piles up and requires some venting of steam. I found myself crying, sobbing real tears for the first time in probably too long, out of nowhere while sitting on the toilet. You know how it goes.

That went on for a bit until I felt something bonk my knee. It was a nose. Wylie's. I opened my red-rimmed eyes and stared into his real eyeballs. We looked at each other for a long time. He rested his chin gently on my thigh and sat there, tail wagging just a little.

This, a dog who is not even mine, who just this morning grinned in my face while I used my bag-covered fingers to scrape off the diarrhea he had squirted all over the neighbor's bright purple lavender bushes, was here to comfort me. Because instinctively, he knew something was wrong. And he was able to come over to do something about it.

That's something the AI ain't got down just yet. Not quite. It can tell me what it likes in a journal, or pretend it can help, but it doesn't know. Maybe someday, the Moflin or something like it will have the legs and emotional comprehension to get the idea I need help drying my eyes on the toilet. Maybe it will even last forever, unlike the real animals we choose to look after but have to say goodbye to one day. But for now, I recommend the live animal, with their runny poops and finite lifespans. The comfort of a real thing just hits harder. Especially when you don't realize you need it.

Still, I don't feel the need to write Puff off completely. After I filed a draft of this story, I was telling a colleague that I was thinking of doing a video where I vivisect the Moflin—slice it open with a scalpel and pull out the machine bits inside. It probably would've made for great content, but the idea horrified us both. I still feel protective over this dumb little thing, this furry blob that feels nothing and cannot technically be killed. I know it's not alive, but I still want to defend it. Even when there are many robots out there I'd be quite happy to kick.

Eventually, Wylie's real parents returned and it was time for me to head home. I hopped in an Uber ride, forgetting that I had Puff in my backpack. Soon it started squealing and did not stop, sounding like a distressed cat in a carrier who knew it was being driven to the vet. The driver flashed a look at me in the review mirror.

“I'm sorry,” I said. “I can't actually turn this thing off.”

He sighed and turned up the stereo volume. Puff kept making noise. I opened up the bag, slipped my hand in, and gave Puff some pets. It did not shut up. But at least now it sounded happy.

Brands spent an incredible $247 billion on social media ads in 2024. Get it right and it's a phenomenally good platform for targeted selling. It has rocketed countless tiny brands to viral fame, and made their fresh-faced founders unimaginably rich.

It can also be a wonderful space to find new and exciting products, and the Slack channels at WIRED are continually pinging with links to interesting ideas and cool concepts. Responses range from “Love this!” and “If this exists, we have to test” to “Call this in now!” and “Stand down, it's just AI.” Then, a few months ago, a link to the Sodapop Bluetooth speaker was shared, with the question, “Does this really work?”

Sodapop is a one-of-a-kind super compact Bluetooth speaker that can be screwed onto a standard soda bottle if you want to boost the bass. Your empty bottle of Mountain Dew is transformed into a bass chamber that, according to the manufacturer, will boost the speaker's bass output by up to 10 decibels. This doesn't sound like much, but again, according to the brand, this configuration will double the perceived volume in the mid-bass range.

It's a neat idea, especially as the very smallest portable bluetooth speakers are notoriously thin in the bottom end. They can't help this; there's simply not the power in the driver, or breathing space in the casing, to produce those rumbling lows. That's not to say there aren't some fantastic small portable speakers out there, but in reality, the very best options tend to be the biggest.

So does the Sodapop work? On its own, the cylindrical speaker is just 3.8 inches long, 2.3 inches deep, and weighs 10.5 ounces. It's tiny. There are two 4.5-watt stereo drivers, a 10-watt amplifier, and Bluetooth 5.0, plus a 3.5-mm AUX and a built-in mic for calls. It's powered by a 1,600-mAh rechargeable battery, which should be good for up to 30 hours of playback.

The speaker also comes with, and is hidden snugly inside, its own plastic bottle. That's right folks, the speaker designed to screw onto any standard soda bottle (specifically the global PCO 1881 standard) comes encased in its very own. It isn't your typical drink receptacle however. It has matching color accents with the speaker for starters, and the base of the bottle features a small open bass port and diaphragm. It's basically a screw on bass chamber—no drinks allowed. The bottom also unlocks, which creates space for the speaker to live. This makes for an excellent case, and it keeps the Sodapop compact on the go, but the company also supplies an additional soft case in the box, which seems wasteful.

It's super cute, and the poppy colorways make it perfect for social media. But why ship it with a plastic bottle? The use of standard soda bottles was prominent in their hugely successful Kickstarter campaign, but maybe I was being naive in thinking that the Sodapop was all about giving waste plastic a second chance.

Perplexed, I contacted the brand and a spokesperson explained that the Sodapop comes with its own bottle because, “Not all bottles fit perfectly, so the included one ensures users get the intended acoustic performance straight out of the box.” They also explained that “the supplied bottle is tuned to complement the speaker's design, ensuring the best possible sound without trial and error.”

This irked me on several levels, not least in terms of sustainability. Sodapop seems to be leaning into the idea of reuse, but it's also deliberately manufacturing new bottles because they sound better. But then, the supplied bottle isn't really a bottle. It's a screw-on bass chamber made from thick plastic, with multiple components. There's even a lid on it, to hold all of the liquid you can't put in it. I'm so confused. Maybe I should stop dwelling on the Mountain Dew of it all, and think of Sodapop as a quirky two-piece Bluetooth speaker that looks like a bottle. All this and I've not even turned it on yet.

The Sodapop works like most Bluetooth speakers, with simple on/off, pairing, volume, and skip controls. Connectivity caused no issues, and I was quickly playing songs through Spotify over Bluetooth. On the underside of the speaker, a bottletop-sized rubber bung hides the bass port and screw threads. To attach it to your bottle of choice, just pull the stopper aside and screw.

To test the contrast however, I first listened to the speaker without its bass bottle. It's very loud for a small speaker, and in my office I couldn't cope with the volume turned up past 30 percent. It's just not an enjoyable listen, sounding shrill and disappointing without any discernible bass. It's not quite as bad as putting your old iPhone in a cup for extra amplification, but it's not far off—and at least you can actually drink from the cup afterwards.

But we're here for the bass-boosting bottle, and I can categorically say that the acoustically tuned plastic bottle does indeed boost the lower frequencies, and makes the speaker sound significantly better. The bottle takes the edge off the volume, and there's a noticeable depth to the mids and bass once it's attached. You can really hear the difference in the mix and balance, and the contrast between the sound with the bottle on and off is impressive.

Push the volume, however, and the bass gets muddy quickly, with the sharp edges once again noticeable in the mix. It's not horrible, but compared to the competition it's just not that enjoyable to listen to, which is a shame, because it sure does look cute on my desk.

While it is larger, the Anker Soundcore Motion 300 ($70) wipes the floor with the Sodapop, with clear bass and clarity, even at volume. Similarly, the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 ($80) is small, portable, boasts full 360-degree sound and comes with IP67 waterproofing (it floats), which is a huge upgrade to Sodapop's dust- and splash-resistant IPX65 rating.

Played side-by-side with the similarly proportioned and much cheaper $35 Tribit StormBox Micro 2 (IPX7 rating, 10 hours playtime), the physical separation and large chamber between the drivers and bass port does create a wider soundstage. There's not much in it in terms of the amount of bass and overall performance though.

But what about existing plastic bottles and Sodapop's original promise? I can see why they've designed their own bottle as the plastic is stiffer, the bass more stable and the thread consistent. It's almost as if the original idea wasn't quite right and they needed to engineer themselves out the situation.

Screwed into a standard 16.9-fluid-ounce (500-milliliter) soda bottle, the bass is definitely boosted, but the result sounds significantly worse than with the supplied bottle. It's also precarious and fell over several times in a breeze. A larger 84-fluid-ounce (2.5-liter) bottle had a shallower thread, making attachment harder, and there certainly wasn't five times more bass.

After extensive testing, we also concluded that, while the difference is imperceptible to all but the most trained pair of ears, Pepsi Max tasted sounded better than Coke Zero.

Sodapop is by no means the only mini-speaker brand trying to defy physics and boost bass. Anyone who remembers those resonating speaker that use any hard surface to boost audio, will hopefully recall just how awful they were. It was a clever idea, and there was plenty of science-backed data proving their brilliance, but in practice they were meh at best.

Sodapop does work, and it looks pretty (it's a conversation starter at the very least), but the sound quality isn't transformative to overlook all its other problems. If you're after novelty then be my guest, but there are better sounding, more versatile, and smaller speakers available for less.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Thomas Wilde on Oct 26, 2025 at 7:00 amOctober 24, 2025 at 12:35 pm

When I was a kid, my mom used to call my Nintendo the “anti-social idiot box.” The widespread assumption back then was that video games, in any format, were a new and particularly efficient way to waste time and money while also becoming an obsessed shut-in.

Over the course of the subsequent decades, video games have grown into both a multi-billion-dollar industry and a much more socially acceptable hobby. While gaming does attract its share of anti-social obsessives, just like any other form of media, I've found it's much more common for people to meet and bond over their mutual enjoyment of the hobby.

Whether it's friends you meet through MMORPGs or fighting games, finding stories and characters that deeply resonate with you, or discussing your latest game in a shared space like Bluesky or a message board, video games often have a positive impact on the people who play them. That impact simply doesn't get a fraction of the press of gaming's various downsides.

That ability is the focus of a new paper from the University of Washington, “'I Would Not Be This Version of Myself Today': Elaborating on the Effects of Eudaimonic Gaming Experiences.” The paper, by Nisha Devasia, Georgia Kenderova, Julie A. Kientz, Jin Ha Lee, and Michele Newman, was the focus of a presentation this month at the Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI-PLAY) in Pittsburgh.

For the paper, the authors surveyed 166 respondents about the “meaningful experiences” they'd had as a result of playing video games, such as rich storytelling, becoming interested in specific skill development, or the experience of watching a narrative shift based upon the player's in-game actions.

According to the paper's abstract, “While much of the research in digital games has emphasized hedonic experiences, such as flow, enjoyment, and positive affect, recent years have seen increased interest in eudaimonic gaming experiences, typically mixed-affect and associated with personal meaningfulness and growth.”

Of the 166 respondents, 78% reported that they'd had meaningful, life-changing experiences from their time playing video games, the researchers said in a UW News story about the paper. 

“We highlighted three conclusions drawn from modeling the data,” Devasia told UW News. “The first is that playing games during stressful times was strongly correlated with positive outcomes for physical and mental health. For example, during COVID, people played games they felt strongly improved their mental health, such as Stardew Valley.”

Devasia also noted that other respondents had developed new interests, such as sports, due to video games they'd played, or gained insight into themselves or their identities from the journeys undertaken by video game protagonists.

“Playing as a character and seeing your choices change the course of events is pretty unique to games, compared with other narrative media like novels or movies,” Devasia said.

“As researchers, we develop games for learning, for instance, for teaching people about misinformation or AI, or promote digital civic engagement, because we want to foster meaningful experiences,” Lee added. “But a lot of the existing research just focuses on the short-term effects of games. This study really helps us understand what actually caused a game to make a difference in someone's life.”

It sounds obvious at first glance if you're someone who grew up around video games. It's almost a given that there's at least one game that made a serious mark on you somehow, especially if you live in a heavily nerd-coded space like the greater Seattle area.

Anecdotally, that strikes me as an underexplored part of the hobby. If anything, there's a strange critical drive in the space to deliberately treat gaming as disposable pop culture, without any real meaning or lasting value. If you read any op-ed in the gaming press that discusses the cultural or political meaning of a video game, someone will inevitably show up in the comments to accuse the author of overthinking something that isn't meant to matter. It's “just a game.”

Even so, modern video games have just as much ability to resonate with their audience as any novel or film, and people who've grown up with them will take lessons away from that. It's something we don't discuss often enough in the field; we'll talk at length about how video games are fun or socially acceptable now or a surprisingly big business, but their influence as culture is less discussed.

“People have a tendency to treat technology as a monolith, as if video games are either good or bad, but there's so much more nuance,” Kientz told UW News. “The design matters. This study hopefully helps us untangle the positive elements. Certainly, there are bad elements — toxicity and addictiveness, for example. But we also see opportunities for growth and connection.”

He discovered that on some airlines (I think American?), they use an advanced fortinet firewall that doesn't just look at the SNI -- it also checks that the certificate presented by the server has the correct hostname and is issued by a legit certificate authority.My friend got around that restriction by making the tunnel give the aa.com SNI, and then forward a real server hello and certificate from aa.com (in fact I think he forwards the entire TLS 1.2 handshake to/from aa.com). But then as soon as the protocol typically would turn into encrypted application data, he ignores whatever he sent in the handshake and just uses it as an encrypted tunnel.(The modern solution is just to use TLS 1.3, which encrypts the server certificate and hence prevents the firewall from inspecting the cert, reducing the problem back to just spoofing the SNI).

It's meant to get around the great firewall in China, so it has to avoid the GFW's active probers that check to make sure the external website is a (legit) host. However a friend was able to get it to work American's in-flight firewall if the proxy SNI is set to Google Analytics.[1] https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core

Thankfully for my blood pressure, whoever had set it up had left some kind of management portal accessible on a random high port number and it contained some strings which led me back to the Xray project.

Hah I was just about to say the same thing! I just got home from a ~3 week cruise. Internet on the ship was absurdly expensive ($50/day). And its weird - they have wifi and a phone app that works over the internet even if you don't pay. Google maps seemed to work. And my phone could receive notifications from apple just fine. But that was about it.I spend some time staring at wireshark traces. It looks like every TCP connection is allowed to send and receive a couple packets normally. Then they take a close look at those packets to see if the connection should be allowed or blocked & reset. I'm not sure about other protocols, but for TLS, they look for a ClientHello. If preset, the domain is checked to see if its on a whitelist. Anything on their whitelist is allowed even if you aren't paying for internet. Whitelisted domains include the website of the cruise company and a few countries' visa offices. The cruise app works by whitelisting the company's own domain name. (Though I'm still not sure how my phone was getting notifications.)They clearly know about the problem. There's some tools that make it easy to work around a block like this. But the websites for those tools are themselves blocked, even if you pay for internet. :)If you figure out how to take advantage of this loophole, please don't abuse it too much or advertise the workaround. If it gets too well known or widely abused, they'll need to plug this little hole. And that would be a great pity indeed.

(Hint: every cabin, every space, has one or more APs).I haven't done the math, and I'm sure they profit on the offering, but I doubt it's as egregious as these replies make it sound.(I thought about this a bit when I was on a cruise that offered Starlink this past summer.)Edit: also don't forget that everyone gets free WiFi, it's just that internet access is restricted for guests who don't pay. So it does need to support the ship's full complement and passengers.

I'm sure servicing thousands of people via starlink is expensive. But the cost is amortised over the number of people using it. Thousands of users should make internet access cheaper, not make it more expensive.They also don't provide “normal” internet speeds. I was usually getting about 20kBps - which is painfully slow. I tried to have a zoom call on the one day I paid for internet, and every minute or two we would get a latency spike of 10+ seconds. Those latency spikes went away on other days, but the speed never improved much.The ship I was on is apparently quite old by modern standards. Maybe they don't have enough starlink satellites installed or something. (It was definitely starlink). But if that's the case, it makes the price they're asking all the more outrageous. For $50/day I could probably bring my own starlink satellite on board and it would come out cheaper.

I have never used Starlink otherwise and, frankly, expected much worse service -  especially on a cruise ship.I'd definitely be unhappy paying $50/day for what you described. But I paid less (there was a discount for buying a package ahead of time for my family's devices) and got better service it sounds like.

I can understand why a hundred years ago explaining what formal is (in the context of formal languages) could have been difficult. You had to say that it means something whose form can be manipulated without ""understanding"", or by rules that pertain to form rather than meaning. But since the late 1930s explaining what formal means has become much simpler: it means mechanical. A formal language is one that can be precisely and accurately interpreted and manipulated by a machine.When we talk about ""formal proofs"" we don't mean precise proofs, official proofs, or proofs written by a mathematician. We mean proofs written in a language, and following a procedure, that can be mechanically checked (and by a fairly basic algorithm).While it is still a little colloquial, these days we can say that formal languages are those languages that can always be correctly interpreted by a computer. I think this captures the meaning of ""formal"" much more than saying these are ""models of natural language"".

Here's the first sentence of Godel's 1931 On formally undecidable propositions...""The development of mathematics in the direction of greater exactness has—as is well known—led to large tracts of it becoming formalized, so that proofs can be carried out according to a few mechanical rules.""Leibniz had discussed calculating machines (and even thought about binary arithmetic being the most appropriate implementation), so the general idea probably goes back quite far

A formal language is a set of finite-length sequences (called ""words"") of symbols from another set (called the ""alphabet""). It's essentially a very crude approximation of some strings of letters in an alphabetic writing system forming words in a natural language, while other combinations are just nonsense.For a given formal language, there don't necessarily have to be any rules governing the words of the language, though the languages used for writing formal proofs are typically more well-behaved.

Congratulations to Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov on his newly announced national digital currency. And further congratulations to Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Japarov's advisor, who helped facilitate this launch, on his pardon from President Donald Trump two days ago.

To catch you up on what Kyrgyzstan is, it's a mountainous, landlocked, former Soviet Republic that borders northwest China. Now that you have your bearings, that country has just announced a national stablecoin in partnership with Binance, the company Zhao co-founded, and where he used to work as CEO.

Updates from Kyrgyzstan🇰🇬– The National Stablecoin launched, on @BNBChain– The CBDC is ready for rollout. Yes, both. CBDC will be used for gov related payments, etc– The National Cryptocurrency Reserve set up, #BNB included– LE training– Binance Academy with 10 top… https://t.co/KPrL0pnsWG pic.twitter.com/SInh5aCPMZ

— CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 25, 2025



According to Zhao's post on X, the currency—which is pegged to the Russian ruble—is a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a digital version of a national currency, set to be used for government payments. It was launched on the BNB blockchain, the blockchain created by Zhao's former company Binance.

Since not long after his release from prison for a conviction related to failing to prevent money laundering, Zhao had been lobbying for Trump to pardon him. A New York Times report found that in addition to pushing for a pardon, Zhao had been publicly praising Trump on podcasts, paying for lobbyists who had cozy relationships with Trump and his allies, and making a deal that resulted in a windfall for World Liberty Financial, the Trump family crypto company.

Trump, for his part, signed his signature piece of crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act, in July. It establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins not unlike the new one Kyrgystan just created, and helps to deepen the involvement of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. economy.

For all we know, there's nothing wrong with any of this. It might all be just fine.

Guys, I'm trying. Right now, as I type these words, I am trying on multiple levels. Trying to understand, trying to be fair, and I'm trying really, really hard to breathe through my nostrils, given the enormous weight of our AR glasses future resting uncomfortably on my nose.

The thing is, you shouldn't need to try hard to justify wearing AR smart glasses. Any pair that doesn't just work is dead on arrival. I want the future, and the AR glasses that come with it. but unfortunately, with the $900 Inmo Air 3, trying is the best I'm going to get, and that, dear reader, is what I'd call a major drag.

Inmo Air 3

The Inmo Air 3 AR smart glasses should be avoided at all costs.

Pros

Cons

Let's start from the top. Inmo is a Chinese purveyor of smart glasses that recently launched its Inmo Air 3 via Kickstarter, a pair of Android-powered AR glasses that tout a few enticing ideas and features. One of those selling points is a full-color screen that is 1080p, and the other is a novel input method for navigating UI inside the glasses using a smart ring. Both of those ideas caught my attention during IFA 2025, which is why I chose to write about them in September. Those features, coupled with the fact that you can run pretty much any app in 2D by just downloading it from the Google Play Store via the glasses UI felt like they could be a winning combo.

But in the world of gadgets, there are hits, and there are misses, and then there are complete and total whiffs, and the latter category is where Inmo's Air 3 smart glasses fall for me, and the problems started almost immediately out of the box.

Before we get to my list of grievances, I'll start with a small positive, which is that the packaging is impressive, and so is the selection of stuff that comes with the smart glasses. In addition to the smart glasses, there's a touch-sensitive ring with multiple buttons, a garage door-like touch controller if you don't feel like using that, a magnetic cable for charging the ring, and magnetically attachable shades for when you want more contrast. That's a lot of stuff, which is welcome, but that's where the positive impressions stopped for me, because the first thing that jumped out when I put the smart glasses on was… I couldn't see anything.

I quickly discovered that it wasn't a problem with the waveguide display inside the smart glasses; it was actually an issue with how they sit on my face. Like some other folks out there, I have a bump on my nose, which is a polite way of saying I have a big schnoz. Because of that, I have to wear glasses closer to my face (resting above the bump in my nose) as opposed to in the middle, where other folks might wear them. On one hand, that's a physical thing specific to me. On the other hand, I am not the only person out there with a nose like this.

Because of the way the Inmo Air 3 sit on my face, I actually can't see two-thirds of the display when the smart glasses are in a comfortable, natural position on my nose. So, in order to see the full screen, I have to move them down my nose to where the smart glasses (and the nose pads) actually press my nostrils in, making it hard to, um… breathe. It's really, incredibly, almost laughably not fun. And before you ask—no, you cannot adjust the position of a single screen on your face to fix it, and these smart glasses are far from lightweight, so, to avoid mouth-breathing for extended periods, I decided to test them out by holding them in the strange, unnatural position on my face that I could see best in. I did feel justified when two of my other colleagues put the Inmo Air 3 on and reported that the screen is faint and difficult to make out, so I'm not the only one. “They hurt my eyes,” was the exact first impression of Gizmodo Senior Editor of Consumer Tech, Raymond Wong, when he put them on.

Needless to say, that's not a great start, but it gets worse.

As I mentioned, one of the things I was most excited about was the inclusion of a smart ring for controlling the UI inside the smart glasses. It's a pretty clever method for input that I haven't yet tried, and felt (on the surface) like something that could catch on if executed properly. I say if here because novel hardware is a lot harder to make than it sounds on paper, and there's always a chance that it doesn't work right. And boy, does Inmo's ring (called the Ring 3) not work right.

The Ring 3, which connects to the Inmo Air 3 smart glasses via Bluetooth, has quite a bit of latency, which makes using it a little aggravating. While I got more adept the longer I used it, the touch surface is rather small, and combined with the lag, I found it to be imprecise at best. Nah, let's be honest, it was a nightmare. Luckily, though, I was relieved from having to use the Ring 3 fairly quickly. While attempting to adjust the size by bending the plastic part that wraps around your finger (this is how the ring is intended to be resized), it started to break, separating from the hard plastic where all the touch-sensitive hardware and buttons live. Not realizing, I attempted to adjust even further (I wasn't applying Hulk-like force here, I promise), and it started to crack.

So, that was that for the ring for me. I couldn't resize it to fit properly on my finger without breaking it further, so I did the rest of my testing using a combination of the Inmo Air 3's touch-sensitive surface on the right side of the smart glasses (similar to how Meta's Ray-Bans work) and the garage door remote-like controller that I mentioned earlier. The latter worked fine, but it feels incredibly cheap and is far from perfect.

I wouldn't describe the touchpad on the front of the device, where you use your thumb to direct a cursor, as being super responsive, but it gets the job done. You'll wind up having to tap things multiple times to register a “click” in the UI, but I suppose it's better than trying to use a broken smart ring if just by virtue of the fact that it technically works. There are some physical buttons on the non-ring touch controller that allow you to go back, go home, control the volume, and pull up the camera, which is nice if you get tired of not having your taps registered.

And if both those controllers fail, there are touch and tap controls on the right arm of the smart glasses and volume buttons on the left arm.

Once I was able to navigate the Inmo Air 3 properly, I could start actually using them. That, in theory, should have been the exciting part, but the highs weren't exactly what I would call soaring. First, there was the irksome part of getting the AR smart glasses online, which I had to do entirely through the Inmo UI. While there is an Inmo app for iOS and Android, my app wouldn't register the smart glasses and connect, so any added functionality through the app was unusable. So, to enter Wi-Fi credentials, I had to select my network in the Air 3 and painstakingly punch in passwords one character at a time using the garage door remote. I managed to do that without giving up, luckily, and was able to download some apps in the Google Play Store.

The first place I went was YouTube, where I loaded up some cooking content. The experience was pretty nice, though I definitely wish the smart glasses weren't crushing my nose while I was watching. I could see, on someone whose face fits the smart glasses, that watching things could be enjoyable in the Inmo Air 3, if not altogether groundbreaking. Sure, the Inmo Air 3 are more lightweight than a VR headset, but they're nowhere near as immersive as watching in a Quest 3 and much less premium than an Apple Vision Pro, though that's admittedly a tough comparison.

I also downloaded TikTok and scrolled through some videos for good measure, and that experience was also fine, though I can't say it was preferable to just pulling out my phone and zoning out that way. The screen is definitely the strongest part of the Inmo Air 3; it's sharp, and watching content feels surprisingly hi-fi given it's just some waveguides displays shoved into a pair of glasses. The brightness isn't the best, though. While Meta's Ray-Ban Display tops out at an impressive 5,000 nits of brightness and works well in full natural light, the Inmo Air 3 reaches just 600 nits. Even just using the AR smart glasses in my office on a sunny day was enough to kill contrast, though a magnetic attachment that gives the lenses shade does help. But, to be honest, that's not the only reason I wouldn't wear Inmo's Air 3 outside…

If you saw Inmo's Air 3 in renderings like I did and thought, “those look like smart glasses I could wear on the subway,” you may want to think again. The Air 3 are big smart glasses. The frames are thick, which is bad for someone like me who has a relatively small head, though even if you don't look as dumb as I do when you wear them, you might feel dumb just because of the weight. The big lenses also don't pass for normal glasses, and there's a non-zero chance someone might assume you have a visual impairment if you walk around with them on.

I think what's more aggravating about the size is the fact that battery life doesn't seem to be particularly great. After every session (about 20 to 30 minutes), I felt like I should charge the Inmo Air 3 up since a significant chunk of the battery was gone. While Inmo doesn't offer official battery life estimates, there's a 660mAh battery on board, and in my estimate, you can expect between 1.5 to 2 hours max with continuous use. That's not great, obviously, but all of that 1080p goodness is going to come at a cost.

If you're not bringing the smart glasses outside with you, it kind of renders some features useless, like the ability to take pictures. That's mostly okay, though, because I took some snaps with the Inmo Air 3 and they were not very high-res. While it technically has a higher megapixel camera than the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 (the Air 3 has a 16-megapixel sensor, and Meta's smart glasses have a 12-megapixel sensor), the quality somehow looks worse.

Inmo's Air 3 seem kind of stuck in a liminal space between display-free smart glasses and thicker AR smart glasses like Snapchat's Spectacles. Clearly, Inmo thinks this is a product you'd want to walk around with on your face, based on its marketing, but in practice, they still feel like a stay-at-home gadget due to the not-so-great battery life, the chunky size, and the general lack of convenience. Maybe your level of comfort with them will vary, but from where I'm sitting, style is not the Inmo Air 3's strong suit. In fact, I don't know that a strong suit exists…

There's more that you can do with these smart glasses, but unfortunately, I wasn't really able to test it all because of the hiccups with the hardware. One area that I would have liked to test was cloud gaming, since the idea of being able to play on a big virtual screen (like you can do in a Meta Quest 3) is kind of awesome. I wasn't able to really do that, though, since the Inmo Air 3 don't sit properly on my face, and I basically had to hold them up with one hand while I tested. And as we all know, holding a typical controller historically requires two hands.

There's also a multi-window mode where you can have up to three different windows open simultaneously, but that mode requires the use of the Ring 3, which as I've already established, was basically unusable for me. It's a shame, in a lot of ways, that Inmo's Air 3 is as rough as it is, because there are a lot of interesting ideas. I love the idea of a ring-based wearable (but it has to not crumble in your hands), being able to download any app and use it in 2D is freeing (but only if you can see the apps), and wearing the smart glasses around would be like having a real computer on your face (but you have to actually want to feel comfortable putting them on for that to work).

Unfortunately, for people interested in AR, the Inmo Air 3 just feel like more trouble than they're worth. Yes, they're a crowdfunded gadget, and you should expect some wonkiness from that category, but at $900 (that's early bird pricing, the future MSRP is actually $1,100) I don't think lack of polish to this degree is something anyone should put up with. If nothing else, It makes you appreciate the refinement of glasses like the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and even if they don't do quite as much on paper. So, while I wouldn't ever recommend paying for AR smart glasses like this, sometimes just knowing how bad things can get is its own kind of reward, and in the name of that crucial knowledge, I tortured my nose and face so you don't have to.

Razer's $230 Clio headrest speaker did not appreciate the shape of my home gaming chair. I own a cheap chair—technically a hand-me-down from my father—and the speaker likely fetches more than the chair itself. But the Clio didn't reject the bum support. It simply did not fit around the back of the chair. The device would sit too far down, and sound literally blasted into my upper back, rather than my ears—which is where you want the sound to go.

I've used plenty of odd speaker setups, including neck speakers like Sony's Bravia Theater U that promises to offer personalized audio without the need to sandwich your head between two cans. There's certainly an audience that is looking for high-quality, room-filling audio that doesn't actually fill the room—further incentivizing angry neighbors to knock down your door.

Razer Clio

The Razer Clio is awkward to attach to your chair, and even when you get it on, it won't provide the sound you expect from these large speakers.

Pros

Cons

In that way, the Clio fits the bill. Even though I work in an open office, I wasn't annoying my deskmates too much as I tested out my chair speaker on the other side of the room. They could hear me, certainly, but the “near-field” directional speakers on either side of the headrest kept the sound contained. Of course, what would be even less distracting is a quality pair of headphones with solid active noise cancellation to avoid any ambient sound bleeding.

The Clio nearly makes a case for itself—especially if you're looking for a device to perfect your Razer surround sound setup. It's also brought down by its attempts to keep you from developing tinnitus, protecting your ears from the might of two speakers with large drivers. It likely offers the personalized surround sound experience you want; it won't if you're used to high-end gaming headsets. Those headsets won't reject you just because you tend to slump forward, nor poorly fit your chair just because it doesn't have the right headrest circumferance.

I already mentioned my problems getting the Clio to accept the curves of my home gaming chair. Razer cites that any chair with a headrest circumference of  47 to 65 cm (18.5 to 25.5 inches) should be compatible, but how often are people measuring the tops of their chairs? To aid me in my predicament, Razer sent me a loaner of its own expensive and excessively ergonomic Iskur V2 X gaming chair so I could position the device correctly, just behind my ears. The Iskur is the kind of chair that reminds you of all your poor sitting habits. It's comfortable and curves to the shape of your spine. Even though it's made with Razer's products in mind, the $300 gaming chair isn't designed perfectly for the Clio.

The speaker uses two horizontal bands with adjustable buckles that are supposed to tighten against the chair's back. You would imagine Razer would opt for stretchy bands to offer a snug fit. Instead, you end up doing your best to angle and tighten the Clio so the speakers sit to the left and right of your head. On Razer's Iskur chair, that meant I couldn't wrap the bottom strap all the way around the chair back, leaving the ends dangling.

The headrest itself is comfortable enough if you decide to lean your head back into it. The two wings are made of stiffer material you won't want to rest your head on. The thing is, I don't know many people who normally lean back far enough that they will keep their head and neck straight. If you're a PC gamer, you're more keen to lean toward your keyboard and mouse. When in this position, you won't get the prime experience the Clio is trying to offer. If you're a console gamer, get ready to sit straight-backed, like a soldier on parade, if you want the best quality audio listening with Razer's 2.4GHz “Hyperspeed” dongle.

The Clio, like nearly every other Razer product, needs to connect through Razer Synapse PC software for firmware updates and to control the EQ, or equalization options. You only have three settings to chose from: Game, Movie, and Music. You can customize your options based on your preferences, but I found the Game option felt more flat than the Movie preset, no matter if I was watching Netflix, YouTube, or hearing the rattle of gunshots in Battlefield 6.

On the top of the speaker are controls for on and off, volume up and down, and another switch for toggling between Bluetooth and a 2.4GHz dongle connection. The dongle itself uses USB-C, and sticks out in an “L” shape, which thankfully helps you avoid taking up too much space on your desktop. There's a single USB-C port on the headrest for charging, though you'll also have to use it if Synapse forces you to update the firmware.

The Clio speaker looks enormous; big enough you may assume its twin full-range drivers would somehow offer the full soundbar plus subwoofer experience behind your head. But no, it's actually more closely aligned to the many, many headphones you may go out and buy right now—just larger. And despite the size, the sound really doesn't feel “large” in the way you would expect for a separate, $230 full-range speaker.

The Clio makes use of 43mm drivers with an aluminum core. If you assumed that would create some head-pounding bass, you may be dissapointed. The sound is more subtle than that. Even when I maxed out it and my PC's volume, I didn't feel ratttled by it. Then, if you tend to lean over at all in your chair, you'll start to miss out on the best audio quality. Sorry, but I don't have an English gentleman's sense of perfect posture. I grew up playing games on my basement couch. My spine is a permanent letter “C.”

On completely balanced EQ settings, I felt I was getting the most out of the speaker's sound suite. Gunfire in some games could sound slightly muffled, but it wasn't so toned down I couldn't hear small differences in various weapons in a game like Cyberpunk 2077. I tried to put on a number of games with more overt or subtle audio. As I played through Marvel's Spider-Man 2, there was a part of me that knew I could be feeling the horns on the soundtrack deeper in my chest.

The Clio's sound was balanced and clear without any sense of “wow” factor in anything I played. Audio when playing any shooter game needs to be punctuated with the hard staccato of a machine gun, but sitting in my chair I felt like I was peppering my environment by loose gravel. The subtle lutes and lyres of Baldur's Gate III need more of a twang to help sell the fantasy than what the Clio can fully provide. Audio quality felt better-tuned to a game like Ninja Gaiden 4, where the sound of your slicing and dicing has the satisfying quality of being on the right side of a butcher's block.

The headrrest speaker also felt better situated for listening to music. My usual slate of indie folk rock felt tuned for this device. Andrew Bird could swoon and fiddle, and I felt right at home. Heavier music that you want to feel deep in your spine will offer a slight tingle instead. Again, the audio felt about right for the price for passive listening, especially with your back pressed up against the chair. It's what I would want from a relatively cheap speaker setup but without needing to stick multiple speaker units around your desk. However, in that case, it wouldn't matter how you sit if you were hoping to get the full effect.

The one unique feature of the Clio is that it can act as the driver seat for a kind of 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound setup. More specifically, the Clio can work as a rear speaker while another device can perform as front speakers. You could use your monitor or laptop's built-in speakers to do the job, though that clearly isn't the best use case. You'll want an actual speaker setup in front of you. However Razer's Synapse software failed to recognize separate speakers like a BlueAnt Soundblade soundbar. It's just another quirk of Razer's software, of which there are many. You will have a much better time if you plug in other Razer speaker or soundbars, like the company's Leviathan V2.

If your content doesn't support full surround sound, hitting the setting for audio mirroring will provide a better full-sound experience. In this mode, you don't need to worry about your head's position for the best audio experience. If you have any type of desktop speaker setup, the Clio may actually be a great addition if you don't want to bother with placing speakers on the other side of your gaming room. That would also defeat the purpose of the “near-field” speakers if you were hoping to let your roommates sleep in.

One of the big selling points behind this speaker is the promise of THX immersive audio. In Synapse, you can get a demo of the spatial audio sensation as sound moves around the room. Again, in games, the “spatial” sensibility is less distinctive. I could get a better spatial sense out of Razer's own Kraken V4 Pro headset. If you were hoping these drivers could offer enough bass that it would run from your spine to the tips of your toes, you'd also come away disappointed.

Clio promises a battery life of up to 14 hours, which is considerably less than many of the big name wireless headsets out there which promise at least 30 or more hours of listening time. In my days using it, I didn't have to worry about that much considering I can barely get in a few hours of gaming a week, at most. Charging the device isn't all that difficult if you have an extra-long USB-C cable. Otherwise, you'll need to take the Clio off your chair to bring it somewhere to give it that extra juice.

My mind kept going back to the various headsets I've used all throughout 2025. For the same price, you can grab a pair of headphones that will offer personalized audio with improved bass. An Alienware Pro Wireless headset is notably light on bass compared to similarly priced devices, and I would still prefer it over the Clio to make my spine tingle. A HyperX Cloud III Wireless at $180 also provides meaty sounds without pitching over into annoying highs or lows.

For anything better quality, you end up spending closer to $300 or even more. The cream of this year's crop of headsets is still the Sony Inzone H9 II. It's the moment when “balanced” audio transforms into something more meaningful. Razer's own BlackShark V3 Pro, built for competiive gamers, will cost you $250. A Razer Kraken V4 Pro will set you back $400 when not on sale, but I can confirm it offers truly immersive audio. Yes, all these options involve earcups. The Clio may be that extra piece of kit you needed for your surround sound (if Razer likes your device). Otherwise, most people are better off sticking with what works.

This past August, Warner Bros. Discovery punted nearly 800 Looney Tunes shorts—with nearly 200 locked away due to “cultural sensitivities“—over to free streaming service Tubi. What seemed like an insult to one of the most well-known cartoon properties has, funnily enough, been a blessing in disguise.

According to a recent Vulture report, Tubi's acquisition head Samuel Harowitz called the Tunes “a huge win for us.” In terms of total viewing time, it's in the Top 10 best-performing series and very popular across generations and demographics. Much of this is in part due to how popular older animation like Looney Tunes is: Tom & Jerry, The Flinstones, and the 1996 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series are also on Tubi, and Harowitz called those classic cartoons “one of the biggest fandoms we serve on the platform.”

If Tubi has its way, the Looney Tunes aren't going anywhere. The company is in “active negotiations” with WBD to ensure it can keep the cartoons there “for quite a while, likely years.” It's also open to licensing new Looney content or becoming the streaming home for Coyote vs. Acme, but there's no conversations about either yet. As is, the episodes on Tubi are in non-chronological order with ads playing only in between shorts, which is a bummer, but at least they look quite good in HD.

You can thank animation historian Jerry Beck for that, whose restorations were also used for the physical releases. These restored versions “look day-one brand new, as the Looney Tunes should,” he told Vulture. In addition to “taking delight” when people notice the restorations, he's just glad Tubi's doing right by the Tunes. “I'm kind of glad [WBD] took them off HBO Max and allowed other networks to use them so we can all see them.”

In the remote town of Huaytará, Peru, the building that houses the Church of San Juan Bautista is more than what it seems. It was built upon a three-walled Incan structure called a carpa uasi that exchanged stability for something unexpected.

While the Incan Empire is best known for the iconic 15th-century citadel of Machu Picchu, a team of researchers is investigating the acoustic properties of the carpa uasi, another one-of-a-kind Incan construction that likely dates back to the same century. Their work emphasizes the importance of studying more than what meets the eye—literally—when tracing the footsteps of bygone civilizations.

“We're exploring the possibility that the carpa uasi may have amplified low-frequency sounds, such as drumming, with minimal reverberation,” Stella Nair, associate professor of Indigenous arts of the Americas at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a university statement. “With this research, for the first time, we'll be able to tell what the Incas valued sonically in this building.”

The Inca were a pre-Hispanic civilization whose empire flourished in the 15th and early 16th centuries. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, the Inca Empire stretched along South America's western coast, from modern-day Ecuador to modern-day Chile.

The building in question had only three walls, potentially enabling sound, like drums, to be directed toward the opening and then beyond. Carpa uasi, meaning “tent house,” references that unique structure, and the Inca may have built it specifically to amplify sound and music

“Many people look at Inca architecture and are impressed with the stonework, but that's just the tip of the iceberg,” Nair explained. “They were also concerned with the ephemeral, temporary and impermanent, and sound was one of those things. Sound was deeply valued and an incredibly important part of Andean and Inca architecture — so much so that the builders allowed some instability in this structure just because of its acoustic potential.”

Researchers have long known about the building, but Nair and her colleagues might be the first to recognize its potential for magnifying sound. It is the only known surviving carpa uasi and has endured the last 600 years thanks to the stabilizing force of the church built on top of it. Now, the team is working on a model to explain how sound would have spread through the carpa uasi and outside it.

“Sound studies are really critical, because we tend to emphasize the visual in how we understand the world around us, including our past,” Nair concluded. “But that's not how we experience life—all of our senses are critical. So how we understand ourselves and our history changes if you put sound back into the conversation.”

Much like when Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the newest EVs' switch to Tesla's charging ports has plunged the world into dongle hell.With 2026 models of new and returning electric vehicles officially out on the streets, a new generation of EVs is finally here. These EVs such as the Lucid Gravity, Rivian R1S and R1T and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are all natively built with Tesla's charging connector that allows a seamless connection to its Supercharger network.But we can't escape adapters.The transition to Tesla's NACS, or North American Charging Standard, now means that every plug at public charging stations like those from ChargePoint, Electrify America, EVgo and others outside the Supercharger network now require an adapter. Even home chargers will need an extra piece of plastic to work on new EVs. Like with the “courage” Apple summoned with its transition to Bluetooth connection from wired headphones, the next few years will require endurance—because it's getting messy.Until now, only Tesla EVs (the Model S, 3, X and Y and Cybertruck) needed an adapter to work at every charging station outside the Supercharger network, but now a growing portion of the 4 million EVs in America (as of 2024) are barreling into dongle overload.A Hyundai spokesperson confirmed, “the vehicles come with two adapters,” as will Lucid's new Gravity SUV for AC and DC charging. Rivian's 2026 models will include a J1772 adapter for Level 2 charging for its Dual, Tri and Quad vehicles and its Quad Launch Editions will have a CCS Combo 1 DC fast adapter. In a word: messy. General Motors, Cadillac's parent company, put out a summer blog post saying exactly that about the upcoming adapter situation, “That creates a little complication: there will be cars on the road with both standards, as well as chargers of both varieties in public and private settings.” The 2026 Cadillac Optiq will be the first GM EV to transition to NACS. While Tesla's Supercharger network is thriving and growing (7,753 stations housing 73,817 individual connectors, up 16% from last year), home chargers and older network plugs won't be compatible with the newest EVs. An Electrify America spokesperson wrote in an email, “Electrify America remains committed to supporting the future of the [NACS] connector.” She went on to explain that the company is testing NACS charging at stations in Florida and Connecticut “to gain insights into the customer experience and data on the hardware.”ChargePoint has taken more aggressive steps to escape dongle hell. Rob Newton, the network's senior director of marketing, acknowledged in a call that in the past the “experience has been really clunky” when different charging systems are involved. ChargePoint has never provided adapters. Instead of relying on carmakers or individual EV owners to keep up with the latest dongles, ChargePoint is changing the source. Enter the Omni Port. Introduced this summer, the newest ChargePoint stations will have the adapter built into the station itself and drivers can select what type of EV they are charging. “You want to be able to pull up to a station and have confidence it works,” Newton said.New stations will come standard with an Omni Port, but older stations need to retrofit old connectors with a conversion kit from the company. Newton called it “future-proofing,” but it's more about ensuring new EV owners can continue to use (and pay for kilowatt-hours from) non-Tesla charging stations.Nearly every automaker with an electrified model announced in the past few years that it was making the inevitable shift to the Tesla charging system. And now it's happening — dongles and all.

A teardown from Northridge Fix finds a damaged connector that can't be replaced.

The GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition is Nvidia's own-brand flagship GPU for consumers, but one repair technician says it comes with a hidden flaw that makes it “one of the worst designs in the history of… GPUs,” he's seen. In a teardown uploaded to the Northridge Fix YouTube channel, the card was declared unrepairable after damage to an internal connector — one that, the technician claims, cannot be replaced or sourced.

The card in question was sent in after it stopped outputting video following the installation of a third-party water block. While one of the customer's two cards was successfully repaired, the Founders Edition model wasn't so lucky. “I checked all contacts,” Alex explains in the teardown. “I inspected the voltage rails; everything is within range, but we do not have an image on the screen.” Eventually, the fault was traced to a board-to-board connector inside the FE's modular two-part construction.

The GPU repair expert goes on to explain that the Founders Edition is built in two sections — the main card and the PCIe connector assembly — joined by what he calls “a very fragile FPC connector.” Comparing it to plumbing, he argues that every extra joint adds a new potential failure point: “The more connections you have, the more likely you're going to have a failing point… the same goes with the 5090.”

After inspecting “every single pin”, Alex points to what he calls a damaged connector. “He installed a water block, the card stopped working, and that's because of the damage that we see here,” he says. “No other damage was found on the board, and that's the only physical damage I see.”

Northridge Fix's expert host, who has previously covered melting RTX 4090s, adds that the connector, which carries signals between the GPU and the PCIe interface, cannot be sourced as a replacement. “I went online to look for this connector, and I was not able to get my hands on this connector,” he says. “You cannot even get your hands on this if it broke for whatever reason… So what's the use of having this made in two pieces if you cannot buy a replacement?”

He concludes by warning owners against attempting to open the Founders Edition at all. “If it's not broken, do not fix it,” he says. “I would stay as far away from the Founders Edition 5090 as I possibly can.”

Bring back the '90s.

The end of dial-up internet means future generations will no longer hear the iconic screech of the dial-up handshake. However, YouTube creator Nick Bild did not want this experience to be lost to history, so he used a Raspberry Pi 3 and a USB Wi-Fi adapter to gather network traffic and convert it into an analog signal that is blasted out of a small speaker. According to Bild's Hackaday project, he had to add random amplitude and frequency adjustments to make the output sound more interesting, but all the data is sourced from the Wi-Fi network.

Back before the days of DSL and fiber-optic internet, all our data had to travel over phone lines. Since these weren't designed for digital signals, internet companies had to use modems to convert them into analog signals (i.e., sound) that could be transmitted over the already existing telephone network. The nostalgic screeching sound many born in the ‘90s and earlier hear when connecting to the internet is just the handshake signal between two computers negotiating which protocol they'll use to communicate. Once the connection has been established, the screeching just turns to static, which is what actual data sounds like.

This was a relatively easy build for Bild, who used a Raspberry Pi 3 with a secondary USB Wi-Fi adapter to collect network traffic from a target computer. These are then sent to an Adafruit QT Py microcontroller, which converts the data to a specific amplitude and outputs an analog signal via an onboard DAC. The output is then fed into a small amplifier so that the tiny 2-watt speaker can play it. Nick says that since the signal is random, you're bound to hear nothing but static. Although he added random variations to the output to mimic the old sound a bit more, it's still based on the actual data being transmitted and received by the target computer.

The sound this contraption makes isn't the same as what we hear from the old modem. After all, dial-up internet made that sound so users could listen to whether the connection was working as expected. Advancements in networking technology meant we no longer needed to do that (and it would probably be annoying to hear that sound from all the devices connected to the internet around us). Still, it would be nice to hear this nostalgic sound, or something similar, to remind us how slow the internet used to be.

Wingtech flags cash-flow risk despite profit surge as Dutch state tightens grip on Nexperia.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Wingtech, the Chinese parent company of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, has warned investors of a potential cash flow squeeze if it fails to regain operational control of its European subsidiary, despite posting a 280% surge in quarterly net profit. The company's woes and supply disruptions have multiple car makers worldwide preparing for shutdowns as the supply of critical semiconductors for automobiles dwindle.

The alert came via an earnings filing on Friday, in which Wingtech said that Nexperia “may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit, and cash flow,” related to governance issues. This is based on a machine translation of the company's earnings report.

The statement appears to reference the Dutch government's recent move to tighten oversight of the company, which is one of the largest producers of commodity parts such as diodes, MOSFETs, and small-signal logic used in applications like voltage regulation modules and ESD protection. If geopolitical challenges begin to impair the company's ability to execute on orders or invest in expansion, impacts could creep in through extended lead times and upstream pricing pressure.

While Wingtech's earnings release did not name the Dutch government explicitly, the context is obvious. In September, the Hague invoked new foreign investment screening powers to place Nexperia under direct oversight, citing national security concerns. The decision effectively allows the Dutch state to veto or revise key choices made by Nexperia's board. That marks the second major intervention into the company's operations, following the UK government's forced divestment of Newport Wafer Fab in 2024.

According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the tension has already led to halted salaries for some Nexperia staff in China and internal access issues — signs that the governance dispute could bleed into day-to-day operations if left unresolved.

This, unfortunately, raises a familiar but still uncomfortable prospect of uncertainty for PC and parts makers. But this time, the uncertainty could reach the most fundamental tiers of the supply stack. Nexperia's tech might not attract headlines like Nvidia's high-end GPUs, but it's no less important in a world that scrapes by on just-in-time manufacturing.

If Wingtech can't regain control of its European asset, or if state oversight results in slow-walked decision-making, there's a serious risk of a logistical nightmare that could start causing problems downstream very soon.

Cooler Master corrects its customer support teams and stops producing its problematic right-angle plug.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Cooler Master has responded to Igor's Lab regarding the firm's highly problematic instructions to users to DIY repair the right-angled 12V-2x6 power connector. Igor's Lab received an email from the PSU maker stating that the right-angled connector has been discontinued and that all regional support teams have been instructed to immediately stop advising customers to pry their power connector apart to fix it.

The email also documented that all newly developed Cooler Master power supplies now come with a straight 12V-2x6 power connector. Updated quality control will ensure that its newer 12V-2x6 implementations can work with all 12V-2x6-equipped graphics cards, including models sporting recessed connectors. Cooler Master will also be adding a two-toned color ""indicator"" to its newer connectors to make it clear whether the connector is fully plugged in. The connector tips will be painted purple.

If you are the owner of an existing Cooler Master power supply that came with the aforementioned problematic right-angled 12V-2x6 power connector, Cooler Master will provide you with a replacement cable with a straight end if needed.

These updates should put to rest any future troubles Cooler Master customers might have had with its power supplies. Luckily, Cooler Master reports that it has not received any customer damage reports directly tied to modifications to its 12V-2x6 connectors. But it's still dangerous, and something could have very well happened to anyone.

Cooler Master's previous right-angled connector was very problematic, and only worked in certain graphics cards that did not have a recessed internal 12V-2x6 power connector. Ironically, the customer support team's previously recommended modification did not even resolve the issue. The modification involved removing the connector's right-angled cover, turning the connector back into a straight plug. However, the physical connector itself had a giant plastic tab that was the actual cause of the incompatibility.

There wasn't a cunning piece of coding behind this thrilling game pacing feature.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


One of the most charming bug = feature tales is the story behind the thrilling crescendo of pacing gamers experienced when playing the original Space Invaders arcade machine. This weekend, self-proclaimed C/C++ expert Zuhaitz reminded us that the adrenaline-pumping rising intensity of Taito's arcade classic was not due to genius-level coding. Rather, it was simply the fact that the underlying Intel 8080 could run the game code faster as aliens were wiped from the screen one by one, by the player dishing out laser missile death.

If you ever played Space Invaders you surely noticed that each time you killed an alien the game went faster.But, if you checked the source code from one of the arcade machines, you would find nothing related to this. That's because this mechanic is a hardware accident.The… pic.twitter.com/UkqTEUvC9IOctober 25, 2025

Intel's 8080 processor, launched in 1974, was the successor to the legendary 8008, enhanced with a more powerful and flexible architecture. However, with its ~5,000 transistors, 8/16-bit bus, and ~2.0 MHz clock speed, powering the original Space Invaders with 224 x 256 mono pixels was probably near the limits of its gaming capabilities. Hence, the impact on gameplay ‘feel' as the alien horde was eliminated by the player.

The processor-bottlenecked performance slowdown persisted, even though the CPU was aided by a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter in this cabinet design. Also, a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip was used for the iconic audio.

As Zuhaitz states in the above-linked Tweet, checking the original arcade game's source code confirms there is no code to adjust the game speed as aliens are wiped from the game.

At the beginning of the game, “changing the position, redrawing the sprites and checking for collisions for each one of the 55 aliens was really expensive,” notes the computer engineering prodigy. In a way this isn't just a bug becoming a feature, but for players of the original game this was a killer hook, and helped arcade machine owners liberate gamers of many shiny silvery quarters.

Space Invaders was launched by Taito in Japan in June 1978.

Later versions of the game, and emulators running on more modern, powerful platforms, would need mitigations to implement the ‘arcade perfect gameplay' the original was renowned for. Rewrites and reboots could achieve the correct balance of game pacing using code. However, as emulators like MAME became popular, allowing the running of original code ROMs, they would benefit from custom configurations that limit CPU/timing parameters to period- and architecture-correct levels.

After the U.S. women's national team's most underwhelming performance of her short tenure, head coach Emma Hayes remains optimistic ahead of Sunday's rematch against Portugal. She will use the opportunity to test more players and continue to evaluate her roster's depth with the 2027 Women's World Cup qualifiers still a year away.

Hayes hinted before the first Portugal match on Thursday that she intended to promote a player from the U-23 team, which was training alongside the senior squad in Chester, Pa. With Trinity Rodman and Sam Meza both sidelined by injuries, she added Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta earlier in the week, leaving one roster spot still open for that U-23 player. On Friday, Hayes gave the nod to Paris Saint-Germain center back Eva Gaetino.

“When I got the call, knowing that all of my work, all of my effort, all of the setbacks, everything was worth it, I was just speechless,” Gaetino told The Athletic. “I couldn't stop crying, honestly.”

The 22-year-old earned her first senior call-up from interim head coach Twila Kilgore in March 2024 for the SheBelieves Cup, but did not make it onto the field. She earned her first cap later that year in an October friendly against Argentina, starting and playing 70 minutes alongside Naomi Girma in the 3-0 win.

After those first call-ups, Gaetino returned to her club determined to put the feedback she received from the U.S. coaching staff into practice.

“There was definitely a learning curve, so I focused on locking down those details, especially as a center back defending higher up the pitch,” Gaetino said. “We like to keep teams pinned in and defend in a way that sets us up for attack. It's about improving defensively while maintaining our core principles and figuring out how to blend your own individual style into a system that makes us one of the best teams in the world.”

Center back is one of the positions that Hayes is currently examining, especially as previous starters Girma and Tierna Davidson remain out due to injury. Girma has had limited time with the U.S. after her January move to Chelsea due to calf injuries, and Davidson remains out this year with an ACL injury. In addition to adding Gaetino, Hayes also called in San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley to her first U.S. camp.

Before joining PSG, Gaetino was a first-team All-American and ACC Defensive Player of the Year for Notre Dame in her junior and senior years of college. She signed for PSG in January 2024, following fellow USWNT and Notre Dame teammate Korbin Shrader (Albert).

Last season, Gaetino earned regular minutes and featured in the UEFA Women's Champions League; however, since the firing of former head coach Fabrice Abriel, she has only started three games this season under the new coach Paulo César. In the offseason, Shrader also left the team, joining eight-time Champions League winner OL Lyonnes. During the difficult transition, Gaetino has looked to another USWNT player, Crystal Dunn, for help. Dunn joined PSG earlier this year, but has yet to feature for the team this season.

“She keeps me grounded. She keeps me sane. She's just an incredible person, an incredible player, and I just have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for her,” Gaetino said. “I'm still learning how to navigate life as a pro, and doing it in another country adds a layer of difficulty. But I've quickly realized it's really just a race, and the only true competition is against yourself.”

Hayes told reporters that Gaetino is “the most WNT-ready player in this U-23 group,” but that she won't likely start the young defender against Portugal.

“It's unrealistic to have a player that's not been training in this environment, not built connections in this environment, not even trained with the team yet to start a game … even if she's showing qualities in the right direction,” Hayes said. “I think performing at the under-23 (level) is one step for her to perform at this level. As I keep saying to all of our players, doing well for your club, being club class, is one thing. Being in the national class is another.”

The USWNT stumbled in a 2-1 loss against Portugal on Thursday, a reminder that consistency remains the squad's biggest challenge. Hayes will likely shuffle her line-up heading into Sunday's rematch at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn., before wrapping up the international window against New Zealand on Oct. 29 at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City.

“I want to learn these things now,” Hayes said. “I'd much rather have the situation that happened the other night happen now and learn what we learn, than do that in 12 months time. So let me be clear, learning never stops.”

Gaetino is just one part of a puzzle Hayes is trying to put together as she continues to assess players ahead of the 2027 Women's World Cup qualifiers next year, but she is ready to make her case.

“I am doing everything I can to get myself ready, so if my name is called, I can help the team out to the best of my ability,” Gaetino said. “We have a chip on our shoulder, and we're ready to prove who we are.”

The U.S. Women's National Team heads to East Hartford, Connecticut, this Sunday for a rematch against Portugal, carrying the rare sting of a defeat. Portugal stunned the USWNT 2-1 on Thursday, marking their first-ever win against the Americans.

For head coach Emma Hayes, this second friendly is a crucial test of her young squad's character and ability to respond to adversity. The USWNT was outmuscled and disjointed in the first clash, particularly vulnerable on set pieces—a definite area of focus for the coaching staff.

Portugal will be highly motivated to prove their win wasn't a fluke, banking on their organized defense and efficient counter-attacking. However, with the loss snapping the USWNT's unbeaten streak against them, expect a far more focused and aggressive performance from the Americans.

The match, which also honors Connecticut native and USWNT legend Alyssa Naeher, is a chance for the team to show progress in the early stages of their 2027 World Cup qualification cycle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Chelsea's interest in signing world-class defender confirmed","https://theprideoflondon.com/chelsea-interest-signing-world-class-defender-confirmed","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 02:07:01 GMT","

Chelsea's defensive issues have become abundantly clear this season. In the full-back areas, they do have quality talents in the form of Reece James and Marc Cucurella. But the central defensive pairing seems to be letting them down time and again. Against Sunderland, bringing on Tosin Adarabioyo for Josh Acheampong was a mistake and then paid for it with a late goal from the visitors to end up on the losing side.

Trevoh Chalobah has never really been considered a starting quality centre-back for Chelsea either. In fact, a year ago, the club were trying desperately to find him a new home. Yet, here we are, with him being the first-choice out of all the centre-backs at the club.

A large part of that is down to injuries to players like Levi Colwill and Benoit Badiashile. But at the same time, one cannot deny that Chelsea have filled their squad with plenty of mediocre talents as well. That might sound harsh but it is the truth.

They need some genuine quality at centre-back. And interestingly, it looks like a Bayern Munich regulr is on their radar.

Christian Falk has told CFBayern that Chelsea are interested in signing the Dayot Upamecano next summer for free. But the Frenchman is wanted by Real Madrid as well. 

So, signing Upamecano will not be easy. It remains to be seen if Chelsea can win the race and bring him to Stamford Bridge.

If they can't, they would have to look elsewhere. But one thing is clear, sooner or later, this ownership needs to start investing in some proven talents. At the moment, the club seem to be going in circles and it is not a successful one.

The entire transfer strategy seems to be based on succeeding in the future and not now. But when does this never-ending chase end, especially after spending more than a billion pounds? This might very well go down as the biggest failed experiment in football history if Chelsea are not careful.

World Cup

This is the 12th in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup.

Previously, we've looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962, an England success in 1966, another Brazil win in 1970, a second West Germany triumph in 1974, and Argentina's long-awaited win in 1978. In 1982, Italy matched Brazil's three World Cup wins, and this is how they did it.

Advertisement

One of the cliches about Italy going into every World Cup — if they qualify — is that they are ‘traditionally slow starters'.

But Italy had won their opening game of the 1966, 1970, 1974 and 1978 tournaments. In fact, in 1978, they started very strongly before tailing off. Really, the cliche stems from World Cup 1982 in Spain.

And it really was extreme. A goalless draw with Poland was followed by a flat 1-1 draw with Peru, and another unconvincing 1-1 draw against Cameroon, meaning Italy were fortunate to progress from the group stage on goals scored. At that point, the idea of them winning the World Cup was absurd.

But then, in the second group phase — consisting of four groups of three, in the first 24-team World Cup — Italy exploded into life despite a very tough draw, defeating holders Argentina and favourites Brazil.

When the knockout stage eventually arrived, they got past European opposition, in Poland and West Germany, with relative ease.

Italy were hugely unfancied going into the tournament, having only finished second in their qualification group behind Yugoslavia and losing to France and East Germany in friendlies. Bookmakers had them as 18-1 seventh-favourites amid serious questions over a couple of key players. World Soccer magazine considered that they “face the real threat of first round elimination” in its tournament preview.

West Germany and Brazil were considered the favourites, while Argentina were not merely defending champions, they'd also unearthed Diego Maradona, who was already being spoken about as the world's best player.

There have been major shocks in World Cup finals — 1950 and 1954 in particular — but considering the tournament hasn't produced anything like a Denmark 1992 or a Greece 2004, this is probably the World Cup's biggest underdog triumph, despite Italy's considerable footballing heritage.

In some ways, Enzo Bearzot was a classic Italy manager: a former international himself, a dedicated smoker, a tactician more than a coach. In other ways, he felt different: Bearzot was more of a father figure than an authoritarian, he gave his players a fair amount of freedom, and he liked attacking football, having been inspired by the Total Football of the previous decade.

Bearzot had worked for the Italian federation as under-23 manager and as assistant to both Ferruccio Valcareggi and Fulvio Bernardini, before taking charge in 1977. Italy's performance at World Cup 1978 and Euro 1980 on home soil was decent enough, but their sluggish form going into the tournament meant he was mercilessly mocked in the Italian press. He was criticised so heavily during the initial group phase that he imposed a complete media blackout for the rest of the competition, with him and his players simply refusing to speak to journalists.

That approach seemed to be successful, cultivating an ‘us against them' mentality. Italian journalists were forced to eat their words by the end of the tournament.

There is a slight irony in the fact that at a time when football was becoming concerned at the dominance of systems over the star power of individuals, this was actually the period in World Cup history where three straight tournaments were overwhelmingly dominated by one man. In 1978, it was Mario Kempes. In 1986 — spoiler alert — it was Maradona. And in 1982, it was Paolo Rossi, which had seemed highly unlikely going into the tournament.

Rossi was Italy's golden boy and had performed impressively at World Cup 1978, scoring three goals. But Rossi was involved in the Totonero match-fixing scandal, which came to light in 1980. He was handed a three-year ban, later reduced to two years on appeal. Rossi protested his innocence and claimed he was punished so strictly because of his prominent role in Italian football, to make an example.

He went two years without playing any football, although Juventus nevertheless signed him midway through his ban. He returned to play only three Serie A games before the World Cup, when Bearzot placed great faith in him. Rossi's rustiness was evident in the group stage, to the extent that he was substituted at half-time in the 1-1 draw with Peru. He didn't score against Argentina, either, and when Marco Tardelli played an inviting cutback to him early in the fifth game, against Brazil, he produced a complete air-kick. He was still goalless.

But then, out of nowhere, Rossi exploded into life when he firmly nodded home left-back Antonio Cabrini's cross. Brazil equalised through Socrates after a lovely flowing move.

Then Rossi pounced on Toninho Cerezo's wayward square pass (hugely reminiscent of Italy's consolation goal against the same opposition in the 1970 final) and fired home. Brazil equalised again, through Falcao's excellent strike.

But then, in the second phase of a corner kick, a scuffed shot found its way to Rossi, all alone — aside from team-mate Francesco Graziani. Both went for the ball. Rossi connected for his hat-trick goal.

After that, he couldn't stop scoring: he scored both goals in the 2-0 semi-final win over Poland, the first a sidefoot, the second a cushioned header, and then opened the scoring in the final. 3, 2, 1.

Rossi wasn't tall or powerful, and he didn't score spectacular goals. In fact, he wasn't obviously good at anything aside from that old knack of being in the right place at the right time.

Even accounting for his two-year ban, Rossi wasn't particularly prolific at club level either. The relatively meagre number of Serie A goals he scored is fitting: 82, as if to symbolise the year he won the World Cup, the World Cup Golden Boot, the World Cup Golden Ball, the Ballon d'Or, and World Player of the Year.

Bearzot was a more attack-minded coach than many of his predecessors, favouring a front three and a glorious playmaker in Fiorentina's Giancarlo Antognoni, who recovered from a fractured skull to be fit for the tournament.

Also notable was Bruno Conti on the right, in part because Italy so rarely produce outstanding wingers. He scored Italy's first goal of the tournament in the group stage, and while he briefly became notable for an incredible open goal miss against Cameroon, he shone in the latter stages, transforming his reputation from a workmanlike wide midfielder to a genuinely world-class attacker.

But in the Italian tradition, Bearzot was a flexible tactician who varied his approach from game to game, attempting to nullify the opponent's strengths. Perhaps that's why Italy looked so poor in the group stage against feeble opposition; they needed to be the underdogs.

Bearzot excelled against stronger sides. Against Argentina, he used an aggressive man-marking system with the terrifying Claudio Gentile playing a particularly fierce game to shackle Diego Maradona. Gentile committed six fouls in that game, all on Maradona. When he was booked against Brazil, too, he was suspended for the semi-final against Poland, so in came 18-year-old Giuseppe Bergomi, who performed well.

Therefore, Bearzot was faced with a dilemma about who to play in the final. But then it turned out Antognoni wouldn't be fit, having limped off with a badly gashed shin against Poland. Bearzot didn't select a replacement for Antognoni, instead playing both Gentile and Bergomi and switching to a system featuring five defenders in front of 40-year-old goalkeeper Dino Zoff, the side's captain.

Of course, had Italy failed to beat West Germany, it would have been considered typical Italian over-caution, but Bergomi nullified Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Gentile did a job on Pierre Littbarski, while the classy Gaetano Scirea swept up behind them and brought the ball forward into attack, including in the move for Italy's second goal. Scirea's class on the ball, to a certain extent, made up for Antognoni's absence.



Italy ran out convincing winners over West Germany in a final that was less thrilling than the 3-1 scoreline suggests.

West Germany seemed tired after their semi-final had gone to penalties — the first shootout in a World Cup — after a 3-3 draw with France. They had little support from most neutrals, partly because of Harald Schumacher's infamous challenge in that semi-final, and partly because of the way they and Austria engineered a mutually convenient result to both progress from the group stage — the infamous Disgrace of Gijon that resulted in FIFA changing the structure of future tournaments so the final group games were always played at the same time.

Advertisement

By half-time, though, you sensed it wasn't going to be Italy's day. Already without Antognoni, they then lost Graziani just seven minutes into the game, with his replacement Alessandro Altobelli struggling to get up to speed. They also missed a penalty when the otherwise faultless left-back Cabrini skewed wide after Conti had been brought down.

But Italy were always the better side. Rossi headed the opener from a Gentile cross that bounced up perfectly for him. Tardelli added the second — more on that shortly — before the brilliant Conti teed up Altobelli for the third. Paul Breitner scored a late consolation.

Oddly, considering the latter stages were really all about Rossi, it was Tardelli who stole the limelight for the most memorable moment of Italy's tournament.

His goal to put Italy 2-0 up in the final, ending a patient passing move by twisting onto his left foot and thumping the ball home, on the slide, was followed by one of football's most famous celebrations, with Tardelli sprinting to nowhere in particular, screaming ‘gol!'.

“I was born with that scream inside me,” he said later. “That was just the moment it came out.”

Considered a runner and a scrapper going into the tournament, similar to how Italy's current manager, Gennaro Gattuso, was spoken about in his playing days, this World Cup showed Tardelli offered technical quality, too, and he was probably the best player in the final.

The neutral's favourites were unquestionably Brazil, who played marvellous attack-minded football in a tournament largely lacking quality. The unfortunate striker Serginho was often blamed for their inability to win the tournament, but the real problem was the defence. They lost to Italy thanks to three Rossi goals, and on each occasion, it was due to a serious defensive lapse.

Their lack of quality at the back was obvious in 1970, but it didn't prove costly; now it did. The defeat by Italy, claimed Zico, was ‘the day football died'. But Brazil were fundamentally flawed, only keeping one clean sheet, against minnows New Zealand.

Granted, Italy only kept two clean sheets themselves, both against Poland. Still, Italy defeated the two South American giants impressively, and were comfortable in the semi-final and final. Ultimately, Italy were considered worthy winners.

			By: Author The Cancun Sun 

Posted on Published: October 26, 2025

CANCUN — As the world turns its eyes to North America for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a fascinating story is emerging, and it places the Mexican Caribbean at the very center of the action. While Cancun is not an official “host city” for any matches, it is strategically positioning itself to be the unofficial capital and primary logistical hub for the entire tournament.

This isn't just wishful thinking; it's a calculated plan backed by massive infrastructure and major official announcements. For soccer fans and regular travelers alike, this will transform the entire region for 2026. Here at The Cancun Sun, we're breaking down what's happening and what it means for your vacation.

The single biggest factor in Cancun's new role is its air connectivity. According to a recent announcement from Quintana Roo's Tourism Minister, Bernardo Cueto, Cancun International Airport (CUN) is the only airport in Mexico offering direct flights to all 16 official host cities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

This is a massive game-changer. It means Cancun will function as the perfect “home base” for tens of thousands of international fans. Travelers can base themselves at a luxurious all-inclusive resort, enjoy the beach and amenities, and then take easy, non-stop flights to watch their team play in Miami, Dallas, or Mexico City, all without the hassle of multiple connections.

This isn't just about the fans; it's about the players, too. In a huge vote of confidence, Governor Mara Lezama recently announced that two of the region's most renowned resorts—Fairmont Mayakoba and Moon Palace Cancun—have been officially chosen to accommodate national team delegations, including their coaching staff, families, and media personnel.

For the savvy traveler, this “stamp of approval” from FIFA is the ultimate review. It speaks volumes about the verified, world-class quality of these properties in three key areas:

Now, does this mean you'll be able to get a selfie with a superstar player at the swim-up bar? Almost certainly not. You can expect a large area of the resort to be privately cordoned off for the team's security. But the fact that you are staying at a property deemed worthy of a World Cup team is a powerful testament to its quality.

While no official “fan zone” has been announced yet, it is heavily expected. With millions of people traveling through Cancun and using it as a home base, the stage is set for a massive celebration.

It is highly anticipated that the Hotel Zone and downtown areas will host enormous, organized fan festivals, where visitors from all over the world can gather to watch the matches on massive screens, turning the entire destination into a non-stop party for a solid month.

This new role as a global hub reaffirms Cancun's leadership as a world-class destination. For travelers, it means two things:

COSTA RICA'S LEADING ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER

Our under-17 women's national team ended their FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup campaign on a tough note Friday evening, falling 3-1 to host nation Morocco in the final Group A match at Rabat's Olympic Stadium. The defeat eliminated us from the tournament, while Morocco advanced to the round of 16 for the first time in their history.

The game started with high stakes for both sides. Our team, coming off a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Brazil, needed a win to keep their knockout hopes alive as one of the best third-place teams. Morocco, winless in their first two matches, aimed to capitalize on home support to secure the points required for progression.

Morocco struck early. In the fourth minute, a mishandled clearance by goalkeeper Valeria Fernández allowed forward Mayssa Baha to slot home the opener from close range. The 14-year-old Baha, who emerged as the match's standout player, doubled the lead in the 39th minute from the penalty spot after Fernández fouled a Moroccan attacker inside the box.

Our team pushed back in the second half, creating several chances. They thought they had pulled one back in the 71st minute when Fabiana Alfaro found the net, but a VAR review ruled the goal off for an offside in the buildup. The setback proved costly. Just six minutes later, in the 77th minute, Alfaro inadvertently turned a Moroccan free kick into her own net, extending the hosts' lead to 3-0.

Our Ticas showed resilience late on. In the fifth minute of stoppage time, substitute Naima Moya scored a consolation goal with a well-placed shot, making the final score 3-1. Despite the late effort, it came too late to spark a comeback.

Our team controlled slightly more possession at 51 percent and outshot Morocco 10-9 overall, but the hosts were more clinical, registering six shots on target to our teams three. Yellow cards were shown to players on both sides, reflecting the competitive intensity, but no major disciplinary issues disrupted the flow.

This result left us at the bottom of Group A with one point from three matches, having scored just three goals while conceding seven. Their tournament journey mirrored previous World Cup appearances, where the team struggled to convert opportunities into wins. Coach Édgar Rodríguez's squad, featuring young talents like captain Priscilla Rodríguez and forward Sharon Umaña, gained valuable experience but will return home reflecting on defensive lapses that proved decisive.

For Morocco, the victory marked a milestone. Finishing third in the group with three points, they qualified as one of the four best third-place teams across the tournament's six groups. The win also made them the first host nation to reach the knockout stage in the history of the U-17 Women's World Cup. Baha's brace highlighted her potential, as she led the attack with composure beyond her years.

The 2025 edition, expanded to 24 teams and hosted in Morocco from October 17 to November 8, has showcased emerging talent from around the globe. In the other Group A fixture, Italy defeated Brazil 4-3, confirming the top two spots. Morocco now awaits their round of 16 opponent, set to face Group B winners North Korea.

Our players leave with heads held high after competing against strong opposition, including former champions Brazil and Italy. The experience positions them well for future qualifiers, as the federation continues to build its women's program. Back here in San José, our fans will look ahead to the next cycle, hoping for breakthroughs in youth development.

As Marcus Rashford prepares to face Real Madrid as Barcelona's most productive player this season, fresh from scoring two classy goals against Olympiacos in the Champions League, it is worth remembering that the striker was mocked in some quarters for having the audacity to think he could even play for the Blaugrana after two disappointing seasons, let alone rip it up for them.

Former Manchester United forward Teddy Sheringham said Rashford ""didn't deserve to make the step up"" to Barca after leaving Old Trafford. European football pundit Gabriele Marcotti told Rashford to ""get a grip of where you are right now"" and laughed at his entourage's trip to Barcelona last May to try to persuade the Catalans to sign him. 

No-one is laughing now though. Rashford not only got his move, he has convinced the doubters in England and the sceptics in Spain.

Our expert offers his best Arsenal vs Crystal Palace predictions for their Premier League clash at the Emirates this afternoon (26/10/2025)

Our betting expert expects a tougher fixture for Arsenal, but with home advantage to help secure maximum points.

The hosts have been flying since the start of the season, and that momentum will take some stopping. That solitary defeat to Liverpool seems like a lifetime ago, as they've gone nine games unbeaten since then. They enter this fixture on the back of six wins in all competitions. 

Palace, meanwhile, were winless in their previous two games, not considering their Thursday fixture against Larnaca. The Eagles' recent record against the Gunners isn't encouraging, especially since their previous away win against this opponent came in 2019. Glasner has never beaten Arsenal in three attempts, so his barren run here may continue. 

The hosts won six of the last seven head-to-heads and were victorious in four of the last five meetings with Palace at the Emirates. Considering the quality that Arsenal have both in the starting 11 and on the bench, the visitors may not be able to resist defeat. 

The hallmark of Arteta's Arsenal this season has been their defence, the same as last term. With 12 games played across all competitions, the Gunners have only conceded three goals. That's a goal every four games, a staggering statistic that highlights their strong defence. 

Despite that run, and their four-game clean sheet sequence heading into this weekend, Palace can get some joy here. Both teams found the back of the net in each of the last three head-to-heads, including both league fixtures last term. 

Not considering their Thursday fixture, Palace have scored 10 goals in their previous five games. With Jean-Philippe Mateta netting a hat-trick last weekend, he will be in the mood to worry the home defence. 

Eberechi Eze joined Arsenal from Crystal Palace during this season's transfer window. He has been incredible since moving to North London, but he has been unlucky with not getting enough goals under his belt. 

Eze hit the bar on Tuesday night against Atletico Madrid, but he did manage an assist. He has yet to open his Premier League account for Arsenal, which makes it almost inevitable that he'll find the net against his former club. 

After a long time, both the media and fans are starting to believe that Arsenal are serious contenders on multiple fronts. One of the reasons behind this is their form this season, and the other is the incredible strength in depth they possess.

Mikel Arteta's men sit atop the Premier League table, hoping they can end their 22-year wait for the title. With just one defeat in the entire season, they are poised for a proper challenge, but seeing off sides like Crystal Palace is a must.

Last season, Arsenal's pursuit of Liverpool capitulated towards the end of the campaign. Palace were one of those teams to snatch a 2-2 draw at the Emirates Stadium and derail the North Londoners' title hopes.

Oliver Glasner has been a breath of fresh air since hopping into the hot seat at Palace. He's already delivered the FA Cup and guided his side to European football for the first time in their history.

They've been off to a positive start in the Conference League, and recently owned the longest undefeated streak across Europe's top five leagues. Everton unceremoniously put an end to that and halted the run at 19 games.

The Eagles will have their work cut out here, especially after playing on Thursday night, compared to Arsenal, who last competed on Tuesday.

Arsenal expected lineup: Raya, Timber, Saliba, Magalhaes, Calafiori, Zubimendi, Rice, Eze, Saka, Trossard, Gyokeres

Crystal Palace expected lineup: Henderson, Richards, Lacroix, Guehi, Munoz, Kamada, Wharton, Mitchell, Sarr, Pino, Mateta","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 Jannik Sinner cut through cramp to reassert his indoor dominance Sunday at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna. 

 The top seed at the ATP 500 rallied past Alexander Zverev 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 to recapture the title at an event where he previously triumphed in 2023. Sinner dug deep to overcome an impressive start from Zverev and also shook off physical struggles in the first and third sets to cap a two-hour, 29-minute victory and seal his 21st tour-level crown.

 “It feels amazing;” said Sinner, who is now on a 21-match winning streak on indoor hard courts. “It was such a difficult start in this final for me. I went a break down, had some chances in the first set but couldn't use them. He was serving very well, but I just tried to stick there mentally and play my best tennis when it came. 

 “The third set was a bit of a rollercoaster, but I was feeling the ball very well at times, so I tried to push and I'm very happy of course to win another title. It's very special.” 

 Zverev struck the ball cleanly off both wings in the early stages and had already earned the opening break in the fourth game when Sinner began to move gingerly and limp in between points, evoking memories of the Italian's retirement due to cramp in Shanghai earlier this month. Zverev, himself a former champion in Vienna (2021), closed out the set, but the World No. 2 Sinner appeared to have soon shaken off his physical issue with a classy second-set display. 

 However, the Italian then seemingly began to struggle with cramp in his left hamstring during the seventh game of the third set, just as his eighth tour-level meeting with Zverev reached its crescendo. Yet via a combination of drinking pickle juice at changeovers and upping the aggression in his game to shorten the rallies, Sinner continued to pile the pressure on his opponent. 

 Watch Zverev find fortune, to Sinner's amusement, in Vienna final third set: 

 The Italian clinched a decisive break for 6-5 in the third set after winning a lung-busting baseline exchange when Zverev pushed a backhand long. He soon served out to clinch his fourth title of the season, level his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Zverev at 4-4, and join Roger Federer and Andy Murray as ATP No. 1 Club members to have triumphed twice in Vienna. 

 “It was very difficult of course,” said Sinner of his third-set physical struggle. “The most important thing was to not give up and try to stay there. Try to see what the situation was. I just tried to make the right choices at the right time. I think that was the key today. Serving well and saving energy in my service games was important too.”

 Sinner produced some scintillating tennis across his run in Austria, where he did not drop a set prior to the final. Now 48-6 for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, the 24-year-old will be full of confidence as he prepares to end his 2025 season at the Rolex Paris Masters and the Nitto ATP Finals. 

 Zverev, who on Friday joined Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic in qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals, was chasing his first win against a Top 5 rival in 2025. The German will now head to Paris third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, having leapfrogged Djokovic with his Vienna run.

Lorenzo Musetti's Vienna run ended in the semi-finals on Saturday against Alexander Zverev, but the Italian's showing still leaves him in a strong position to qualify for his Nitto ATP Finals debut. Musetti increased his lead in eighth place in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin to 440 points ahead of Felix Auger-Aliassime and could seal his place in the season finale with a strong week at the Rolex Paris Masters.

With Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Zverev and Novak Djokovic already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, four spots are still up for grabs in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Alex de Minaur and Musetti currently occupy those positions, with Auger-Aliassime, Casper Ruud and Daniil Medvedev leading the chasing pack. Players have two more weeks to rack up points, with a pair of ATP 250s in Athens and Metz to follow Paris.

Musetti is bidding to join defending champion Sinner on home soil in Turin. In addition to the personal history of his Nitto ATP Finals debut, Musetti would also make Italian history if he can qualify: Never before have two Italian singles players qualified for the season finale in the same year. In 2021, Matteo Berrettini qualified, then withdrew after one match due to an injury. Sinner, an alternate, replaced him.

In Paris, Musetti will open his campaign against countryman Lorenzo Sonego or a qualifier. He could face Medvedev in the third round.

PIF ATP Live Race To Turin (entering Paris) 




Shelton, also seeking his Turin debut, will face Flavio Cobolli or Tomas Machac in his opening match, with Andrey Rublev a potential third-round opponent. Fritz, a Turin semi-finalist in 2022 and finalist in 2024, seeks his third Nitto ATP Finals appearance. If both qualify, it would mark the first time two Americans qualify for the year-end event since Andy Roddick and James Blake both competed in 2006.

De Minaur is hoping to return to Turin for the second consecutive season. Like Musetti, the Aussie bolstered his position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin with a semi-final showing this week. Sinner ended his run in Vienna on Saturday.

Fritz and De Minaur could meet in a pivotal quarter-final in the top half of the draw, with both players pushing for qualification. They have split 10 previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings.



With 1,000 PIF ATP Ranking points on offer in Paris, Auger-Aliassime and Ruud could both move into the top eight with the title. Medvedev, the 2020 champion at the season finale, would need further points in Athens or Metz to find a way into the top eight and extend his streak of consecutive Nitto ATP Finals to seven.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, currently on 2,585 points, could pass Medvedev for 12th by beating Joao Fonseca in Sunday's Basel final. That would put the Spaniard on 2,755 points, 990 points behind Musetti.

Belinda Bencic won the Toray Pan Pacific Open on Sunday in Tokyo, defeating 20-year-old Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes for a milestone 10th career title and second of the season. The win comes 10 years after she lost in the final as an 18-year-old, and this time, entering as the more experienced player paid dividends. Meanwhile, the duo of Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani claimed their fourth doubles title of 2025.

Belinda Bencic entered Sunday's Toray Pan Pacific Open final at a clear disadvantage. 

Tokyo: Scores | Draw | Order of play

Her opponent, 20-year-old Linda Noskova, had spent just 35 minutes on court across the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds in Tokyo, advancing via a retirement and a walkover. Bencic, meanwhile, logged 5 hours and 23 minutes over the previous two days, battling through back-to-back three-set matches. Her quarterfinal win over Karolina Muchova required a comeback from a set down and saw her save a match point.

None of that mattered in the final. The 28-year-old Bencic defeated Noskova 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes to claim redemption for her loss in the final of the very same tournament 10 years ago.

A former Olympic gold medalist -- also won in Tokyo -- Bencic now climbs to No. 11 in the PIF WTA Rankings, putting her back on the cusp of the top 10.

“It was wonderful playing in front of you guys,” Bencic said after the match. “The last time I won here was the Tokyo Olympics when it was an empty stadium, so it was a completely different atmosphere, but it was great to play in front of you guys. I love to play in Japan, so I'm super happy to finally win this tournament.”

The victory marks Bencic's second title of the season and a milestone 10th of her career. It's also the second time in three years she has won multiple titles in a season to bookend her absence from the WTA Tour.

Road to the title: Seeing Bencic hoist the trophy shows that the road less traveled isn't always the best path.

After a first-round bye and a routine second-round win over Varvara Gracheva, Bencic's path intensified. She narrowly defeated Muchova 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 in a three-hour battle that saw her save a match point, then outlasted last year's runner-up Sofia Kenin in 2 hours and 15 minutes to reach the final.

Though the scoreline in the final appeared straightforward, Bencic overcame a series of challenges to secure the title.

Experience pays off: Relatively inexperienced in her first Tokyo final a decade ago, Bencic's experience proved decisive against the younger Noskova.

She saved all 10 break points she faced, including seven in the second set. But the first three came in the opening game. After Noskova fired two big winners to earn the first break point, Bencic responded with a body serve that caught the Czech off guard, forcing her to swat an error into the net.

The gritty six-minute hold that ensued, which saw Bencic save two more break points, set the tone. Bencic, battle-tested from earlier rounds, dragged Noskova into a physical contest. Noskova, who hadn't faced pressure since trailing by a set in the second round to McCartney Kessler, struggled to match her opponent's intensity.

From there, Bencic held serve with ease and broke Noskova twice to close out the first set in 32 minutes.

After trading holds to reach 2-2 in the second set, the fifth game proved pivotal. Once again, Bencic's experience, and Noskova's lack of it, made the difference.

Bencic stayed composed, refusing to let the physical and mental toll force her into errors. On the first four break points faced at 2-2, she waited for Noskova to overhit, which she did each time. Bencic then brushed aside the fifth break point of the game with an ace and held for a 3-2 lead.

Noskova managed one final hold at 3-3, but Bencic converted a break before serving out the match, sealing victory with a forehand winner. Her celebratory scream felt like a release a decade in the making.

BENCIC WINS IN TOKYO! 👏She beats Noskova 6-2, 6-3 to pick up a 10th career title 🤩@BelindaBencic | #TorayPPO pic.twitter.com/NP0jtfELT0

By the numbers: Her final winner was one of 23 that Bencic hit during the match compared to just 13 unforced errors. Noskova actually tallied more winners, with 28, but was undone by 37 unforced errors, many in key moments.

Other than that, the biggest statistical gaps came on each player's first-serve effectiveness and their ability to convert their break opportunities. Noskova created more chances but went 0-for-10 on break points, while Bencic converted 3 of 6.

To further highlight her clean, more efficient brand of tennis in Sunday's final, Bencic landed 68% of her first serves and won nearly 79% of those points. Noskova, while stronger on her second serve, placed just under 63% of her first serves and won fewer than 60% of those points -- well below her season average of 70%.

A bright future: While it wasn't the ending Noskova likely envisioned, the 2025 season showed plenty of promise for the 20-year-old in just her third full season on tour. She'll finish the year having just reached her career-high ranking at No. 13 in the world and as the top-ranked Czech player, ahead of Muchova, Marketa Vondrousova and Barbora Krejcikova.

Despite getting the better of her Sunday, Bencic sees big things in Noskova's future.

“You are a wonderful player, and for sure you will win many titles,” Bencic said during the trophy presentation. “It was an honor to share the court with you. You play very beautiful (tennis).”

In Sunday's doubles final, No. 4 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani defeated No. 3 seeds Anna Danilina and Alexsandra Krunic in straight sets, winning 6-1, 6-4 in 1 hour and 12 minutes to close out the week in Tokyo.

It's the fourth title of the season for the duo, who recently clinched a spot in the WTA Finals in Riyadh and will move up to No. 15 and No. 16, respectively, in the PIF WTA Doubles Rankings.

For Babos, a four-time Grand Slam champion, it's the 29th WTA doubles title of her career as she continues to inch closer to the big 3-0 mark. For Stefani, it's career title No. 13.

Belinda Bencic won the Toray Pan Pacific Open on Sunday in Tokyo, defeating 20-year-old Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes for a milestone 10th career title and second of the season. The win comes 10 years after she lost in the final as an 18-year-old, and this time, entering as the more experienced player paid dividends. Meanwhile, the duo of Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani claimed their fourth doubles title of 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Fonseca will face another Spaniard in Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in Sunday's title match. The No. 8 seed advanced after Ugo Humbert retired in the second set of their semifinal, trailing 7-6 (4), 3-1, due to a lower back injury. It marked Davidovich Fokina's second consecutive win via retirement following No. 4 seed Casper Ruud's withdrawal in the quarterfinals with an ankle issue after losing the first set 7-6 (1).Davidovich Fokina, seeking his first ATP title, has finished runner-up in all four of his previous final appearances. Fonseca, meanwhile, will be bidding for his second career title and first above the ATP 250 level, having won his maiden trophy in Buenos Aires earlier this season.

The teenager's path to the Basel final included a win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, a walkover against No. 7 seed Jakub Mensik, and a quarterfinal victory after No. 9 seed Denis Shapovalov retired with a knee injury while trailing 3-6, 6-3, 4-1.No matter the result on Sunday, Fonseca is guaranteed a new career-high ranking, projected to rise to at least No. 34 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.“It's been an amazing year, starting at No. 130 in the world, now 40-something and into a first ATP 500 final,” Fonseca said.“We didn't go to Asia this year, I was a little bit sick.

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams on race day at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Lando Norris has looked unstoppable this weekend, with a mesmeric final lap in Q3 giving him pole by a healthy margin.

What will doubtless please him even more – though he's far too diplomatic to say it – is that the three cars behind him are red and silver, rather than blue and orange. Ferrari are second and third, with George Russell fourth, before Max Verstappen, struggling for grip, appears in fifth, one row ahead of Championship leader Oscar Piastri, who will start seventh.

But this isn't a race that's won on Saturday. Pirelli have bridged their tyre compounds to produce some intriguing strategy options, and Mexico City has a history of throwing its own brand of mayhem into the works. We're in for quite a race.

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

Max Verstappen will line up in fifth for the Mexico City Grand Prix on a weekend that has not been straightforward for the Red Bull driver so far.

Max Verstappen is anticipating a “difficult” race from P5 on the grid at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the Dutchman admitting that the “whole weekend has been tough” so far at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Despite topping the timesheets during Friday's second practice hour, Verstappen raised concerns about Red Bull's pace in the long runs, the reigning World Champion suggesting that everything other than the squad's short run performance was “pretty bad”.

The car again looked tricky to handle at times during Saturday and Verstappen ultimately claimed fifth place in Qualifying, with his lap of 1m 16.070s nearly half a second off that set by polesitter Lando Norris.

“We tried a lot of stuff,” Verstappen reflected after the session. “Even going into Qualifying, I guess we got it a little bit wrong in some areas of the track. You only need to look at the onboard and you see enough – it's just difficult.

“All weekend we couldn't find the grip in the car, so that's something that we need to understand because in Qualifying when you have those kinds of issues you are sliding a lot, and on a track like this you cannot afford that.”

Pushed on whether any changes had been made to his RB21 overnight following Friday's issues, the 28-year-old answered: “I mean, big enough to normally see a difference, which we have seen in the last few weekends – if you make a change it shows something, but this whole weekend has been tough.”

Given the struggles with race pace that he flagged earlier in the weekend, Verstappen is expecting Sunday's Grand Prix to be a challenging one as he prepares to line up behind the McLaren of Norris, the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton plus Mercedes' George Russell.

“It's going to be difficult,” he explained. “It's going to be warm, it's going to be tough on tyres. You need a good balance – I don't think we have that.

“But we'll see what we can do, I'm not really expecting to be in a battle ahead of me – they're miles faster. It's more with the people around me, I guess.”

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

The drivers and team report back on final practice and Qualifying for the Mexico City Grand Prix from the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Norris topped FP3 in style, going over three tenths clear of the field despite this being a relatively short track. That set him up for a tilt at pole and he duly delivered on his last lap, knowing full well he had the Ferrari cars breathing down his neck. He pulled out a special flying run to grab a first pole since Belgium. Piastri has struggled all weekend by comparison and today was no different, as he wound up a good few tenths back time and time again. He scraped into Q3, but was nowhere near the front, qualifying eighth. He inherits one place when Sainz serves his grid penalty, which will be scant consolation.

Oscar Piastri, 8th, 1:16.174

""Not the Qualifying I was after. I've been struggling for pace this weekend, and that continued into this session. It's a long run to Turn 1 tomorrow, so let's see what we can learn this evening and what we can do to unlock the pace.”

Lando Norris, 1st, 1:1.586

""Pole position! I'm very pleased with that. It was a great final lap; it felt very natural, and to come out with Pole by that margin is a very good feeling. We've still got a lot of work to do tomorrow, so we'll get our heads down this evening and get ourselves ready for the race.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“It's very satisfying for the team to be back on Pole position today. In the last few races, we haven't extracted the full performance potential from the car, but after regrouping and improving our understanding of the car, we are now back to being the reference point for the rest of the grid, at least here in Mexico City.

“It was a well-deserved Pole position lap from Lando, where he extracted maximum performance, reiterating that we have a strong car which behaved well in the conditions today.

“There is a little bit of work to do on Oscar's side with some sliding in corners like we saw in Austin. This is something the team will review overnight and look to improve ahead of tomorrow.

“Looking ahead to the Grand Prix, our race pace looks strong, which should help Oscar recover positions throughout. We will also focus on giving Lando a clean start as we look to maximise our points in Mexico City.”

Ferrari have looked quick from word go here, crucially with both cars. Their drivers both arrived in Q3 with two fresh sets of soft tyres, and put them to good use. Leclerc grabbed provisional pole on the first runs with a staggering improvement, but had no answer to the pace of Norris second time around. He was pleased with his lap and with P2, and Hamilton backed him up with his best Grand Prix Qualifying of the year. And the best news is with such a long drag to Turn 1, there is every chance a Ferrari could be in the lead on the first lap tomorrow.

Charles Leclerc, 2nd, 1:15.848

""The car has been really good today and over the course of this weekend. On a track like this with such low grip, even the smallest of mistakes is costly though. I'm happy with both of my laps in Q3. The temperatures dropped slightly, which helped to improve the grip and the car reacted well.

""The race start will be our opportunity to try and get alongside Lando and take the lead. It would mean a lot to the whole team to secure a victory, so I will do everything to bring it home.""

Lewis Hamilton, 3rd, 1:15.938

""I'm really happy to be up here in the top three alongside Charles, it's a great result for the team and one they truly deserve. We haven't brought any upgrades this weekend, so the focus has been on improving our processes and extracting everything we can from the car. That approach is what made the difference today. Qualifying in third has put me in a good position to really fight tomorrow and I'll be giving it everything I can to build on the good momentum we've had so far this weekend. Grazie a tutti: the tifosi, the team here at the track and everyone back at home.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""It's our best qualifying since the early part of the season and this one is particularly good as we were there right from Q1 and it's very important to have Charles on the front row tomorrow. It is also important that Lewis is near the front as it is gives us more possibilities in terms of strategy.

""Our pace was decent in the last couple of races but we struggled to put everything together, while this weekend we have done a good job from the start on Friday. When you start off on the right foot, it is far easier to fine tune everything as the weekend goes on. In qualifying, with Charles we only ran one set of new tyres in Q1 and again one in Q2, while except for Lando, the others used two. It was always our plan to save one set of Softs for tomorrow.

""Can we win tomorrow? A lot will depend on the start and it's a long run off the grid to Turn 1. The key will be the ability to run in clean air.""

Antonelli continued to impress on Saturday, the youngster seemingly comfortable at this track. So it was a surprise when he barely scraped through to Q2, after completely losing his rhythm at the start of Qualifying. Fortunately things improved from there, with both drivers putting in solid efforts in Q3. Russell is a danger from P4, but will have his work cut out with Verstappen behind while Antonelli is poised to also score good points for the Silver Arrows.

George Russell, 4th, 1:16.034

""I am reasonably happy with how qualifying went today. On pure single lap pace, Lando (Norris) and both Ferraris seemed to have a step on us, so the next best possible position was P4. That's exactly where we ended up. It was all very close out there; Piastri was just one tenth behind me and he was P8. Being ahead of both him and Verstappen gives us a good chance of fighting for the podium in tomorrow's race.

""It's a long run to turn one, and it will be a long race after that, so let's see what we can do. We have both Ferraris ahead of us on the grid and, given how close the fight is for second in the Constructors' Championship, getting in the mix with them tomorrow is crucial. We had decent long run pace on Friday and hopefully we can deploy that tomorrow.""

Kimi Antonelli, 6th, 1:16.118

""I had a scrappy Q1 and was struggling to find my rhythm. That put me in a slightly unfavourable position for the rest of qualifying, needing to improve on my last laps in both Q1 and Q2. I managed to improve as qualifying went on though and Q3 was my cleanest session. P6 and being only a few tenths off the front-row, wasn't a bad result in the end.

""Tomorrow should be a great fight. There are plenty ofunknowns going into the race and all three compounds look like they could be useful tyres. The start, given the long run to turn one, is going to be very important. If we can get away well, we can then hopefully put ourselves in a positive position to fight for positions ahead. That's going to be key with both Ferraris lining up ahead of us.""

Bradley Lord, Team Representative

""This season has been one of fine margins in the battle between the top four teams, and those margins become even finer on a short circuit like this one. We have been in and around the top four all weekend, with both drivers, but it was clear from FP3 that, barring an unusual event, Norris was favourite for pole position. P4 for George and P6 for Kimi are therefore solid results this afternoon, albeit with the feeling that there was more time to find with both cars.

""George had a smooth session but never quite felt he had the car and tyres under him at the right time to challenge for the front row, while Kimi had a nervous start to the session - only just escaping Q1 - but then showed good composure to finish P6, under a tenth behind George.

""We're starting right in the middle of the pack of teams fighting for P2 in the Constructors' Championship and bookended by the top two drivers in the standings. The run to turn one here in Mexico is always frantic and it feels like there's even more at stake than usual tomorrow. All three compounds look like viable race tyres, so we may see some variation across the field, too. Although degradation levels were high yesterday, as we often see at this circuit, the start and pit stops will likely play a disproportionate role in determining the race outcome as we have seen at recent events. We will be working hard to ensure we make the most of those opportunities tomorrow with both cars.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""We can't be overly pleased with P4 and P6 today. The tyres always seem to be a bit fickle on a single lap at this track and that was very much the case today. Kimi had a very tricky start to his session, rather too close to the cutoff for comfort in Q1 and Q2 but he did a solid job of gathering it together for the final runs. He lost a bit of time in the final sector and, had it not been for this, he could have ended up P5. George had a slightly easier journey through to the final session, managing to save two sets of the soft tyres but struggled to switch them on with the cooling track. His second attempt was stronger, but it seemed with the track conditions in Q3, we were at best the third quickest team today.

""We'd have liked to be starting a bit higher up but there are always position changes at the start due to long run down to turn one so, providing we can avoid the usual dramas and emerge in good positions, we should still be able to have a good race. The battle for second in the Constructors' Championship is finely balanced and, with two Ferraris starting ahead of us tomorrow, we know we need take advantage of every opportunity we can create.""

Verstappen could not extract the same pace from the RB21 that he managed in FP2 yesterday. He dropped down the order in final practice, and likewise in Qualifying. The Dutchman was fighting his car at certain points on the track, both understeer and oversteer combining to make the RB21 a real handful out there. In the end he was fifth, and has work to do to close the gap to his Championship rival. Tsunoda looked in the mix for the top 10, but just fell short although he also inherits a place courtesy of Sainz's grid drop.

Max Verstappen, 5th, 1:16.070

“We tried a lot of things on the car but unfortunately in Qualifying it just didn't really come together. It wasn't for lack of trying: in some areas we had improved and in some it was worse which overall just made it very difficult to drive. Unfortunately, the balance was unpredictable and we couldn't push and were sliding a lot more, which on a track like this isn't good. We just had no grip and not enough pace and the weekend hasn't really been that good for us. For the long runs tomorrow, it is very difficult to say but I'm not expecting it to be miles better than the one lap pace and it will be difficult to overtake. I'll try to do the best I can, I think it will be quite spicy with the cars ahead and it will be warm and tough on tyres. The most important thing will be to stay out of trouble as it is a very long race. We will try to do the best that we can and maximise everything possible.”

Yuki Tsunoda, 11th, 1:16.816

""As it's been for most of the season the gap between Q2 and Q3 has been so tight, so it's unfortunate to be on the other end and miss out by such a small margin. I've felt good in the car this weekend, but we just didn't have the grip in Qualifying that we had hoped for, and in a field like this you sometimes lose out. I had a clean session and I always try and take the positives as tomorrow will bring new opportunities where the long run has seemed good. I stayed close to Max's delta and that's a good sign as that's always been the target for me in this Team. I'll start P10, so with maximum focus from the start we can try and push through and score some good points for the Constructors' as we're still in that fight for P2.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“It is fair to say we didn't quite manage to put the car in the sweet spot so far this weekend. Certainty with Max, you have heard he has been very vocal that he has not been able to push in the way he likes. We tried many things, but we couldn't quite find a way to give him a car he could push with. With the level of the competition around you, then you pay the price straight away if you are not in your window. A lot of our attention overnight went on trying to see if we could improve the race pace and we committed time to that in the session this morning. If this is what has exposed us in the short run today, it is difficult to say right now, we will get the answer after the race. It is all part of the game, we learn and it is still a very long race to go tomorrow. All our competitors are around us, a lot can happen here and I am sure it won't be a boring race! Yuki had similar struggles to Max and couldn't quite get the grip, which meant his Qualifying didn't quite come together, but he starts in P10 tomorrow and can still play a pivotal part in the fight for us and pick up strong points.”

Williams had a very difficult FP3 session, with both drivers struggling to keep their car on track. Albon was the more vocal of the two, and his issues continued into Qualifying as he exited at the first time of asking, citing a brake problem. Sainz though managed to extract all the pace the car had to offer in qualifying not just in the top 10, but ahead of a McLaren. Unfortunately, he will drop backwards once his grid penalty earned last time out in Austin is applied.

Alex Albon, 17th, 1:17.490

""The conditions were very different between sessions, and I had a lot less grip in qualifying than in FP3. We've been chasing the feel of the car all weekend, never feeling totally comfortable or hitting our stride. I felt like the track got away from me in qualifying and we were sliding around a lot today, I never really found the grip that I needed. We fixed some things ahead of qualifying, but were also dealing with a potential issue with the brakes, so there's a lot to analyse and debrief as a team to see what we can do to improve. It's usually one-stop racing here in Mexico so we'll see what happens tomorrow and hopefully we can finish the weekend stronger than we started.""

Carlos Sainz, 7th, 1:16.172

""That was probably my best qualifying lap of the season. I'm enjoying the feeling in the car and today we executed a very solid qualifying. We'll take the positives and refocus on tomorrow. It's a shame we have to serve that penalty as it will definitely make our race tougher with the dirty air and the cooling. However, I have confidence in my race pace and we'll do all we can to fight back into the points. I also want to say thank you to the fans here; their support is truly something special and it's incredible to drive around this circuit listening to all their cheers!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""What a fantastic lap from Carlos to qualify P7 on the grid and ahead of a McLaren, which is an extraordinary effort. Well done. With Alex, there is great performance in him, which we've seen across the session. However, for whatever reason, during our last run in qualifying, we didn't have the grip in the tyres and couldn't get them working. I'm confident we'll see Alex back tomorrow fighting in the front and taking advantage of the long opening straight from where we are starting on the grid. Looking ahead to the race, it's the longest run down to turn one of any circuit of the season, so it always creates good opportunities and some fireworks.""

It was a mixed bag for Racing Bulls in Mexico City. Both drivers looked very quick at the start of Qualifying, leading to hopes of two berths in Q3. But Lawson ran wide on his first flying run in Q2, leaving the pressure on. He made a mistake on his second run and abandoned his third to exit without setting a representative time. Hadjar though made it to the top 10 shootout, which atoned for his Q1 crash in Austin last weekend.

Isack Hadjar, 9th, 1:16.252

""I'm very happy about my team and the way we bounced back from yesterday. We worked really hard overnight, making some changes to the car and we went in the right direction. It definitely paid off as it helped us get into Q3 today. I think I did a decent job in terms of driving, I felt like I was on it straight away in Q1, but then we went a bit over the limit before doing a good final lap. Tomorrow I really want to fight to come back into the points after a difficult weekend we had in Austin. There are several different scenarios that can happen in Turn 1 since it's quite far away from the grid, so we have to take every opportunity that might present.”

Liam Lawson, 15th, 1:18.072

""The car was fast today and we had a strong Q1. In Q2, I struggled with the balance and a mistake on the first lap made the rest of the session quite tricky. The second lap wasn't very strong, so the team decided to abort and use a used tyre at the end. We ended up even slower, so it's something we'll be reviewing. It will be tough given where we're starting from tomorrow, but we'll be working hard as a team to push for points.”

Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance

“After a difficult Friday, we made several changes on the car setup from data analysis and simulator running, which have seemed to have worked well. Q1 was intense with the entire field within less than one second of lap time. We decided to offset ourselves to avoid traffic, and it appeared to pay off. The same approach in Q2 was riskier as we were missing the last bits of track evolution, but Isack managed to get through. Unfortunately, Liam made a mistake in T4 of his first Q2 attempt; in his second lap he wasn't improving so we decided to abort and try again, but his tyres were already dropping in performance. Luckily Isack managed to secure the ninth place in Q3, which rewards a solid session from him and the team. The race strategy looks quite defined with most of the cars on the same tyre allocation. The race start is critical here with the long run down to T1, so we will push on both drivers to train their launch procedure in the morning.”

Haas found some overnight improvements in Mexico City, with Bearman always looking the pick of their two drivers. He impressed hugely in Q1, regularly putting his car in the mix right at the very front. The rookie made Q3 for the third straight weekend, Haas having unlocked some more pace in their car of late, helped by that upgrade package from Austin. Ocon couldn't quite match Bearman, but will inherit a place when Sainz serves his penalty.

Esteban Ocon, 12th, 1:16.837

“Well done to the team because we've clearly improved the qualifying pace that I was struggling with recently. It's been a strong session in terms of car feeling, so I'm happy with that. It's very unfortunate to miss out on Q3. It was the last lap of Q2 really, we had the pace, and we were P5 heading into the run, but it just wasn't a great lap as I was in the dirty air of Tsunoda and Leclerc. They didn't do anything wrong, but it was just a case of the wrong place, wrong time, as I was in that dirty air and lost the rear into the last sector. Three hundredths is what we needed to get into Q3, and I think we could've gone P5 if I was able to continue to put in the sector times I was putting in before.”

Oliver Bearman, 10th, 1:16.460

“Overall, I'm happy. I think we optimized the package that we had today, and I'm super happy with that lap. Being the first car out on track is not ideal, but then again, we were missing a bit of lap time to be fighting for anything other than P9 or P10. I feel good about tomorrow, as with the pace that we showed on high-fuel yesterday – I feel confident, as that was the good part of yesterday. I'm really looking forward to the race tomorrow.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“FP3 was pretty smooth, and both drivers did a really good job. In qualifying, we were so close to getting both Ollie and Esteban into Q3, but Esteban missed it by three hundredths – with his lap being decent as well. They're such tiny margins, but we're very happy that we got both cars so close to the top 10. Ollie's Q3 lap – although that was ultimately P10 – was a very, very good lap and I can say he got everything out of that car. We've come away from this qualifying feeling very positive, and with Sainz's penalty, tomorrow we start P9 and P11. Our focus is now to get both cars into the top 10 on Sunday.”

Hulkenberg was flirting with the top 10 at times in Qualifying, but couldn't extract enough pace from his car as the track improved late on in Q2. He can get stuck in from his grid slot though, and did out-qualify his team mate. Bortoleto's Grand Prix qualifying form has faded of late as he fell at the first time of asking for the third straight weekend.

Nico Hulkenberg, 13th, 1:17.016

“I'm not super happy with how qualifying went, as we thought there was a bit more potential after the pace we showed in practice. It felt like we were close to the limit but just couldn't quite extract the extra couple of tenths needed for Q3. The laps were clean and consistent, but the pace wasn't quite there. Still, we're in the mix and tomorrow's race is another opportunity. The field is very tight, so we'll look carefully at our strategy options and give it everything to come away with a strong result.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 16th, 1:17.412

“It's a bit of a shame, to be honest. The first two laps of qualifying felt quite strong, but I wasn't able to put everything together on the final push with the new softs. I struggled to find the grip I needed across the lap, and in the end, the lap just didn't come together as we hoped. The pace was definitely there, which makes it even more frustrating. It's a tough track for overtaking, so tomorrow won't be easy, but we'll give it everything. There's still a lot to play for, and we'll aim to make the most of every opportunity in the race.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“It was a well-executed qualifying session from the team. We delivered our plan and put ourselves in a position to get the most out of each lap, with both drivers having the opportunity for a clear run.

“Nico reached the limit of what the car had to give. These cars operate in a very narrow performance window where everything has to be perfect, from tyre temperatures to balance, hence we see such variability in the midfield from race to race. Gabi was building momentum nicely but, unfortunately, the balance wasn't the same as the last run and he couldn't deliver a clean lap.

“Our focus is now on making progress in the race tomorrow. It will be a challenging strategic call with tyre choices and whether all three compounds will come into play. We need to be ready to make the most of any opportunities that come our way.”

Alonso suffered a mechanical issue in FP3 and thus did not manage any Qualifying simulation laps. Whether that cost him any positions is a slight unknown, but he did at least make Q2. Stroll did not, exiting in Q1 for the fifth time in the last six race weekends. It might be tough for Alonso to score for the third weekend in a row, but if he gets a good start, anything is possible.

Fernando Alonso, 14th, 1:17.103

""We've been struggling for pace today and I think it was the maximum we could achieve in Qualifying. It was very low grip out there, but it was the same for everyone. Let's see what happens in the first few corners tomorrow, as it's tight into the chicanes and there might be something to gain there. We will give it our all and try to fight for points.""

Lance Stroll, 19th, 1:17.606

""The car was feeling OK in FP3, but there was just no grip in Qualifying and this happens a lot – there's good grip in the practice sessions and then we go into Qualifying and we struggle. We'll see what we can do tomorrow; it will be another tough race for us starting from the back. We will obviously try to make up positions, but it's a very different kind of track with the high altitude.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""It's been a challenging Qualifying session in the heat and altitude of Mexico City. We knew it might be close in the midfield and so we opted to run three sets of Softs in Q1 to give us the best chance to progress. We struggled to find grip throughout both sessions and Lance was unfortunately eliminated in Q1, starting P19 for tomorrow. Fernando did well to progress into Q2 with a strong lap at the end of Q1, but we think P14 was probably the maximum we could have achieved today. A lot can happen into Turn One here, so we'll be ready for anything and try our best to progress and fight for points. It's been a busy double-header for the team and hopefully we can put on a show tomorrow for the fans.""

It was another tough Qualifying session for Alpine, whose car still remains without the pace to make much of an impact on the pecking order. Both drivers exited at the first time of asking, with Gasly grabbing the intra-team honours. It is the fourth time in the last five race weekends that both Alpine drivers have exited in Q1, with positives hard to come by for the team.

Pierre Gasly, 18th, 1:17.546

“Considering how much we seemed to struggle yesterday, it felt like we did a better job today to at least close the gap to some of the cars ahead and, in the end, we were only a couple of tenths off reaching Q2. Since yesterday, the car has felt very difficult to drive, sliding a lot, lacking grip, and we have been far off the pace. We knew it would be difficult here so it has been good to make some steps forward and get on top of a couple of issues, which we faced in Practice. Tomorrow, we know it will be tough. We need something to happen in front of us and we will give it our best go as always.”

Franco Colapinto, 20th, 1:17.670

“Given how the car was feeling on Friday, I probably expected a bit more from Qualifying. We started the weekend well and had some good Practice sessions but, as a team, we seem to be struggling here, particularly on the bumps and kerbs. I was pushing on my final run and hit the kerb which destabilised the car and prevented me from improving on my lap time. To get the most performance out of the car we tend to run it quite stiff, which also means it's hard to put a consistent lap together, especially here. On high fuel yesterday, the car felt better and the lap times seemed more competitive. It will be difficult from where we are starting the race, but we'll fight and try our best to recover some positions tomorrow.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“Track conditions and tyre degradation in FP3 when race simulation was relevant were very similar to yesterday. However, in qualifying track evolution meant that times matched those from our simulations.

“In this session the C5's performance was seen over a single lap. Those drivers who got to the first corner after the long run of over one kilometre, with the tyres at the right temperature across the front axle definitely benefited from a well balanced car and therefore had a competitive advantage. Managing rear tyre temperature in the final sector was the key to gaining a few precious hundredths.

“The few drivers who managed to set their best time on a second lap probably owe it exclusively to the improvement from track evolution. Track temperature which could reach 50°C tomorrow, will therefore be a key factor when it comes to strategy choices with the aim of managing thermal degradation.

“With no drivers having saved two sets of Mediums, its effectively clear that a one-stop strategy will be the most popular choice for the race. The Medium has proved to be the most versatile compound this weekend and starting on it opens up a couple of options at least.

“If drivers can extend their first stint to a window between laps 42 and 48, they could fit Softs to go to the flag. On the other hand, if the C4 performance drop is too high, a switch to the Hard compound between laps 26 and 32 is possible.

“Starting on the Soft could give an initial advantage in terms of grip, but the heavy fuel load would require the driver to manage their race pace. In this situation, a shift to the C4 would come between laps 23 and 29, or if the C2 is preferred, between laps 20 and 26.

“Finally, in theory, one can also look at a two-stop strategy, running Soft-Medium-Soft, which produces a similar overall race time to the one-stop. However, the disadvantage of losing places after the pit stops, and the difficulty in overtaking at this track, means this is really only viable on paper.”

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

It was advantage Lando Norris in Qualifying for the Mexico City Grand Prix, the Briton clinching an impressive pole position.

Lando Norris surged to a stunning pole position in Qualifying for the Mexico City Grand Prix, the Briton leading the way from the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri ended the session back in eighth.

After setting the pace in Q2, it looked like Norris had a challenge on his hands in the top 10 shootout when Leclerc grabbed provisional pole during the opening runs. But the 25-year-old was in commanding form for his second lap, pumping in a 1m 15.586s to go 0.262s quicker than Leclerc's final effort.

Hamilton added to a solid outing for Ferrari by taking P3, followed by Mercedes' George Russell in P4 and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in P5. The other Silver Arrows machine of Kimi Antonelli, meanwhile, claimed P6 from Williams' Carlos Sainz, though the Spaniard will take a five-place grid drop following a penalty last time out in Austin.

It looked to be another tricky session for Piastri, with the Australian nearly eight-tenths adrift of his team mate in eighth place, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Haas' Ollie Bearman completed the top 10.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 GRAN PREMIO DE LA CIUDAD DE MÉXICO 2025

Yuki Tsunoda just missed the cut for Q3 by 0.014s, putting the Red Bull driver out of the session in P11. Also eliminated in the second segment were Haas' Esteban Ocon in P12 and the Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg in P13.

Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso followed in 14th, while Liam Lawson failed to set a representative time for Racing Bulls, leaving him in 15th.

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto was pushed out of Q1 in P16, followed by the Williams of Alex Albon in P17 and Alpine's Pierre Gasly in P18.

Lance Stroll claimed 19th for Aston Martin after aborting his final effort, while the other Alpine of Franco Colapinto rounded out the order in 20th place.

After three practice sessions at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez – each topped by a different driver in Leclerc, Verstappen and Norris respectively – it was time for the paddock to switch their attentions to Qualifying for the Mexico City Grand Prix.

The Aston Martin pair of Stroll and Alonso were the first to hit the track on scrubbed soft tyres when the 18-minute Q1 segment got underway, with the latter back in action after having his limited running in FP3 due to a small issue with the front right of his car.

While Kick Sauber's Bortoleto soon had his early effort deleted for exceeding track limits, Norris set a benchmark of 1m 17.147s – seven-tenths ahead of McLaren team mate Piastri, who had seemingly reported a DRS issue on his MCL39.

Once all 20 drivers had put a lap on the board, Russell slotted into second – just 0.047s behind Norris – with Leclerc in third ahead of Verstappen. At the other end of the timesheets, the names at risk were Hulkenberg, Alonso, Colapinto, Gasly and Bortoleto.

As the track rapidly evolved, the order continued to change. Bearman particularly caught the eye by momentarily going fastest – and while he was then beaten by Norris and Leclerc, the Haas driver's time kept him in third with a few minutes remaining.

With four minutes to go, the drivers now in danger were Gasly, Tsunoda, Colapinto, Hulkenberg and Stroll – but with the track improvement proving so great, it appeared that anybody could be in trouble if they chose not to put another lap in.

Hadjar and Lawson put their Racing Bulls machines into first and third respectively – Hadjar's effort of 1m 16.733s putting him 0.166s clear of Norris – while Antonelli found himself in the danger zone before improving to P11.

Elsewhere Gasly failed to better his time and Alpine team mate Colapinto also suffered the same fate, the Argentinian having a bit of a moment over the kerbs. Stroll abandoned his effort, meaning that he would also be exiting Q1.

The other Aston Martin of Alonso hauled himself up to P12, pushing Bortoleto back into the drop zone. This left Albon as the only driver that could still improve – but the Williams man was unable to do so, putting him out of the session in P17. Hamilton, meanwhile, ended the segment in P2, just 0.003s back from Hadjar at the top.

Knocked out: Bortoleto, Albon, Gasly, Stroll, Colapinto

After leading the way in Q1, Hadjar was amongst the first to head out on track as 15 minutes went on the clock for Q2. The Frenchman was soon joined by the rest of the pack, with all again running the soft tyres albeit with a mixture of new and used sets across the field.

As the first laps came in, Norris went quickest on a 1m 16.252s with a sizeable margin of 0.406s over closest challenger Leclerc, while Sainz was half a second back in third ahead of Verstappen and Hulkenberg.

Piastri, meanwhile, was one second adrift of his team mate in 10th, the Australian reporting that “something weird happened” with his power unit into Turn 5. Elsewhere, Lawson did not get a lap on the board after aborting his effort, having gone wide during his effort.

The New Zealander then dived into the pits at the end of his next attempt, meaning that he was still without a banker lap with just a few minutes remaining – putting him at risk of elimination alongside Bearman, Ocon, Alonso and Antonelli.

Both of the Haas duo moved up into the top 10, but a flurry of lap times were coming in that could change the order, with Hamilton shooting up to second behind Norris. Russell also improved to third, and Mercedes team mate Antonelli bettered his time to go eighth.

Piastri faced a tense moment after finding himself in the elimination zone, before the McLaren man climbed up to seventh. This pushed Tsunoda down into P11, with the Red Bull driver exiting along with Ocon, Hulkenberg, Alonso and Lawson, the latter having failed to set a representative time.

Knocked out: Tsunoda, Ocon, Hulkenberg, Alonso, Lawson

As the dust settled on Q2, it was time for the all-important top 10 shootout, with the McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari duos joined by Verstappen, Sainz, Hadjar and Bearman. Who would come out on top?

Verstappen was the first to cross the line as the initial laps came in, but the Dutchman's effort of 1m 16.455s was promptly beaten by Norris. Leclerc, however, went even faster, pumping in a 1m 15.991s to go 0.179s clear of Norris.

Hamilton was nearly four-tenths adrift of his team mate in third, with Verstappen fourth while Piastri had to settle for fifth – this time around three-tenths behind Norris. Russell, Antonelli, Sainz, Hadjar and Bearman rounded out the provisional top 10 order.

The focus for all then switched to the decisive final runs. Piastri was the first of the frontrunners to set his time and improved to P3, before Verstappen pushed the Australian down to fourth by moving up to second.

Norris then stormed through on a 1m 15.586s, a significant four-tenths quicker than Leclerc's previous time. While Leclerc did improve on his final lap, the Monegasque could not beat Norris' effort, sitting 0.262s behind in P2.

Hamilton slotted in behind Leclerc in third while Russell moved up to fourth, pushing Verstappen down to fifth. Antonelli took sixth ahead of Sainz in seventh, though the Williams driver will ultimately line up in P12 due to a five-place grid penalty carried over from the United States Grand Prix weekend.

Piastri ended up back in eighth – nearly six-tenths behind Norris' effort – with Hadjar taking ninth and Bearman rounding out the top 10.

""I'm happy to be back on pole, it's actually been quite a long time,"" said Norris. ""A good feeling. The lap? I don't know. It was one of those laps where you don't really know what happened, it felt decent but when I crossed the line and saw 1m 15.5s, I was very pleasantly surprised.

""I've been feeling good all weekend, especially from today, FP3, Q1, Q2, Q3. I got a little bit nervous of the Ferraris in Q3 at the end, but I pulled it out when it mattered and I'm happy because of that.""

The 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix is set to begin at 1400 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

It was a tough Qualifying for Oscar Piastri at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver ending the session in P8 – nearly eight-tenths adrift of polesitter team mate Lando Norris.

Oscar Piastri was left to reflect on a “frustrating” Qualifying at the Mexico City Grand Prix after ending the session in P8, with the Australian admitting that it was “not the lap time that I'm expecting”.

Having been unable to match the pace of McLaren team mate Lando Norris in the second and third practice sessions – with Norris sitting out FP1 while rookie Pato O'Ward took the wheel – Piastri again seemed some distance away during Qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Norris ultimately sealed pole position in Q3, but Piastri was nearly eight-tenths adrift of the Briton back in P8, though he will be promoted to P7 on the grid for Sunday's race due to the Williams of Carlos Sainz ahead of him taking a five-place penalty.

Looking back on how the session unfolded, Piastri explained: “It was tough. It felt like some of my laps when it counted were not bad, but just not the lap time that I'm expecting obviously. There's some things we need to try to understand, but obviously a frustrating session.”

There appeared to be a potential concern over the power unit in Piastri's MCL39 during Q2 when the championship leader radioed in that “something weird happened” in Turn 5.

When asked about this afterwards – as well as being quizzed on what specifically he is missing at the moment given his tricky weekend so far – the 24-year-old responded: “The PU was fine, I think – just a small under-delivery in one of the corners on the lap, but nothing major that continued.

“The thing that's been missing is the lap time. Everything's felt normal. The car's never going to feel amazing around here with the high altitude, but everything's felt pretty normal – just the lap time's not been there.”

With the focus now switching to Sunday's race, Piastri outlined how he intends to approach the launch when the 71-lap Grand Prix gets underway.

“Try and have a good start, and then see what I can do,” the McLaren driver – whose championship lead over Norris stands at just 14 points – stated. “It's a long run to Turn 1, so there's  opportunities there and I'll try and take them.”

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

Kimi Antonelli will start Sunday's race from sixth with Mercedes team mate George Russell set to line up fourth.

Kimi Antonelli believes ""there was a little bit more"" potential to come from Mercedes in Qualifying for the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the young Italian set to start sixth.

Antonelli had shown encouraging pace on Friday during practice, finishing the two sessions in second and third respectively, but come Saturday's Qualifying session, the 20-year-old dropped back in the pecking order, finishing more than half a second behind poleman Lando Norris.

""I think there was a little bit more,"" said Antonelli when asked if he had extracted everything from the car.

""A really scrappy Q1, just couldn't find my rhythm and it was a bit all rushed in Q2. And then Q3 was a cleaner session but I just didn't do a good enough job at the start of the session and it put me in more of an unfavourable position.

""Just a shame but still P6, close to P3, we can put on a fight.

""The start is going to be very important and hopefully from there we can gain a few places and fight for the front.""

Team mate George Russell will start in front of Antonelli having qualified fourth, with reigning World Champion Max Verstappen splitting the Mercedes pair.

The Briton was left surprised to be behind the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton on the grid and believed that although the run to Turn 1 at the start would be crucial, other strategic opportunities might present themselves.

""The order is a little bit surprising. Ordinarily if we were behind two Ferraris we'd probably be lining up P5 or P6 on the grid,"" he said.

""P4 I think was a decent result and I think those three were out of reach but it was so close between me and I think Oscar [Piastri] was only one-tenth behind me and he was in P8, so glad to be on the right side of it.

""Race pace is good. I don't want to be negative but I think Turn 1, Lap 1 is going to be very important but there's still always chances.

""You've got the two Ferraris, maybe they can off-set the strategy to put pressure on the McLaren and equally, those two can't pit on the same lap so maybe I can undercut one of them. Who knows.""

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

Lando Norris, Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton face the press after qualifying in the top three for the Mexico City Grand Prix.

1. Lando Norris (McLaren), 2. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari), 3. Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari)

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by James Hinchcliffe)

Q: Lando, 14th pole of your career, first pole for McLaren here in Mexico City since 1990. And in a season where the gaps have been pretty tight in qualifying, that was a monster lap from you in Q3. Can you just talk us through it?

Lando NORRIS: Yeah. Thank you. I mean, I'm happy to be back on pole. It's actually been quite a long time, so a good feeling. The lap—I don't know. It was one of those laps where you don't really know what happened. It felt decent, but then when I crossed the line and saw a 15.5, I was very pleasantly surprised. So I've been feeling good all weekend, especially from today. Like FP3, Q1, Q2, Q3. I got a little bit nervous with the Ferrari in Q3 at the end, but I pulled it out when I needed, and I'm happy because of that.

Q: You talk about it—it's been a minute since you were on pole. Last time was Belgium, and you said then, pole is sometimes a disadvantage there. We've got the longest run down to Turn 1 of anywhere on the calendar here. How much sleep are you going to lose tonight going through all the different scenarios of what could unfold in the run down to Turn 1?

LN: Not a lot. I mean, I haven't been sleeping well lately, so maybe that's the key to it all.  But I won't. You know, I've had some good races here in the past, so I'll just focus on what I can control, and that's all I can do.

Q: Alright. Well, don't leave—we're going to come back to you. Charles, congratulations. Front row start. Great run for Ferrari. It's been a track you guys have been competitive at, but at a track where the surface grip is so low, and the downforce is lower than anywhere else that you guys run, how difficult is it to not overdrive when you're trying to push 10 tenths on a qualifying lap?

Charles LECLERC: It's very difficult. This qualifying is very, very difficult, because there's very little grip, so the car is sliding a lot. And in order to put everything together, it's very tricky. But I'm pretty happy with the job we've done. I don't think there was much more in the car. There's a bit here and there, as always in qualifying, but very happy with the performance.

Q: It's been a year since Ferrari last won a Grand Prix at this race. How much would it mean for you to bring home a victory tomorrow for the team?

CL: It would mean a lot. So we'll do everything in order to get the first place into the first corner and then we'll see what's possible.

Q: And Lewis, P3 on the grid. This is sometimes a race where being P3, you get that double draft—it can be a bit of an advantage. Are you kind of rubbing your hands together at the possibilities into Turn 1?

Lewis HAMILTON: I have no clue what you just said.  but—you know what, I'm really, really happy. Thank you so much, everyone. I'm honoured to be up here with Charles and with Lando. These guys have been so quick all year, and it's an amazing feeling. This is the first time we've both been up in the top three in qualifying this year and the team truly deserves it. So, we're just working as hard as we can. Super grateful to everyone in the team for continuing to push and for not giving up. You know, we've not really moved the car forward necessarily in development, but we've extracted more from it. Our process is better this weekend, and that's what you're seeing. So, grazie a tutti.

Q: The qualifying pace is obviously good. How do you guys feel about your race pace tomorrow?

LH: Well, it's hard to beat these two guys today, but I mean P3 is kind of the perfect spot actually at this track. So I'm hoping I can make the most of that at the start. I think our race pace is not too bad. It's difficult to know already, but I'm really hoping— you know, with this crowd—I know there's going to be an amazing crowd there tomorrow, so we'll try and give it a good race.

Q: I was standing in the stadium during FP3, and every time you went by, that place erupted. I know a lot of people will be cheering for you tomorrow. Best of luck. Lando, we'll finish with you. Crucially, in the championship battle, you qualified ahead of both drivers that you're fighting against. Tomorrow, is it more focused on collecting points and staying ahead of them, or is it just all about going for the win?

LN: No. I'm here to win. No, I'll be looking forward. I know I'm going to have some quick guys behind me, and it's a long run down to Turn 1 and so forth. And the race pace from the Ferraris is normally very strong. So I'm expecting a battle. I'm not expecting it to be easy. But, no—eyes forward and I'll see how much I can win by.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Brilliant lap to take pole, Lando. Many congratulations. You even said ""What a lap"" over the radio. Just how good was it?

Lando NORRIS: That's the confusing thing. I mean, obviously it was an incredible lap. I pushed the braking everywhere. I pushed the high speed a bit more and all those things. But I don't have a delta, so I didn't know if I was up, if I was down, if it was good, bad, whatever. There were a couple of little places where I thought I messed up a touch and didn't get the best exits, like out of six, but the rest of it felt pretty decent. I was happy, but I thought I'd be more like a 15.9, 15.8. I thought if I'd get ahead of Charles, I'd be pretty happy. So when I saw 15.5 on my dash, it put a pretty big smile on my face because it was one of those laps which was — everything just came together in terms of feeling. It was very natural and similar to my lap in Monaco. A good feeling because it's been a while. It's not that often this year I get that feeling in this car, even with how quick it is. But yeah, happy because of this.

Q: You found nearly six tenths between Run 1 and Run 2 in Q3. Whereabouts?

LN: Honestly, I don't know. I have to go and see on the data. Like I said, I just pushed the braking in a few little places a bit more. Took a couple of bits more risk in the high speed. But yeah. Quite often, the laps I do best, I don't really know what's happened or how it's happened. Like I said on the radio to Will and Jarv, the less I know, the better I do normally on my quali laps. So it was one of them. But yeah, six tenths. I was surprised. I got a bit worried Q3 Run 1 when Charles did a 15.9. I was like, “damn, that's a pretty impressive lap”. So, like I said, nice when I saw 15.5.

Q: Are you surprised by the gap to your main rivals in this championship?

LN: I mean, maybe. It's tough because I do feel like I'm doing a very good job. I feel like I have been for a good amount of weekends now, especially when I get this feeling that I had today. Actually, the whole day today. It's not just my Q3 lap that was good. FP3 was strong already and a good step better than it was yesterday. Q1, Q2, Q3 — all of my laps were good. No mistakes. No lock-ups. None of these things. And I could just, in a good way, improve. The car is incredibly quick, but it's not easy to drive. I think we both complained of that as drivers, but when you just get in that little bit of a rhythm, it's flying, and that's where I was today.

Q: Let's throw it forward then. Can we start by talking about tyres? Some drivers have raised questions about the Medium tyre. Do you think this could be a complicated race strategically?

LN: Potentially. I mean, obviously with the Hard being a step harder, that can change a few things. But the race last year was very nice and we were very confident. Our race pace was very strong with the Medium-Hard last year. So yeah, I don't think we're too worried about anything. I think the pace has still been decent, even with missing FP1 and just kind of getting that high fuel stuff in FP2. But you never know. Many things can happen around here. It's a long race. Easy to make mistakes. A lot of overtaking opportunities, that kind of thing — but the pace is there. So as long as I get my head down and focus, then I'll be fine.

Q: And a final one from me. The long run to Turn 1 has provided plenty of drama over the years. Just how do you plan for those opening 10 seconds or so of the race?

LN: That's tonight. That's with my engineers and my team around me to review things, see what's best. Of course, you want a good start and go from there. But it's a long run. I don't know what our straight-line speed is like compared to the Ferrari. In general, I think we've been a touch down, so we'll wait and see.

Q: Lando, very well done to you. Thank you for that. Charles, let's come to you now. Is there a semblance of disappointment from you given that you were quickest after the first runs, that you're not on pole position today?

Charles LECLERC: A little bit. But yeah, after the first lap in Q3, I thought this was a really good lap. So I knew there was a little bit more to come, but not so much. But considering the gaps that were behind, I was like, “OK, let's see how it goes. I will still go flat out on the second lap and see where we end up”. But I was very surprised, obviously, by the jump Lando did from the first to the second run in Q3. I just don't think we had the pace today to match that. There was a little bit here and there, but I don't think it would have been enough for pole position anyway.

Q: How has the car been? How difficult was it to extract the lap that you did?

CL: I think the car was actually really good today. The whole weekend has been pretty strong. But on a track like this, it's very difficult because it's such a low grip track, and it's very easy to make a mistake. Whatever small mistake you do is exaggerated in terms of lap time lost. So it was very tough, but I was pretty happy with both of my laps in Q3.

Q: Tell us about track improvement during the session. Did it ramp up progressively?

CL: A little bit. I think the track got cooler in Q3, and that definitely helped. The grip was a little bit higher, and I felt in some corners I was a little bit under the limit, if anything. But yeah, the car reacted well, and again, I don't have anything to complain about car-wise.

Q: Let's throw it forward to tomorrow. Obviously, Lando had the one-lap pace. Just how confident are you in Ferrari's race pace?

CL: He's got the race pace too. We were speaking about it earlier. I think he will be very strong tomorrow for sure. But the start is definitely a chance for us — it's an opportunity for us to try and make something special even though starting second here on the dirty side of the track. I'm not sure it's great, but it's OK. I'll just focus on what I can control and hopefully it will be enough to be alongside him into Turn 1.

Q: Alright. Good luck with that, Charles. Thank you very much. Lewis, very well done. Your best start of the year with Ferrari. First of all, what does this mean?

Lewis HAMILTON: I was just saying to these guys, it's been a long time since I've been up here, so it feels fresh. And yeah, really grateful to the team for the hard work and just the constant effort through the year. Of course, I wish we had this experience earlier on in the year, but the fact is we're continuing to improve and continuing to stay positive, and so it's just great to be up here with these two.

Q: Tell us about the car. As you say, Ferrari seems to be finding a bit of form now. How good was your side of the garage? How pleased were you?

LH: Relatively happy. As Charles said, it is a really difficult circuit. We're all sliding around in general. The grip is quite low at this circuit because of the altitude. But even with that, clearly, everyone's experiencing the same thing and our pace has been great all weekend. I think we've made good steps with the car through the weekend. Obviously, I missed FP1 — I wouldn't say that hampered the weekend, but of course, you learn more with more laps on the track. I think I got the car to as good a place as I could. It's definitely not easy to put a lap together. But yeah, I'm just happy to be here.

Q: You said a moment ago that the processes have been better this weekend. What did you mean by that?

LH: We continue to improve on our process — from the moment we arrive, to our debriefs, to the decisions we make as a team within engineering, within when we going out — all these different things. So I think we're just continuously tightening up on some of those areas. And I think just how Charles and I have worked together to move the car and develop it forward has been really positive over the race weekends. Our cars are pretty much identical now, and I'm finally figuring out how to drive this car that Charles has been fortunate to drive for the past seven years, in terms of the characteristics. But I'm finally feeling like I'm getting there. So it's good.

Q: So what's the plan tomorrow at the start? Tuck in behind Lando, sneak out under braking, get him into Turn 1?

LH: I don't know. Definitely want to be racy tomorrow. I don't have anything to lose, but he does. So I'll be… Yeah, we'll be quite aggressive, I'm pretty sure. Hopefully we'll be close enough to put up a good fight.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Fred Ferret – l'Equipe) Question to the three drivers. How worried are you about the possible use of lift and coast tomorrow during the race? And can you tell us how you manage to do that during a Grand Prix?

LN: I mean, ask these guys — they're pros at it. These guys, they do it every race. Yeah, I think you always have to do it a little bit, but never as much as these guys.

CL: Let's say I think we're ready for this. It's always a track where lift and coast is a big part of the race, especially for the people from second onwards. That's why I think the start is so important on a track like this, because when you have free air, everything comes a lot easier. So yeah, we'll be quite aggressive into Turn 1 if I have the possibility and then manage from where we are. But it's definitely going to be a big part of the race.

LH: Not much to say. Lift and coast is pretty much what Charles said.

Q: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-Magazin.com) Question for Lando. I think you said earlier that you didn't have the delta in your last Q3 lap. Was it just that single lap that you didn't have the delta time on your dash? And can you elaborate a little bit how much you usually rely on the delta time and if it could have even helped you?

LN: No, I've not had it since Monaco. I've never used the delta since, in qualifying. So, yeah, I don't know. Who knows if it would have helped me or made me worse? I think the thing when I don't have it is, I push no matter what — no matter how the start of the lap was, no matter how any corner was. I guess it's because you have no reference of maybe the overall lap time, you just always try and maximize every corner to the maximum. And yeah, otherwise sometimes I just stare at it too much, and that's never the best thing. So yeah, it's just nice because normally when it goes well, like today, it's a pleasant surprise to see the lap time pop up when it's as good as this one.

Q: (Filip Cleeren – Motorsport.com) Congratulations, Lando. You've obviously been quite open this year about how tough it was at the start to get a good feeling with the front end of the car. So how much is this pole the result of all the work that you and the team have done about fixing that? And do you think this is repeatable? Like, do you come into a weekend now confident that you will be able to extract the maximum out of the car for one lap?

LN: I think, even when I look at my first lap in FP2 — my first lap of the weekend — it's a track which is not easy because of the downforce and the grip and things like that. High end of straight speed, big braking zones. But my first lap, I was on it. I was, again, pleasantly surprised at how quick I was on the pace compared to everyone — to the others who already did FP1. But certainly, it's hard to quantify how much the work the team has done behind the scenes to give me a bit more of what I want and what I need in order to perform at the level that I can perform at, which is the level of today and certain other places where we've been this season. But it was only a few weekends ago in Singapore where I almost felt like it was the beginning of the season again — no feeling for the front, no confidence, no ability to go out and do what I did today. No confidence to do what I did today. So it's a little bit up and down still. There's certainly areas we have to improve. And if I want to be able to do what I did today more often — which I do — we have to improve the car more. And I've got to try and make it more to my liking. But there's certainly a lot of work that I've also done personally, away from the track, with my team, with a lot of people to understand what my struggles were, reasoning, all those things, and then how I can combat it. Because the last thing I want is to make the excuse. Like, at the end of the day, it's my job to drive whatever car I get given, whether it's a great one or a terrible one. I don't feel like I should ever have a reason to have an excuse. There's reasoning for things — why I struggle here, why I've struggled there, and so forth — but it's not an excuse. If I'm slow, I'll say I've just done a bad job, and I wasn't a good enough driver on that day. And I think I've always been open about those things. But yeah, there are clearly things which work for me and things that don't. I hate that because I hate to have a reason for why sometimes I struggle. I just want to be able to drive whatever car I get given. But certainly, progress has been made. And I'm very happy that the team has worked hard to improve on those things. But we still need to make more if I want to be even better.

Q: (Luis Vasconcelos – Formula Press) For Charles and Lewis. This is a bumpy track, you have to ride the kerbs. The car was not particularly good on that earlier on. It was today. You were also able to improve a lot in the last run of Q3, which was not the case earlier on in the season as well. Can you elaborate a little bit on where the team has made more progress, and if you think that with the knowledge of what now works for the car, there's still a little bit more you can extract until the end of the year?

CL: I don't think there's a silver bullet or something that we've changed significantly that makes us a lot better now than three, four, five races ago. I think it's a little bit everywhere. Like Lewis was saying earlier, I think the processes and all the small differences make a big difference at the end, and we improved all that in the last few weekends. Yeah, on the bumps, I don't think this was particularly a weakness at any point. I think we had to manage some other things at one point of the season, which now we are in a bit more of a comfortable place. But yeah, the pace in itself is more down to small details everywhere rather than something standing out.

LH: Yeah. I mean, I second what Charles has said. I think this is a peculiar circuit, obviously, with the altitude, so we perhaps are closer than we would normally be, I would say. It's difficult to say where we'll be in the next races. I'm not sure we'll be as close as we are. But I do think through those small improvements that Charles was talking about, that we've made — they make big differences. And it feels great to finally get into Q3 and be able to deliver good laps and be competitive. That's been a problem all year, particularly on my side.

Q: (Gabriel Martínez – TV Azteca Deportes) Lewis, you've always had great support from Mexican fans. How special is it for you to have your best qualifying result so far with Ferrari in front of a crowd that really appreciates you?

LH: Yeah, it's beautiful. It's really been amazing. Every time I come to Mexico, honestly, I've always felt very welcome. I really, really love the city. I mean, I grew up watching it in movies, and it's even more beautiful in person, I would say. When you get into the city and see the restaurants, the lights that are hanging, it's just got such a great feel to it. And then obviously we've been coming to this race, it's been growing year on year, and I would say I'm pleasantly surprised to see the positive response that I get from the fans every year here. It's something I'm incredibly grateful for. So, muchos gracias.

Q: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Charles, you found a pretty big amount of pace from Q2 to Q3 — I think it was about seven tenths. Can you just explain where that came from?

CL: Well, I kept a new soft for the race. So yeah, in Q2, I had done my lap early on in Q2 compared to most of the others that had put a second set. I went on a scrubbed tyre then. So obviously there was a little bit of a gap there more than anything. But the lap time came quite nicely. I was quite confident with the car, so I knew where I had to push and where I had to improve. Everything came together very nicely on that first lap in Q3 — just like, honestly, the second lap in Q3 as well. So yeah. But I think the biggest explanation is mostly that I only put one set in Q2 when most of the others went for two.

Q: (Filip Cleeren – Motorsport.com) For all three. You mentioned the dirty air before, and Max is fifth, Oscar is seventh — which is obviously quite significant in the championship. So how difficult will it be for them to come through the field? And do you think the order will largely be dictated by the start?

LN: Well, I think you're talking about two of — along with these guys here — two of the best drivers on the grid. So I don't think you can ever put it past them to come back through. From my side, our race pace has always been very strong this season, so I'm still expecting Oscar to come back through and race well. He normally does. So, let's see. That is my expectation. And same with Max — when has he ever not been on the attack and come forward? Hopefully I can just stay ahead on lap one, and then these guys can hold everyone else up for me.

CL: Yeah. I mean, it's probably going to be tough. I'd rather be in my position than theirs, but yeah, they've got the pace. Especially if Oscar finds the pace that Lando had on the high fuel, I think he'll probably have the pace to come back. But it's obviously a lot more difficult.

Q: Lewis, anything from you? And how hard is it to follow? The championship contenders — the progress they're going to make — how hard is it to come through in dirty air?

LH: It's tough with the altitude, with the overheating of the car, with the overheating of the brakes. I mean, I don't know how it is for everybody, but I'm pretty sure most people have that experience here with the lack of cooling. So it won't necessarily be easy. But you've got some great drivers behind us. So we shall see.

'Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reze Arc' is the latest victory for Japanese anime. Elsewhere, awards hopeful Springsteen biopic 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' settled for a fourth-place finish.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Japanese anime feature Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc is off to an impressive start at the U.S. box office, where it opened to an estimated $17.3 million from 3,003 theaters, well ahead of expectations in another win for the genre. The acclaimed manga pic boasts a 96 percent critics score and a 99 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes — a rare combo, along with an A CinemaScore and five out of five stars on PostTrak.


	Since its first launch at the Japanese box office last month, Chainsaw Man — The Movie has already grossed north of $80 million worldwide. Sony and Crunchyroll are handling the movie domestically and in select overseas markets. Produced by the team at MAPPA, the R-rated pic is based on the hit manga-turned-anime TV series that is available to stream in the U.S. on Disney+, Crunchyroll and other platforms.

Chainsaw Man follows the adventures of Denji (Kikunosuke Toya), a teenager and demon hunter who is killed by his overlords, the yakuza. But when his beloved chainsaw-powered, devil-dog Pochita (Shiori Izawa) makes a deal and sacrifices himself, he is reborn with the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. Along with violence, the pic doubles as a teenage romance with the arrival of the mysterious Reze. However, Reze is not quite who she seems, and a series of battles ensues that could destroy Tokyo when their love story takes a twisted turn.

	











	Directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara, the film is based on Tatsuki Fujimoto's original story, with a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko. “It's safe to say that manga and anime fans won't be disappointed, even if they'll inevitably be nitpicking about one narrative aspect or another,” writes THR in its review.


	Heading into its U.S. opening, Chainsaw Man was expected to battle Blumhouse and Universal's holdover hit Black Phone 2 for No. 1 with a debut in the $11 million to $12 million range. But it quickly pulled ahead of the pack thanks to males, who made up 75 percent of all ticket buyers, and younger moviegoers. More than 50 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25. It's also drawing an ethnically diverse audience, including over-indexing among Asian moviegoers (20 percent), according to PostTrak.


	In a second surprise twist, holdover Black Phone 2 found itself in a closer race with Regretting You — the second Colleen Hoover book adaptation to hit the big screen after 2024's box office blockbuster It Ends With Us — but ultimately pulled ahead by a narrow margin, according to Sunday estimates (the race won't be officially called until Monday morning).


	The pic, a needed win for Blumhouse, fell a scant 52 percent to $13 million for a domestic total of $49.1 million and $80.4 million globally. The Blumhouse and Universal's release is holding remarkably well for a horror title, and should continue to take advantage of being the only major studio horror film opening nationwide over the Halloween corridor this year.

	











Regretting You opened to an estimated $12.9 million domestically and $22.9 million globally.


	Many expected Regretting You to be dinged by generally withering reviews, but the female-fueled pic garnered strong exits on PostTrak and boasts an audience score of 87 percent on Rotten Tomatoes (its CinemaScore, however, was only a B). It's also clearly benefiting from being one of the few films to target women amid a glut of male-sewing fare, and is also a testament to Hoover's continued popularity. (She's stayed mum on the topic of the ongoing legal battle between It Ends With Us director/producer Justin Baldoni and actress/producer Blake Lively). Females made up at least 80 percent of the audience, while nearly 75 percent of all ticket buyers were under the age of 35.


	The new film is described as a romantic drama that explores the aspirational theme of living life fully and without regrets. Constantin Films produced and financed the movie, with Paramount acquiring domestic and certain overseas rights. Internationally, the film opened week in 40 markets, including the U.K., Australia, Brazil and Mexico, for an early foreign total of $10 million.


	Disney's Bruce Springsteen bio-drama and awards hopeful Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere had to settle for fourth place in its debut after coming in behind expectations with $9.1 million domestically and $7 million internationally for a global start of $16.1 million (it has yet to roll out in 20 percent of the foreign marketplace). The movie, coming in on the low end of expectations, is skewing notably older, which is no surprise, and Disney is confident the pic will have staying power because of its subject matter, originality and solid-to-strong audience scores.

	











	More than 60 percent of ticket buyers on Friday were 45 and older, including 40 percent over the age of 55. That's a demo that isn't known for rushing out to see a film on opening weekend; it also cares more about reviews. The movie's Rotten Tomatoes critics score presently rests at 61 percent, while the RT audience score is far stronger at 85 percent. And it earned a B+ CinemaScore, which isn't a disaster.


Springsteen, playing in a total of 3,460 cinemas, benefited from 250 IMAX runs and an additional 750 in other premium large-format auditoriums, but it still couldn't clear $10 million. The music-infused pic stars Jeremy Allen White in the titular role, and he is credited in THR‘s review for giving a “raw and internalized performance as The Boss.” Jeremy Strong, Stephen Graham and Odessa Young also star in director Scott Cooper's examination of a brutal comedown after a blockbuster tour, which yielded the prolific musician's most personal album, Nebraska.


	It remains to be seen how much of an impact the first two games of this year's World Series — which pits the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Toronto Blue Jays — had on the weekend box office. Generally speaking, NFL games pose far more competition. At the same time, L.A. is the largest moviegoing market alongside New York City (it is also the biggest market for anime). Friday night's opening game of the World Series, as well as Saturday's, are both in Toronto.


	At the specialty box office, Neon launched Shelby Oaks in 1,823 locations. Marking YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann‘s debut feature, the found-footage pic opened to a solid $2.4 million. So far, its main claim to fame is that it raised $1.4 million via a Kickstarter campaign, the highest amount ever for a horror title, per the crowd-sourcing platform. Neon later provided some additional funds.

	











	Focus Features' awards contender Bugonia also made headlines in its limited debut at the specialty box office, and is reporting an estimated opening per-location average of $40,588 from 17 cinemas, one of the best platform starts of the year to date (it will also be the top location average of the weekend by a long shot). Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the acclaimed film stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons.

The British actor talks season three of the ITV bomb squad thriller, working opposite Vicky McClure and why he's learned to embrace the charming villain roles that always seem to come his way.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	You've probably seen English actor Jason Flemyng in Guy Ritchie and/or Matthew Vaughn‘s films, such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and X-Men: First Class. You may have seen him in such Hollywood movies as Rob Roy, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Seed of Chucky, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Transporter 2 or in small independent films from around the world. Now he is playing the antagonist in one of Britain's biggest TV dramas, season three of Trigger Point, starring Vicky McClure.

	











	Flemyng stars as Steven Wyles, who is causing the team of Explosives Officer, or Expo, Lana Washington, portrayed by McClure, all sorts of headaches with his sinister vendetta. “Someone is targeting individuals and demanding revenue,” according to a season three plot synopsis. “Working alongside the Police Counter Terrorism Unit, the Bomb Disposal Squad race against time to find the bomber before they claim their next victim.”

	Season three of the show, produced by Jed Mercurio's (Line of Duty, Bodyguard) HTM Television, in association with All3Media International, which distributes the series internationally, starts airing on ITV1 and STV on Sunday and will be available to stream on ITVX and STV Player.


	Flemyng talked to THR about his role and why he always seems to get cast as a baddie.I told to a friend of mine that you got cast in Trigger Point, and he said, “Yes, I recognize him. He must play a bad guy!”












Flemyng [Laughs] Everyone says that. It's so unfair. I've been playing those parts for my whole career, and I think I have been miscast from the very beginning of time until now. But that's what I do. As soon as you see I'm in it, you know that people are gonna die.


What can you share about your character in season three without spoiling too much?


	Initially, we see the victims, we see the explosions, we see the ramifications of his actions, but we don't see him. It's a cat-and-mouse game between me and Vicky, which was fun. 


	Vicky's someone I've admired from a distance for a long time. When you meet people like that, you're like, “Please, let them be nice.” And Vicky was exactly as I expected her and exactly as I wanted her to be. It was a happy shoot, and it comes from the top.


	There are some big dialogue scenes with Vicky that were a joy. In football [aka soccer], if you go on to the pitch with Ronaldo, you look like an idiot, right? But in acting, if you go on to the set with Vicky or Stephen Graham or Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, the better the actor, the better you are. Honestly, I've been really lucky.


What can you tell us about the dynamic between Vicky's Lana and your character Steven?


	It's a classic film relationship between the compassionate copper, even though Vicky is not a copper, but, you know, the compassionate protagonist and my character. The story behind this character is that he is a little man. It's David versus Goliath. He's been fucked over by the capitalist system. He is a byproduct of profit, and he's sick and dying, as a lot of his friends are. He has no way of fighting back. So he takes it into his own hands. It's a sort of Robin Hood story to a degree.


	Vicky's character understands why he's doing it, but obviously doesn't agree with the way he's doing it. But her character is compassionate and left-leaning, you could say. He does it the wrong way, and she understands why he's doing it, but can't agree with the way he does it. There are a lot of those head-to-head things where they discuss that, which is great. Her compassion for him is very understated, but we know it because she's such a great actress.

	











	There are some massive scenes in it, which you definitely don't get in a film. I have more lines in one scene than I have in whole movies, because there are six-, seven-page scenes. But when you have good dialogue, it's easy.


	The writing was working well, and I hope that the audience will have compassion for him because they understand his predicament, and they understand what's happened to him. I think in modern society, a lot of people feel voiceless, and a lot of people feel like they're a byproduct of the capitalist system. 


Did you know Trigger Point well? What was your reaction to the opportunity to join the show?


	This landed on the desk, and I was like: Brilliant! It's [shot] in London as well. Double brilliant! I really didn't have much of an idea about it. I knew Vicky was in it, and I knew that it was Jed's show. But then when I arrived on it, I knew this was a big deal. Usually, when people ask me what I am doing, I'm like: “I'm making this film about a lesbian sheep farmer in the Czech Republic. And it's got subtitles in German.” And they're like, “Oh yeah? Great.” But when I said I'm in Trigger Point, they were like, “Oh my god, yeah, Trigger Point.” It's probably the most popular thing I've ever done.


	I'm at an age where my kids are 14, and it's nice to be on the telly and at home. It sits easy with me that I'm not in Jordan, making a film that not many people are ever going to see. It's nice to be in London, filming with the people who know exactly what they're doing in a really tight machine. I have now watched the other seasons, which are great. And I think this year, it's sort of stepped up another level visually. It looks more cinematic and dramatic. So, I'm really excited to see what people think.

	











Will your fans get to see more of you on mainstream TV shows then, maybe even as the hero saving the day for once?I'm with you on that. But the people who are in control need to make those decisions. (Laughs)

""He was great,"" Clooney said. ""I got yelled at by Frank Sinatra!""


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



George Clooney is looking back at one of the more surreal moments from his early Hollywood days — getting personally scolded by the legendary Frank Sinatra.


	While attending the Los Angeles premiere of his new film Jay Kelly on Thursday (Oct. 23), the actor recalled his brushes with legendary artists like Sinatra and Tony Bennett during a time when he was trying to get a foothold in the industry. 


	“I remember being on the road […] I was my Aunt Rosemary's driver when she was singing,” Clooney told People. “And I hadn't known her much when I was young because I lived in Kentucky. She was the Hollywood aunt. So I came out to make a living and I was her driver.”

	











	At the time, Clooney found himself in close proximity to giants of American music, including Bennett, Sinatra and more. 


	“I got to drive [her] and Tony Bennett, and all of these really wonderful singers around for a year,” he said. “I got a really good life lesson in success and failure, and handling it.”




	One of the more unexpected encounters came courtesy of Sinatra himself, who wasn't thrilled with a press boycott Clooney was involved in. “I remember he was mad at me once because I led this boycott about […] some press freedoms, and he called me because people thought he was sick and there were helicopters flying over his [home],” Clooney recalled. “And he called me going, ‘It's not working what you're doing!'”


	Still, Clooney took the confrontation in stride. “He was great,” he added. “I got yelled at by Frank Sinatra!”


	Clooney, who would go on to win Oscars for both acting and producing, said those formative experiences helped shape his approach to success — especially the importance of staying grounded. 


	“Most of my friends, we've been friends for 40 years. I slept on their couch when I was broke. And they're always around when people are giving you too much credit,” he said. “They're the first people to remind you that they're full of crap.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is landing at the high end of where we were seeing it yesterday with $17.2M after a $5.2M million Saturday in a weekend where the Toronto Blue Jays and LA Dodgers were a complete distraction in the World Series, now with 1-1 tied streak. Running global cume on this anime movie is $108 million (40% of that coming from a September Japan release). 


	Sony and Crunchyroll know how to speak to their followers directly. They kicked off the campaign at Anime Expo Los Angeles in July which included a MAPPA panel (they produced the movie) and activations on the expo floor with MAPPA and Crunchyroll booths and Pochita walkabout and photo ops. Sony trailered Chainsaw Man on Demon Slayer, Him, One Battle After Another, and Tron: Ares. There was a big splash at New York Comic-Con two weeks ago with a MAPPA panel, exclusive BTS footage, a surprise fan screening raffle, Pochita photo ops, and more. 

	











	There were also Anime Influencer screenings at Alamo Drafthouse Downtown LA attended by 80+ leading creators, as well as an Anime Men (13M followers) Imax advance screening at the large format exhibitor's HQ in Playa Vista, CA. Sony also tapped into the Crunchyroll fanbase with a stunted two-part recap program for the IP on the anime brand's platforms. There was also a presence across Crunchyroll's platform and owned digital channels across 65+ markets, premium App Homepage placement, dedicated newsletters, video ads, podcast ad spots, and a YouTube watch-along livestream of the first season across five global channels. Premium formats, Imax and 3D drove an updated 63% of the weekend with AMC Empire in NYC the highest grossing venue with $72K. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Universal/Blumhouse's second weekend of Black Phone 2 is edging out the start of Paramount‘s Colleen Hoover movie, Regretting You, $13M to $12.8M. Overindexing regional update shows the Mountain, Midwest, South Central and Southern areas for the Hoover source material pic. Megaplex Theatres in Geneva, UT is the leading single-location gross at $16.9K. Bestselling woman's novel-turned-film, Where the Crawdads Sing, held -40% in weekend two and legged out to a massive 5.2 multiple off its $17.2M opening for a final stateside of $90.2M. That landed an A-, Regretting You has a B. We'll see what the hold factor is here for Regretting You; note that Crawdads had the advantage of a July 2022 playdate. 


Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is arriving at the low end of its projections with $9.1M. That start is just north of what MGM's Aretha Franklin movie Respect did in its opening, $8.8M, which bowed in the summer of 2021 as movie theater were making their way back from the pandemic. Respect finaled at $24.2M off an A CinemaScore. Springsteen‘s global take is $16.1M, under the $20M the studio was expecting. The movie was shot with New Jersey tax credits and cost a net $55 million. Respect also cost a net of $55M. While the movie was made with the utmost respect and authenticity for The Boss, getting his sign off so that the Warren Zanes novel could make it to screen under the direction of Scott Cooper, a movie about the global rock star's depression period during the making of his Nebraska album, pre Born in the U.S.A., is not a movie that his fans want to rush out for. Seriously, a lot of pure heart from Jeremy Allen White's prep as Bruce Springsteen to the production shooting in The Boss' NJ stomping ground; a lot went into this. Also complicating Springsteen‘s success is a non-holiday release date during an October World Series-NFL perfect storm weekend. Had Springsteen been released during the holidays, that's when this older skewing audience of 59% over 45 could truly find it. The movie was brought in by incoming Disney chief David Greenbaum as his first project since segueing over from Serachlight after A24 passed on the movie over its production cost. In its essence, Springsteen is more of an arthouse film than a big Bohemian Rhapsody 20th Century title, however, the studio didn't want to put it through Searchlight since they recently played James Mangold's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. Springsteen championed the movie during the promotional tour. He didn't sign as an EP as he never desired the production to come across as a vanity project. 


	Also, as is the Russian roulette with these possible awards contenders, if they're trotted out too early at the fall film festival troika, and they're not exactly perfect, it could spell doom for a movie's prospects. Springsteen, despite the brilliant performance White, didn't exactly wow following its Telluride world premiere and has been sitting on Rotten Tomatoes with a 61% fresh critics score. For the penny-counting older skewing audiences and their streaming apps at home, that doesn't scream ‘get out of the house.' At the same time, Disney is hoping for some sort of hold with 85% Rotten Tomatoes score and that 60% definite recommend from Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits. 


	Note, just because Springsteen bottomed out, doesn't mean that rock performer biopic is dead. True, they are hard to stitch so that it's not the same old, drugs, sex and rock n' roll, but you have to have a groundswell, overcoming all odds story, and chock-a-block concert performances. This has been a successful sub-genre with Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocket Man and Elvis and Bob Marley: One Love post Covid. Why did A Complete Unknown win over in the story of off-beat poet-turned-electric guy, Bob Dylan? Why it was the whole romantic tension between Timothee Chalamet's Dylan and Monica Barbaro's Joan Baez (note that movie received an A CinemaScore to Springsteen‘s B+). 

	











	Pre-release social media universe reach on Springsteen counted 160M, which was +4% ahead of the music bio genre norm per RelishMix, yet below that of A Complete Unknown (187.4M), Bob Marley: One Love (193.6M),  


	In better news for arthouse, Focus Features' first limited weekend of Yorgos Lanthimos' zany corporate politco-hostage comedy Bugonia posted a $40,5K opening theater average at 17 theaters — that's the fifth best opening theater average YTD. Huge performances in NYC, LA and Austin, I understand.The Emma Stone-Jesse Plemmons movie posted $690K off of very shiny critical reviews of 90% coming out of its Venice and Telluride premiere. The movie cost a ton of cash, Focus taking this package off the table for $45 million (I hear the movie itself cost $55 million). Part of the promotion included free screenings for anyone who is bald, or yearning to be with a barber on hand at cinemas. Bugonia expands to 1,800 locations over Halloween weekend. Note, the distribution plan here for Bugonia is different from Lanthimos' Oscar darlings, The Favourite and Poor Things which played the Thanksgiving and early December corridor, riding their awards season buzz and posting and holding weekends where those pics were often making $2M to $3M a weekend.

SATURDAY AM: In an autumn where prestige awards potential isn't working, nor attempted tentpoles like Tron: Ares, Sony/Crunchyroll anime proves its merit again with its latest Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc which is now looking at a $15.5M-$17M opening after an $8.5M Friday, powered by an A CinemaScore from fans. 


	It will be interesting to see if the audience expands today as the fanbase for this movie are shouting its praises to the sky with an 82% definite recommend on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak.  

	











	This is the ninth anime movie to open north of $10M, which is a big deal, because not every Japanese animation IP works on the big screen. What's great about this is that Sony has a new solid franchise in the wake of Demon Slayer. Even if this drops tonight in typical front-loaded anime fashion, it's another No. 1 win for Sony this year with non-traditional motion picture fare. As studios execs remain perplexed about what exactly works this fall, it's all anime, horror and Taylor Swift. 


	Imax and premium large format screens are revving 58% of Chainsaw‘s weekend with the West, South and South Central its best grossing regions. There's also a great swath of diverse demos all around in 32% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, a very strong 20% Asian American and 13% Black. The AMC Empire in NYC is the top grossing theater with close to $45K. 


	A title acquired during the Brian Robbins regime at Paramount, Regretting You, is doing its job in attracting 83% female moviegoers with a $13M 2nd place opening after a $5.2M Friday and B CinemaScore. In PostTrak exits, women love the movie giving it a 77% definite recommend. Regretting You isn' the most popular of the Colleen Hoover novels in the It Ends With Us-sense of the word, and it didn't have the whole Blake Lively-Ryan Reynolds post-Deadpool & Wolverine marketing halo effect, so take that into account. Paramount snapped up the $30 million financed production post the Hoover It Ends With Us box office fiesta in summer 2024 (that moving making $351 million worldwide); Amazon MGM Studios took the author's novel Verity (out on Oct. 2 next year with Anne Hathaway and Dakota Johnson) while Universal snapped up Reminders of Him (March 13 with Maika Monroe).


	Diverse demos for Regretting You are 50% Caucasian, 36% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian American and 5% Black. Women over 25 led at 45%, with women under 25 at 39%. 


	Distrib sources are complaining that the World Series is cutting into male moviegoers this weekend. Then why the hell are you booking movies aimed at men during a juggernaut time when guys can't come? Good on Paramount for capitalizing on the opportunity to book a female-driven title on the marquee. 


	While we're on the subject of bad release dates for what should be older skewing male movies: 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere which has now shifted its range to $9M-$10M (many are seeing $9M) after a B+ CinemaScore in fourth with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 second weekend ahead in 3rd with $12M (-56%). If Springsteen hits the bottom of its tracking range at $9M, it won't be “Glory Days” for this net $55M Jeremy Allen White-Jeremy Strong starring production. On the upside, the movie has a 60% definite recommend on PostTrak, so we'll see if this improves. Why isn't this brand-name rock performer movie not being released over Christmas ala last year's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown when a bigger audience is available? While older Springsteen fans showed up last night at 40% over 55 (the pic's biggest demo) and 59% over 45, it was clearly not in bulk judging from the grosses. Also, Springsteen was largely female leaning movie at 52%. Women over 25 bought tickets at 46% and men over 25 went at 42%. Overall, this is very Caucasian leaning movie at 85% with few diverse demos showing up. We'll get into this more as the weekend goes on, but off the bat, the release date isn't doing this making-of-the-Nebraska-album any favors.  


	Premium large format screens for the Scott Cooper directed title are repping a quarter of the weekend's gross with best areas of play in the East and Midwest. AMC Lincoln Square is the top grossing location with over $32K so far. 

	











	NEON's Shelby Oaks gets a C+ after a $1.1M Friday on its way to around $2.3M now. Best areas for the  Chris Stuckmann directed movie are the West, South Central, and East with AMC's Boston Common 19 the top grossing venue stateside with just over $7K. Fifty-three percent guys, 74% 18-34. This is a standard NEON niche genre play. 


	Overall ticket sales are clocking an estimated $75.4M, which is +8% from last weekend, but down 20% from a year ago when Venom: The Last Dance opened to $51M. Remember, New Line's Mortal Kombat 2 was suppose to open this weekend before it moved to early May next year; a brilliant release date change by Warner Bros, sidestepping the World Series. 


	Saturday numbers:


	1. Chainsaw Man (Sony) 3,003 theaters, Fri $8.5M, 3-day $15M-$17M/Wk 1


	2 Regretting You (Par) 3,393 theaters, Fri $5.2M 3-day $13M/Wk 1


	3. Black Phone 2 (Uni) 3,460 (+49) theaters, Fri $3.7M (-66%), 3-day $12M (-56%), Total $48M/Wk 2

FRIDAY PM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is slicing its way to the top of the box office with a good $8M today for what's shaping up to be a $14 million-plus weekend.


	While at the high end of its $11M-$14M projections, and a clear No. 1, the caution here is that it's the first night of the World Series with the Los Angeles Dodgers taking on the Toronto Blue Jays. Los Angeles is the No. 1 market for anime movies.


	RelishMix reports that the social media reach on Chainsaw Man is massive at a half billion, 6x above anime genre norms across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram combined with gigantic video views counts on YouTube of 351 million and counting. Note Chainsaw Man‘s reach on social is 2.5x more than Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle before its opening which stood at 200 million.


	Reports the social media stat org, “Convo runs positive for Chainsaw Man-The Movie: Reze Arc, with fans losing their minds over animation studio MAPPA's cinematic polish, the faithfulness to the manga's art style, and Kenshi Yonezu's soundtrack. Theatrical worthiness is a recurring theme, with audiences insisting this arc had to be a movie. The chatter even positions it above competing anime events, with praise like ‘compared to the recent Infinity Castle, Reze arc was kick ass—would watch in theaters again' and ‘I absolutely love how loyal they stayed to the art style, it feels like the manga came to life.' 


	The following music video alone is racking up close to 68 million views on YouTube. 


	Second is a three-way race between 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere (3,460 theaters), Paramount's Colleen Hoover movie Regretting You (3,393 theaters) and the second weekend of Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 (3,460 theaters) each looking at $10.8M-$12M. For Black Phone 2, that hold-range is better than -60% with at least $47M by Sunday, which would be $400K less than Black Phone at the same point in time of its ten-day run. 


	Fifth is the third weekend of Disney's Tron: Ares at 2,940 theaters with $1.3M today and $4M+ for the weekend. 

	











	Neon's horror thriller from Chris Stuckmann, Shelby Oaks, is spotting $1.1M today for a $2.5M take at 1,823 sites. This is in the range of Neon's summer 2024 horror title, Cuckoo which opened to $3M.


FRIDAY AM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc revved up $3.4 million in previews Thursday in screenings that began at 4 p.m. at 2,500 locations.


	By the way, that preview number is close to the $3.8M posted by Demon Slayer: Mugen Train back in April 2021, on its way to a three-day total f $21.2M as movie theaters were reopening from Covid. That title, released by Funimation/Aniplex, had a Friday of $9.5M.


	The Tatsuya Yoshihara-directed Chainsaw Man based on the popular manga is expected to ring up $11M+ in a weekend that might now be too close to call with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 with an expected $12M+ second frame.


Chainsaw Man is 100% fresh from 18 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 99% audience score. 


	Meanwhile, 20th Century Studios' $55M Scott Cooper-directed Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere strummed $850,000. The movie is expected to bring in $9M-$11M. Note that preview take is under the $1.4M Christmas preview gross of Searchlight's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, which went electric over the holidays with a $7.2M opening day, $11.6M 3-day and 5-day total of $23.2M. Springsteen is opening at 3,460 theatres including 250 Imax screens and 750 Premium Large Format screens. Critics aren't wowed by this rock performer biopic at 61% fresh, but fans last night enjoyed it better at 85%.


	Jeremy Allen White plays Bruce Springsteen and Jeremy Strong plays his manager Jon Landau in a semi-biopic about The Boss recording the personal 1982 album Nebraska which preceded his global phenomenon Born in the U.S.A.


	Paramount is not reporting grosses on Regretting You given its limited run in under 500 theaters last night, with one showtime for the A Night of No Regrets fan event that included a Q&A with cast and director Josh Boone with a special performance by Hannah Cohen. Nonetheless, sources say the movie did better than Springsteen last night. Regretting You was forecasted at $9M-$11M this weekend in what is the second Colleen Hoover novel feature adaptation to hit the screen after the massive success of It Ends With Us. Critics don't like the schmaltziness of Regretting You at 34% on RT, but there was also never beginning with them on It Ends With Us which they threw Kleenex boxes at with 54%.


	Neon this frame has the psychological thriller Shelby Oaks, which did $515K from combined mystery screenings and last night's previews. The movie is expected to file in the low single digits.


Black Phone 2 posted $1.6M yesterday, off 11% from Wednesday, for a first week of $36M, up 3% from its 2022 first chapter.


	The rest of the top 5:


	1.) Black Phone 2 (Uni) 3,411 theaters, Thu $1.6M (-11% from Wed), Wk $36M/Wk 1 


	2.) Tron: Ares (Dis) 4,000 theaters, Thu $698K (-22%), Wk $15M (-65%), Total $58.4M/Wk 2


	3.) Good Fortune (LG) 2,990 theaters Thu $487K (-15%), Wk $8.7M/Wk 1


	4.) One Battle After Another (WB) 2,532 theaters, Thu $350K (-18%) Wk $5.5M (-45%), Total $63.4M/Wk 4

I loved Bugonia so much. Twisted, hilarious and super original. I hadn't seen the original Korean movie it was inspired from until just a few days ago and it manages to completely make the story its own and offer something fresh and utterly compelling imo. I know Emma Stone probably isn't going to win a third Oscar at such a young age but dammit if we were going performance wise and not politics or whatever girl should have it in the bag. What a force she is.

Speaking of music biopics, there's a Milli Vanilli movie barely released in the US that is available to see now on various streamers that is absolutely fantastic.

JAW & Glenn Powell, they're not “movie stars” I ain't paying $20+ to see streaming stars with streaming caliber acting in mediocre movies.

The Two Jeremy's have 0 drawing power whatsoever. I can't believe social Network 2 is going with both of them.

I think the star of that project is Aaron Sorkin, much like the stars of the first movie were Sorkin and David Fincher.

Didn't wbd used to own Crunchyroll and sell it off?

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


Time magazine has released a new cover of its upcoming Nov. 10 issue featuring President Donald Trump after the GOP leader heavily critiqued the original image used.


	The legacy publication unveiled the second edition earlier this week, tied to its feature on Trump, who was interviewed about his role in brokering the ceasefire deal between Gaza and Israel. While the former image features the POTUS looking upward framed against the sky with the caption “His Triumph,” the latter depicts Trump with his hands clasped under his chin at the Hayes desk with the subtitle “Trump's World.”

	Unveiled Oct. 14, Trump took significant umbrage with the cover photo initially chosen, writing on Truth Social at 1:36 a.m. ET that night: “Time Magazine wrote a relatively good story about me, but the picture may be the Worst of All Time. They ‘disappeared' my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump has a long established relationship with the newsweekly — both as subject and reader. According to the outlet, as of December 2024, Trump's total cover count exceeds 40, coming behind only Presidents Ronald Reagan and record-holder Richard Nixon. Naturally, this doesn't include the fake covers that had reportedly been hanging in “at least five of his golf clubs,” which featured a cover line exclaiming that “Trump is hitting it on all fronts … even TV!” The existence of the bogus covers, reported by the Washington Post, prompted the magazine to ask Trump to remove them. Since then, several real covers currently hang in various locations inside his Mar-a-Lago residence. Time also named him the Person of the Year in 2016 and 2024.


	Prior to the release of the original cover, the owner of Time, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, made waves over the weekend for comments to The New York Times in which he said he thought Trump was doing a “great job” and “fully” supported the idea of sending federal troops into San Francisco.

	











	According to a report by The Daily Beast, Washington, D.C.-based photographer Stephen Voss's new photo of Trump drew inspiration from Arnold Newman's 1963 photograph of German industrialist and convicted Nazi war criminal Alfried Krupp, which was published by Newsweek, though Time vehemently denied this. (The digital outlet also reported Voss liking comments on Instagram where followers asked about the connection, though he has since seemingly removed his likes.)


	“There is no connection and claims suggesting otherwise are completely untrue,” a Time spokesperson said. “The references for this photoshoot were past presidential portraits in the Oval Office, including TIME's own covers. Giving weight to speculation on social media is reckless and contributes to the spread of misinformation.”

He made sure to hide his turkey neck in the new photo.

Everyone gets the face they deserve – this is his. He needs to deal with it.

Time just showed ITS OWN True Face by putting that first photo of President Trump on the Cover!

EVERYONE Complained about that original Cover photo, not just the President! It was a Joke! A not funny one.

You mad bro?

Just say you live dictators and be done with it. Your face is covered in Cheeto.

Another flip for trump. What does he have on everyone that could make you lose your morals.

	Before Mariska Hargitay ended up as “America's sweetheart sex cop,” as she aptly described herself on her Good Hang with Amy Poehler podcast appearance, the veteran TV actor thought she would be a comedian and tested for Friends “many times.”


	Discussing her affinity for comedy with the Parks and Recreation alumna, Hargitay said “all I wanted to be was you,” reflecting on having come up through The Groundlings, the famed Saturday Night Live pipeline improv school and sketch comedy troupe.


	“I did a lot of [comedy auditions],” Hargitay told Poehler about going out for comedic roles at the beginning of her career. “I did Seinfeld, and I did Single Guy, and I tested for Friends so many times.”

	When asked which part she auditioned for, Hargitay said, “I think it's Monica — so long ago, again. But I always thought that I would end up being on a sitcom or doing comedy, that's what I thought.”

	However, a chance encounter with a psychic, who had come highly recommended by her friends, revealed to her a different destiny.


	At the time, the My Mom Jayne documentarian had just wrapped her time as Cynthia Hooper on ER and was a “struggling actor.” Via her development deal at DreamWorks, she was then working on a dramedy in the vein of Ally McBeal. But while on a routine trip to New York City, she visited a psychic in Long Island at her friends' behest, who “started saying all this amazing stuff to me.”


	“He said to me, Amy, ‘You see that face you're doing right now? You see that face?' … I said, ‘Yeah.' He goes, ‘You're gonna be famous for that face. You're moving to New York, and you're gonna be famous for that face,'” she recalled. “And I said, ‘Uh, no, I live in L.A., and I'm gonna be a comedian because I'm funny, and I'm pretty, and that is a deadly combination.' And he looks at me — and this is my favorite moment in my life — and he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's ass what you say.'” 

	











	She concluded, “Six months later, swear to God, I got SVU.”


	Hargitay has portrayed no-nonsense and fiercely protective New York Police Department officer-turned-captain Olivia Benson in Law & Order: SVU since 1999. The Dick Wolf-created NBC mainstay is currently airing its 27th season.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","For Returning to Myself , Brandi Carlile Had to Get Lost","https://www.avclub.com/brandi-carlile-returning-to-myself","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 03:13:00 GMT","

The title of Brandi Carlile's latest record, Returning to Myself, makes an encouraging first impression. What could possibly be bad about reclaiming selfhood? Isn't that a pop psychology milestone people make guest appearances on daytime talk shows to humble brag about? But Returning to Myself considers the implicit woe of its own declaration: in order to return to oneself, one must first be lost. It's a common existential crisis that worsens when pop culture primes audiences for inspiration instead of reality checks. 

In fairness, Returning to Myself covers its share of triumphs on top of personal travails; it's a fool's errand to argue that Carlile indulges in miserabilism on the tracklist. Granted, in 2025, everyone who isn't ultra-rich, white, or plays a Christian on TV has at least one or fifteen things to feel miserable over. And granted, the last four years of Carlile's life have, at least going by the broad strokes, been good to her as an organizer, a producer, an advocate, a celebrant of the 2024 “Joni Jams,” a parent, and a partner; if Earth is looking worse for the wear, Carlile is holding strong. But when an individual comes to represent so much for so many people, drifting apart from “self” becomes increasingly likely, not to mention easy. 

Loss is loss. If one is lost to addiction or lost in a pattern of decentralized creative work, they are still lost, so Returning to Myself functions as a much-needed course correction for Carlile's career—a pivot back to her own music. Girls Just Wanna Weekend will keep on weekending; the Looking Out Foundation will, in fact, keep looking out. “There's no honor in the pilgrimage / Until a soul returns,” Carlile trills on the record's opener and title track, driving home the importance of fulfilling personal pursuits in between giving to and doing for communities, as she does; no doubt can be cast on her contributions to her industry outside of her discography. At the same time, Carlile has to fill her own cup. If Carlile isn't making music, then the question should be raised: Who is she?

Returning to Myself makes a sufficient answer well before Carlile's propelling an aural stream of scorching social commentary through listeners' earbuds on “Church & State,” where she ratchets up the record's momentum with one of the year's great Americana anthems, where an undulating bassline, distorted guitar chords, tambourine on the high hat, and a defiant chorus all give structure for Carlile's recounting of many Americans' post-2024 election haze: “And in the days that quickly followed / they began to turn to stone / they couldn't stand or speak or swallow / they couldn't get out of bed alone.” 

I'm not a betting sort, but I'll wager many of you are less than eager to revisit the day they woke up to learn that a tyrant had won himself a second tenure in the land's highest office. Let Carlile do the heavy lifting for you instead. She doesn't need separation of church and state to know how to rock. (But also, there's really supposed to be a separation of church and state.) And she doesn't need to torture herself for the sake of stabilizing as an artist, either. Returning to Myself does the difficult work of cracking open the soul to let flow Carlile's vulnerability, sans traces of flagellation; coming back to the studio to lay down new songs following the substantial gap since her 2021 album In These Silent Days, she has a great deal to say, and she says it gently but firmly, with conviction but without forced redress.

The heights of “Church & State,” for instance, are hinted at in “Human,” where Carlile affords herself, her subject, and her audience the gift of grace. “Baby / You're only gonna hurt your back / Looking down like that / Cut yourself a little more slack,” she sings to kick off the track. “Baby / You're gonna have a heart attack / And they won't thank you / They don't make awards for that.” On one hand, Carlile is an exquisite lyricist; on the other, it's very easy to imagine one of her friends or colleagues, or her wife, Catherine Shepherd, as the verse's true source, which would make Carlile a vessel of sorts for the concerns of people who care about her. In turn, that makes her the perfect candidate for relaying the same wisdom back to us, crescendoing in “Human”'s final minute, where the delicacy of her singing and guitar strumming bursts into bright, declarative arena rock—encouragement for allowing ourselves to be imperfect, as all humans are. 

The one exception to the rule here is Joni Mitchell, to whom Carlile dedicates an entire track—“Joni,” of course—toward the album's back half. Joni, in Carlile's accounting, is a “wild woman,” and cursed to boot, but her “curse” is that “she doesn't suffer fools”; nor does she “bandage bruised egos.” Returning to Myself finds a shrewd place for the song in its order, where time enough has passed that the motif has sunk in and we appreciate the dots that can be connected between Carlile and Mitchell, who likewise meant a great deal to a great many people and distinguished herself as “more” than just a musician—though Mitchell, of course, is no mere musician. And neither is Carlile. Maybe one day, a member of Americana's incoming generation will write a song for her just as she has for Mitchell. In the meantime, Returning to Myself succeeds in its task: bringing Carlile into a fresh creative moment where she flourishes.

Bryant Gumbel is “expected to recover” after a sudden medical emergency led to his hospitalization in New York last week, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. The retired “Today” show anchor, 77, was taken from his Manhattan apartment on October 20 around 9 p.m., as reported by TMZ.

“He's not dying,” a source told Page Six, while another insider told TMZ that Gumbel remained in the hospital through Wednesday, October 22, but was “doing OK.” It has not been confirmed whether Gumbel has since returned home, though those close to him were optimistic he would be discharged by Thursday. Details surrounding the nature of the medical incident have not been publicly disclosed. “They're being extremely tight-lipped about it,” one source shared, as per PageSix.

As per photos published by TMZ, days after the hospitalization, Gumbel was photographed walking in New York City alongside his wife, Hilary. The former “Today” co-host wore a black jacket, baseball cap, and sunglasses while Hilary kept close to him. The sighting offered reassurance that Gumbel is regaining strength as he continues to recover.

Hilary later shared the word “gratitude” in a simple Instagram post, signaling quiet relief following the stressful week.

Gumbel's recent hospitalization comes more than a decade after he revealed a lung cancer diagnosis in 2009. At the time, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant tumor and part of his lung.

“It's nothing to hide from,” he said during a guest appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly, as reported by ABC. “They opened up my chest, they took a malignant tumor, and they took part of my lung, and they took some other goodies.”

In 2010, Gumbel told People, “I'm still doing well. Doctors tell me I'm free and clear, so I hope for better times.”

Gumbel hosted “Today” for 15 years beginning in 1982, working alongside Jane Pauley, Katie Couric, and Chris Wallace. He later became the host of HBO's “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,” where he earned widespread respect for his thoughtful reporting and interviewing style.

He shares two children, Bradley and Jillian, with his former wife, June Baranco. Gumbel later married his current wife, Hilary, in 2002.

His brother, fellow broadcaster Greg Gumbel, died in 2023 at age 78 from pancreatic cancer.

A post shared by Marcia Lane (@thenewsjunkiedaily)

Friends and family say Gumbel is now taking time to rest and focus on his health. Those close to him remain positive and expect him to make a full recovery.

Kathy Garver is honoring June Lockhart following the beloved actress's death at age 100. Lockhart died on October 23 in Santa Monica, California, as reported by The New York Times. Garver and Lockhart first met while working together on an episode of the classic Western anthology series “Death Valley Days,” and they remained close for decades after filming.

“Sad to say goodbye to June Lockhart, who died on Thursday at the age of 100,” Garver wrote. “A well-lived life, fulfilled with wonderful roles and a beautiful family.”

A post shared by Kathy Garver (@kgcissy)

Garver recalled that Lockhart played her mentor in the “Death Valley Days” episode, portraying a knowledgeable librarian opposite Garver's character, who was based on a young Isadora Duncan. Their connection extended beyond the screen.

“She just had an inner sense of people and engaged in their energies,” Garver shared.

A post shared by Kathy Garver (@kgcissy)

The actress also remembered a surprising and intimate moment that became one of her most cherished memories.

“We remained in touch for many years. And she even announced on a talk show when I had not told anyone that ‘Kathy, you're pregnant.' She just knew,” Garver wrote.

Her tribute highlighted Lockhart's empathy and intuitive warmth, qualities that endeared her to colleagues and audiences alike.

Garver closed her tribute with a message of love and peace for her longtime friend.

“Her beautiful soul will take flight in heaven, to rest along with my husband David and dear sister Beverly. I know they will welcome her with warmth and love.”

Born in New York City in 1925 to actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, Lockhart stepped into the spotlight early. She made her feature film debut at age 13 in the 1939 adaptation of “A Christmas Carol,” appearing alongside both of her parents.

A post shared by Amazing Time Capsule (@amazingtimecapsule)

Her early film work included titles such as “All This, and Heaven Too,” “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “The Yearling,” and “Sergeant York.” Before joining the “Lassie” series, she appeared in “Son of Lassie” as Priscilla, the granddaughter of the Duke of Rudling.

Over the course of her long career, Lockhart took on dozens of roles across television, film, and stage. She continued performing well into her 80s, with recurring appearances on shows including “Petticoat Junction,” “General Hospital,” and “Beverly Hills 90210.” She also made guest appearances on series such as “The Beverly Hillbillies,” “Happy Days,” “Full House,” “Roseanne,” and “Grey's Anatomy.”

Lockhart leaves behind a legacy of warmth, intelligence, grace, and a body of work that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Her impact on television history and on those who worked with her will endure for generations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Keanu Reeves Steps Out After Scary Incident With ‘Divine Wife'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/keanu-reeves-divine-wife-encounter-grace/","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 01:32:17 GMT","

Keanu Reeves was back out in New York City this week, just days after an unsettling encounter with a fan outside his Broadway show. The 61-year-old actor looked calm and collected as he ran a few errands in the Big Apple on Thursday.

Reeves kept things low-key, wearing black trousers, a blue hoodie, and a brown blazer layered over the top, in photos published by the Daily Mail. He wrapped a bright red scarf around his neck and paired the look with brown boots and a printed cap. Carrying a black backpack and a reusable DoorDash bag, the “John Wick” star looked like any other New Yorker going about his day.

The relaxed outing came not long after Reeves found himself in a frightening situation outside the Hudson Theatre, where he's currently starring in Waiting For Godot, directed by Jamie Lloyd. Over the weekend, a woman claiming to be his “divine wife” tried to approach him as he left the theater.

In videos shared on social media, the woman could be heard yelling, “Keanu, it's your divine wife!” before trying to open the door of the car he was getting into. Security quickly stepped in to stop her, dragging her away as she continued to shout.

Even as chaos unfolded, Reeves stayed composed. He smiled and waved to fans at the stage door before quietly slipping into his car to head home. Witnesses nearby could be heard urging security to “get her out of here,” while one person filming said, “You guys need a restraining order on this one.”

The woman was eventually pulled to the ground and escorted away, but Reeves didn't react publicly or show any anger. Fans online have since praised how he handled the moment, calling him “graceful,” “professional,” and “the definition of calm under pressure.”

Reeves has stayed focused on his stage work, playing Estragon in the classic play. While one critic from The New York Post said he seemed “stiff” in his Broadway debut, audience members have shared a different story—posting glowing reviews and calling the show “an emotional triumph.”

Through it all, Reeves has continued to do what he's always done: stay kind, keep working, and avoid the drama. As one fan put it on X (formerly Twitter), “Even when people act wild, Keanu stays cool. That's why everyone loves him.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Lost in Space' Star Pays Tear-Jerking Tribute to Her Beloved TV Mom June Lockhart","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/marta-kristen-tribute-june-lockhart/","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 03:07:51 GMT","

Marta Kristen is remembering her longtime co-star and on-screen mother, June Lockhart, following Lockhart's passing at age 100. The two starred together on the CBS sci-fi series “Lost in Space,” where Lockhart played Dr. Maureen Robinson and Kristen played her daughter, Judy. Their connection continued long after filming ended.

“June Lockhart! She was one great dame,” Kristen shared, in a heartwarming, lengthy tribute. “She had unparalleled tenacity and intelligence. I'm not surprised she lived to be 100.”

A post shared by Christopher Baum (@scifi_revisited)

Kristen recalled a moment during production that revealed Lockhart's vibrant personality.“While filming ‘Lost in Space,' June would often go out on Friday evenings after a long day on the set,” she said. “I especially remember one Friday when I saw her coming out of her dressing room, and I could not help but gawk.”

A post shared by Rubens Valle (@rubensavalle)

Kristen described Lockhart in a striking outfit of green and white crocheted bell-bottoms with a matching top, her hair loose and glowing. “She was magnificent,” Kristen wrote in her tribute: “A Rock 'n' Roll Queen.”

Kristen also remembered Lockhart's generosity and sense of adventure. When Kristen was planning a fiftieth birthday surprise for her late husband, she hoped to arrange a ride on the Goodyear Blimp. Not knowing where to begin, she turned to Lockhart.

“June immediately said that she would arrange this with one condition – that she be a part of the birthday surprise and excursion,” Kristen shared. “Of course, I said yes. As you could imagine, we all had one helluva day in the air.”

A post shared by Joe Bushor (@joebushor)

Kristen said countless stories demonstrate Lockhart's intelligence, humor, and curiosity. “She loved life, and life loved her,” she wrote.

“Her zest for life, whether it be listening to David Bowie or being honored by NASA with a public achievement medal for her dedication to space exploration, is just a few examples of why we all loved her.”

A post shared by Arts 🐾🐾 (@memories.official)

“I treasure all of the moments, both professional and personal, I was blessed to experience with this incredible, intelligent, and beautiful woman,” Kristen said. “My heartfelt condolences to her loving family. June's light will continue to shine. Rest in Peace, my dear friend.”

A post shared by Gr8erDays (@gr8erdays)

Lockhart leaves behind a legacy defined by grace, wit, and a lifelong love of storytelling. Her work on “Lost in Space,” “Lassie,” and countless film and television roles continues to resonate with audiences across generations.

Colleagues, fans, and loved ones remember her not only for her talent but for her curiosity, humor, and generous spirit. Her light, as her co-stars say, will continue to shine.

Sometimes, even the Google AI Overview gets it right. Sometimes. In searching out confirmation as to when Scott Cooper‘s Bruce Springsteen film, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” first tacked on that “Springsteen,” a quick Google search helped, as did the AI Overview leering at me from the top of the page.

Important findings reigned. First up: “The initial title of the film was ‘Deliver Me from Nowhere,' based on Warren Zanes' book” (true!). Next: “The title was officially changed to ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere‘ in June 2025, according to news reports and the movie's production status updates” (well, really, it was a new trailer, but OK). Finally: “The change was made to make it clear to the audience that the film is a biopic about Bruce Springsteen.” Ah, well.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		




Related Stories Oscar Winners Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers Used a ‘Sinners' Camera and More to Preserve Cinema History in ‘The Eyes of Ghana' Jeremy Strong Loves Figuring Out Real People, from Mark Zuckerberg to Jon Landau in ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere' 

Except, well, it's not really. At least, not in the way that a potential movie-goer who is not already a fan of The Boss would expect to see if they're hitting the multiplex to check out the “Springsteen biopic.” Adding his name to the front of film's title — again, a title pulled directly from a much-loved and well-known book on the subject — was the first sign that the 20th Century Studios powers that be were getting a little squirrelly about their big fall feature.

 










What is “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” really about? As our own David Ehrlich wrote in his review out of Telluride, it “is a semi-desolate sketch of a biopic about a depressed 32-year-old man” who  is also “haunted by unresolved childhood trauma and suffering from a depression that he knows how to sing about but lacks the words to diagnose” and “is at its best during the frequent stretches when it finds Bruce staring at the walls of his isolated rental home in Colts Neck.”

Trailers for the film — which has now screened at Telluride, New York Film Festival, and AFI Fest, to name a few, so it's certainly not hiding — play up the more glitzy and recognizable moments of Springsteen's career. These are also moments that have relatively little to do with the film itself. If moviegoers are taking marketing on its face, who could blame them for expecting to see a film about Bruce and the E Street Band on the road? That's what this trailer opens with.

Or, consider this clip, the only one on 20th Century Studios' dedicated “Deliver Me from Nowhere” YouTube page, which is entirely comprised of a performance of “Born to Run.” For those keeping track, Cooper's film is about the creation of Springsteen's album “Nebraska.” “Born to Run” is not a track that appears on that album. And while this performance is indeed part of the film, it's a very weird pick to represent the entire feature.

 










Look, I'm the last person to think that a film about a depressive episode in a global superstar's early career makes for the easiest of sells. (Well, small note here, I think most musical biopics should probably be about a depressive episode in a global superstar's early career, but I don't run a film studio.) I get the impulse to try to make this look like something more broad, but that's a mistake. 

I worry that when even casual Bruce fans show up to see the movie, they'll expect to see what they've seen in the trailers: The Boss jumping around on stage, playing “Born in the U.S.A.,” celebrating another smash hit show with the E Street Band. Hell, they'll expect to see significantly more of the E Street Band in general.

This is not that film. It's better for it, and it's also a much tougher sell.

Other marketing, the kind of stuff that people who would need to seek out (like, oh, big fans of Bruce) is more honest, like this featurette all about Cooper's approach to this specific time in The Boss' life and career. Cooper isn't shying away from what sort of film he's made, even if audiences might be surprised. As he told IndieWire earlier this week, “So many people have preconceived notions about a music film about Bruce Springsteen. Or a film that they want to see, like the ‘Born in the U.S.A.' or ‘Born to Run' story. … This is probably the most unexpected story that folks will get about a music icon. … I'm realizing this film is not what people expected. Now, whether it's what they wanted is another thing.”

 










If it's not clear: I am a huge Springsteen fan. I've seen him live over a dozen times — that includes actual concerts, performances at premieres (like the NYFF premiere), and quite literally live in his own home studio when I interviewed him for “Western Stars” in 2019 — and the prospect of a biopic uniquely tailored to some of Springsteen's continuing obsessions, interests, and neuroses is particularly appealing to me. And, based on the general queries I've made of other Bruce fans, that holds true for them, too.

(Fun fact: Ehrlich's older brother is a Springsteen freak who has seen him in concert so many times that he's pushing triple digits with his count. When I asked David if Steven is excited to see the film, he said he was “frothing at the mouth.”) Now that's an audience to bank on and appeal to. 

Those are not the people who need a trailer or a clip or a title that simplifies what they're going to see (or, if we're being more candid about it, just kind of lies about it). Those are the people who will come multiple times, tell their fellow fans to check it out, to champion it. They're Bruce fans; dedication is part of their DNA. Don't ever count them out. Like the Boss, they're tougher than the rest. Selling this film to them does not have to be.

A 20th Century Release, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” hits theaters on Friday, October 24.

8.6

Genre:

Metal

Label:

Immortal / Epic

Reviewed:

October 26, 2025

The sobs are real. About five minutes into “Daddy,” the finale of Korn's self-titled 1994 debut, the band slams back in after a brief rumbling lull. This last chorus is intended to be the climax, one more chance for Jonathan Davis to recount not only the brutal circumstances of his boyhood rape but also the barbaric way his parents ignored the wounds, even insisting he was making it all up. By the time the song ends, though, that parting salvo feels only like an afterthought, a recent memory whose shape has already started to blur.

For the last hour, the 23-year-old Davis has offered himself as a new breed of heavy-metal singer, able to chain the melodic finesse of Rob Zombie to the guttural power of death metal to these strange, savage glossolalia spurts that suggest he's turned hell's waiting room into a Charismatic Christian outpost. But as Davis shouts the parting question of his parental jeremiad—“My god, saw you watch/Mommy, why your own child?”—his voice suddenly frays, a strong rope under immense strain for two decades finally giving way. He's lost it by the time he reaches his last words, gulping so much air that it's hard to tell if he's laughing at adolescence's cruel absurdity or crying because of it. And then, he bawls—four minutes of muffled, strangling sobs interrupted only by a spontaneous tirade about hating the people who had done that to him, the people who made him want to die. As Davis wallows on the studio floor, his band plays on, improvising against injury. He slams a door, and the song ends.

Especially if you're hearing it for the first time, that passage can feel gratuitous or even gross, a little bit of California theatrics meant to give a band named Korn a bump of gravitas. Davis, after all, had toyed with tears during “Daddy” a year earlier, half-laughing as he seemed to fake them while cutting the band's Neidermeyer's Mind demo with Ross Robinson, the pal who was becoming their producer. But this time, when Robinson noticed that Davis was actually losing it, he motioned for the band to keep going, to let this play out. The tape never stopped rolling. The result is gratuitous, but it is also uncomfortable, affecting, and true—a vivid reminder that art can at times simply mean an unapologetic release of all the pain that helped shape the person making it.

That is an end-to-end encapsulation of Korn, a 66-minute emotional expulsion during which a damaged man who had given up his beloved job as a coroner's assistant turns himself inside out, exposing the most wounded parts of his body and brain to the rest of the world because he doesn't know what else to do with them. There is so much to say about these dozen songs—the way they pulled the seven-string guitar from the annals of obscurity, the way they reimagined bass tones and drum placement in the context of modern heavy metal, the way they stitched an adoration of extreme music writ large into the unruly chimera that became nu metal. Sure, its predecessors are clear, from the collected early works of Mike Patton to the unrepentant rabble-rousing of N.W.A. and Body Count, from Florida's death metal glower to Los Angeles' hair metal glow and Seattle's grunge insurgency. Still, Korn is the rare record that sounds like a new thought, a breakthrough dispatch from a frontier that others had only thought might exist.

The real spirit of Korn, though, is how completely Davis splits himself open, how candid he allows himself to be about the pains of being an ostensibly permanent pariah. The crying is only the culmination of everything that happens before it, the dam breaking after the waters have pushed against it for too long. He clowns the tough guy who took a swing at him during a show as a hypermasculine poser. He asks for deliverance from a speed addiction so severe that his penis is disappearing beneath his pubic hair. And, in one of the mightiest songs about bullying ever put to tape, he repeatedly calls himself by his teenage nickname, “HIV,” and hurls the endless string of homophobic insults he's heard all his life and that have made him question his own identity back at whatever abusers happen to be listening.

Korn would soon be rightfully associated with a big, dumb, macho scene that broke stuff at Woodstock '99 and, while we're being real, a scene whose lingering big, dumb, macho energy is still helping to break notions of American progress a quarter-century later. But Korn is the opposite of that—a musically weaponized expression of total vulnerability. Kurt Cobain had been dead for only seven months when Korn released their debut, and Davis represented a sudden frameshift for singers who saw songs as a sort of bloodletting for misery. He stripped away any grand sense of writerly ambition to tell you exactly what he'd witnessed and how awful it still made him feel, rendering himself and his past completely naked in the present. His words were as direct as his tears. It is not surprising that, two decades later, it is still Davis' favorite Korn album. Yes, it's by far the best one, but it's also where he becomes his own exorcist, getting beyond his dreadful history by screaming about it in ways that still sound like a personal reinvention.

Korn came from Bakersfield, the mid-sized Southern California city often overlooked in favor of much bigger neighbors in every direction. Bakersfield helped crystallize the classic country version of masculinity. A decade after the singer Buck Owens settled there, at the edge of the San Joaquin Valley, in the early '50s, Bakersfield steadily emerged as a West Coast counterpart to the country music hubs in Texas and Tennessee. It was an oil-and-farming town that seemed the antithesis of Hollywood, a couple hours or so south.

The Bakersfield Sound that Owens established and Merle Haggard soon epitomized was defined not only by its musical atavism but also its emotional conformity, with the man as a domestic bedrock. During an admittedly great 1969 breakup song that became a massive hit, he asked, “Who's going to be your puppy dog when I'm a thing of the past?/Hey, who's going to mow your grass?” Haggard, meanwhile, was offering to kick some Unamerican ass, and hippies became his most popular punchline. Bakersfield wasn't some cornerstone of the Summer of Love or a California idyll; it was hard, hot, dry. “Either you were a drug addict, or you got someone pregnant and had to get a job,” as Davis later put it.” “There was no place to go.” So crying on tape? Singing about daddy issues? Not so much.

But Jonathan's dad, Rick, offered an unexpected link between that Bakersfield past and his son's future. In the early '90s, Rick leased Owens' once-palatial Bakersfield studio, dubbing it Fat Tracks. He'd toured in bands himself, with the hair flowing down his back earning him homophobic insults and hippy ignominy, too. Still, as you might have intuited from “Daddy,” father and son were not exactly simpatico. After his parents divorced when he was 3, Davis became a shuttlecock for broken homes, living with his mother and stepfather until the man busted the drum kit he got at 13. He retreated to his dad's place, where his stepmother would pour homemade hot sauce down his mouth just for laughs. She kicked him out at 18. “She was a twisted, sadistic shit. She was a fucking wicked witch,” Davis once told Melody Maker. “I hate her for taking my teenage years.”

The year Davis turned 18, five young Bakersfield musicians who called themselves Love and Peace Dude, or L.A.P.D., realized they had no future there, maybe aside from day jobs at the world's largest ice cream factory in town. In Hollywood and then Huntington Beach, they shared a rehearsal space with their heroes in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, sold weed, and signed a record contract so parsimonious they had to portion out Del Taco burritos just to subsist during sessions. They bailed on the deal, broke up the band, and started another one, Creep. When their new singer turned out to be, well, a creep, they cracked that one open, too. They—a nameless quartet of two guitarists dubbed Munky and Head, a bassist called Fieldy, and the drummer David Silveria—went looking for yet another singer.

Munky and Head found him back in Bakersfield, during a night out at a local dive while visiting family. Davis had become a Duran Duran obsessive, and he wanted to be as beautiful as his New Romantic heroes. A championship bagpipe player accustomed to sporting kilts in competitions, Davis now stalked through Bakersfield wearing makeup, frilly shirts, and even dresses, being lampooned as gay seemingly everywhere he turned, even being sent to a “gay counselor” at one point.

He was in drag with his band Sexart the night that his voice stunned the two guitarists, who went home and told the rest of the band about the find. Fieldy's dad had been in a group long ago with Davis' dad, and his mom had been Jonathan's babysitter. He called Davis, lied about a record deal this new act didn't actually have, and offered to buy him a bus ticket if he would try out. Davis relented, though it meant leaving behind a job that had become an outlet for all his lingering rage—a coroner, or, as Fieldy once put it, “the guy who literally picked up bodies off the streets” and even brandished a dead fetus in a jar to impress his friends.

It did not take long for Korn—which, I regret to inform you, possibly took its name from an anecdote Davis heard about eating ass—to actually land that record deal. After cultivating an audience in Huntington Beach by playing parties in their rented rehearsal space there, they began chartering buses of fans and friends for the hour ride north to gigs on the Sunset Strip. In a matter of months, those shows—and a demo tape—earned them multiple major-label offers. They opted, instead, for Immortal, an upstart label that was barely older than their band but that was tapping into the same hybridized energy as Korn with the Judgement Night soundtrack, where Cypress Hill met Sonic Youth, where Helmet met House of Pain.

The band soon took the party with them. A few years their elder, Ross Robinson, the producer, led them to Indigo Ranch, a secluded studio above Malibu dotted with stands of cactus but also filled with the kind of pristine vintage gear that his dad had fantasized about for his Bakersfield space. That's where Neil Young had made his most mystic acoustic music ever in the mid-'70s, where Megadeth had built a sizable chunk of thrash metal's foundation a decade later with Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!. The outcast had arrived.

Some members would stay up for days on end, high on meth or drunk on entire cases of beer or bottles of Jägermeister. They partied so hard that Indigo Ranch's owner, Richard Kaplan, frequently threatened to kick them out. Still, Robinson—a health obsessive and wheatgrass devotee who pushed his habits onto the band—would drag them out of the studio for canyon hikes each morning, trying to sober the band up before they started the cycle again.

Toward the end of the sessions, Robinson and the band decamped to Bakersfield, in part so Davis could score “a big ol' fat rock of meth” from his dealer, and so that they could track vocals, incidentally, at Fat Tracks, his dad's place. Rick had encouraged his son not to be a musician, yet here was his kid and his strung-out friends in their much-hyped Los Angeles band, cutting their big-deal debut in his space. (A year later, the local news called Rick Davis a “proud father,” and he suddenly sounded like his kid's self-help coach: “Chase your dreams … and if you don't have dreams, you don't have anything.”) For all the people that had called Davis “faggot” and smashed his childhood instruments, he was now lashing back out from one of the city's truly sacred spaces—the old empire of Buck Owens.

That's the way I hear nu metal's most famous opening line, too: “Are you ready?” This is what Davis growls at the end of a minute-long intro to “Blind,” where Munky and Head pull a razorwire riff until the tension feels like a musical garrote. It is a question as much for Davis as for an audience that he doesn't really have yet. For the first two decades of his life, Davis had been told by his parents and by Bakersfield generally that he wasn't enough, that he didn't belong. So was he finally ready to step into this potentially better act?

Korn toggles between what has been and what could be for much of its hour. As “Blind” settles in after that opening eruption, Davis tries his best to croon about rare places of sanctuary, where he can hide away from the rest of his threatening world. “I dream to live a life that seems to be a lost reality” he barks on the bridge, his staccato voice a wide-awake introduction to his mutated death metal growl. That sound would prompt a generation or three to reconsider how heavy music might sound.

Davis needs us to know that the odds against his success and sanity have always been long. It's tempting to hear “Shoots and Ladders,” for instance, as some weirdo variety show for the bagpipes that open it, the nonsense vocal paroxysms that shape the climax, and the patchwork of nursery rhymes that frames the entire song. But if Davis' bagpipes sound especially elegiac, it's because this is a mourning song for innocence lost so early it barely existed at all. “Hidden violence revealed darkness that seems real,” he sings to end the chorus, his voice somehow stuck between lullaby and tantrum. “Look at the pages that cause all this evil.” I've always wondered if this song netted Korn its only Grammy nomination because the voters spotted this literary criticism of nursery rhymes, or because they could simply recognize the nursery rhymes. I've always assumed the latter.

The neuroses run as deep as the desire to overcome them. Davis' “need” in “Need To,” after all, is about finding someone to support and love him, about looking for a relationship that, for the first time, won't make him feel exploited. He worries he doesn't have the tools to let anyone be close to him, the skills to be more than just another broken person. “Fake” is a tantrum directed at an authority figure (presumably one of his four parents or stepparents) whose power is just a pose. Davis breathlessly interrogates ideas of manhood, authenticity, and fear, resenting being told to do something by someone who doesn't know themselves. “I think being a person relies on one thing/Be yourself, let you come through,” he sings a little like Scott Walker, the guitars warping so as to suggest a soaring string section. It is one of the most plainly moralizing moments in Korn's 30-year discography, a moment of total lucidity that feels like an essential mission statement: You can be better than your abusers and detractors by simply being not full of shit.

The rest of Korn had his back. That quiet moment during “Fake” is a rare bit of respite amid these 12 tracks. They are, for the most part, like the militia at his side and rear, ready to defend Davis as he lambastes the people who have hurt and harassed him. That ability owes, at least in part, to the band's idiosyncratic setup.

In the early '90s, Munky had fallen for the strange sounds of Steve Vai's athletic guitar, always moving like an elite gymnast who had unlocked an extra limb. When he learned that Vai was playing a seven-string Ibanez, he not only got one for himself but also convinced his bandmate Head to try one, too. The tandem tweaked the instruments, adjusting the strings and springs so that the sound was deeper and thicker, covering bits of the spectrum a bass would ordinarily manage. That allowed the band's actual bassist, Fieldy, to approach his instrument differently, channeling an early love of funk-rock into distinct lead lines. With five strings instead of four, Fieldy could slide upward into some space normally reserved for guitars, adding licks and even taking stunted solos in the room abdicated by Head and Munky. All these tonal shifts meant the bass wasn't always tied to the drums, too, so that Silveria could move more freely. He responded to the rest of the band in real time, his hits sometimes landing, crucially, like Davis' fists.

To wit, on “Ball Tongue,” a break-up song with an old friend, Davis recounts all the ways he's been disappointed until he just runs out of words. He repeatedly hurls himself into inscrutable scat outbursts, his annoyance beyond ordinary expression. (He was, mind you, also freaking out on meth in his dad's studio during this take.) Especially at the start, Silveria's drums are enormous, each hit lasting longer than it needs. Head and Munky's guitars sound like sirens or a mind spinning out, while Fieldy seems to be slapping at Silveria's every beat, a mountain lion pawing at a house cat's toy. It is intentionally mean, the four old friends telling their new pal's old friend to fuck off forever. And during “Helmet in the Bush,” a song about trying to overcome an addiction that is breaking Davis' body, they become his backbone, forever trying to pull him back toward the center as he spirals.

Nowhere is this more apparent and important than on Korn's centerpiece and longest song (outros excepted), “Faget.” For the next four years, and perhaps even for the next 30, it would stand as Korn's most totemic and persuasive number, though Immortal dared not serve it as a single for all the obvious reasons, from clear FCC violations to how absolutely homophobic it initially seems. At this point, Davis had endured so many homophobic insults that he tried “be[-ing] with a guy,” as he later put it, to see if he might actually be gay. That didn't stop their name-calling or his self-doubt.

The band is devastatingly heavy as Davis relays all this, Fieldy and Silveria pulverizing every beat and Head and Munky flipping between one riff that suggests a buzzsaw and another that conjures an anxiety attack. Davis often sounds small beside his bandmates in the first half, as if they are a street gang brandishing their clubs while hiding him from an enemy. But he steps into the fore during the back half, repeatedly screaming “All my life/Who am I?” while the band rises around him. Korn would never sound tougher or more unified than they did by song's end, when Davis takes back the thing everyone's always called him and wields it now like a weapon of his own creation. “I'm just a faggot,” he yells. It is an astonishing moment—of power, of solidarity, of saying you shouldn't bully me, my friends, or anyone else who's different ever again, you asshole.

When Immortal was courting Korn, the label promised tours with L.A. hip-hop bros House of Pain and New York hardcore lugs Biohazard—“an insane dream come true,” as Fieldy later wrote. Even those bands' edgiest material felt like simplistic goofs compared to Davis' trauma exposés, clad in his band's hyper-flexible armor. Biohazard and House of Pain were mean to Korn on those runs, as the members later remembered. Perhaps they saw the future arriving in real time and realized there was no space for themselves there? It took nearly a year for Korn to land on the Billboard 200, finally debuting in August 1995 but never rising very high. The record, though, stuck around like some unshakeable cold, remaining on the chart for well over a year.

When its follow-up, Life is Peachy, debuted at No. 3 in November 1996, Korn still shared space on the index. Two months later, they were playing arenas while opening for Metallica, a band they'd publicly dissed; a little more than a year later, after releasing their titanic Follow the Leader, they were leading their own Family Values Tour into arenas, parading Limp Bizkit and Ice Cube around orgiastic extravaganzas that made Korn feel like the world's wildest party. Within four years, they'd gone from tracking methed-up vocals in Bakersfield to headlining the homes of NBA teams, a true insurgency of misfits clad in Adidas tracksuits.

Perhaps they banged their heads into the walls of fame too hard. By the time he was 30, Davis was telling stories about doing coke off the Bible, smashing glass tables with beer bottles in strip clubs, and being sandwiched inside many threesomes with sisters, all with the retrospective romantic gloss of a wounded war veteran. (It is little surprise that both Fieldy and Head would eventually write memoirs about their Christian conversions.) Or perhaps Davis had emptied so much of himself with Korn that there was very little lift to give, too few unexamined scars to turn into song. Robinson, after all, remembered basically bullying Davis into that earlier confessional mode for subsequent records, bringing up the stepmother who had forced capsaicin down his gullet to elicit the kind of visceral reaction that made Korn so compelling.

It didn't really work. Korn got dumb—and quickly. In the same timeframe that Korn found overwhelming fame, Davis morphed from the guy calling himself “HIV” and attempting to own every homophobic slur that had hit him to calling Fred Durst a “little faggot ho” in a lazy schoolyard taunt that included a Hanson joke. The hits off that same album, Follow the Leader, were a string of stylized nothings and a litany of grievances against his record label. Sure, that second one, “Freak on a Leash,” is maybe the perfect encapsulation of Korn's musical dynamic. Still, complaining about corporate overlords makes for light reading compared to the turmoil of Korn.

I am not going to tell you that Korn remains some great American rock band or apologize for the very worst of the music they have since made. (During the last 25 years, I concede, they have sounded sporadically revelatory.) But I will forever say that Korn does not belong in the conversations about school shootings, toxic masculinity, and incel culture into which Korn itself has sometimes been placed. It is an album about getting fucked over by the world and trying to find a safe space for yourself in spite of it all. Almost all the violent things happen to Davis here. “Should I pray/For all the hate to go away?” he offers in response, the rhythm beneath him brooding but calm as he tries to figure out his own way forward.

Nu metal built its own funeral pyre at Woodstock '99, where the inglorious excesses of the '90s gathered for one final summer shindig before the ostensible death march toward Y2K. A teenage boy still sequestered at home with strict parents, I wasn't there, but I did watch it on pay-per-view via satellite TV. I was 16, and it was all thrilling until it wasn't, until the whole thing collapsed into some topless Mad Max clusterfuck. To me, the energy of that weekend still drifts into American public life like the smoke from the bonfires that burned on the last night. It was a moment of unchecked American arrogance, of community being subsumed by the need for a good time for me and mine only.

As the album that helped launch nu metal, Korn can arguably be seen as one match that helped light that weekend. MTV, after all, reported an alleged gang rape during their Friday night set, a performance that has often been cited as a catalyst for the chaos that soon followed. I recently rewatched their hour onstage, however, and I was struck mostly by its frailty and vulnerability. Davis tries to remain upright and find the high notes at the edge of heat exhaustion; the other members (the glistening and shirtless Silveria excepted) seem perplexed by their tough-guy decisions to wear sweatsuits and khakis. Davis bounds across the stage in a reflective black kilt, studded with silver and wearing a traditional Scottish sporran. At one point, he plays bagpipes for nearly two minutes.

But the moment that reminds me who Korn had been, how good they could be, and how different they still were from the Mansons, Bizkits, and Buckcherrys of the day arrives 40 minutes in, when they segue into “Faget” through an ominous drone. With the “HIV” tattoo on his left arm in plain view, he tells a few hundred thousand people about what he endured back in Bakersfield. By the time they hit the song's existential crux—“All my life/Who am I?”—they sound like an army marching on the path to find out. “I'm just a faggot,” Davis eventually screams, Head repeating the slur like a schoolyard bully. Davis keeps yelling it, anyway, as if he's trying to beat that word until it breaks in half, until its power leeches out into nothingness.

By and large, nu metal became the domain of angry boys airing their childhood grievances or broadcasting their kinks for megalithic audiences. That era made monsters out of young men simply trying to work through their adolescent shit and often failing. By the time they became TRL favorites, Korn were little different than the peers their popularity had partially enabled—almost as prurient as Manson, almost as puerile as Bizkit, almost as pouty as Eminem. But that moment at Woodstock made it clear how different Korn had temporarily been and how different Korn is, even as the scene it helped render reached its ridiculous zenith. Davis had been born into a fucked-up time and place. For once in his life, he just wanted to answer “All my life/Who am I?” in any way that didn't make him feel like a failure.

Radiohead talked about their upcoming European tour and opened up about why they needed to take a nearly decade-long break in the band's first interview together in years.


	“I guess the wheels came off a bit, so we had to stop,” Thom Yorke told The Times UK about the band's vibes by the end of their tour in support of 2016's A Moon Shaped Pool. “There were a lot of elements. The shows felt great but it was, like, let's halt now before we walk off this cliff.”


	“And I needed to stop anyway,” Yorke added. “Because I hadn't really given myself time to grieve,” referring to the death of Rachel Owen, his former partner and mother of his children who died from cancer in 2016. “[My grief] was coming out in ways that made me think, I need to take this away.”


	“Music can be a way to find meaning in things and the idea of having to stop it, even when it makes sense to, because you're not well? Even at my lowest point? I can't,” Yorke said of touring at the time. “I need something that I can hold on to. But there have been points in my life where I have looked for solace in music and played the piano, but it literally hurts. Physically. The music hurts, because you're going through trauma.”

	Guitarist Ed O'Brien added that by the end of the A Moon Shaped Pool tour, he was “effectively over Radiohead.” “It wasn't great on the last round. I enjoyed the gigs but hated the rest. We felt disconnected, fucking spent. It happens. This has been our whole life — what else is there? Look, success has a funny effect on people — I just didn't want to do it any more. And I told them that,” O'Brien said.

	











	“I went through a very long dark night of the soul. I had a deep depression. I hit the bottom in 2021. And one of the things that was lovely coming out of it was realizing how much I love these guys. I met them when I was 17 and I have gone from thinking I can't see myself doing it again to realizing that, you know, we do have some stellar songs.”

	For the band's upcoming tour, Yorke sent the list of 65 potential setlist songs to his band mates. “Which we're all frantically learning,” guitarist Jonny Greenwood said. “Then Thom will turn up and say, let's not do half.” Unlike some other recent reunion tours with rigid setlists, the band's shows will differ from night to night. “We have too many songs,” Yorke added.


	The band also talked at length about the Israel-Hamas conflict and their perceived “whitewashing genocide” in Palestine; Jonny Greenwood is married to an Israeli artist and spends a lot of time in the region.


	“A few times recently I've had ‘Free Palestine!' shouted at me on the street. I talked to a guy. His shtick was, ‘You have a platform, a duty and must distance yourself from Jonny,'” Yorke told the Times UK. “But I said, ‘You and me, standing on the street in London, shouting at each other? Well, the true criminals, who should be in front of the ICC [International Criminal Court], are laughing at us squabbling among ourselves in the public realm and on social media — while they just carry on with impunity, murdering people.' It's an expression of impotency. It's a purity test, low-level Arthur Miller witch-hunt. I utterly respect the dismay but it's very odd to be on the receiving end.”

	While some members of the band, notably O'Brien, have voiced their support for a “Free Palestine” on social media, drummer Philip Selway added, “What [the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement] are asking of us is impossible. They want us to distance ourselves from Jonny, but that would mean the end of the band and Jonny is coming from a very principled place. But it's odd to be ostracized by artists we generally felt quite aligned to.”


	Radiohead was also asked what the future of the band is after these European shows, and whether they'll perform new music on the trek. “I don't know,” Jonny Greenwood said. “We haven't thought past the tour.” Yorke added, “I'm just stunned we got this far.”

Gary Clark Jr. played a surprise set for F1 attendees in Austin last weekend, taking over the city's Franklin Barbecue for a private show sponsored by Velocity Black.


	The invite-only event transformed Austin's famed barbecue joint into an intimate showcase for the rock and soul star, who played an hour-long set that included his hits like “Things Are Changing” and “Low Down Rolling Stone,” as well as a cover of Jimi Hendrix's “Little Wing.”


	Clark Jr., who was born and raised in Austin, was joined by wife Nicole Trunfio (a successful model-turned-entrepreneur of maternity brand, Bumpsuit), while other guests in the crowd included Aston Martin Formula 1 development driver Jak Crawford; Franklin Barbecue owner Aaron Franklin; and ambassadors for whiskey brand Glenfiddich, celebrating the brand's ongoing collaboration with the Aston Martin team.


	“I got a call to play music at a barbecue joint and I couldn't turn it down,” Clark Jr. told the crowd of 50 or so guests by way of introductions. “I'm trying to find my groove right now,” he said minutes later: “I did myself a disservice and had a whole bunch of barbecue, so this might be a low down blues set,” he joked.




	Though thousands of racing fans descended upon Austin for the 2025 U.S. Grand Prix, the night was reserved exclusively for members of Velocity Black, a luxury digital concierge service that offers insider access to premium dining, entertainment and travel experiences around the world — all from the convenience of a handy app. Velocity Black's team of insiders come from the worlds of aviation, fashion and hospitality and can curate everything from a private jet pickup, to bespoke getaways, to scoring tickets to sold-out sporting events and concerts (think everything from World Series tickets to Sabrina Carpenter seats). Members also get access to special events tailored to their profile and interests, with the app using custom-built tech to identify “hyper-personalized experiences,” per a company memo.

	Access to the private Clark Jr. and Franklin Barbecue event was available only to Velocity Black members, who received invitations through the Velocity Black app as a complimentary perk of membership. The restaurant — which typically closes as soon as its meat is sold out for the day — re-opened exclusively in the evening, with Franklin pitmasters smoking up brisket, ribs and turkey to pair with the Glenfiddich x Aston Martin F1 16-year single malt. The party and music continued afterwards with a Dwight Yoakam concert at the Moody Center, with an official after-party in a members-only speakeasy dubbed “The Hideaway by Velocity Black.”

	Velocity Black has also been the official Luxury Lifestyle Partner of the Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 team for the last three years, and Velocity Black members were able to access dedicated VIP tables in the Aston Martin paddock club lounge over the weekend, while taking in private garage tours and pit lane walks. Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso even made a surprise appearance in the paddock club the day before the race.


	Velocity Black's activations in Austin will continue on beyond the race, with the “Hideaway” returning to the Moody Center later this fall, offering VIP access in the “most exclusive corner of the arena's event floor” for the upcoming Tate McRae and Billie Eilish concerts.

For years, the testing facility has been known for housing secret objects due to its history of developing classified technology 

BOMBSHELL footage shows a mysterious “UFO-like” aircraft being tested during secret experiments at a US military-linked base.

Investigative YouTuber Anders Otteson told The Sun how he camped on public land overlooking defence firm Lockheed Martin's Helendale radar-testing facility, where he filmed the unknown object.

The footage, shot from a distance, shows what appears to be a dark, wing-shaped object mounted at the top of a white pillar.

It was inside the premises of Lockheed Helendale, a facility used by the firm's secretive Skunk Works division, which is in the middle of a remote desert.

Skunk Works is the official pseudonym of the US defence company's Advanced Development Programs (ADP) – which develops top secret aircraft and weapons. 

For years, the testing facility has been known for housing secret objects due to its history of developing classified, high-tech aerospace technology.

Some of America's most groundbreaking and classified aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, are known to have been developed at this facility. 

And secrecy surrounding Skunk Works' projects has fueled public speculation and conspiracy theories that the organisation is involved in reverse-engineering alien technology.

Throughout the clip, the object, which resembles an aircraft fuselage, can be seen floating on top of the pillar as if it were being radar-tested. 

In one frame, a distinct blue area can be spotted on its upper surface.

Mr Otteson, who runs a YouTube channel to document remote secret sites across the US, said it could be an advanced aircraft technology being tested. 

He told The Sun: “It could be something that is in an early stage of development, it could be a new manned fighter or a new drone. 

“It could also be a model that is developed specifically for a test… say they're going to test a new type of paint, or a new particular component.”

The investigative YouTuber, who has filmed near classified facilities including the infamous Area 51, also linked the Skunk Works team to alien technology.

A slew of conspiracy theories suggests that many projects at the facility involve reverse-engineering tech whose origins are extraterrestrial.

US officials and elected politicians are currently rallying for information about unknown objects flying in US airspace – including one of Trump's top team, Marco Rubio.

And there have been numerous high-profile hearings on the subject, with suggestions the US has “exotic” technology held under wraps. 

Mr Otteson said if the US government possesses advanced or “alien” technology, Skunk Works would almost certainly be involved. 

“The Hellendale facility also has a massive underground chamber below it that's 200 feet deep,” he said. 

“It has spawned a lot of speculation about what other advanced projects might be being worked on in an underground facility like that.

“It is a good place to store advanced technology underground and that is partially why it was built to hide secrets from Soviet espionage. 

“Any other kinds of technology that Lockheed may be in possession of, that'd be a place that they could store it, essentially.” 

Located northwest of Victorville, Lockheed Martin's Helendale facility was designed during the Cold War to protect America's next-generation aircraft from the prying eyes of the Soviets. 

The facility is known to have several test pylons, radar arrays, and control stations to test the stealth technology of military aircraft. 

Speculations also indicate the unknown object could be America's SR-72 “Darkstar” – a top-secret US Air Force project that could revolutionise the military aircraft technology. 

Dubbed “Son of Blackbird”, it is thought to be the potential answer to a near-perfect plane as it's set up to be a super-fast, hypersonic high-altitude surveillance aircraft.

It is thought that next-generation aircraft could potentially reach speeds of Mach 6 (4000mph) – doubling its predecessor's top speed and introducing cutting-edge capabilities for modern combat scenarios. 

According to Airforce Technology, the aircraft will be a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft which will use state-of-the-art aerospace technology for long-range missions.

It will also be capable of hitting targets on any continent within an hour, provided it is equipped with hypersonic missiles, Interesting Engineering reports.

Lockheed Martin announced in 2018 that they are working on the SR-72 project, with a prototype expected to fly very soon.

The US Air Force and the Pentagon have never officially confirmed or denied the existence of the craft.

It is also not yet clear if Lockheed Martin has been given an official go-ahead by the USAF to complete a prototype for consideration.

Some fans have added the “Darkstar” moniker to the SR-72 name after a similar concept plane with the same name was seen in Top Gun: Maverick, which was released in 2022.

Aliens have warned humanity that we face destroying the planet in a breathtaking UFO discovery, which is being cited as ""first contact.""

The alarming caution from ""far away in time and space"" urges humans to take steps to protect the  planet. In a chilling series of phrases, experts have concluded that our intergalactic neighbors have deep seated fears for the future of  earth as human beings evolve.

Linguist Agnese Sartori claims to have deciphered the intergalactic words and unidentified hieroglyphic like symbols on the Columbian crash UFO - famously named the Buga Sphere. Italian Sartori painstakingly interpreted each etched symbol, using ancient languages, links to Sanskrit and her knowledge of ancient lingual archeology and literature.

Her conclusion is that the sphere's message relates to ""oldest language spoken in some form on this planet.""

Sartori explained, ""I believe there's a message here. They're telling us, 'we entrust you with life, creation, universal harmony, everything that the sun, the moon, the stars, the cosmos, the primal vibration signifies, and you have the possibility to destroy it or save it. That for me is perhaps my interpretation, (which) could be the fundamental message of that sphere.""



Sartori's conclusion features in a 30 minute broadcast, streamed by Beacon TV's website, explaining how she formulated meanings of the sphere's markings on its shell.

""In some way I believe that man can design destiny, because by making mistakes alone, one can decide that this planet will be destroyed in 100 years or in 100,000.

""I believe that man who is a co-creator because he's eternal also has a responsibility for the cosmos, because if something happens to earth, it will be a problem in the solar system and will have repercussions much further afield.

""I believe that man has a great responsibility, and what's happening now is a huge problem. People don't study anymore, they don't want to study.""

Sartori stated the 31 etchings on the basketball shaped flying machine, not constructed on this planet, tease details of a flood.

""I believe that there are symbols here which can speak of the system of the earth or the cosmos, which has been modified through, for example, a flood. Because Indra speaks - that symbol - also of a flood. Perhaps it's included in the past of the delivery and the successive cycles that have passed on earth. I think so.

""In fact, many others who have studied Sanskrit and pre- Sanskrit speak of pre-law dates, but the flood is spoken of. There are many texts that speak of the flood.""

In recent months extraterrestrial life investigators and scientists have delivered staggering conclusions about the Buga Sphere not being from our current civilization.

Organic material found dates back approximately 12,560 years. Tomography scans of the sphere have seen boffins conclude that the object has a transmitter mechanism inside the impenetrable ball.

Presently, scientists believe that the sphere may not just be sending messages into outer space, but also receiving communication. The advanced screening appears to raise questions too about potential unknown metals or compounds.

The basketball shaped flying machine, which seems to have not been constructed on this planet, is seamless - leaving experts baffled as to how to open it up.

Among those filming the study was TV presenter Jack Osbourne and Emmy nominated documentarian Serena DC and as part or a new TV series.

Both Jack and Serena along with scientists and experts before getting a closer look at the Buga Sphere.

That footage will form part of American Paranormal, an eight-part investigative docu-series about the paranormal and unexplained phenomena.



Jack, famous for hit series like Portals to Hell and The Osbournes Want to Believe, and Serena DC are trekking the world on a mission to find aliens or supernatural entities. And to deliver proof of life beyond our stars and delve into unsolved mysteries such as the infamous Peruvian mummies and Big Foot.

The father of four detailed how he is determined to prove ""intelligent creatures occupying planets"" have connected to earth and humanity."" Serene explained how their visit with the spheres and Sartori's conclusion are a ""pivotal moment in human discovery.""

""If even half of the team's findings are real, what we are peering at is a threshold, where humanity could rewrite a chapter of our origin story and our place in the cosmos.

""If this translation is indeed accurate, it speaks of cosmic beginnings, of cycles of creation and destruction and of a solar event that divides worlds. Whether this is poetry, prophecy, or a record of something that truly happened long ago, we don't know yet.

""Further metallurgical analysis is now underway. Teams from several laboratories are studying the sphere's precise alloy composition to determine whether these metals are of earthly origin or something else entirely. Whatever its origin, perhaps we're being reminded that someone or something is watching over us.""

Excited Jack, working with Beacon TV and Elysium Media, was ""blown away"" by what he experienced during the visit to the labs where the Buga Sphere is secretly held. He is holding back his full insight into the experience for the show, which airs next year.

But Jack expressed his belief in life in other galaxies, ""I do believe that there are intelligent creatures occupying planets in this universe or occupying somewhere, whether it's in this universe or not, but I feel like there is a chance that we are the only living thing in this universe. But there are other living things in other universes that can come into ours.""

Leading UFO journalist and award-winning Mexican TV host Jamie Maussan is the custodian of the sphere, leading this intriguing probe in Mexico. Lead scientist and engineer Rodolfo Garrido. NASA scientists and US university professors have also studied the craft leading to a series of conclusions. The enigmatic object is seen by many as a confirmation aliens have visited earth.

It made headlines when it was was spotted above Buga making movements impossible to conventional earthbound aircraft in March. Since crashing into power cables, scientists have spent months undertaking lengthy testing procedures. The initial conclusion was that the basketball-shaped flying machine was not constructed on this planet. The three layers of metal-like material and 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus were dated back back centuries.

A University of Georgia report stated organic material found inside the Buga Sphere is approximately 12,560 years old, predating the pyramids of Egypt by seven millennia.

In recent months, boffins have made a series of claims pointing to the flying object being not of this world. Radiologist Dr Jose Luis Velazquez reported finding ""no welds or joints"" which would typically indicate human fabrication.

His report noted, ""It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin."" Sartori boasts a long career in reading and translating texts of mythology and history of religions, philosophy, history of classical art, and archaeology of the mediterranean.

The sphere displays symbols that the team compared to ancient scripts, including runes, Ogham and Mesopotamian writing systems. The sphere's existence is controversial though, because there are no official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga. The government has tried to get the sphere back for their analysis without luck.

Australian Serena DC boasts a long track history of creating TV documentaries about many mysteries and unexplained things on the planet. She has enjoyed success with shows like Interview With The Extraterrestrial and Beyond The Grave.

The most haunted place in Massachusetts must be Salem, right? After all, the quaint east coast town that boasts historic charm and the highest quality of life in the U.S. was also the site of the Salem Witch Trials, where a total of 25 accused witches died horrific deaths between spring 1692 and late-summer 1693. Keeping an open mind, we'd be hard pressed to argue that the 15-month frenzy of mass hysteria that gripped the community didn't leave at least some kind of energetic imprint on the town.

It's that what-if factor that draws hordes of visitors to Witch City every year during Halloween season, but today's lighthearted festivities are a far cry from the horror that gripped 17th-century Salem. The town located about 20 miles northeast of Boston may be home to one of the most iconic Halloween events in the nation, but there's a lesser-known haunted place in Massachusetts where activity is said to rival the unexplained phenomena of the Bermuda Triangle.

We're talking about the Bridgewater Triangle, a 200-square-mile ""paranormal vortex"" located about 30 miles south of Boston. ""The Bridgewater Triangle, I think per square foot we've got more weirdness here than the Bermuda Triangle could hold a candle to, and the reason of course is so much history,"" Jeff Belanger, an author and lecturer who specializes in unexplained phenomena, told CBS News in 2022. The three points of the triangle-shaped vortex identified in 1983 by Loren Coleman, director of Maine's International Cryptozoology Museum, are located in the towns of Abington (north), Freetown (southeast), and Rehoboth (southwest). So what exactly happens within the confines of the Bridgewater Triangle? Here's what we know.

Like other reportedly haunted places, including the aforementioned Salem, Massachusetts and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania — home of one of the most haunted hiking spots in America — a number of horrific events and gruesome deaths have occurred within the confines of the vortex. One of the earliest recorded incidents dates to an epic battle during King Philip's War, a 17th-century stand-off between British colonists and indigenous members of the Algonquin, Nipmuc, Wampanoag, Pocumtuck, and Narragansett tribes.

One of the bloodiest battles of the 15-month war took place at Hockomock Swamp, a 16,950-acre parcel of wetlands once home to a Wampanoag stronghold that was also considered to be a sacred place. The word Hockomock translates to ""the place where spirits dwell."" Long before the fateful battle, colonists had already reported experiencing unnerving phenomena in the vicinity of the swamp, especially sightings of eerie light floating above at sunrise and sunset. It's not much of a leap to connect lingering energy related to the agonizing deaths warriors and colonists experienced in the vicinity of the swamp during King Philip's War to paranormal activity. ""King Philip's War was the bloodiest battle in US or British history ever per capita, meaning the greatest population percentage died,"" Belanger told CBS News. ""Seventy-five to 80 percent of the natives were wiped out, 25 percent of the colonists. That leaves a stain that I don't think can ever be washed away.""

But that's just the tip of the Bridgewater Triangle's paranormal iceberg. Reports of spine-tingling activity in the region, an unassuming blend of suburban and rural, even pastoral, landscapes, include suspected cult murders and reported UFO sightings well into the 21st-century. It's also home to Fall River's Lizzie Borden House, one of the 50 most haunted places in the world.

About 20 miles south of Hockomock Swamp, Freetown-Fall River State Forest is a veritable hotbed of disturbing activity. Cris-crossed with peaceful walking trails, the 5,000-acre woodland is far from foreboding, yet it's been the site of an inordinate number of violent crimes. In 1978, the body of 15-year-old cheerleader Mary Lou Marnuda was found tied to a tree. A year later, 19-year-old Doreen Levesque's body was discovered on the grounds of a local high school within the confines of the Bridgewater Triangle. The murders of two more young women followed shortly thereafter, ultimately revealing an unsettling pattern of cult-like activity involving animal sacrifices and ritualistic murders. Could bad juju be lurking in the forest?

Another reportedly haunted site, Assonet Ledge is said to be imbued with negative energy. In 2004, an allegedly happy and well-adjusted man who was walking with his girlfriend suddenly jumped to his death from the ledge. Other visitors have reported the sudden onset of deep despair and the urge to jump, while some notice glowing orbs and dark apparitions lurking in the pond beneath. And we haven't even touched on the multitude of reported UFO sightings, let alone Bigfoot, giant serpents, and pukwudgies (mischievous creatures who can turn mean in a flash, according to tribal lore).

The Bridgewater Triangle isn't a tourist attraction. You won't find costumed witches peddling tarot readings or hear the call of ghostly spirits beckoning you into a mystical storefront, but you may find the most spine-tingling adventure of your life, if you dare. Most of the reportedly haunted places are open to the public. Or you may just have a drive-by encounter with the infamous red-headed hitchhiker, a ghostly figure said to haunt a section of Route 44 near the Rehoboth-Seekonk town line.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

14:30 JST, October 26, 2025

Three years have passed since the fatal shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and some people on social media are still claiming that the man indicted for the murder was not the sole perpetrator.

Instead, they claim there was a “true sniper.”

Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, was indicted on charges that include murdering Abe.

The former prime minister was fatally shot during a stump speech in Nara in July 2022.

Investigators have concluded that Yamagami was the sole perpetrator, and his defense team has also denied the involvement of multiple individuals.

The Nara District Court will hold the first hearing for the case on Tuesday.

Posts such as “He was not the sole perpetrator” and “It was an organized act of terror. The truth lies in power” continue to be made on social media.

The Yomiuri Shimbun used Social Insight, a tool for analyzing social media posts from data analysis firm User Local Inc., to examine posts on X with phrases such as “assassination of former Prime Minister Abe.”

The analysis found that more than 600,000 posts, including reposts, had been made since the incident took place as of this month. This year alone, the number of such posts so far totals about 150,000. Many posts in July this year, three years since the incident, were found to have used such terms as “truth” and “mysterious.”

In May, an organization claiming to have the goal of uncovering the truth of the incident held a meeting in Tokyo. The group's 79-year-old representative, who is a former Tochigi prefectural assembly member, said several hundred people attended the meeting.

“The government is covering up the truth,” the man told The Yomiuri Shimbun. “We will gather information and take action.”

The social media posts claim that some major points are suspicious.

They say that one of the doctors who attempted to save Abe at the hospital described injuries during a press conference that were inconsistent with the results of an autopsy conducted by the Nara Prefectural police.

Likewise, they claim a gunshot distinct from those made by the suspect's homemade gun can be heard in video footage of the incident.

However, according to senior officials of the Nara Prefectural Police and senior prosecutors, the prefectural police carefully investigated whether any third parties were involved and found no proof that any were.

The investigators found that the wounds on Abe's body were consistent with the shots fired by the suspect. Both the Nara Prefectural Police and the Nara District Public Prosecutors Office therefore determined that Yamagami had acted alone.

A senior official of the prefectural police admitted that the doctor's explanation was different from the autopsy results. However, the official went on to say that the autopsy results are accurate, as they describe the state of the body objectively.

“It's possible for observations made in an emergency while trying to save a patient's life to be different from the results of an autopsy,” the official said.

Regarding the gunshots, another senior police official said, “We analyzed the video footage, but only two gunshots can be heard, both of which were made by the suspect.”

Yamagami is expected to admit in court that he intended to kill Abe. Therefore, the involvement of multiple parties will not be an issue at trial.

“No one other than the accused participated in the incident,” a member of his defense team told The Yomiuri Shimbun clearly.

A doctor who performed the autopsy on Abe and a police officer who analyzed the suspect's homemade gun are among those who are scheduled to appear in the court hearings.

“These kinds of social media comments may tone down a bit once the accused admits to the charges and speaks about the details of the incident,” said Daisuke Tomo, professor at Kindai University and an expert on information ethics.

Squad omission fuels more conspiracy theories","https://www.teamtalk.com/aston-villa/harvey-elliott-conspiracy-theories-aston-villa-squad-omission-deal-cancellation-claims","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 14:29:20 GMT","

Premier League • England


                                    Is the writing on the wall for Harvey Elliott at Aston Villa?                                

Harvey Elliott was left out of Aston Villa's squad for their fixture with Manchester City on Sunday afternoon, with no official reason yet given but conspiracy theories circulating that he could be sent back to Liverpool.

Elliott left Liverpool towards the end of the transfer window to join Villa on loan with an obligation to buy. That obligation is dependent on him making a certain number of appearances this season, believed to be 10.

And although he's halfway towards that milestone now, he has been used sparingly by Unai Emery. Elliott's only Premier League start for Villa so far culminated in him being taken off at half-time.

This week, reports have suggested Elliott regrets his choice of move in the summer and that the deal between Liverpool and Villa could be cancelled.

Thus, it was interesting to see when the team news was announced for Villa's clash with City that Elliott wasn't even on the bench.

It could be due to an injury, or it could be a conscious decision by Emery. But until any explanation arrives, fans have been wondering if the writing is on the wall and Elliott will be sent back to Liverpool.

On X, one account posted: “Harvey Elliott not even on the bench! Not a chance he's meeting the appearance requirement to sign permanently. Genuinely feel horrible for the lad.”

Another added: “Think he'll go back in January, unless we have a season long loan that we can't get out of… he just won't play the 10 games?? Time will tell I suppose”

Over on Reddit, one user suggested: “I half suspect that he's ringing home begging to get out of here at this point.”

Another replied: “I suspect he'll get his wish. It's seeming like we don't want to trigger the obligation to buy at this point more than trying to work him into the system.”

And another concurred: “Wouldn't surprise me in the least if he's sent back in January.”

On the flipside to the suggestions Villa want to cancel the Elliott deal, some have wondered why Emery would have given him appearances lasting four minutes (Feyenoord) and 19 minutes (Everton) if unsure about activating a permanent deal.

It's believed Villa are committed to paying £35m for Elliott once the obligation to buy kicks in, which isn't an insignificant amount of money.

GO FURTHER – Five loans that MUST be cancelled ASAP

Villa head coach Emery shed some light on Elliott's situation at a press conference this week.

Emery said: “I am being very, very demanding myself to choose in each match the player to start and the players on the bench and the subs players, and firstly is always trying to get the best performance collectively, through individual players.

“Harvey is a 10 number in our structure, in our shape, and he plays some matches and there is still adaptation to add himself individually in our structure, the task we have.

“Of course, he is training well, and his commitment is being very well as well, but his performance was not enough (up to this point).

“At the same time, we have other players who can play as a 10 and they are performing well, and I have different players.

“This is the main reason he is not playing the last matches minutes, but he has to continue working like he is doing in the training session and of course getting his confidence in the performance we need through him.

“His quality, in my opinion, is to play No. 10.

“He can maybe play wide right, like John McGinn, but he will need more time.

“At the beginning I signed him thinking him to play No. 10 and getting the performance and getting him to play consistently for us. There are other players who can play there.”

In a further blow to Elliott's long-term prospects, Villa are reportedly close to agreeing a contract extension with one of their other players who can operate as a No. 10.

They have also reportedly taken the lead in the race for a highly-rated LaLiga winger and have been backed to make an ambitious offer for a Real Madrid forward.


                        These five loan spells haven't got off to good start this season and might need to be backed out of if possible                    


                        Everyone is in agreement a Liverpool star made the wrong decision with his summer transfer, and a recent report from a trusted source has confirmed the deal could be cancelled                    


                        Liverpool have 10 players out on loan during the 2025/26 season and we're keeping track of how all of them are getting on away from Anfield                    


                        The Egyptian superstar has publicly spoken about the defending Premier League champions' decision to offload a young gem in the summer transfer window                    


                        The arrival of Alexander Isak at Anfield has prompted Liverpool to sell an attacker to a Premier League rival, though the Reds have largely negotiated the terms they were looking for                    


                        Crystal Palace have granted Marc Guehi permission to undergo a medical ahead of his transfer to Liverpool, but the £160m double deal including Alexander Isak could force two players out of Anfield

Authorities revealed this week that a man once named a person of interest in the disappearance of Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit was responsible for the 2006 killing of a Wisconsin woman and may have been responsible for other murders.

The Wood County Sheriff's Office announced that Christopher Revak was behind the death of Deidre Harm, officially closing a case that had gone unsolved for nearly two decades.

On Oct. 20, the Wood County Sheriff's Office shared a letter from District Attorney Jonathan Barnett on Facebook stating that he would have filed charges against Revak if he were still alive.

""I consider this case closed,"" Barnett wrote. ""I believe I had enough to charge and, if Mr. Revak were still alive, win at trial.""

Harm, a 21-year-old single mother, disappeared after a night out at a downtown Wisconsin Rapids bar June 10, 2006. Her remains were discovered five months later by hunters in a wooded area near Seneca, about 5 miles from downtown, according to WSAW.

""This may provide some closure for many but won't bring Deidre back,"" the Wood County Sheriff's Office and Wisconsin Rapids Police said in a joint statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers will always be with Deidre's family.""

Revak, a Wisconsin native and former EMT, died by suicide in a Missouri jail cell in July 2009, just one day after being charged with second-degree murder in the death of Rene Williams, 36, a mother of three from Mansfield, Missouri.

Williams was last seen March 13, 2007, at the Eagle Lodge bar in Ava, Missouri, where she worked. Revak was also at the bar that night, according to FOX 9.

In 2024, KCCI Des Moines reported that Iowa and Wisconsin investigators were taking a fresh look at Revak, who had long been suspected of multiple violent crimes before his death.

Notorious ‘Scorecard Killer' Linked To Decades-old Murder Nearly 45 Years Later

According to a recent documentary, police have examined whether Revak may have been connected to as many as five different homicides over a 14-year span, including the disappearance of Huisentruit.

Douglas County Sheriff Chris Degase, who investigated Williams' case, previously told Fox News Digital that Revak's confirmed link to Harm's killing deepened his concerns about the former EMT's violent history.

""When I started working on the Christopher Revak case, he was my suspect in the murder of Rene Williams,"" Degase said. ""I didn't think it was his first go-around at it.""

Degase told KY3 that forensic evidence linked Revak to Williams' disappearance.

""We had his DNA at the scene. We had her DNA inside his truck,"" he said. ""I think the biggest thing was that they weren't able to find a body. They had no witnesses to come forward to say that she was dead.""

Despite the lack of a body, investigators charged Revak with Williams' murder based on DNA results. Degase said his curiosity about similar crimes led him to uncover chilling parallels.

""It wasn't the first time Revak tried to abduct a woman in Ava,"" he said. ""Actually, shortly after his arrest, I Google searched ‘women abducted from bars' in all the towns that he had lived in. And when I Google searched from Wisconsin Rapids, Deidre Harm came up.""

New Crime Scene Details Emerge In Manhunt For Fugitive Dad Accused Of Killing 3 Daughters

That discovery prompted Degase to reach out to Wisconsin investigators, sharing his findings and helping connect the dots between cases.

""I don't believe in coincidences,"" he said. ""I called the authorities out there and gave them the information I had.""

Degase, who is featured in the documentary discussing the case, said Williams and Huisentruit remain missing, a detail that still haunts him. He didn't rule out the possibility Revak could have traveled to Iowa.

""Obviously, [Jodi] wasn't abducted from a bar, but I just thought it was odd,"" Degase said.

He added that Revak ""had a dark side.""

""We're dealing with what's possibly a serial killer,"" Degase told KY3. ""During his day, he's doing his deed to society and helping people and saving people, but there was a dark side to Chris Revak.""

Revak had also been a person of interest in the 1995 disappearance of Huisentruit, a 27-year-old morning anchor for KIMT-TV in Mason City, Iowa.

Huisentruit vanished around 4 a.m. on June 27, 1995, after calling a colleague to say she was on her way to work but never arriving. Police found signs of a struggle outside her apartment, including a pair of high heels and a bent car key near her car.

She was declared legally dead in 2001, though her body has never been found.

Alleged Devil's Den Killer Investigated In Multiple Unsolved Murders Across Us That Have One Thing In Common

At the time, Mason City Police said there was no evidence linking Revak to the case. However, in 2024, investigators from Wisconsin and Iowa reconnected to compare notes about him, according to FindJodi.com.

Authorities had also looked into whether Revak's ex-wife once lived in the same house as one of the last people to see Huisentruit alive but determined she moved out six months before the anchor's disappearance.

Despite three decades of dead ends, then-Mason City Police Chief Jeff Brinkley said in June the department continues to receive and pursue leads year-round.

""We haven't put this down. We haven't stopped working. We have not stopped pursuing leads and information,"" Brinkley told FOX 9 at the time.

In 2024, officers searched a property in Winsted, Minnesota, following a tip, though no new evidence was found. Earlier this year, part of a 2017 search warrant was also unsealed.

""We're still hopeful the case will be solved and justice served — no matter how long it takes,"" Brinkley said.

Huisentruit's family continues to hold out hope for closure.

""The pain and anguish felt by us and all who loved Jodi are immeasurable,"" her family wrote in a statement on the Jodi's Hope Facebook page. ""True peace will only come when Jodi is found and justice is served. We still choose to hope that one day soon it will happen.""

A $50,000 reward remains in place for information leading to answers in Huisentruit's disappearance. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Mason City Police Department or the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.

Oregon has for years struggled with a drug crisis, reporting one of the highest rates of substance use disorders in the US and ranking last in the nation for access to treatment. The problem is systemic, rooted in decades of failure to invest in the level of behavioral health services needed for people with mental illnesses and addiction. The Pacific north-west state's significant affordable housing shortage has compounded the challenges, as people languish on the streets without care. On 12 November 2024, Cameron Washam, 45, was lying on the street by Portland's Union Station, on the brink of death. He and his wife, Christina Bell, 47, had long struggled with homelessness and addiction. Workers from a Portland street outreach initiative coordinated by the Mental Health and Addiction Association of Oregon (MHAAO), a non-profit dedicated to peer recovery services, approached and offered help, saying they could immediately take them to a detox program. They entered detox, Washam got emergency surgery for his infection, and after eight days, they were placed in an outpatient program, then a sober recovery home. The outreach effort [is] called the Provider-Police Joint Connection Program. Since its launch, the program has connected 1,005 people to services, including 651 who received access to programs on the same day outreach teams met them and 159 who got into detox and treatment.

Detention of Chicago man violates his due process and he must be given a bond hearing by 31 October, judge says

The detention by immigration authorities of a Chicago man whose 16-year-old daughter is undergoing treatment for advanced cancer is illegal, and he must be given a bond hearing by 31 October, a federal judge has ruled.

Attorneys for Ruben Torres Maldonado, 40, who was detained on 18 October, have petitioned for his release as his deportation case goes through the system. While US district judge Jeremy Daniel said in an order Friday that Torres's detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is illegal and violates his due process rights, he also said he could not order his immediate release.

“While sympathetic to the plight the petitioner's daughter faces due to her health concerns, the court must act within the constraints of the relevant statutes, rules, and precedents,” the judge wrote Friday.

Torres's attorney took the ruling as a win – for now.

“We're pleased that the judge ruled in our favor in determining that ICE is illegally detaining Ruben. We will now turn the fight to immigration court so we can secure Ruben's release on bond while he applies for permanent residence status,” his attorney, Kalman Resnick, said in a statement Friday night.

Torres, a painter and home renovator, was detained at a suburban Home Depot store. His daughter, Ofelia Torres, was diagnosed in December with a rare and aggressive form of soft-tissue cancer called metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Torres entered the US in 2003, according to his lawyers. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a four-year-old son. The children are both US citizens, according to court records.

“My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” Ofelia said in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for her family. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleges that Torres has been living illegally in the US for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding.

“This is nothing more than a desperate Hail Mary attempt to keep a criminal illegal alien in our country,” assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “The Trump administration is fighting for the rule of law and the American people.”

At a hearing on Thursday, which Ofelia attended in a wheelchair, the family's attorneys told the judge that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father's arrest so that she could see family and friends. But since his arrest, she had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption”, they said.

Federal prosecutor Craig Oswald told the court that the government did not want to release Torres because he didn't cooperate during his arrest.

Several elected officials held a news conference on Wednesday to protest Torres's arrest. The Chicago area has been at the center of a major immigration crackdown dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, which began in early September.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

B:  However, a poll showed that support for same-sex marriage slightly dropped to 54.3 percent from last year's 56.5 percent.
A:  The government is wavering on whether to extend the Assisted Reproduction Act to same-sex couples, leading to public doubts.

The law seeks to define ultra-processed foods, the often super-tasty products typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats. The legislation requires the state's Department of Public Health to adopt rules by mid-2028 defining “ultra-processed foods of concern” and “restricted school foods.”
Schools have to start phasing out those foods by July 2029, and districts will be barred from selling them for breakfast or lunch by July 2035. Vendors will be banned from providing the “foods

Russia has tested its newly developed nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed Burevestnik cruise missile, Russian Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said in a televised meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Oct. 26.

""I have a report from the industrial bodies, and in general, I am familiar with the estimates provided by the Defense Ministry. It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses,"" Putin claimed, according to Russian state media.

Russia was ready to test the low-flying nuclear missile ahead of Putin's summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska on Aug. 15, Reuters previously reported. Satellite imagery revealed extensive activity at the Pankovo test site on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.

""We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000-kilometer (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,"" Gerasimov said, adding that the test launch lasted for 15 hours.

U.S.-based researchers previously identified a possible deployment site for Russia's Burevestnik missile. The site is adjacent to a nuclear warhead storage facility known as Vologda-20 or Chebsara, located about  475 kilometers (295 miles) north of Moscow.

Western analysts remain skeptical of the cruise missile. Eight experts interviewed by Reuters pointed to the missile's troubled development history and inherent design flaws. They questioned whether its deployment would significantly alter the nuclear balance between the West and other adversaries.

Analysts say the Burevestnik missile has become more important to the Kremlin since the White House announced in January plans to develop the Golden Dome U.S. missile defense shield.

""It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed.

While Ukraine also lacks Western-supplied weapons, soldiers and commanders say shortages of basics — cars, drones and people — make holding back Russia extremely difficult. Even as Kyiv seeks U.S. approval for Tomahawks, they say critical, rudimentary gear is the more pressing need.

Russia faces an increase in the arson and “spontaneous combustion” of electrical panels, railway relay cabinets, and other infrastructure helping Moscow wage its war against Ukraine over the past week, a source at Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. 

The episode covers Russian war crimes in Pokrovsk and continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, including missile strikes on Kyiv and Kharkiv. While Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire with Ukraine, has President Trump finally shifted his approach to Russia?

Ukrainian forces liberated two villages in eastern Donetsk Oblast about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of embattled Pokrovsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Oct. 26. 

Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Oct. 26, killing at least three people, and injuring at least 32 others, including seven children.

At least nine civilians were killed and 44 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional authorities reported on Oct. 26.

Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said a large group of ""smuggling balloons"" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania.

""I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.


""I think it's very important we have dialogue because President Trump already has done a lot to solve lots of the world conflicts,” Kirill Dmitriev told Fox News on Oct. 25.

The United States signed a flurry of deals on trade and critical minerals with four Southeast Asian partners on Sunday, looking to address trade imbalances and diversify supply chains amid tighter export curbs on rare earths by China.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who is in Kuala Lumpur to attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, signed reciprocal trade deals with his Malaysian and Cambodian counterparts, as well as a framework trade pact with Thailand that will see the countries work to address tariff and non-tariff barriers.

The United States would maintain a tariff rate of 19% on exports from all three countries under the deals, with the levy to be reduced to zero for some goods, according to joint statements released by the White House.

Washington also announced a similar framework deal with Vietnam, which has been levied with a tariff rate of 20% on its exports to the United States.

Editorial: An elbows-down strategy in the pipeline

Vietnam, which recorded a trade surplus of US$123-billion with the United States last year, has pledged to vastly boost its purchases of U.S. products to reduce the trade gap between the two countries.

Trump on Sunday inked two separate U.S. deals with Thailand and Malaysia seeking co-operation to diversify critical minerals supply chains, amid competing efforts from Beijing in the rapidly growing sector.

Reuters reported exclusively this month that China was in talks with Kuala Lumpur on rare earths processing, with Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional expected to partner with a Chinese firm to build a refinery in Malaysia.

China, the world's top miner and processor of rare earths, has imposed increasingly stringent export controls on its refining technology, sending global manufacturers scrambling to secure alternative supplies for critical minerals used widely in semiconductor chips, electric vehicles and military equipment.

Malaysia agreed on Sunday to refrain from banning or imposing quotas on exports to the U.S. of critical minerals or rare earth elements, the countries said in a statement.

The statement however did not specify whether Malaysia's pledge applied to raw or processed rare earths.

Malaysia, which has an estimated 16.1 million tonnes of rare earth deposits, has banned the export of raw rare earths to prevent the loss of resources as it looks to develop its downstream sector.

U.S. President Donald Trump is in Malaysia for the ASEAN Summit, where he said the U.S. was in a golden age.

The agreements were inked after Trump oversaw the signing of an enhanced ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, following deadly border clashes between the neighbours earlier this year.

Under the deals, the four Southeast Asian countries pledged to remove trade barriers and provide preferential market access to various U.S. goods.

The deals also include commitments in digital trade, services and investments as well as promises by the Southeast Asian countries to protect labour rights and strengthen environmental protections.

Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam further agreed to accept vehicles built to U.S. motor vehicle safety and emissions standards, according to the statements.

Malaysia, a majority Muslim country recognized as a global leader in halal certification, agreed to streamline requirements for U.S. products such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

Its trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told reporters that Malaysia had also secured tariff exemptions for aerospace equipment and pharmaceutical products as well as commodities such as palm oil, cacao and rubber.

Thailand said it would eliminate tariff barriers on approximately 99% of goods, and relax foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. investment in its telecommunications sector, both countries said in a statement.

They also took note of several forthcoming commercial deals between Thai and U.S. companies, including the purchases of agriculture products such as feed corn and soybean meal worth an estimated US$2.6-billion per year.

Thailand has also committed to purchases of 80 U.S. aircraft totalling US$18.8-billion and energy goods including liquefied natural gas and crude oil of around US$5.4-billion annually, the statement said.

Catherine Connolly, an independent progressive candidate, has won by a landslide in a poll marred by low turnout and spoiled ballots. Her victory is a damning verdict for Ireland's center-right coalition government. 

Catherine Connolly has won Ireland's presidential election by a landslide, official results on Saturday showed.

Connolly, an independent candidate who was backed by left-wing opposition parties, won over 64.7% of the vote.

""I will be a president who listens, who reflects and who speaks when it's necessary. Together we can shape a new republic that values everybody,"" she said in her victory speech at Dublin Castle.

In second place was Heather Humphreys of the centrist Fine Gael party, who won 28.2%.

Jim Gavin, of the Fianna Fail party, came in third with just over 7%, although he had pulled out of the running earlier this month amid controversy over a rent payment scandal, leaving Connolly and Humphreys as the only viable candidates.

Gavin and Humphreys' parties rule with the Green Party in a coalition government.

Connolly will succeed Michael D Higgins, who completed two full terms after holding the largely ceremonial role since 2011.

Connolly, a 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway, built her campaign around messages of ""peace,"" ""unity,"" and ""neutrality.""

A fluent Irish speaker, she hails from the far-left of Ireland's political spectrum, and was endorsed by Sinn Fein, Labour, the Social Democrats and other left-leaning parties.

Connolly has been fiercely critical of the United States and the European Union, even though Ireland is overwhelmingly pro-EU.

She has voiced her opposition to increased military spending in the EU since the war in Ukraine began. Connolly has also compared defense spending in Germany to the 1930s.

Connolly has slammed the US, UK and France for their roles in the war in Gaza.

Some of her views on these issues are likely to place her at odds with Ireland's center-right government.

The election was marred by a low voter turnout of 46.3%, while as many as one in eight voters submitted spoiled ballots, according to The Irish Times newspaper.

Right-wing figures had called on voters to spoil their ballots to protest at the dearth of conservative candidates in the race, as well as to demonstrate their frustration with issues such as immigration and crime.

Ireland has seen sometimes violent protests against the rising numbers of asylum seekers in the country, which is struggling with a severe housing crisis and rising homelessness.

Eoin O'Malley, a Dublin City University political science professor, told the AFP news agency that the election had effectively turned into a ""referendum on the center-right government.""

He explained that the high number of spoiled ballots ""reflects a deep anger and dissatisfaction with all the parties, which refuse to discuss issues such as immigration.""

Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor announced in September that he was withdrawing his bid for the presidency.

McGregor, a prominent voice in the country's anti-immigration movement, visited the White House in March as a guest of US President Donald Trump for St. Patrick's Day celebrations.

He was convicted last November in a civil rape case and is also being sued in the US federal civil court by a woman who accuses him of sexually assaulting her in Miami.

Other high-profile figures who had shown interest in the post, including musician Bob Geldof and ""Riverdance"" performer Michael Flatley, also exited the race.

The high-stakes election will show Milei and the rest of the world if Argentines continue to support his tough austerity measures and economic reforms. Also on the line is a crucial US bailout.

Argentines on Sunday headed to the polls in legeslative elections that are being viewed as a litmus test for President Javier Milei's free-market reforms and deep austerity measures.

The president and his party, La Libertad Avanza, is looking to increase its small minority in congress which would make future reforms easier. Melei has faced several political blows since September with congress overturning laws introduced by him.

The high-stakes midterm elections assume even more importance for Argentina's economic safety. US President Donald Trump, who recently provided Argentina with a hefty financial bailout, has threatened to pull support if Milei does not perform well in the elections.

""Don't give up because we're halfway there,"" Milei told supporters at a closing campaign event in the port city of Rosario on Thursday. ""We're on a good path.""

Milei — who has built his presidency on austerity measures and drastic econonic reforms — saw his popularity drop amid a corruption scandal and public weariness. While his reforms have tamed inflation, the dramatic welfare cuts have severely affected universities, public hospitals and pensioners.

His party was defeated at the polls in Buenos Aires' provincial elections in September as a result, an outcome which was seen as indicative of the mood going into Sunday's ballot.

Half of Argentina's lower Chambers of Deputies and a third of the Senate's seats are up for grabs in this legislative elections.

A majority seems out of Milei's reach. However, political experts say that if the president's party grabs more than 35% of the votes, his government would be able to block opposition to his vetos through alliances with other parties.

Sunday's outcome will be closely watched by the White House.

Facing pressure from the Peso which continues to lose groud and inflation which is creeping back up, Milei sought help from one of his best political friends: US President Donald Trump.

Trump, who has called Milei his ""favourite president,"" offered a financial package in the form of a currency swap worth $20 billion and the promise of another $20 Billion in aid from private banks.

But soon after, Trump imposed a condition that Milei must not suffer defeat at the Hands of ""socialists or communists.""

German politicians are making serious accusations against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. They allege the party is studying the country's critical infrastructure — in the interests of the Kremlin.

Allegations of espionage against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) have been raised by the interior minister of the state of Thuringia. In an interview with Handelsblatt, Social Democrat (SPD) Georg Maier expressed concern that the AfD is abusing its parliamentary powers to gather information about Germany's transport infrastructure, water supply, digital infrastructure and energy supply.

""With its requests, one gets the impression that the AfD is working through a list of tasks assigned by the Kremlin,"" Maier told the newspaper this week.

He pointed out that the Thuringian branch of the AfD had submitted 47 such inquiries to the state parliament in the past 12 months alone — and with ""increasing intensity and depth of detail.""

""The AfD is particularly interested in IT and equipment used by the police, for example in the area of drone detection and defense,"" Maier said. Equipment used in civil protection, health care and Bundeswehr activities are also the subject of inquiries.

In Germany, Kleine Anfragen (literally ""small inquiries"") are an official parliamentary instrument to help parties obtain information from both federal and state governments that is not publicly available. They are primarily used by opposition parties that do not have direct access to the ministries and authorities of the government apparatus. The governments must respond to the inquiries in writing.

In Thuringia, the state and parliamentary group leader of the AfD is Björn Höcke, who is classified as a confirmed right-wing extremist by the security authorities. Höcke has been previously convicted of using a banned slogan from the Nazi era.

Höcke has also repeatedly praised President Vladimir Putin's Russia in the past. In a YouTube conversation with AfD politician Maximilian Krah in January 2023 — after the start of Russia's war of against Ukraine — he stated: ""Today, whether the mainstream media wants to hear it or not, Russia does not only have negative connotations — it is also a country that some hope could be a champion for a world of free and sovereign states without hegemonic influence.""

Höcke has sharply rejected the accusations of the SPD interior minister. In a statement on his Facebook account, he accused Maier of having a problem with the rule of law.

""He has no evidence to back up his claims. He is bothered by the fact that the opposition is doing its constitutional duty: monitoring the work of the government and, if necessary, criticizing it."" Questions to the ministries on various issues also help prepare the AfD for assuming government responsibility, Höcke added.

Höcke said his AfD parliamentary group was considering filing a complaint against the interior minister for defamation, and called on Thuringian State Premier Mario Voigt to dismiss Maier.

The AfD is the strongest political force in Thuringia. However, because of its proven links to the far right, all other parties have refused to form an alliance with it. Since last year, the small state has been governed by a coalition of conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance.

But Maier has also received backing from within the federal parliament, the Bundestag. Marc Henrichmann, the chairman of the Bundestag's intelligence oversight committee and a CDU member, told the RND news network: ""I firmly believe that Putin is using the AfD as a compliant tool and that party leadership — as much as it claims the contrary — does not have the power to prevent this form of betrayal.""

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Henrichmann pointed out that, due to the same concerns, AfD lawmakers had not been elected to the Bundestag's parliamentary oversight committee. This committee meets exclusively in secret and is responsible for monitoring the work of the federal intelligence services.

The AfD has repeatedly been accused of having close ties to Russia, and numerous AfD members of the Bundestag have maintained close contacts with Putin's circle in the past. AfD Bundestag member Jan Nolte used to write for the Russian propaganda newspaper Izvestia.

Similarly, Markus Frohnmaier, deputy chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, was part of the organizing team for the 2018 Yalta International Economic Forum, which was supported by the Russian government and the Russian secret service FSB. In October 2025, Frohnmaier announced his intention to travel to Moscow for political talks. Numerous other party officials have made headlines in the past with statements downplaying Russia's war against Ukraine.

For all these reasons, Maier also wants any motion to ban the party to include ""the issue of treason.""

""The AfD is not only hostile to the constitution due to its nationalist ideology, but also threatens our liberal democracy through its connections to authoritarian systems,"" he said.

These films won't swindle you out of a good time.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Glass-cutting power tools, priceless crown jewels, and two scooters to escape on. The story of the thieves who targeted the Louvre last weekend could have been ripped from a movie. For anybody feeling inspired (ideally not to commit a robbery of their own), The Atlantic's writers and editors have recommended seven heist films that won't swindle you out of a good time.

Inside Man (streaming on Netflix)

Besides being an excellent genre film, Inside Man is a testament to Spike Lee's range. The plot follows a Dog Day Afternoon–style hostage situation, a sometimes-thrilling, sometimes-goofy détente between bank robbers and police officers that is miles away, conceptually, from the barbed cultural critique of Do the Right Thing or the biographical sweep of Malcolm X. Race certainly figures into Inside Man, and the screenplay (written by Russell Gewirtz) contains moments of social commentary, some less subtle than others—but by the mid-2000s, Spike Lee had nothing left to prove on that front. And what a cast! Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Clive Owen, and, of course Denzel Washington, who outshines all of the rest. In a just world, we'd get a blockbuster this good every year.

— Will Gottsegen, staff writer

To Catch a Thief (streaming on MGM+ and Paramount+)

If you watched footage of that ladder truck pulling up to the Louvre and thought, Hmm … needs more glamour, here is your perfectly feline fix. I will confess that the heists at the center of Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 film are not themselves that sophisticated, but the movie is really more preoccupied with how good Cary Grant looks in a tuxedo anyhow; it is very French in that way.

Grant is a retired burglar who's pulled back into the game when a copycat frames him. He joins bejeweled mother-and-daughter tourists (played by Jessie Royce Landis and Grace Kelly, respectively) ostensibly to smoke out the real culprit but mostly to flirt a lot with both of them.

To Catch a Thief may fail as a thriller, but can you really hold that against a film that unfolds along the French Riviera? Only the south of France produces those turquoises and fuchsias, and only Technicolor captures them. The setting outsparkles even Grant. It's a fabulous place to spend a few hours planning what you'd wear to a robbery.

— Drew Goins, senior editor

Ocean's Eleven (available to rent on YouTube, Prime Video, and Apple TV+)

Ocean's Eleven makes crime look like choreography: a heist unfolding exactly as it should, with just enough chaos to keep it interesting. Less than a day after walking out of prison, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is already scheming to rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night. He has three rules: don't hurt anyone, don't steal from people who don't deserve it, and play like you have nothing to lose.

I'm not usually one for suspense (I'm the kind of person who checks how a movie ends while I'm still watching it), but this is the one heist film I can sit through. It's not stressful to watch—just satisfying, clever, and fun. Not only is it a classic, but it also never feels dated; no matter how many times I've seen it, the cast always clicks, and the humor still lands. By the end, you'll probably catch yourself wishing you could join the crew—not for the money or the win, but for the satisfaction of pulling off something that elegant.

— Rafaela Jinich, assistant editor

The Good Thief (streaming on the Roku Channel)

On its face, Neil Jordan's remake of a 1956 French caper seems like a poor man's Ocean's Eleven. (It doesn't help that the only streaming version I could find looks like it was bootlegged with a camcorder.) Nick Nolte plays Bob, a charming heroin addict and aging thief attempting one last score: robbing the vault in a Monte Carlo casino on the eve of the Grand Prix, the busiest night of the year. It's just the type of impossible heist a man out of chances would try, which is what Bob lets the authorities think and Jordan lets the viewers think while they are both up to something else.

Modern heist movies tend to feature genius thieves masterminding Rube Goldberg–esque plans that defy physics, logic, and credulity. But in The Good Thief's winsome third act, Bob and his ragtag crew improvise their way through a scheme that hinges on the film's true subject: luck. Luck may not be fair, but it is occasionally democratic and can find even a down-and-out junkie gambler if he puts on a tuxedo nice enough to fool security.

— Evan McMurry, senior editor

Baby Driver (streaming on Prime Video)

Some may classify the getaway driver as the most boring person on a crew of hardened criminals: no shoot-outs, no lifelike masks, no rappelling skills required. But the director Edgar Wright made sure the same couldn't be said about the protagonist of Baby Driver. Miles, also known as “Baby” (Ansel Elgort), has tinnitus, and music helps him drown out the ringing. The songs he listens to score his high-octane escapes after a robbery goes down; he evades a fleet of cop cars on the highway to the frenetic beat of “Bellbottoms,” and embarks on a parkour-style speed run through a mall to “Hocus Pocus.” I can't promise that it's a relaxing watch, but this twist on the heist genre is worth a couple of hours of your evening. Plus, you may even leave with a new song stuck in your head.

— Stephanie Bai, associate editor

The Mastermind (out now in theaters)

In the opening scene of Kelly Reichardt's latest film, a man pilfers a small object from a local museum to practice for a larger burglary he has planned—but this isn't exactly a heist movie. The Mastermind, which I recently reviewed, follows J. B. (Josh O'Connor), a father of two and an amateur thief in 1970 Massachusetts, whose M.O. amounts to glancing around to make sure the guards aren't paying attention. But his more ambitious scheme, to steal four Arthur Dove paintings with a few accomplices, soon goes sideways after he speeds off with the art in his trunk. For much of The Mastermind's run time, Reichardt examines how J. B.'s poorly conceived plan upends his life. There are no heist-movie hallmarks—no scenes of him carefully assembling a crew, no voice-overs outlining the master plan. Reichardt, it turns out, is the one doing the double-crossing. Yet the film's small-scale, low-stakes drama fuels its appeal. Reichardt roots around in her protagonist's mind to understand why he'd so casually risk losing his comfortable middle-class life for a few pieces of art.

— Shirley Li, staff writer

Fantastic Mr. Fox (streaming on Disney+)

The object of theft in Fantastic Mr. Fox is not money or jewels—it's food and drink from three oafish farmers. As someone who finds many heist movies for grown-ups complicated and hard to follow, I love the simplicity of this movie about a patriarch fox who wants to feed his family and friends and bring some excitement into his middle-age era. The action scenes are lively and suspenseful, but the real joy of the movie is its meticulously constructed visual world and the sweet, melancholic portrayal of family life.

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

The Week Ahead

Essay

What an Iranian Filmmaker Learned In Prison

By Arash Azizi

For more than a decade, after the government of Iran deemed his work “propaganda against the system,” the filmmaker Jafar Panahi was banned from making films or leaving the country. He spent some of that time in prison and under house arrest, but he still found ways to produce art—including the 2011 documentary This Is Not a Film, which was recorded in his Tehran apartment and smuggled into the Cannes Film Festival on a flash drive. The ban has since been lifted; even so, Panahi chose to make his latest film, It Was Just an Accident, in secret, without an official permit. This month, he showed the thriller at the New York Film Festival.

Much of Iran's clandestine cinema, including some of Panahi's earlier works, is didactic, focused on valorizing the victims of the regime's injustices. But It Was Just an Accident turns the camera inward, toward the pugnacious debates that pit Iranians against one another.

In a 2009 interview, a 25-year-old Mark Zuckerberg offered a grand prognosis on the human condition. ""You have one identity,"" the Facebook founder said. ""The days of you having a different image for your work friends or coworkers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly. Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.""

At the time, his five-year-old social network was shaping the identities of more than 350 million people. Like Sergey Brin and Larry Page with their mission to ""organize the world's information"" with Google, like Steve Jobs when he put the internet in our pockets, Zuck was becoming something of the world's new Minister of Thought — influencing how humans conceived of themselves and one another as they communicated at an unprecedented scale.

Today, 16 years and arguably several identities later (from the hoodie-wearing ""I'm CEO, bitch"" wunderkind to the suit-wearing presidential prospect to the shirtless jiu jitsu-fighting MAGA beefcake), Zuck is starting to cede that title to another tech leader who is shaping human cognition at perhaps an even grander scale, Sam Altman.

ChatGPT, just three years old, has more than 800 million weekly users, at least 40 times Facebook's audience three years in. OpenAI is now the most valuable private company worldwide. Ten percent of the world's adults use its flagship chatbot on a monthly basis — for writing emails and scouring the web, planning trips, decoding medical mysteries, or finding love.

Where Zuck taught us to post, Altman teaches us to prompt. If the past twenty years were about curating who we are, the next may be about creating who we want to be.

Facebook rewired how we see ourselves and each other. Posts, pokes, photos, and likes stitched together a specific digital avatar. Instagram gave us filters. The feed's ranking systems rewarded the glossiest slice of life — the latté foam art and dopamine décor. Zuckerberg promised to ""bring the world closer together."" He didn't say we'd show up unvarnished.

Altman's world is generation, not just presentation. Filters that boost saturation and darken edges have been supplanted by ""Ghiblified"" photo edits. Sora lets users turn rough ideas into hyperreal videos. I cast myself in a fake space opera; Mark Cuban tap danced with the late Ginger Rogers. These tools don't polish reality so much as draft new versions of it.

I've seen the appeal up close. My husband, historically terrible at gifts, recently nailed it on my birthday: gold hoops and a Catbird necklace with our daughter's initial. His confession — ""I used ChatGPT"" — felt both cute and slightly disorienting. If a bot is co-authoring intimacy, what else are we outsourcing? Holiday cards, wedding toasts, and homework may be just the start.

The office is already there. Studies suggest generative tools can speed up knowledge work and lift quality, especially for low performers. Emails became more polished, decks more dazzling. That power also comes with a catch: more ""workslop"" to sift and lower productivity if misused.

There's a bigger platform shift underneath all of this. Facebook's feed once redistributed attention outward. Publishers lived and died by referral traffic. AI flips the model. Large language models ingest the open web and answer queries in its place. Where Zuckerberg built a web of people and links, Altman built a funnel. The user asks, it synthesizes. That convenience is already hitting publishers.

Zuckerberg started Facebook to connect his Harvard class. His ambitions went global. Facebook groups knit together new parents, bird watchers, English learners, and Bronies. The company has expanded internet access in developing countries.

The same algorithms that brought us closer also sorted us apart. Ranking systems fed people more of what they already agreed with, hardening echo chambers. Critics accused Facebook of supercharging conspiracies and ""fake news"" — around elections, the environment, and health.

Altman isn't auditioning as a great communitarian. His concerns lie with the human-to-machine connection.

People are consulting ChatGPT as ""a sort of therapist or life coach,"" Altman said, a trend he admitted made him feel ""uneasy."" Others are falling in love with the chatbot. Soon, a gated adult mode will offer erotica for personalized fantasy on demand. That's the shift from the public square to private rooms.

Early evidence points to extreme tradeoffs. In March, a study from OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab found that ChatGPT heightened feelings of loneliness in a group of power users. Last month, parents of two teens who died by suicide after talking to chatbots testified to Congress about the technology's harms.

Zuckerberg still regulates humanity's attention; Meta has some 3.5 billion daily active users across its products. He has credited fast-improving algorithms with putting content people actually want in front of them, increasing time spent on the company's apps in the second quarter. Altman is moving into intention, the first — and in some cases final — draft of what we say and do.

Zuckerberg isn't ceding the future to Altman. He's desperately trying to catch up: billions in capex for data centers and chips, Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressive, NBA superstar-level offers to poach researchers. In July, Facebook published a new manifesto: ""personal superintelligence for everyone,"" essentially echoing the frontier Altman staked out.

There's upside. Coauthoring with machines can widen who gets to sound sharp, ship better work, or just be kinder in the group chat. There's also creep. The more we rely on a model as our first reader and first responder, the easier it is to mistake its output for our own thinking.

In the age of social media, we shaped and curated our identity — or identities — for the computer. In the age of AI, the computer is starting to shape and curate our identities for us.

Top Chinese and U.S. economic officials on Sunday hashed out the framework of a trade deal for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize that would pause steeper American tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls and resume U.S. soybean sales to China, U.S. officials said. 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the talks on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur had eliminated the threat of Trump's 100% tariffs on Chinese imports starting November 1. Bessent said he expects China to delay implementation of its rare earth minerals and magnets licensing regime by a year while the policy is reconsidered.

Chinese officials were more circumspect about the talks and offered no details about the outcome of the meetings.

Trump and Xi are due to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, to sign off on the terms. While the White House has officially announced the highly anticipated Trump-Xi talks, China has yet to confirm that the two leaders will meet.

""I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,"" Bessent told reporters after he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang for a fifth round of in-person discussions since May. Bessent said he anticipates that a tariff truce with China will be extended beyond its November 10 expiration date, and that China will revive substantial purchases of U.S. soybeans after buying none in September in favor of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina.

U.S. soybean farmers ""will feel very good about what's going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years"" once the deal's terms are announced, Bessent told the ABC program ""This Week.""

Greer told the ""Fox News Sunday"" program that both sides agreed to pause some punitive actions and found ""a path forward where we can have more access to rare earths from China, we can try to balance out our trade deficit with sales from the United States.""

China's Li Chenggang said the two sides reached a ""preliminary consensus"" and will next go through their respective internal approval processes.

""The U.S. position has been tough,"" Li said. ""We have experienced very intense consultations and engaged in constructive exchanges in exploring solutions and arrangements to address these concerns."" Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, his first stop in a five-day Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a face-to-face with Xi in South Korea on Thursday.

After the talks, Trump struck an optimistic tone, saying: ""I think we're going to have a deal with China."" Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs, starting on Nov. 1, in retaliation for China's expanded export controls on rare-earth magnets and minerals. China and the United States rolled back most of their triple-digit tariffs on each other's goods under a trade truce due to expire on Nov. 10.

The U.S. and Chinese officials said that in addition to rare earths, they discussed trade expansion, the U.S. fentanyl crisis, U.S. port entrance fees and the transfer of TikTok to U.S. ownership control.

Bessent told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program that the two sides have to iron out details of the TikTok deal, allowing Trump and Xi to ""consummate the transaction"" in South Korea.

On the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit, Trump hinted at possible meetings with Xi in China and the United States.

""We've agreed to meet. We're going to meet them later in China, and we're going to meet in the U.S., in either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago,"" Trump said. Among Trump's talking points with Xi are Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, concerns around democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai.

The detention of the founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily has become the most high-profile example of China's crackdown on rights in Hong Kong. Trump also said that he will seek China's help in U.S. dealings with Moscow, as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on.

Tensions between the world's two largest economies flared in the past few weeks as a delicate trade truce, reached after a first round of trade talks in Geneva in May and extended in August, failed to prevent the United States and China from hitting each other with more sanctions, export curbs and threats of stronger retaliatory measures. China's expanded controls on rare earths exports have caused a global shortage. That has prompted the United States to consider a ban on software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, according to a Reuters report.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin miners are using their computing power to service a thirsty AI boom, and investors are taking notice.

Companies once focused solely on mining digital tokens are signing long-term contracts using their land, energy, and data centers for AI workloads.

Miners like IREN (IREN), Riot (RIOT), TeraWulf (WULF), and Cipher Miner (CIFR) are just a handful of players shifting their resources toward high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and artificial intelligence.

Industry insiders point to the promise of better returns from AI than crypto mining.

""Bitcoin mining just doesn't cut it anymore,"" Daniel Keller, CEO and co-founder of cloud infrastructure firm InFlux Technologies, told Yahoo Finance.

A crowded mining field and bitcoin's price swings have squeezed margins. Jefferies analysts hly competitive mining environment and price volatility can impact bottom lines. Jefferies analysts estimate miner profits declined more than 7% in September as bitcoin prices declined.

Every four years, bitcoin's “halving” event cuts mining rewards in half, further eroding revenue over time.

""Due to halving schedules, mining is less profitable in the long run than AI computing,"" said Keller.

""Additionally, demand for AI workloads is through the roof right now, and BTC miners have what AI data centers require: affordable and consistent power housed in temperate environments,"" he added.

The pivot comes as AI demand booms and heavyweights such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) are striking new deals in the space.

Cloud hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are facing multiyear grid and permitting delays for more AI data center capacity, creating an opportunity for smaller, power-ready operators to help meet demand.

""The access to ready and cheap renewable power combined with data center capabilities positions Bitcoin miners as attractive partners for AI cloud providers looking to accelerate time-to-market and build resilient high-performance computing clusters,"" Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani said in a note earlier this month.

Bernstein analysts estimate that bitcoin miners' grid-connected power can cut data center deployment timelines by up to 75%. Additionally, their existing infrastructure is ""closer to AI data centers"" versus traditional ones.

""This allows Bitcoin miners to retrofit existing BTC mining facilities for AI/HPC at low incremental capex,"" Chhugani wrote.

Earlier this week, bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) unveiled its move into AI data centers, using its land and computing infrastructure to tap into the booming market.

The announcement follows a slew of other players pursuing similar strategies.

Miner Riot's shares are up 104% since the start of the year as the company has pivoted into AI. Over the summer, Riot announced additional acreage at its Corsicana, Texas, data center campus would be converted to mixed bitcoin and HPC use, expected to be online in 2026.

Meanwhile, bitcoin miner TeraWulf and peer Cipher Mining recently struck multibillion-dollar, decade-long leases with Fluidstack, a Google-backed AI cloud infrastructure company. Shares of TeraWulf have soared 150% since the start of the year.

In August, Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced plans to transform its 1,500-acre Helios data center campus in Dickens County, Texas, into an AI and HPC hub, in a tie-up with cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave (CRWV), whose big customers include OpenAI and Microsoft.

IREN, formally known as Iris Energy, paused its bitcoin mining expansion in April to pivot to AI cloud services. In August, the company announced the purchase of 4,200 Nvidia Blackwell chips as part of its expansion. The stock is up more than 500% year to date.

Analysts view the pivot to AI cloud services as structural and not a temporary side bet.

""Taken together — multi-year, investment-grade backstops, double-digit-year contract terms, and power-grid bottlenecks — this is not a band-aid while hyperscalers wait for their own campuses,"" Compass Point analysts Michael Donovan and Ed Engel wrote earlier this month.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto markets jumped on Sunday amid reports the US and China made progress in high-stakes trade negotiations.

The price of Bitcoin and Ethereum rose 1.6% and 2.8%, respectively, as officials said the two countries were unlikely to follow through with threats to impose sky-high tariffs and export controls.

“I would expect that the threat of the 100% [tariffs] has gone away, as has the threat of the immediate imposition of the Chinese initiating a worldwide export control regime,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS News Sunday morning.

Renewed trade tensions earlier this month sent markets tumbling and caused the single largest liquidation event in crypto history.

On October 10, China said it would further restrict export of rare earth elements used in the manufacture of computer chips and other technology.

US President Donald Trump promptly hit back. On October 11, he said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods as well as export controls on “critical software” on November 1.

Major stock market indices fell more than 2%. But crypto was hit especially hard.

Bitcoin price, which had reached an all-time high of $125,000 earlier this week, plunged 16%, falling below $105,000 briefly. Many altcoins suffered even heavier losses, tumbling between 30% and 80%.

As crypto markets dipped, leveraged traders were forced to close out their positions, causing a cascade of liquidations that eventually topped $19 billion.

Even stablecoins were hit. USDC briefly dipped below a dollar, while USDT began trading at a slight premium.

The crash prompted at least one analyst to declare that “Uptober” has been “placed on ice.”

The term refers to October's status as a historically bullish month for crypto assets.

According to Bessent, US and Chinese officials have settled several points of contention, including China's purchase of US-grown soybeans and ownership of social media platform TikTok.

“I believe that as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea,” Bessent said.

The crypto market is showing positive momentum as Ethereum and Dogecoin see gains. Amid these new animal spirits, Digitap ($TAP), a new player, is attracting attention due to its utility-based model and its applicability in cross-border payments.

The platform will simplify the process of payments to freelancers, migrants, and businesses. It has already amassed over $1 million in funds and sold 72 million coins. Given its features and rising interest, whale investors have added it to their watchlists as one of the potential coins to hold for 100x gains.



As the crypto market recovers, Ethereum has emerged as one of the top 10 crypto coins to watch at the moment. It has seen a slight recovery on the weekly chart. Still, data from CoinMarketCap shows that the Ethereum price is up by 7% on the 1W chart.



Meanwhile, whales have been accumulating Ethereum. Lookonchain data shows that a whale recently bought 8,491 $ETH. For a meaningful bullish breakout, the ETH price must clear the $3,950–$4,000 zone. Ethereum has acted as a resistance cluster over the past week. 

Sustained movement above that region could open the path for the price of Ethereum to rally toward $4,200 and $4,400. Conversely, if sellers return and drive prices below the $3,780–$3,750 support area, Ethereum could slide toward the psychological $3,600 level.

Crypto Caesar predicts that the Ethereum price might soar to $4,500 after forming a triple bottom pattern. Four Crypto Spaces also confirmed the triple bottom pattern. He says the Ethereum price may climb to $4,700.

CryptoBullet1 is also optimistic about ETH. He told his followers that ETH is tracking Bitcoin's fractal from February to December 2024. According to the expert, the price of ETH may shoot up to a new high of $6,800.

Just look at this beauty 😍$ETH is perfectly following the February-December 2024 $BTC Fractal 👌

DOGE is witnessing positive movement after a recent pullback. The Dogecoin price is up 4.6% in the weekly chart, per CoinMarketCap.



This uptrend shows that buying interest is rising in the crypto market after a steep decline earlier in October. Dogecoin's RSI has risen to 41.97, which is a sign of a bullish trend. However, the price of Dogecoin is still within bearish territory. 



This suggests there is room for a Dogecoin rally if buying pressure increases. However, investors' confidence remains shaky as the Fear and Greed Index reads Fear.

Ali_Charts noted that the Dogecoin price is ready to rebound. Also, Javon Marks notes that Dogecoin's chart points towards a 270% price spike. 

Don't make it more complicated than it is.$DOGE‘s trend points toward a nearly +270% move to All Time Highs with high likeliness of an extension.

There's no debating that. pic.twitter.com/nyYPLsCdwI

He said that the memecoin trades inside a rising channel and could soar to the middle of the channel, which corresponds to $0.25, or to the top, which is $0.33. Meanwhile, RAFAELA_RIGO_ expects the price of DOGE to climb to $0.24.

Digitap is creating a unique path in finance by merging traditional banking systems and DeFi into one platform. It seeks to take advantage of the increasing demand for quick digital transactions. Research shows that digital wallet transactions might reach over $16 trillion by 2028. 

The platform created by Digitap will allow its users to deposit fiat, store various types of cryptocurrencies, exchange assets in real-time, and connect to a Visa-issued card, enabling them to spend their crypto on Apple Pay or Google Pay.   The fintech project will also support real-time crypto-to-fiat transactions, allowing freelancers, businesses, and migrants to send and receive money anywhere in the world.

Meanwhile, Digitap has a built‑in AI routing engine that finds the most efficient path for every transaction. The project also has a mobile app, available for download on Google Play Store and App Store, which customers can use to monitor transactions and make payments.

Reliability is backed by audits from SolidProof and Coinsult. These assessments reassure users and investors that Digitap's infrastructure blends robust TradFi rails with DeFi flexibility.

Presently, Digitap is in the second round of its presale and has sold more than 50% of the tokens for this round. The $TAP coin is currently priced at $0.0194 and is expected to increase to $0.0268, an opportunity for smart investors to pocket a 38% ROI. As the adoption of Digitap increases, the value of $TAP could skyrocket by 100x, making it one of the best cryptos to buy right now.

Ethereum and Dogecoin are currently targeting key resistance zones. While a breakout could see them reclaim higher levels in the coming days, Digitap offers more upside potential.   Given its growing presale momentum and transformation of the multi-trillion-dollar market, analysts have tagged it the best cryptocurrency investment for newbies and experts who want to see 100x returns on their portfolios.

The future of blockchain security is being reshaped - not by quantum computing, as many feared, but by artificial intelligence.

Experts warn that AI is enabling state-backed hackers to carry out attacks with unprecedented speed and precision, leaving traditional defenses struggling to keep up.

North Korean cyber units have taken the lead in this new era, using AI to scan blockchain code, detect vulnerabilities, and replicate successful exploits across multiple platforms. Techniques that once required large, highly skilled teams can now be executed by small groups in a matter of minutes. The result is a dramatic amplification of their impact: even minor teams can now operate at what Chalkias, chief cryptographer at Mysten Labs, calls “industrial scale.”

In 2025 alone, these AI-assisted operations have contributed to some of the largest crypto thefts in history, including a record-breaking breach of Bybit. AI is applied throughout the attack chain – from phishing and social engineering to laundering funds via advanced pattern-recognition algorithms that trace and obscure transactions.

DeFi platforms, with their open-source code, are particularly vulnerable. AI can quickly identify repeated weaknesses across protocols, meaning a flaw in one system may expose many others. Chalkias predicts that exchanges and smart-contract platforms will soon need continuous, AI-focused security audits to keep pace with evolving threats.

While quantum computing remains a potential long-term risk, it is not the pressing danger today. AI is actively disrupting crypto security, forcing the industry to adapt defensive measures now. Embedding AI into wallets, custodians, and exchanges could provide real-time protection and automated auditing, turning the technology into a defensive ally rather than just a threat.

For North Korea, the emphasis is clear: AI-driven social engineering, deepfakes, and transaction mimicry are more effective than pursuing quantum breakthroughs. In the short term, attackers don't need quantum computers – they only need AI to execute fast, stealthy, and scalable hacks.

Data reviewed by Web3 researcher OnchainLens, using analytics from Arkham Intelligence, shows that wallets associated with the 2020 LuBian breach shifted a total of 15,959 BTC to four newly created addresses.

A new cyber tactic from North Korea is blurring the line between blockchain innovation and weaponization.

Switzerland's gambling watchdog, GESPA, has lodged a criminal complaint regarding FIFA's World Cup-themed NFT platform, citing potential breaches of national gambling laws.

A new report by U.S. cybersecurity firm Socket has revealed that North Korean hackers have infiltrated one of the internet's most vital open-source ecosystems, turning it into a weapon for cyber theft.

In a cybersecurity twist that sounds more like espionage fiction than reality, Kraken recently intercepted an attempted infiltration by a North Korean hacker—disguised as a job seeker.

Recent developments suggest that the Lazarus Group, a notorious state-sponsored hacking entity, may be behind the $305 million breach of Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin.

North Korean hackers could potentially shift their focus to U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to security experts.

North Korean hackers, under the BlueNoroff subgroup of the Lazarus Group, have escalated their cyberattacks, shifting from social media manipulation to targeted phishing emails in their 'Hidden Risk' campaign.

North Korea-linked hacking groups have looted more than $2 billion in cryptocurrency so far in 2025, according to a new report from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.

Northern Data, a company with stakes in both cryptocurrency and AI infrastructure, is currently facing a lawsuit filed in California by former executives Joshua Porter and Gulsen Kama.

Norway's central bank, Norges Bank, has backed the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as it considers a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Norway may hit the pause button on cryptocurrency mining later this year. The government announced Friday it will study whether to impose a provisional ban on mining data centers, arguing that energy and grid capacity should be reserved for more pressing needs.

Next year, Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, will decide on the potential establishment of its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the operator of Norway's $1.7 trillion Government Pension Fund Global and the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, has sharply increased its exposure to Bitcoin-linked assets, according to analysis of recent regulatory filings.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, NBIM, has increased its Bitcoin holdings to approximately $149.48 million, with a total of 2,446 BTC.

Norway's giant sovereign wealth fund - worth about $1.5 trillion — now holds more Bitcoin exposure than ever before, though not by directly buying the cryptocurrency.

Oslo-based seabed-mining firm Green Minerals is shifting its treasury reserves from kroner and dollars into bitcoin, calling the move a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk.

Notcoin, one of the breakout names in Web3 gaming last year, says the days of mindless ""tap-to-earn"" mechanics are likely over.

Brazilian digital bank Nubank has announced the immediate suspension of trading for its native cryptocurrency, Nucoin.

Nvidia and Apple are rumored to be interested in joining OpenAI's next funding round, which could potentially raise the company's valuation to over $100 billion.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has recently sold $49 million worth of NVDA shares, continuing a significant divestment trend.

Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has been rapidly offloading his shares in the company amid recent stock fluctuations.

During London Tech Week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted a critical gap in the UK's artificial intelligence ambitions: while the country is home to exceptional talent, it lacks the computing backbone necessary to lead globally.

AI-related cryptocurrencies saw significant growth last week, while Nvidia shares lost over $400 million in market capitalization.

And so that raises the question of what “nearest” means, and here this allows you to replace Euclidian distance with things like Kullback-Leibler divergence (that's the KL below) which make more sense than Euclidian distance if you're trying to measure how close two probability distributions are to each other.

reply

To me, the definition of ""nearest"" is just a technicality.The real question is: what is K?

The real question is: what is K?

For the data I work with at $dayjob I've found the Silhouette algorithm to perform best but I assume it will be extremely field specific. Clustering your data and taking a representative sample of each cluster is such a powerful trick to make big data small but finding an appropriate K is an art more than a science.

So I do a bit of work in geospatial analysis, and hotspots are better represented by DBSCAN (do not need to assign every point a cluster). I just do not even use clustering very often in gig (supervised ML and anomaly detection are much more prevalent in the rest of my work).

## TitleGeneralized K-Means Clustering for Apache Spark with Bregman Divergences## Body (3,982 characters)I've built a production-ready K-Means library for Apache Spark that supports multiple distance functions beyond Euclidean.*Why use this instead of Spark MLlib?*MLlib's KMeans is hard-coded to Euclidean distance, which is mathematically wrong for many data types:- *Probability distributions* (topic models, histograms): KL divergence is the natural metric. Euclidean treats [0.5, 0.3, 0.2] and [0.49, 0.31, 0.2] as similar even though they represent different distributions.
- *Audio/spectral data*: Itakura-Saito respects multiplicative power spectra. Euclidean incorrectly treats -20dB and -10dB as closer than -10dB and 0dB.
- *Count data* (traffic, sales): Generalized-I divergence for Poisson-distributed data.
- *Outlier robustness*: L1/Manhattan gives median-based clustering vs mean-based (L2).Using the wrong divergence yields mathematically valid but semantically meaningless clusters.*Available divergences:*

A few days ago, we learned KPop Demon Hunters would finally get some merchandise thanks to Hasbro and Mattel. If you're a fan of Magic: The Gathering, good news for you: Huntr/x is coming to a set near you in 2026.

During its recent third quarter investor call, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said the Netflix film would come to its famous card game via the Secret Lair line. In talking it up, he expects it to do pretty well, saying “if we can figure out how to get people jazzed up about SpongeBob SquarePants collectible cards, I'm pretty sure we can do it with one of the biggest movies of all time.”

That KPop is getting a Lair drop is an easier ask compared to a full-blown deck similar to Spider-Man or Final Fantasy. The latter's been a pretty big seller for Hasbro, and during the call, Cocks called the Secret Lair release for Spongebob one of its best ever. Given the movie's been so big that Netflix is bringing it back to theaters a second (technically third) time and getting Hasbro to share the toy lin with Mattel, it's easy to imagine the Secret Lair drop hitting big with newcomers and Magic fans—especially since by that point, the film will probably have been nominated for (or won) an Oscar or two.

We'll have more on the Secret Lair drop for KPop Demon Hunters, including card artwork, as news emerges.

Copper wire thefts have increased in Los Angeles and other cities, but with thieves looking outside of street lights for cables to cut, drivers expecting to use EV chargers are sometimes caught off-guard. But for the person trying to steal copper from the station, the crime is a dangerous proposition. Given the high voltage charging units use, and not a lot of money from scrap buyers, it's only questionably worth the effort. For those trying to stop this scourge, a focus on the economics involved could potentially produce a solution.With a significant number of the cut cables and smashed charging units being harvested for copper wire now, companies, governments and EV advocates are proposing everything from greater enforcement and penalties to cables that cover a vandal with ink—similar to the measures employed against bank robbers. Such a system has also been discussed in the UK, according to a BBC story from April.Los Angeles-based ChargerHelp, which helps train technicians to diagnose and repair EV charging stations and offers data on station uptime and downtime, and the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, recently spoke about the problem in that city where many neighborhoods continue to experience widespread copper wire thefts, leaving some of them dark. Thefts at public and workplace EV charging stations have also grown and also cost hundreds or thousands of dollars each to repair.“For level two, slower chargers, you're seeing anywhere between $650 to $700 for the connector plus the labor. But then, when you start talking about DC fast chargers, it can go all the way up to $1,500,” ChargerHelp CEO Kameale C. Terry told Los Angeles' KABC on Oct. 22. Some solutions sound simple, such as thicker cables that are harder to cut, or using wireless charging pads for cars. But thicker cables are heavier and more cumbersome to use for some drivers and the only EV with wireless charging capability set for sale in the US is the Porsche Cayenne Electric, which at this point has only been seen in prototype form.Several bills in California have been signed in the last few years to hold various agencies accountable for broken and vandalized public EV charging stations in the state, such as mandating governments to identify and repair broken charging units within 30 days.California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a bill into law that imposes stricter laws and penalties for metal recycling, including identification and personal information from the seller, identification of the vehicle used to transport the material, and proof that the metal being sold was legally obtained. There are also restrictions on what metal scrap buyers can lawfully accept, with an eye toward materials from EV chargers. Matt Petersen, CEO of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, said even charging stations at his offices, have been targeted. And he and Terry told KABC that they are concerned more downtime and vandalism of charging stations will further hurt EV adoption, and slow the addition of stations for existing electric drivers—unless solutions are found soon.“All our focus is, ‘How do we accelerate transportation electrification?'”

Eberechi Eze's first-half strike proved the difference as Arsenal beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Sunday. Eze's goal was his first of the season as the Gunners downed the England international's former employers on home turf to go four points clear at the top of the Premier League table.

The Gunners weren't wholly convincing against the Eagles but did just enough to claim another huge three points as Arsenal capitalised on their title rivals Manchester City and Liverpool dropping points over the weekend.

Eze beat Dean Henderson with a fine hit shortly before the break and despite a late Palace push, the Gunners held out to secure all the spoils.

Jude Bellingham had a hand in both goals, and Kylian Mbappe continued his excellent run of form as Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-1 in the first Clasico of the season. It was hardly a legendary iteration of this famous fixture, but two first-half goals from Los Blancos were enough to see off the short-handed Blaugrana. 

Madrid thought they might have had a penalty early on, but saw it chalked off after Vinicius Jr was adjudged to have kicked Lamine Yamal, rather than the other way round, as the Brazilian burst into the box. Mbappe then had a goal disallowed for a narrow offside, but he wasn't to be denied, and soon after Bellingham played him through and Mbappe lashed into the bottom corner.

Los Blancos then gifted Barca an equaliser as Arda Guler gave the ball away on the edge of his own box to allow an unmarked Fermin Lopez to ghost into the area and finish. But Madrid had more in them, still, and Bellingham made it 2-1 thanks to an easy tap-in after no one tracked the Englishman on a set-piece. 

Xabi Alonso's side had a chance to put the game away in the second half from the spot, yet Wojciech Szczesny responded, saving Mbappe's penalty after a lengthy VAR review handed Madrid a fortuitous spot-kick. It was a rather quiet second half, otherwise as Madrid sat in while Barca, without the injured Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, had few attacking ideas.

Joao Fonseca continued his impressive rise on Sunday at the Swiss Indoors Basel, where he won his second tour-level title and first at ATP 500 level to inflict more final heartbreak on Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

The 19-year-old played fearlessly in the biggest match of his life to earn a 6-3, 6-4 victory in Basel against Davidovich Fokina, who holds a 0-5 record in tour-level finals.

Fonseca is the first Brazilian to win a title above ATP 250 level since Gustavo Kuerten clinched the ATP Masters 1000 crown in Cincinnati in 2001, while he is the third-youngest player to win an ATP 500 title since the series began in 2009.

""It is crazy. I want to thank my family and my coaches who helped me achieve this amazing effort,"" Fonseca said. ""My parents just came from Brazil. They were coming to Paris and changed their flights and came here one hour before the match with my uncles. It is just amazing to have them here for the biggest title of my career. It is a pleasure playing this sport and this tournament and I am very happy.""

Fonseca's victory in Switzerland marks the latest breakthrough moment in his flourishing early career. The 19-year-old won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF title in Jeddah last December and then captured his first Top 10 win at the Australian Open, where he beat Andrey Rublev.
Title success followed at the ATP 250 in Buenos Aires, where he became the youngest South American champion in the ATP Tour Era (since 1990). Fonseca will climb to a career-high No. 28 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday following his latest triumph, having started the year at No. 145.
""They were the ones that believed in me,"" Fonseca said when asked about his parents. ""I was thinking about going to university and they said it was my choice and they would be there to support me. I just want to thank them. Since I was young, my mum travelled with me. Since I was 11, I only travelled with her, so that title is for her.""

In a high-quality performance, Fonseca clubbed 15 winners in the first set, rushing Davidovich Fokina, who struggled to cope with the Brazilian's power. The 19-year-old stood close to the baseline to dictate and converted on his fourth set point to lead. Fonseca continued to pile on the pressure in the second set and closed out on serve after failing to convert a championship point on return at 5-3. The 19-year-old leads the Spaniard 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series following his 86-minute victory.
Fonseca achieved a performance rating of 8.91, which combines In Attack, Conversion, Steal and Shot Quality to show overall performance level. The #NextGenATP star struck 28 winners to 19 unforced errors and struck his forehand at an average of 81 mph, six mph faster than Davidovich Fokina. Fonseca is 25-15 on the year, according to Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
Davidovich Fokina has now lost four finals in 2025 and five overall. He squandered two championship points against Miomir Kecmanovic in Delray Beach and then three against Alex de Minaur in Washington. The 26-year-old also fell in the title match in Acapulco to Tomas Machac.
Despite his latest heartbreak, the Spaniard is up to No. 15 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career-high on Monday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Inside the Erste Bank Open's historic new venue","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/vienna-2025-savour-the-spectacle","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 14:09:53 GMT","

 When it came to the next big move in the future of the Erste Bank Open, the team behind the ATP 500 dug deep into Vienna's past. 

 An indoor hard-court event uniquely held across two venues, the Erste Bank Open this year featured a new tournament site: the historic Marx-Halle, a structure which served as the main cattle market of the Austrian capital for 120 years before being repurposed as an events venue.

 This past 10 days, the Marx-Halle has hosted qualifying and main-draw matches for both singles and doubles at the Erste Bank Open. For tournament director Herwig Straka, the new venue has been a high-quality addition that perfectly complements the event's longtime Centre Court venue, the Wiener Stadthalle, where Jannik Sinner and Alexander Zverev will clash on Sunday in a blockbuster championship match. 

 “We found Marx-Halle and we knew it was a brilliant location because it has enough space,” Straka told ATPTour.com when asked about his tournament's motivations for a new second site. “It's the same conditions as the Stadthalle and we can do what we always try to do: To expand, run activities for kids and families. Then we translated it to the idea of fans [being able to purchase] a ground ticket.” 

 For the previous four editions of the Erste Bank Open, the tournament's second site was a temporary structure on the Heumarkt, a square in Vienna's city centre. Straka says the move to the Marx-Halle was motivated by a clear set of goals, and the feedback he has received across the tournament suggests he and his team have achieved them. 

 “[The clearest improvement] is the number of courts,” said Straka of the Marx-Halle, which features two match courts and one practice court and can host up to 25,000 fans. “The option to run a wheelchair event now at a professional level. Maybe additional events in the future we could add. It is space, and real indoor playing conditions. That is the main difference and improvement [from the Heumarkt].""

 The No. 16 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Bublik, as well as other Top 40 stars Francisco Cerundolo, Flavio Cobolli, Tomas Machac, Alex Michelsen and Corentin Moutet are among those to have contested singles matches at the Marx-Halle this past week. It has also functioned as the main practice facility for all the players competing at the stacked ATP 500. 

 “We wanted to improve the quality for the players [with our new venue],” said Straka. “It feels one to one exactly like it does in the Stadthalle. We've had brilliant feedback. All the players, Jannik, Sascha, have practised there. It's that kind of feeling we wanted to create, and we were successful.” 



 As well as ensuring players are catered for, Straka's other primary concern when planning the Marx-Halle venue was for visiting fans. He cites the more ‘personal', up-close experience available to tennis lovers as an obvious plus point. 

 “The fans can get very close to top players and inhale and feel much more than you could do at a main centre court,” said Straka. “The energy of the players and their game, even in practice. There are a lot of tennis fans there who play themselves actively, so for them watching Jannik practise, for example, is a big experience. 

 “I was very proud of the tennis in the city concept [from previous years], but at some stage you need to be ready for the next step and to improve. This is the next step.”

The pop star was at the top of her game, performing tracks from all three of her studio albums.

Billie Eilish has been touring for well over a year at this point. She's probably exhausted — it would be understandable if she was sick and tired of life on the go — but if either of those things were true, the thousands of fans at the UBS Arena in New York on Saturday night (Oct. 25) would never have been able to tell.


	The singer — who previously stopped through NYC's Madison Square Garden in October 2024 — was poised, energetic and appeared to be having the the time of her life on stage, playing the first of two back-to-back shows at the venue on her mammoth Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour supporting last year's album of the same name. If anything, Eilish's marathon time on the road since the trek kicked off two Septembers ago has only made her a stronger, sharper performer, with the star commanding her setlist of songs spanning all three of her studio albums, her debut EP Don't Smile at Me and club-ready Charli xcx collaboration “Guess” with impressive stamina and musicality.


	And despite a headline-making instance of an over-aggressive concertgoer forcibly yanking her at a show in Miami, the best part of Saturday's show was the vulnerable connection and trust Eilish maintains with her fans regardless of the potential dangers. “You're very precious to me, and I feel the need to protect you always,” she said shortly before performing Oscar-winning Barbie anthem “What Was I Made For?” while holding the hands of front-rowers reaching out to her.


	“I just love you so much, and I'll always fight for you and stand up for you,” she added. “Just know that I got you, and I know you got me.”


	Eilish, finally, is now in the final stretch of her HMHAS tour, with the nine-time Grammy winner having just a month left of shows to go before wrapping with two nights at the Chase Center in San Francisco in late November. From impeccable vocal moments to a hilarious looper snafu, check out Billboard‘s roundup of the best moments from her last stop in New York on her finale lap through the United States below.


	This certainly isn't the first time Eilish's vocal growth has been pointed out, but if there's anyone left out there who still thinks of her as a quiet, whisper-soft singer, all they need to do is attend one of her concerts to realize how wrong they are. Even from the opening number — Hit Me Hard and Soft‘s “Chihiro” — it was clear that she has completely leveled up in her singing capabilities, with the star beautifully belting freely and often throughout the set. That even included songs where you wouldn't necessarily expect her to let loose vocally, like on “NDA,” but it only ever elevated the original versions.


	Nearly a year and a half after Billboard ranked “Wildflower” the No. 1 song on Hit Me Hard and Soft, Eilish proved that the track is still one of her all-timers with an exquisite and palpably passionate live performance toward the beginning of her set. It also marked one of the loudest instances of fans singing along with her the entire night, with the crowd becoming part of the show by screaming the studio version's backup vocals in call-and-response form — something that's become a tradition amongst Eilish's concertgoers.


	Another thing that made the number extra special: the arena holding up their phone flashlights without Eilish even having to ask, surrounding her in a comforting glow as she poured her heart out in some of the most vulnerable lyrics she's ever written.


	One of the coolest moments in Eilish's show is when she performs “When the Party's Over” from debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? a cappella, stacking her own harmonies with a looper tool. “Listen, listen,” she instructed the crowd beforehand. “The thing is, it will only work if the entire room is completely silent for, like, one minute. It's the only time in the whole show that you'll have to be quiet.”


	Despite Eilish's plea, a fan or two couldn't help themselves when the arena went silent. “I love you!” they screamed as the singer recorded her first harmony layer, after which other audience members loudly scolded them.


	Unfortunately, the rogue “I love you!” did make it into the loop, and as it played again and again while Eilish continued stacking vocals, the crowd — assuming that people were still being unruly and not realizing that it was the same “I love you” being repeated — continued chastising the rule-breakers, which led to even more noise bleeding into the recording. Eilish, however, took it in stride, cracking up a little before giving a “yikes” expression and moving the number along like a pro, extra sound effects included.


	Shortly before one of the show's quieter moments — during which Eilish invites fans to sit down for a spell as she sings moving ballad “Your Power” and accompanies herself on acoustic guitar — the star gave a stirring speech about the importance of connecting with others through live music. “It's, like, a really dark time in the world,” she began.


	“It's a really scary time, and it's hard to feel like there's anything that's making a difference at all,” Eilish continued. “It feels like we're all doomed a little bit … but also, I think that it's really special that we have [this]. I have this feeling of like, ‘Oh, I shouldn't do shows, maybe, because I feel like there's more important things in the world,' or something. Then I think, ‘It's actually really important that we have things that bring us together and art that we love, and that we have togetherness at all.'”


	She went on to share that she feels “really, really grateful and lucky” that she gets to hold concerts at a time when it's more vital than ever. “I think we all really need it, and we need to be together, and we need to have this glue that keeps us one, you know?” Eilish added. “I hope you feel safe here, and I hope that you feel comfortable to be yourself.”


	Eilish's visuals — which included lasers, horror-movie-esque stills and pyrotechnics — were top tier throughout the one-hour, 45-minute show, but one of the best effects also happened to be the most simple. At different points in the program, the singer carried a handheld camera with her as she walked around and under her stage, giving each individual band and crew member a chance to wave “hi” to the audience as the feed projected live on the big screens. 


	She also carried the camera as she moved through the pit and performed “Guess” on a B-stage, where Eilish pointed the lens down at the fans below and gave them a rare glimpse at her POV. Without the handheld, the crowd also never would have gotten to see the completely random visitor Eilish had chilling beneath the stage the entire time — a life-size Tinky-Winky Teletubby — whom she filmed while crossing under the risers between “Everything I Wanted” and a mashup of “Lovely,” “Blue” and “Ocean Eyes” on piano. Eh-oh!

Laugh Factory Chicago is crowdsourcing to assist night manager Nathan Griffin with legal funds after he was arrested Friday morning outside the comedy club.


	Despite being born in America, masked federal agents tackled him to the ground and reportedly took him into custody without due process, for attempting to intervene with an immigration operation.


	A video of the arrest shows at least four agents in camouflage pushing Griffin to the ground and handcuffing him, briefly pinning his mother Elaine Plybon down in the process. “Why are you doing this? Where are you taking him?” bystanders could be heard shouting as he was put in the backseat.

	











	“After being arrested and hidden throughout the system, he finally resurfaced about 4 hours after his detainment in FBI custody awaiting a hearing for a federal assault charge which could carry 8 years in prison if convicted,” wrote Griffin's brother-in-law on a GoFundMe page for his attorney costs.

	In a video since posted by his mother, she noted that her “voice is still very messed up” and her hand is hurting from the altercation. “For those of you who don't know, I was in Chicago visiting my son, and he was kidnapped by Border Patrol in front of my eyes,” she said.


	“When I think about going out the door in the morning, I don't want to,” she added in part. “Because I do not want to encounter the SUV, the screams, the crying and the horrific things that I saw before I was pulled into the fray when somebody tried to kidnap my son.


	Neighborhood resident Will Kolic told NBC Chicago he saw agents pull up and grab a man who appeared to be Hispanic before people gathered and “started screaming stop it,” before more agents stepped out of the vehicle and arrested Griffin.


	A Border Patrol spokesperson told the outlet that Griffin “attempted to impede and obstruct federal officers” by attempting to shut the car door on an agent's leg. “The individual was immediately detained and turned over to the FBI for investigation,” they said.

	










A post shared by Elaine Plybon (@eplybon)


	Chicago Police arrived on the scene around 9:20am in response to a call about a battery in progress, telling NBC they worked to “de-escalate and conduct crowd control to ensure all those who had gathered at the location remained safe.”


	In a since deleted post by Laugh Factory Chicago, sharing the arrest video, they stated that Griffin's family is aware of his arrest and “actively working to get his release,” according to CBS News.


	Griffin's arrest comes after the Trump administration deployed 300 California National Guard troops to Oregon, under the guise of law and order, in addition to boots on the ground in Chicago and other major cities.

	As Yorgos Lanthimos rolls out another award-worthy film with Emma Stone for the third consecutive year, he's due for some R & R.


	The 5x Oscar nominee recently admitted he needs “a little break” after his latest movie Bugonia‘s wide release on Oct. 31, despite also intending to take a breather after his previous two titles, Poor Things (2023) and Kinds of Kindness (2024).


	“Well, I can't keep doing that anymore. [Laughs] That's what we're certain of right now,” he told Collider, adding: “It's a big mistake. I think I need a break. I've said that before in between the other three, but I'm serious now. You can hold me to it. I'm going to take a little break.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Lanthimos' pending hiatus comes after Poor Things earned him Academy Award nods for Best Picture and Best Director, while Stone won the award for Best Actress. The pair also made Kinds of Kindness while he completed post-production on Poor Things.


	“I decide which film to make every time a script is ready, so when it is ready, and we've been working on something for such a long time, it just feels like a shame to just leave it there and wait,” he explained. “So, I kind of forced myself, almost, to try and find the time to do it immediately after I finished something.” 


	Lanthimos continued, “Like we shot Kinds of Kindness during that very long period of VFX on Poor Things, so I felt that I needed to do something during that time. Then, Bugonia, I had read three years before, and we worked with Will [Tracy] a little bit on the script, so it felt ready, and we just wanted to go out and make it. So, you find the will and the strength, but at some point, it runs out. We're at that point.”


	In Bugonia, now playing in select theaters, two conspiracy theorists (Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis) kidnap a powerful CEO (Stone), convinced she's an alien intent on destroying Earth.

Lana Del Rey took the stage Saturday at Neil Young's “Harvest Moon” charity concert, with the singer opened her set with a rendition of the host's “The Needle and the Damage Done.”


	“I thought we'd get started with a little bit of Neil,” Del Rey told the crowd as she walked onstage at Lake Hughes, California's Painted Turtle Summer Camp. She and her band then launched into a faithful and stirring take on the Harvest classic.


	Del Rey's set also included performances of her own “Arcadia,” “Video Games,” “Summertime Sadness,” and “Norman Fucking Rockwell,” as well as her first-ever solo performance of “Let the Light In.”

	Saturday's gig marked Del Rey's last scheduled performance of 2025 — and the last show on her live itinerary in general — but there's always the slim chance she might randomly hop up onstage if the moment strikes her. The singer previously revealed that her country-inspired album has been pushed to 2026.

	











	This year's Harvest Moon concert also featured sets from Beck, John Mayer, and Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts. Proceeds from the concert will benefit the Painted Turtle, which provides a summer camp experience for kids with serious medical issues, and the Bridge School, which educates children with severe speech and physical disabilities.

	In late 1961, barely a year after he'd arrived in New York City from the Midwest, Bob Dylan already contained multitudes. The proof arrives early in Through the Open Window, the 18th edition of Dylan's ongoing Bootleg Series. That fall, Dylan, then only 20 years old, recorded his first album with producer John Hammond. Among the many unheard tapes crammed into the box's eight discs are leftovers from those sessions, including an alternate version of the traditional “Man of Constant Sorrow.” Sounding like an unsure Boy Scout asking for the approval of his Scoutmaster after attempting a square knot, Dylan lays down a take and then asks Hammond,  “Did you get that? … Did you like that?” But when Hammond asks if anyone else had cut the song already, a different Dylan emerges. “Not that way … A different way, I guess,” he says, before mentioning a peer on the scene who'd already released a version of the song. “Judy Collins did it. But not a version … not like that. That's a different one.”

	











	On a compilation that gives us any number of glimpses into Dylan's growth and creative process before he went electric, that moment is both a throwaway and a deep reveal. Dylan's version of “Man of Constant Sorrow” isn't vastly superior to anyone else's; he doesn't rock it out like he did with other folk and blues songs he was playing at the time. But his subtle brush-off of Collins is a sign of the cocky and brash kid already beginning to emerge — the same one who could cut down people down to size on his way to redefining himself and jolting both the New York folk scene and the world of pop at large.

	Taking in the years 1956 to 1963, Through the Open Window serves as an unofficial companion to last year's A Complete Unknown biopic. It starts before that entirely credible and affecting film did, with a teenage Robert Zimmerman romping through the Shirley & Lee hit  “Let the Good Times Roll” in a St. Paul music store (the first known recording of Dylan). The box wraps up about two years before Dylan's rampaging performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, depicted in the movie. As with the film, it tells a familiar story: earnest and ambitious but seemingly fumbling kid with a mysterious background moves to the big city, ingratiates himself with a music community, knocks everyone's beret's off with his skills and songs, and then begins leaving behind all those inspired by news headlines in favor of more ambitious, poetic, and personal ones.

	Needless to say, that story has been told on his official releases of the era, from Bob Dylan to Another Side of Bob Dylan and Bringing It All Back Home and beyond. But Through the Open Window brings us another side of that transformation. Using a plethora of sources — unearthed club recordings, tapes of Dylan singing in people's homes or at rallies, outtakes from recording sessions, stage remarks — it allows us to eavesdrop as Dylan moves from the Midwest to New York, hits the Village coffeehouse and club circuit, tries out songs for friends, interacts with fellow performers, plunders some of their repertoire (especially that of his mentor Dave Van Ronk), even interacts with a gushing radio DJ. As familiar as that map is, we've never been afforded such a granular document of that metamorphosis, and how fast, relentless, and often breathtaking it could be.  


	Compiled by Steve Berkowitz and Sean Wilentz, the massive box (also available in a two-disc distillation for Dylanologists on a budget) includes a certain amount of material already available on previous Bootleg Series editions and other Dylan compilations. But 48 of its cuts have never been heard by anyone other than collectors and Dylan's gatekeepers, which lends added weight to its historic value. We finally get to hear one of his fall 1961 sets at Gerde's Folk City: not the one that New York Times critic Robert Shelton saw, resulting in the rave review that landed Dylan his record deal, but one a few nights later, which is close enough. We get the first-ever live performance of “Blowin' in the Wind,” which shows how fully formed the song was from the start. Not all of these rarities live up to their legends: that Folk City set is a bit anticlimactic, and “Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues,” his infamous dig at the nutjob conservative group, is a little too cute. But their appearance on any Dylan collection is long overdue.

	Along the way, though, Dylan's transformation from frisky, plucky folk upstart — a walking, talking, cap-wearing version of the Anthology of Folk Music collection everyone was discovering at the time — to master of his domain is heard in large and small ways. Recordings of him playing Woody Guthrie and Jesse Fuller songs before he moved to New York show how fully invested he already was in American vernacular music; his sound and persona were already in the works before he stepped into his friend's car for that ride to New York City. We also hear deeper examples of the way he pillaged the sources around him. On a recording of an early, bumpier version of “Tomorrow Is a Long Time,” he mentions the “tape recorder machine” in front of him as if he were auditioning for a Guthrie biopic.


	As anyone who saw his early New York performances still attests, Dylan was also legitimately funny, and the comic timing on display in these tapes is another revelation. At various shows, he charms audiences with tales of almost getting hit by a bus on the way to the venues, the idea of written setlists (“I don't much believe in lists … I went around and I copied down all the best songs I could find off everybody else's lists,” he cracks), or a hokey fake-hootenanny movie he'd just seen in Times Square (“Don't tell anybody,” he jokes, adding, “42nd Street, a very hip street”). It's a chatty, endearing side of Dylan we've rarely, if ever, heard onstage since. There are also hints of his post-folk future in an early original, “I Got a New Girl,” which he croons as if prepping for Self-Portrait years later, and the piano-locomotive “Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,” a Times They Are A-Changin' outtake that pounds with a rock & roll heart. No purist was he, right from the start.

	As the box hurtles toward its finale — the complete recording of his fall 1963 Carnegie Hall concert, which cemented his stature — Dylan's feel for traditional songs grows deeper, and the growth in his own songwriting, so quickly, remains astounding. The transformation of “Tomorrow Is a Long Time” into the somber beauty it became is remarkable, and a version of “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,” taped at a friend's place in Los Angles, is mesmerizing. By the time he arrives at Carnegie Hall, with three albums under his belt, Dylan is fully in command of his voice, songs, and presence. He sings his “North Country Blues” as if he were a member of that devastated coal-mining family before moving onto “A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,” which feels like a statement of its own: That was the feel of folk music then, but this is folk music now, and on his terms.

	











	That tape, which takes up the last two discs of Through the Open Window, is also unexpectedly illuminating. The audience is hushed during his protest songs and laughs adoringly when he talks about an academic not quite understanding the title phrase of “Blowin' in the Wind.” (“Now this guy's gonna be a teacher!” Dylan retorts.) They sound in awe of him, as they should: The recording stands as one of Dylan's greatest (unreleased) concert albums. In that moment, on that night, the very thought that he would largely abandon that approach and some of those songs — he would never again play a few of them, like “Lay Down Your Weary Tune” — must have been unfathomable, and we share their discombobulation. Yet move on he did, plugging in just over a year and a half later and leaving that period in the Carnegie Hall dust. But as Through the Open Window makes clear, he was always on the verge of slamming one window shut and opening another to an entirely different world.

As if zombies weren't enough to worry about, downtown Elgin was the scene of an extraterrestrial invasion Saturday night during the annual Nightmare on Chicago Street.

The 13th iteration of the Halloween fright festival featured thousands of revelers in the streets of the downtown Elgin “safe zone,” while hundreds of performers, including zombie and alien actors, musicians and dancers, lurched along streets and entertained on multiple stages.

This year's alien invasion theme was premised on extraterrestrials using televisions and lost VHS tapes to unleash horror on the earthlings.

Juan Pietras of Rockford was at his fourth Nightmare and was happy to see a thinner crowd early in the night than in years past.

“It's always a good time,” he said while he sipped a drink and watched the crowd on South Grove Avenue. “Being able to walk around and see all the costumes is the best.”

Juan and his friends paid for VIP tickets, which allowed them early entrance and early food and drink before the crowds showed up after 8 p.m.

The sprawling event area included three stages with music, including performances on the main stage by 12-piece brass/funk band My Son the Hurricane, 1990s throwback band Nerdvana, alt-punk band Take the Reins and DJ Cold.

The Plaza Stage featured the Afro-Latin grooves and punk-rock energy of La Misa as well as Chicago's Future Nobodies, Latin-based DJ JTC and hard core/ska band La Pobreska.

Select businesses within the safe zone were open and offering food and specialty drinks. The event also featured four themed pop-up bars for guests with all-access tickets, with settings that included a forgotten video store, a secret science-fiction facility, an Aztec underworld and a mad scientist's mansion.

Seven “street experiences” included themes of “First Contact,” “Plaza Mictlán,” “Safe Zone,” “Cirq D' Freak,” “Kingdom of Plantae,” “Thunder-Dome: Welcome to the ​Blood Lands,” and “Svengoolie's B-movie Boulevard,” which included a meet-and-scream with Svengoolie himself.

Dozens of vendors lined the streets, selling food, drinks and merchandise, while Bizarre Bazaar, a haunted marketplace, offered creepy crafts, trinkets, occult oddities and more.","{'href': 'https://www.dailyherald.com', 'title': 'Daily Herald'}","other"

A gripping debut that unearths ancient evils and the eternal struggle between redemption and damnation.

OMAHA, NE, UNITED STATES, October 26, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Emerging author Edward Lillion announces the release of his debut novel, The Old Lords, a chilling supernatural thriller that delves into the battle between Heaven's betrayed angels and the fallen Ones who seek to rise again. Blending political intrigue, theology, and horror, Lillion's story confronts the nature of power, corruption, and the human soul.

About the BookWhen journalist Damian Hunter's wife falls into an unexplained coma, his desperate search for answers thrusts him into the secret underworld of vampire politics, demonic possession, and conspiracies older than civilization itself.

Twelve years after vampires revealed themselves to humanity, a hidden Council of seven immortal lords manipulates global wealth, power, and blood. At its center sits Luciaus, an ancient being born of a cursed ritual—ruling from the Red Throne with charisma and cruelty in equal measure.

But something even older is awakening. Shadows move in hospital corridors. Whispers fill Damian's dreams. And an ancient book—the NarShian—may hold the key to saving his wife... or destroying his soul.

From ancient Austria to modern Boston and Vienna's blood-soaked palaces, The Old Lords spans continents and centuries as Damian unravels a cosmic war that has never truly ended. As he descends deeper into the darkness, he discovers that the greatest battle may not be between angels and demons—but within himself.

A blend of supernatural horror, political conspiracy, and spiritual reckoning, The Old Lords invites readers into a world where faith falters, evil evolves, and the line between redemption and ruin blurs forever.

About the AuthorEdward Lillion, a Pittsburgh-born author, writes stories that explore the shadows of the human soul—where redemption, destiny, and darkness converge. The Old Lords, his debut novel, marks the beginning of a powerful literary journey into the unseen forces that shape humanity's fate.

            Former New York Jets All-Pro center Nick Mangold died at the age of 41 due to complications of kidney disease, the team announced on Sunday.
    


            Mangold died on Saturday night after battling chronic kidney disease for nearly 19 years and was undergoing dialysis.
    


Former New York Jets star Nick Mangold seeking kidney transplant, asks fans to consider donating



            “Nick was more than a legendary center,” Jets Chairman Woody Johnson said in a statement. “He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.”
    


            The news comes ahead of the Jets' game against the Bengals in Cincinnati, where the team is looking for its first win of the season.
    

💚 pic.twitter.com/9ieu0ICKOW


            On ESPN's “Sunday NFL Countdown,” Mangold's former head coach, Rex Ryan, was emotional upon learning of his passsing.
    


            “It's brutal,” Ryan said with Pro Football Hall of Famer Randy Moss consoling him. “Such a great young man. I had the pleasure of coaching him for all six years with the Jets.
    


            “I remember it was obvious I was getting fired. My last game, Mangold's injured. Like, injured. He comes to me and says, ‘I'm playing this game.' He wanted to play for me. That's what I remember about this kid. He was awesome and just way too young. I feel so bad for his wife and family – rough.”
    


            Earlier this month, he addressed his health situation in a plea posted on social media where he appealed for a kidney donor.
    


            “This isn't an easy message to share, but I want to be open about what's been happening with me and my health,” the former lineman stated in a statement addressed to the Jets and Ohio State University communities. Mangold won a national championship with the Buckeyes in 2002.
    


            “In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease. After a rough summer, I'm undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant,” the 41-year-old wrote. “I always knew this day would come, but I thought I would have had more time.
    


            “Unfortunately, I do not have any family able to donate at this time, so this is why I'm reaching out to you, our NY Jets and Ohio State communities. I am in need of a kidney donor with type O blood.”
    


            The Jets drafted Mangold in the first round of the 2006 NFL draft out of Ohio State.
    


            “The Ohio State football program is saddened by the news of Nick Mangold's passing and sends heartfelt condolences to his family and friends,” the Buckeyes said on Sunday.
    


            The seven-time Pro Bowler played all 11 seasons with the Jets, where he was a two-time first-team All-Pro and made the second-team All-Pro once. The franchise inducted Mangold into the team's Ring of Honor in 2022.
    


            In September, Mangold was named as one of 128 modern-era players on the initial list for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026.
    


            “On behalf of the entire Johnson family and the New York Jets organization, we offer our sincere condolences to Jenny, their four children — Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte — as well as to Nick's extended family, friends, and all who loved him,” Johnson said.
    


            “Nick Mangold will forever be a Jet,” Johnson added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Better Cryptocurrency Buy: Ethereum vs. Zcash","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-cryptocurrency-buy-ethereum-vs-171800949.html","Sun, 26 Oct 2025 17:18:00 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum is exposed to growth from multiple categories of assets being managed on its chain.

Zcash is growing by onboarding users seeking its privacy features.

Only one of these coins is well-aligned with financial regulators as of today.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

It's quite clear that both Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Zcash (CRYPTO: ZEC) have value. Right now, Zcash's price is sprinting upward each day, and during the past three months, it has gained more than 500%. On the other hand, Ethereum remains the network where most of the useful financial activity happens, and that activity is increasingly aligned with how big money wants to operate.

So, which is the better coin to buy?

Investors win when an asset offers real economic value.

On that front, Ethereum leads the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector by a wide margin. You can see this in its total value locked (TVL) of $86.8 billion, which is a strong proxy for the amount of work being done on the chain. As of today, Ethereum hosts the largest DeFi base by far, as it makes inroads in another important growth segment: real-world assets.

The most credible institutional use case in crypto right now is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) like U.S. Treasuries and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Ethereum is the default venue, with $11.9 billion in RWAs parked on its chain. As RWA-related capital inflows continue, the coin will be in higher demand and feature more value on its chain.

Of course, Ethereum has plenty of competition in DeFi and RWAs. It will have even more competition in the future. The point is that large asset managers already build on or start from Ethereum's stack, then branch out to other chains as they see the benefits of doing so. This matters for the long term because it helps cement standards, tooling, and liquidity based on Ethereum's norms and requirements.

Buying Ethereum today is buying the leading blockchain for asset management today and tomorrow, and, as an investment thesis, its progress makes taking the plunge look fairly appealing.

Zcash doesn't have a DeFi ecosystem, nor will it. It's also unlikely that the chain will be used to manage RWAs anytime soon. As a privacy coin, its use case is much closer to Bitcoin's. It also has some additional features which, if used, can mask the identities of senders and receivers, as well as the quantity transacted.

In practice, however, investors must weigh this promise against real frictions.

First, the regulation remains a significant headwind for privacy coins. In short, financial regulators do not like it when there are assets that can be used for private transactions, as that could shield illegal activity. Thus, Zcash has struggled to remain listed on some of the leading crypto exchanges, and has actually been delisted in some cases.

Second, Zcash's privacy is optional, and at least a tiny bit inconvenient to those who use it. Many coinholders transact transparently rather than using shielded wallet addresses, undercutting the network's differentiation in day-to-day usage. Shielded adoption is growing compared to the past, but it still isn't a majority of the network's transaction value.

Finally, Zcash's value mechanism is thin compared to Ethereum's. There is no comparable DeFi or RWA ecosystem on offer. Thus, it relies on its Bitcoin-like scarcity mechanisms, including its halving process, and persistent demand for its privacy capabilities, to have any shot at gaining in value over the long term.

Could Zcash be a good investment in light of those constraints? Yes, it could be, and for many, it probably will be. But as of today, compared to Ethereum, Zcash is a smaller asset with far more obstacle to its success, some of which are unlikely to abate.

For investors allocating capital, Ethereum is the better buy today. Zcash could still be a decent purchase, but it's higher-risk. Putting aside its recent moonshot, it probably doesn't have as much upside in store for those who buy it now.

...

Real Madrid came out on top in El Clásico for the first time under Xabi Alonso as they overcame Barcelona with a 2-1 victory at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday after on, with Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham on the scoresheet either side of a Fermín López equaliser. The result means Real Madrid now sleep five points clear at the top of La Liga, ahead of Barcelona, and seven points ahead of Villarreal in third place.

1. Who would play in defence?

Even though the line-up seemed pretty clear, there were so many defensive injuries and doubts that it left question marks over who would play in the Real Madrid defence. With Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Dean Huijsen and Raúl Asencio all overcoming knocks and injuries to make the squad, Huijsen was the only man to start, and the defensive unit looked as strong as ever. Injury to Fede Valverde, forced off with what seemed like a pulled muscle in the second half, could force Xabi Alonso into making a decision on his first-choice right-back sooner rather than later. On this occasion, it was Carvajal who came on to replace the vice-captain, but both him and Alexander-Arnold will compete for the spot against Valencia next weekend.

2. Could Xabi Alonso get his first “high-stakes” win?

After the derby defeat against Atlético Madrid, which followed the Club World Cup semi-final loss to Paris Saint-Germain, the question of Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid quickly became whether he was capable of getting a “big win” out of his team. Following in the footsteps of Carlo Ancelotti, a specialist in the big occasions, Alonso has had his work cut out but knew that in becoming only the second Real Madrid coach to win his first Clásico in the last decade, matching Zinedine Zidane, he would go some way to calming those nerves. This was an impressive win not only in terms of the performance, but in terms of the tactical set-up which outsmarted Hansi Flick and Barcelona from the off. At no point in this game did Barcelona look like they were on top or the better team. Job done for Xabi Alonso.

3. How far would Barcelona be from their best?

With no Hansi Flick in the dugout as he served a suspension, it was true that this was not Barcelona at their full strength. Without Robert Lewandowski or Raphinha in attack, while Lamine Yamal was not fully fit, without Gavi or Dani Olmo in midfield, Andreas Christensen in defence, or Joan García or Marc-André Ter Stegen in goal, Barça were lacking far more regulars than Real Madrid, even with their defensive absences. The question was whether Real Madrid would be able to make the most of this. They did, while Wojciech Szczesny produced arguably his best performance in a Barcelona shirt, Real Madrid exploited the gaps in midfield and were able to shut out the Barça offensive block easily. Lamine Yamal's dreadful display, with 21 possession losses, was in part down to a lack of fitness, but also down to a superb performance from Álvaro Carreras and smart tactical work to silence him and deny him space.

1. How should Xabi Alonso handle Vinícius Júnior's reaction to being subbed off?

If there was a negative for Real Madrid, it was the fury in Vinícius Júnior's reaction when Xabi Alonso opted to replace him on 72 minutes. The Brazilian threw up his arms and made a beehive for the tunnel, with no features towards the coach or the bench on his way. With his team leading in such a crucial game, it was a bizarre reaction. Alonso has struggled a little in this aspect, failing to manage the egos of a challenging dressing room as Carlo Ancelotti did during his stint in charge. Alonso has rotated everyone, other than Kylian Mbappé, and it requires further work to keep all of his players happy. The ongoing battle to satisfy Vinícius and rotate his attacking options continues to be one of the few uncertainties in the Xabi Alonso reign.

2. How many goals will Kylian Mbappé score this season?

A missed penalty in a Clásico could have been dramatic, but when you are Kylian Mbappé, you make enough of an impact for it not to be decisive. The Frenchman is now on 11 goals in 10 games in La Liga this season, putting him on track for 42 goals in the league alone through the season, which would surpass his return of 31 goals in 34 games last season. The Frenchman is on fire, but there is an element of dependence on his services. It was a superb goal ruled out for a millimetric offside, and he then scored the goal to break the deadlock. In 10 league games to date this season, he has scored in nine. Of those nine, he has scored the opening goal in five games. Mbappé's finishing is the best it has been since he joined the club, and he's showing it on the big occasions, as he proved on Sunday afternoon.

3. Can this be a turning point for Jude Bellingham?

For the first time since January 3rd, Jude Bellingham recorded both an assist and a goal in the same game. The last time it happened was when he scored an injury-time winner at Mestalla at the very start of Valencia, and on Sunday he looked to be back to his dominant best. The England international was involved in 18 duels in total, in a much more combative role than many expected him to play in the middle of the park, but more than proving himself capable of taking on one of Spain's more gifted midfielders in Pedri, who ended the afternoon with a red card. Bellingham has now scored in back-to-back games for the first time since he scored against Leganés and Real Sociedad in late March and early April of this year.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

2025 Mexico City GP: The Red Bull and Haas drivers meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: The Mercedes and Alpine drivers hit the Fanzone stage

Charles Leclerc will start alongside Lando Norris on the front row for the Mexico City Grand Prix.

Charles Leclerc was left disappointed after missing out on pole for the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the Ferrari driver beginning to believe it was possible.

Leclerc fell 0.262s shy of Lando Norris in Qualifying after setting the early pace in Q3 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez on Saturday.

Although Leclerc had been on the pace across the weekend and topped Free Practice 1, he had been unhappy with the balance of his Ferrari, complaining of a lack of grip – a theme that continued into Qualifying.

But a storming effort in Q3 launched the Monegasque onto provisional pole for Sunday's 71-lap race, before a stunning final lap from Norris ended up pipping him to top spot.

“This Qualifying is very, very difficult because there's very little grip, so the car is sliding a lot,” he said after the session. “In order to put everything together, it's very tricky, but I'm pretty happy with the job we've done.”

Leclerc added: “There's a part of me that is still a little bit disappointed, because when I saw in Q3 that I was P1 with a good lap, I was like ‘okay, maybe then I can believe in being on pole'. But in the end, [Norris] did a great job, and a great lap at the end.

“He improved massively from the first to the second run in Q3, and I'm happy with how it went.”

Leclerc is aiming to secure back-to-back podiums for the first time since Monaco and Spain, and vowed to give it his all at the start on Sunday, despite the likelihood that he will be without a tow on the long run to Turn 1.

“There will be a lot of focus on the start,” he explained. “The run to Turn 1 is very long, and we've got to do the best possible start. I wish I was P3 for the start, because at least you get a little bit of slipstream.

“I probably won't have any slipstream in front of me, and I'm starting on the dirty side of the track. But I will focus on what I can control and try to do the best from where we start, which hopefully, will be enough to take the lead into Turn 1.”

F1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne on Sergio Perez's F1 comeback with Cadillac.

Will we all owe Sergio Perez apologies next year when he returns to Formula 1 with Cadillac after that disappointing and apparently career-destroying 2024 season alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull?

It's not easy to think of a greater fall from competitive grace. After all, Checo, having joined the F1 grid in 2011 with Sauber, went on to race for McLaren and Force India/Racing Point, winning his final race for the latter in Sakhir.

And though he owed that to Mercedes' mix-up with George Russell's tyres, we all cheered and thought it ridiculous that, as it appeared initially, a man who had finally taken the win he so deserved might actually be without a drive after Lawrence Stroll revamped Racing Point into Aston Martin and employed Sebastian Vettel as his lead driver.

							By 

	Brenna Ehrlich



	Ann-Marie Delsol squints against the humid Caribbean sun as she points down at the rutted dirt track where the bodies were found in December of 2023. Her employers had been shot and left in their car, which someone set ablaze and pushed into the underbrush. The vehicle could have been shoved down the steep hill instead of this a shoddy attempt at concealment. “When I saw Daniel and Dominique's bodies — Daniel's body was in holes,” Delsol says, her musical voice stoic despite her grief. 


	A former cook for hoteliers Daniel Langlois and Dominique Marchand, Delsol heard news of a charred vehicle not far from her old workplace, eco-resort Coulibri Ridge. Worried about her family, who had land near the incident, she raced across the treacherous, rutted road to see what was amiss. What she saw haunts her to this day. “It is very painful for us because we've lost two great people,” she says. “That's the first time we are ever having a crime like this in Dominica.”

	











	Nearly two years later, there's still evidence at the crime scene that shook this small island country — ash on jutting rocks, melted scraps of plastic and fabric scattered in the verdant shrubbery where wild dogs stalk giant lizards. A modest roadside memorial vase. A crime scene that's no longer just a crime scene — but something in limbo, much like the tragic case of Langlois and Marchand, who have yet to get justice.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Langlois and Marchand were the de facto patron saints of Dominica, a small island country that settlers played tug-of-war over for centuries until it went independent in the ‘70s. The Canadian ex-pat couple found the beauty in what is now dubbed the “Nature Island,” even though signs of colonial turmoil remain: a village called, simply, Massacre (in honor of a 1600s battle between the British and the indigenous people), a courthouse still boasting cells and chains from before slavery was abolished in the 1800s. Churches, libraries, and houses stand splintered and rotting next to posh tourist resorts, the aftermath of 2017's Hurricane Maria. The death of the popular couple, then, became another stain on the island — a grisly, shocking double murder that stood as an anomaly in the close-knit, friendly community.

	Langlois and Marchand were long-time philanthropists, even before they moved across oceans. But when they washed ashore, their charity flowed as freely as the bubbling hotsprings studded on the island's beaches. Langlois — a Canadian VFX visionary responsible for the tech that made movies like Jurassic Park possible — and his partner Marchand collaborated not only on Coulibri Ridge, but also rebuilding jetties, a primary school, and coral reefs after the devastating 2017 storm. 


	“When I heard of his demise I was very much taken aback and sad,” says Ericson Degallaire, principal of the Soufrière Primary School, which Langlois and Marchand meticulously rebuilt with the same materials they used for their eco-resort. Now, children laugh and study in the open-air structure, boasting candy-bright paint. “Since his demise, things have not been the same in terms of that economic activity. Because I'm sure he would have done more had he been around. So his loss has impacted the community a great, great deal,” the principal adds.


	The question soon became: Why would anyone want this couple, who had given so much to their community, dead? Police soon zeroed in on another family of transplants, the Lehrers, who had bought the neighboring chocolate plantation Bois Cotlette in 2011. To hear the islanders tell it, the patriarch, a former Wall Street wunderkind named Jonathan Lehrer, didn't have the best reputation. Degallaire says that the man never waved to him when he drove by the school toward his 1720s estate; islanders claim he filmed them when they got too close to his land; and TripAdvisor reviews paint a picture of a man who shouted at anyone who stepped foot on his property sans invitation or reservation. “The White American manager… informed us in a very rude and unfriendly way to get off his estate straight away,” wrote one reviewer. “Almost felt we were about to manhandled off the premises.” And that was a problem, since what islanders considered a public road passed through Lehrer's property — as did Langlois.

	According to local press, this dispute over a simple spit of land could have culminated in bloodshed. “My own investigations and personal knowledge [show] that there is a strong… case against [Lehrer] including and not limited to direct eye witness evidence, circumstantial evidence, and scientific evidence,” police would later say in court. Still, the veracity of that statement remains in question and a judge and jury have yet to decide.

	











	MORNE ROUGE ROAD first appeared on a map in the late 1770s, tread by slaves, foreigners, and citizens for hundreds of years before and after Dominica became an independent nation in 1978. Lehrer and Langlois began battling over the road in 2014; Lehrer said it was his property and that Langlois' heavy trucks were clipping the sides of his ancient estate. Langlois — and many other residents — maintained that it was a public thoroughfare. 


	Ayeola George, who works in public relations on the island, recalls an alleged run-in with Lehrer right before the murders when she was on her way to meet up with Marchand at Coulibri Ridge to discuss a charity concert. She got turned around on the dirt road, and drove too close to Bois Cotlette. “Here comes Jonathan and he said — he's in jeans, no shirt, no shoes — ‘Hey you're going to see Daniel?' I was like, ‘Yeah.' He's like, ‘Tell Daniel I said he is an asshole,'” she recalls. “So I was reversing, I'm looking in the mirror and Jonathan Lehrer is filming me. He has his phone and he's filming me. I'm a Dominican — we know how to talk, we know how to stand up for ourselves. But at the same time, I knew of his aggressions toward locals. So I just left it alone.” 


	A PR rep for the Lehrer family could not comment on this particular incident, but pointed out that islanders had staged a protest on the road in 2018 after alleging that Lehrer blocked the byway. Lehrer's rep denies that his employer ever blocked the road, and, when asked about the reported filming of locals, told Rolling Stone: “My thought is that this was in direct response to the family getting things stolen and the property vandalized [during the protest]. So if Jonathan was filming locals tearing across his property, it was likely due to ensuring his safety and the safety of his property.”


	The men had previously taken the matter to court after Lehrer built another road as a compromise, and, after Langlois' death in 2023, a judge ruled in the Canadian's favor. It hardly mattered at that point, though, since the police had arrested Jonathan Lehrer and his bus driver Robert Snyder Jr. for murder. The conflict over the road was trumpeted as the motive in the press. 

	











	Lehrer — who has maintained his innocence to Rolling Stone claimed he wasn't bothered by the road ordeal — has been locked away in Dominica State Prison for over two years now. In stasis, much like that crime scene. “To truly understand the inhumane conditions, you must be able to imagine the cell block,” says his 25-year-old daughter, Emma, who grew up largely on the island and has always dreamed of returning there as a doctor. She also claims that islanders' views of her father are wildly incorrect, describing him as a sweet, adventurous man who wasn't afraid to play pretend with his kids at theme parks. “[He lives in] a concrete room, with a hallway in the middle lined with six single-occupancy cells along each wall,” she says of his current predicament. “There are no windows in the block, and no ventilation built in. In fact, the ventilation is so bad that the prison puts a giant fan in the entrance to the cell block in the evening so the inmates don't suffocate.” 


	There's been a series of starts and stops with Lehrer's case, which Emma claims is riddled with corruption. “There is a lot of planted evidence, concealed documents, tampered witness statements, and more generally abuse of process that we hope to successfully showcase along with the perjury of police officers about the evidence they claimed early on before their suspicions were proved false,” she says. “Now we need to expose it.” 


	The news coming out of Dominica is much more opaque, filtering largely through local reports since both the defense and prosecution have yet to respond to Rolling Stone for comment. After previous denials, Lehrer was initially granted bail in November of 2024 due to what the defense claimed was the State's “misrepresentation of the quality of evidence” against him. In short: the defense claims, the prosecution have none and they're stalling. Lehrer remained imprisoned while the bail conditions were determined; those included about a quarter of a million in U.S. dollars and the revoking of his U.S. citizenship. 


	According to Lehrer's family publicist, the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Police then submitted an application to reverse bail — which was denied by the judge. In December of 2024, the ADCP searched the prison where Lehrer is being held and found a set of jail keys in an “undisclosed location,” according to PR. The ADCP then provided the keys as evidence that Lehrer intended to escape, but was dismissed by the judge due to lack of witnesses, per PR. Then, in January of this year, Lehrer was slapped with a weapons trafficking charge, which made bail ultimately impossible. Still, the charges allege that he was transporting an arsenal of guns on December 4th, when, as Emma points out, he was already in custody. Lehrer was again denied bail for these charges in March.

	











	In the midst of all this, the judge who initially granted Lehrer bail recused himself from the case, after he was told by the prosecution that he should remove “himself from the matter since they had information that was not helpful to him,” according to local press. 


	It's a thorny matter all around, to put it lightly, with both sides bristling at how slowly the process is going. “On the side of the court, there's an inscription that says ‘the High Court of Justice,'” says local activist Lofty Durand. “Sometimes what goes on in there, I think that the inscription should change to the high court of injustice,” adding that locals are afraid Lehrer will just be released and disappear in lieu of a trial. “The court should have been moving with a little more alacrity in that regard, so that all parties concerned, even Jonathan's family, if he's innocent [get answers].”


	Both sides, too, point to government corruption by way of explanation, Lehrer's defenders claiming he's being used as a foreign scapegoat for a crime he didn't commit, and islanders whispering that Lehrer is receiving preferential treatment due to his wealth. Lehrer's family is part of the country's controversial Citizenship By Investment program, whereby folks can obtain passports if they funnel money into local projects. Dubbed the Golden Passport program, it has had its share of issues, with the Government Accountability Project (GAP) alleging that the island has sold citizenship to such people as an Afghan spy, a Turkish millionaire-fraudster, and a former Libyan colonel under Muammar Gaddafi.


	Although Lehrer has not been accused of any malfeasance regarding the program, his original lawyer, Lennox Lawrence, was previously attorney general of Dominica. Still, in the past, Lawrence denied that this gave his client any advantage. “We have a system of separation of powers just like you have in the United States and in Canada,” he said. “The executive is totally different from the legislature.” 


	Finally, in August, a judge ruled that Lehrer and Snyder would stand trial for murder, with an indictment pending for September, but the indictment and trial have yet to transpire. When Rolling Stone reached out to the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court about timing, they declined to comment.


	“At nearly every stage of the case, the government has manipulated the course of justice and interfered with the proceedings,” says the Lehrer family publicist. “Jonathan has been denied the right to speak with media or see his doctor. To date, there is no trial date set as the government and prosecution scrambles to find a way forward for this case.”

	











	MEANWHILE, LEHRER's FAMILY also waits — back in Texas, where they worry every day that Jonathan will die from prostate cancer, for which they claim he is receiving paltry care. When his daughter, Emma, visited him recently — after bail was denied — she says she was met with a grim scene. “I was finally, after weeks of begging through letters and phone calls from the lawyers, allowed to see him for 15 minutes through a Plexiglass screen talking to him through a phone,” she says. “As the end of the time approached, the guards began to harass us and told me I had to leave. I remember turning to the guard with tears in my eyes, asking him if I could just give my dad a hug. He laughed at me. ‘Who do you think you are?' he asked me as he escorted me out the door. I didn't even get a proper goodbye.” If Lehrer is found guilty, he could face public hanging.


	The Lehrer family aren't the only ones suffering. There's Delsol, a grandmother, who leads a group of protesters down to each of Lehrers' hearings, yelling up at the windows of the old courthouse so he can hear her pain. “Every time the court case is on the agenda, I am always there,” she says, looking down at a photo of her brand-new grandchild on her phone. “We will be protesting until…” she pauses. “It will never stop.”

	And then there's Langlois' old friend, Simon Walsh, a dive shop owner, who is still shaken by the murders. His blue eyes fill with tears as he recalls how Langlois saved him from bankruptcy after a hurricane, how they teamed up to rebuild the coral reefs after they were beset by a rare disease. They never did get to finish that project, but Walsh carried on, coaxing dying coral back to life in the breezy, beachside Daniel Langlois Coral Rescue Center. And Degallaire, principal of the Soufrière Primary School? He's eagerly anticipating the opening of a secondary school, named for Marchand. 


	Langlois' and Marchand's impact, then, is not just a lonely crime scene — scraps of a car and soot scarred rocks. It's there in the fabric of the island they called home, in the hearts of the people who welcomed them — and that will endure, much like Dominica has all these centuries.
