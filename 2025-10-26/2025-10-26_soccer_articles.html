                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid came out on top in El Clásico for the first time under Xabi Alonso as they overcame Barcelona with a 2-1 victory at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday after on, with Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham on the scoresheet either side of a Fermín López equaliser. Even though the line-up seemed pretty clear, there were so many defensive injuries and doubts that it left question marks over who would play in the Real Madrid defence. With Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Dean Huijsen and Raúl Asencio all overcoming knocks and injuries to make the squad, Huijsen was the only man to start, and the defensive unit looked as strong as ever. Injury to Fede Valverde, forced off with what seemed like a pulled muscle in the second half, could force Xabi Alonso into making a decision on his first-choice right-back sooner rather than later. On this occasion, it was Carvajal who came on to replace the vice-captain, but both him and Alexander-Arnold will compete for the spot against Valencia next weekend. Could Xabi Alonso get his first “high-stakes” win? After the derby defeat against Atlético Madrid, which followed the Club World Cup semi-final loss to Paris Saint-Germain, the question of Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid quickly became whether he was capable of getting a “big win” out of his team. Following in the footsteps of Carlo Ancelotti, a specialist in the big occasions, Alonso has had his work cut out but knew that in becoming only the second Real Madrid coach to win his first Clásico in the last decade, matching Zinedine Zidane, he would go some way to calming those nerves. At no point in this game did Barcelona look like they were on top or the better team. How far would Barcelona be from their best? With no Hansi Flick in the dugout as he served a suspension, it was true that this was not Barcelona at their full strength. Without Robert Lewandowski or Raphinha in attack, while Lamine Yamal was not fully fit, without Gavi or Dani Olmo in midfield, Andreas Christensen in defence, or Joan García or Marc-André Ter Stegen in goal, Barça were lacking far more regulars than Real Madrid, even with their defensive absences. They did, while Wojciech Szczesny produced arguably his best performance in a Barcelona shirt, Real Madrid exploited the gaps in midfield and were able to shut out the Barça offensive block easily. Lamine Yamal's dreadful display, with 21 possession losses, was in part down to a lack of fitness, but also down to a superb performance from Álvaro Carreras and smart tactical work to silence him and deny him space. How should Xabi Alonso handle Vinícius Júnior's reaction to being subbed off? If there was a negative for Real Madrid, it was the fury in Vinícius Júnior's reaction when Xabi Alonso opted to replace him on 72 minutes. Alonso has struggled a little in this aspect, failing to manage the egos of a challenging dressing room as Carlo Ancelotti did during his stint in charge. Alonso has rotated everyone, other than Kylian Mbappé, and it requires further work to keep all of his players happy. How many goals will Kylian Mbappé score this season? A missed penalty in a Clásico could have been dramatic, but when you are Kylian Mbappé, you make enough of an impact for it not to be decisive. It was a superb goal ruled out for a millimetric offside, and he then scored the goal to break the deadlock. Of those nine, he has scored the opening goal in five games. Can this be a turning point for Jude Bellingham? For the first time since January 3rd, Jude Bellingham recorded both an assist and a goal in the same game. The last time it happened was when he scored an injury-time winner at Mestalla at the very start of Valencia, and on Sunday he looked to be back to his dominant best. Bellingham has now scored in back-to-back games for the first time since he scored against Leganés and Real Sociedad in late March and early April of this year.</p>

Jude Bellingham had a hand in both goals, and Kylian Mbappe continued his excellent run of form as Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-1 in the first Clasico of the season. It was hardly a legendary iteration of this famous fixture, but two first-half goals from Los Blancos were enough to see off the short-handed Blaugrana. 

Madrid thought they might have had a penalty early on, but saw it chalked off after Vinicius Jr was adjudged to have kicked Lamine Yamal, rather than the other way round, as the Brazilian burst into the box. Mbappe then had a goal disallowed for a narrow offside, but he wasn't to be denied, and soon after Bellingham played him through and Mbappe lashed into the bottom corner.

Los Blancos then gifted Barca an equaliser as Arda Guler gave the ball away on the edge of his own box to allow an unmarked Fermin Lopez to ghost into the area and finish. But Madrid had more in them, still, and Bellingham made it 2-1 thanks to an easy tap-in after no one tracked the Englishman on a set-piece. 

Xabi Alonso's side had a chance to put the game away in the second half from the spot, yet Wojciech Szczesny responded, saving Mbappe's penalty after a lengthy VAR review handed Madrid a fortuitous spot-kick. It was a rather quiet second half, otherwise as Madrid sat in while Barca, without the injured Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, had few attacking ideas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our under-17 women's national team ended their FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup campaign on a tough note Friday evening, falling 3-1 to host nation Morocco in the final Group A match at Rabat's Olympic Stadium. The game started with high stakes for both sides. Our team, coming off a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Brazil, needed a win to keep their knockout hopes alive as one of the best third-place teams. Morocco, winless in their first two matches, aimed to capitalize on home support to secure the points required for progression. In the fourth minute, a mishandled clearance by goalkeeper Valeria Fernández allowed forward Mayssa Baha to slot home the opener from close range. Our team pushed back in the second half, creating several chances. Just six minutes later, in the 77th minute, Alfaro inadvertently turned a Moroccan free kick into her own net, extending the hosts' lead to 3-0. In the fifth minute of stoppage time, substitute Naima Moya scored a consolation goal with a well-placed shot, making the final score 3-1. Our team controlled slightly more possession at 51 percent and outshot Morocco 10-9 overall, but the hosts were more clinical, registering six shots on target to our teams three. Yellow cards were shown to players on both sides, reflecting the competitive intensity, but no major disciplinary issues disrupted the flow. This result left us at the bottom of Group A with one point from three matches, having scored just three goals while conceding seven. Their tournament journey mirrored previous World Cup appearances, where the team struggled to convert opportunities into wins. Coach Édgar Rodríguez's squad, featuring young talents like captain Priscilla Rodríguez and forward Sharon Umaña, gained valuable experience but will return home reflecting on defensive lapses that proved decisive. For Morocco, the victory marked a milestone. The 2025 edition, expanded to 24 teams and hosted in Morocco from October 17 to November 8, has showcased emerging talent from around the globe. Morocco now awaits their round of 16 opponent, set to face Group B winners North Korea. Our players leave with heads held high after competing against strong opposition, including former champions Brazil and Italy. The experience positions them well for future qualifiers, as the federation continues to build its women's program. Back here in San José, our fans will look ahead to the next cycle, hoping for breakthroughs in youth development.</p>

As Marcus Rashford prepares to face Real Madrid as Barcelona's most productive player this season, fresh from scoring two classy goals against Olympiacos in the Champions League, it is worth remembering that the striker was mocked in some quarters for having the audacity to think he could even play for the Blaugrana after two disappointing seasons, let alone rip it up for them.

Former Manchester United forward Teddy Sheringham said Rashford "didn't deserve to make the step up" to Barca after leaving Old Trafford. European football pundit Gabriele Marcotti told Rashford to "get a grip of where you are right now" and laughed at his entourage's trip to Barcelona last May to try to persuade the Catalans to sign him. 

No-one is laughing now though. Rashford not only got his move, he has convinced the doubters in England and the sceptics in Spain. And his next stop is a first-ever visit to the Santiago Bernabeu to play in the biggest club fixture in the world and take on Barca's eternal rivals Real Madrid.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Cancun is not an official “host city” for any matches, it is strategically positioning itself to be the unofficial capital and primary logistical hub for the entire tournament. This isn't just wishful thinking; it's a calculated plan backed by massive infrastructure and major official announcements. The single biggest factor in Cancun's new role is its air connectivity. According to a recent announcement from Quintana Roo's Tourism Minister, Bernardo Cueto, Cancun International Airport (CUN) is the only airport in Mexico offering direct flights to all 16 official host cities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Travelers can base themselves at a luxurious all-inclusive resort, enjoy the beach and amenities, and then take easy, non-stop flights to watch their team play in Miami, Dallas, or Mexico City, all without the hassle of multiple connections. In a huge vote of confidence, Governor Mara Lezama recently announced that two of the region's most renowned resorts—Fairmont Mayakoba and Moon Palace Cancun—have been officially chosen to accommodate national team delegations, including their coaching staff, families, and media personnel. It speaks volumes about the verified, world-class quality of these properties in three key areas: Now, does this mean you'll be able to get a selfie with a superstar player at the swim-up bar? You can expect a large area of the resort to be privately cordoned off for the team's security. While no official “fan zone” has been announced yet, it is heavily expected. With millions of people traveling through Cancun and using it as a home base, the stage is set for a massive celebration. It is highly anticipated that the Hotel Zone and downtown areas will host enormous, organized fan festivals, where visitors from all over the world can gather to watch the matches on massive screens, turning the entire destination into a non-stop party for a solid month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the U.S. women's national team's most underwhelming performance of her short tenure, head coach Emma Hayes remains optimistic ahead of Sunday's rematch against Portugal. She will use the opportunity to test more players and continue to evaluate her roster's depth with the 2027 Women's World Cup qualifiers still a year away. Hayes hinted before the first Portugal match on Thursday that she intended to promote a player from the U-23 team, which was training alongside the senior squad in Chester, Pa. With Trinity Rodman and Sam Meza both sidelined by injuries, she added Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta earlier in the week, leaving one roster spot still open for that U-23 player. On Friday, Hayes gave the nod to Paris Saint-Germain center back Eva Gaetino. She earned her first cap later that year in an October friendly against Argentina, starting and playing 70 minutes alongside Naomi Girma in the 3-0 win. After those first call-ups, Gaetino returned to her club determined to put the feedback she received from the U.S. coaching staff into practice. “There was definitely a learning curve, so I focused on locking down those details, especially as a center back defending higher up the pitch,” Gaetino said. It's about improving defensively while maintaining our core principles and figuring out how to blend your own individual style into a system that makes us one of the best teams in the world.” Center back is one of the positions that Hayes is currently examining, especially as previous starters Girma and Tierna Davidson remain out due to injury. Girma has had limited time with the U.S. after her January move to Chelsea due to calf injuries, and Davidson remains out this year with an ACL injury. Before joining PSG, Gaetino was a first-team All-American and ACC Defensive Player of the Year for Notre Dame in her junior and senior years of college. She signed for PSG in January 2024, following fellow USWNT and Notre Dame teammate Korbin Shrader (Albert). Last season, Gaetino earned regular minutes and featured in the UEFA Women's Champions League; however, since the firing of former head coach Fabrice Abriel, she has only started three games this season under the new coach Paulo César. During the difficult transition, Gaetino has looked to another USWNT player, Crystal Dunn, for help. She's just an incredible person, an incredible player, and I just have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for her,” Gaetino said. But I've quickly realized it's really just a race, and the only true competition is against yourself.” Hayes told reporters that Gaetino is “the most WNT-ready player in this U-23 group,” but that she won't likely start the young defender against Portugal. “It's unrealistic to have a player that's not been training in this environment, not built connections in this environment, not even trained with the team yet to start a game … even if she's showing qualities in the right direction,” Hayes said. Hayes will likely shuffle her line-up heading into Sunday's rematch at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn., before wrapping up the international window against New Zealand on Oct. 29 at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City. “I want to learn these things now,” Hayes said. “I'd much rather have the situation that happened the other night happen now and learn what we learn, than do that in 12 months time. Gaetino is just one part of a puzzle Hayes is trying to put together as she continues to assess players ahead of the 2027 Women's World Cup qualifiers next year, but she is ready to make her case. She has reported on the global game since 2013, for TRT Sport, USA Today Sports, VICE, Forbes, and most recently was a staff writer at Sportico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1982, Italy matched Brazil's three World Cup wins, and this is how they did it. But Italy had won their opening game of the 1966, 1970, 1974 and 1978 tournaments. Really, the cliche stems from World Cup 1982 in Spain. But then, in the second group phase — consisting of four groups of three, in the first 24-team World Cup — Italy exploded into life despite a very tough draw, defeating holders Argentina and favourites Brazil. When the knockout stage eventually arrived, they got past European opposition, in Poland and West Germany, with relative ease. Italy were hugely unfancied going into the tournament, having only finished second in their qualification group behind Yugoslavia and losing to France and East Germany in friendlies. Bookmakers had them as 18-1 seventh-favourites amid serious questions over a couple of key players. World Soccer magazine considered that they “face the real threat of first round elimination” in its tournament preview. West Germany and Brazil were considered the favourites, while Argentina were not merely defending champions, they'd also unearthed Diego Maradona, who was already being spoken about as the world's best player. There have been major shocks in World Cup finals — 1950 and 1954 in particular — but considering the tournament hasn't produced anything like a Denmark 1992 or a Greece 2004, this is probably the World Cup's biggest underdog triumph, despite Italy's considerable footballing heritage. In other ways, he felt different: Bearzot was more of a father figure than an authoritarian, he gave his players a fair amount of freedom, and he liked attacking football, having been inspired by the Total Football of the previous decade. Bearzot had worked for the Italian federation as under-23 manager and as assistant to both Ferruccio Valcareggi and Fulvio Bernardini, before taking charge in 1977. Italy's performance at World Cup 1978 and Euro 1980 on home soil was decent enough, but their sluggish form going into the tournament meant he was mercilessly mocked in the Italian press. He was criticised so heavily during the initial group phase that he imposed a complete media blackout for the rest of the competition, with him and his players simply refusing to speak to journalists. That approach seemed to be successful, cultivating an ‘us against them' mentality. There is a slight irony in the fact that at a time when football was becoming concerned at the dominance of systems over the star power of individuals, this was actually the period in World Cup history where three straight tournaments were overwhelmingly dominated by one man. And in 1982, it was Paolo Rossi, which had seemed highly unlikely going into the tournament. Rossi was Italy's golden boy and had performed impressively at World Cup 1978, scoring three goals. He was handed a three-year ban, later reduced to two years on appeal. Rossi protested his innocence and claimed he was punished so strictly because of his prominent role in Italian football, to make an example. He went two years without playing any football, although Juventus nevertheless signed him midway through his ban. He returned to play only three Serie A games before the World Cup, when Bearzot placed great faith in him. He didn't score against Argentina, either, and when Marco Tardelli played an inviting cutback to him early in the fifth game, against Brazil, he produced a complete air-kick. But then, out of nowhere, Rossi exploded into life when he firmly nodded home left-back Antonio Cabrini's cross. Brazil equalised through Socrates after a lovely flowing move. Then Rossi pounced on Toninho Cerezo's wayward square pass (hugely reminiscent of Italy's consolation goal against the same opposition in the 1970 final) and fired home. But then, in the second phase of a corner kick, a scuffed shot found its way to Rossi, all alone — aside from team-mate Francesco Graziani. 🇮🇹 Paolo Rossi had his shooting boots on this day in 1982! In fact, he wasn't obviously good at anything aside from that old knack of being in the right place at the right time. Even accounting for his two-year ban, Rossi wasn't particularly prolific at club level either. Also notable was Bruno Conti on the right, in part because Italy so rarely produce outstanding wingers. He scored Italy's first goal of the tournament in the group stage, and while he briefly became notable for an incredible open goal miss against Cameroon, he shone in the latter stages, transforming his reputation from a workmanlike wide midfielder to a genuinely world-class attacker. But in the Italian tradition, Bearzot was a flexible tactician who varied his approach from game to game, attempting to nullify the opponent's strengths. Against Argentina, he used an aggressive man-marking system with the terrifying Claudio Gentile playing a particularly fierce game to shackle Diego Maradona. Gentile committed six fouls in that game, all on Maradona. When he was booked against Brazil, too, he was suspended for the semi-final against Poland, so in came 18-year-old Giuseppe Bergomi, who performed well. Therefore, Bearzot was faced with a dilemma about who to play in the final. But then it turned out Antognoni wouldn't be fit, having limped off with a badly gashed shin against Poland. Bearzot didn't select a replacement for Antognoni, instead playing both Gentile and Bergomi and switching to a system featuring five defenders in front of 40-year-old goalkeeper Dino Zoff, the side's captain. Of course, had Italy failed to beat West Germany, it would have been considered typical Italian over-caution, but Bergomi nullified Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Gentile did a job on Pierre Littbarski, while the classy Gaetano Scirea swept up behind them and brought the ball forward into attack, including in the move for Italy's second goal. Scirea's class on the ball, to a certain extent, made up for Antognoni's absence. Italy ran out convincing winners over West Germany in a final that was less thrilling than the 3-1 scoreline suggests. West Germany seemed tired after their semi-final had gone to penalties — the first shootout in a World Cup — after a 3-3 draw with France. By half-time, though, you sensed it wasn't going to be Italy's day. Already without Antognoni, they then lost Graziani just seven minutes into the game, with his replacement Alessandro Altobelli struggling to get up to speed. They also missed a penalty when the otherwise faultless left-back Cabrini skewed wide after Conti had been brought down. Rossi headed the opener from a Gentile cross that bounced up perfectly for him. 🇮🇹 At Spain 1982, the late Paolo Rossi, who sadly recently passed away, became an @azzurri legend forever as he led Italy past West Germany to secure their first #WorldCup victory since 1938 🏆 Here's Rossi sharing his memories from that monumental day pic.twitter.com/6O0UGB00Jq His goal to put Italy 2-0 up in the final, ending a patient passing move by twisting onto his left foot and thumping the ball home, on the slide, was followed by one of football's most famous celebrations, with Tardelli sprinting to nowhere in particular, screaming ‘gol! “I was born with that scream inside me,” he said later. Considered a runner and a scrapper going into the tournament, similar to how Italy's current manager, Gennaro Gattuso, was spoken about in his playing days, this World Cup showed Tardelli offered technical quality, too, and he was probably the best player in the final. The neutral's favourites were unquestionably Brazil, who played marvellous attack-minded football in a tournament largely lacking quality. But Brazil were fundamentally flawed, only keeping one clean sheet, against minnows New Zealand. Granted, Italy only kept two clean sheets themselves, both against Poland.</p>
