                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Copper wire thefts have increased in Los Angeles and other cities, but with thieves looking outside of street lights for cables to cut, drivers expecting to use EV chargers are sometimes caught off-guard. Given the high voltage charging units use, and not a lot of money from scrap buyers, it's only questionably worth the effort. For those trying to stop this scourge, a focus on the economics involved could potentially produce a solution.With a significant number of the cut cables and smashed charging units being harvested for copper wire now, companies, governments and EV advocates are proposing everything from greater enforcement and penalties to cables that cover a vandal with ink—similar to the measures employed against bank robbers. Such a system has also been discussed in the UK, according to a BBC story from April.Los Angeles-based ChargerHelp, which helps train technicians to diagnose and repair EV charging stations and offers data on station uptime and downtime, and the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, recently spoke about the problem in that city where many neighborhoods continue to experience widespread copper wire thefts, leaving some of them dark. Thefts at public and workplace EV charging stations have also grown and also cost hundreds or thousands of dollars each to repair.“For level two, slower chargers, you're seeing anywhere between $650 to $700 for the connector plus the labor. But then, when you start talking about DC fast chargers, it can go all the way up to $1,500,” ChargerHelp CEO Kameale C. Terry told Los Angeles' KABC on Oct. 22. Some solutions sound simple, such as thicker cables that are harder to cut, or using wireless charging pads for cars. But thicker cables are heavier and more cumbersome to use for some drivers and the only EV with wireless charging capability set for sale in the US is the Porsche Cayenne Electric, which at this point has only been seen in prototype form.Several bills in California have been signed in the last few years to hold various agencies accountable for broken and vandalized public EV charging stations in the state, such as mandating governments to identify and repair broken charging units within 30 days.California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a bill into law that imposes stricter laws and penalties for metal recycling, including identification and personal information from the seller, identification of the vehicle used to transport the material, and proof that the metal being sold was legally obtained. There are also restrictions on what metal scrap buyers can lawfully accept, with an eye toward materials from EV chargers. Matt Petersen, CEO of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, said even charging stations at his offices, have been targeted. More cars now need adapters to work at charging stations outside the Supercharger network. You just know this is going to end up as a Netflix documentary. Two NYPD officers may have been involved in kidnapping an Italian tourist, according to a new report.</p>

The GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition is Nvidia's own-brand flagship GPU for consumers, but one repair technician says it comes with a hidden flaw that makes it “one of the worst designs in the history of… GPUs,” he's seen. The card in question was sent in after it stopped outputting video following the installation of a third-party water block. “I checked all contacts,” Alex explains in the teardown. After inspecting “every single pin”, Alex points to what he calls a damaged connector. “He installed a water block, the card stopped working, and that's because of the damage that we see here,” he says. “I went online to look for this connector, and I was not able to get my hands on this connector,” he says. “You cannot even get your hands on this if it broke for whatever reason… So what's the use of having this made in two pieces if you cannot buy a replacement?” He concludes by warning owners against attempting to open the Founders Edition at all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Razer's $230 Clio headrest speaker did not appreciate the shape of my home gaming chair. The device would sit too far down, and sound literally blasted into my upper back, rather than my ears—which is where you want the sound to go. I've used plenty of odd speaker setups, including neck speakers like Sony's Bravia Theater U that promises to offer personalized audio without the need to sandwich your head between two cans. There's certainly an audience that is looking for high-quality, room-filling audio that doesn't actually fill the room—further incentivizing angry neighbors to knock down your door. The Razer Clio is awkward to attach to your chair, and even when you get it on, it won't provide the sound you expect from these large speakers. Of course, what would be even less distracting is a quality pair of headphones with solid active noise cancellation to avoid any ambient sound bleeding. The Clio nearly makes a case for itself—especially if you're looking for a device to perfect your Razer surround sound setup. It's also brought down by its attempts to keep you from developing tinnitus, protecting your ears from the might of two speakers with large drivers. It likely offers the personalized surround sound experience you want; it won't if you're used to high-end gaming headsets. Those headsets won't reject you just because you tend to slump forward, nor poorly fit your chair just because it doesn't have the right headrest circumferance. Razer cites that any chair with a headrest circumference of  47 to 65 cm (18.5 to 25.5 inches) should be compatible, but how often are people measuring the tops of their chairs? To aid me in my predicament, Razer sent me a loaner of its own expensive and excessively ergonomic Iskur V2 X gaming chair so I could position the device correctly, just behind my ears. It's comfortable and curves to the shape of your spine. The headrest itself is comfortable enough if you decide to lean your head back into it. The two wings are made of stiffer material you won't want to rest your head on. The thing is, I don't know many people who normally lean back far enough that they will keep their head and neck straight. If you're a console gamer, get ready to sit straight-backed, like a soldier on parade, if you want the best quality audio listening with Razer's 2.4GHz “Hyperspeed” dongle. The Clio, like nearly every other Razer product, needs to connect through Razer Synapse PC software for firmware updates and to control the EQ, or equalization options. You only have three settings to chose from: Game, Movie, and Music. You can customize your options based on your preferences, but I found the Game option felt more flat than the Movie preset, no matter if I was watching Netflix, YouTube, or hearing the rattle of gunshots in Battlefield 6. The dongle itself uses USB-C, and sticks out in an “L” shape, which thankfully helps you avoid taking up too much space on your desktop. There's a single USB-C port on the headrest for charging, though you'll also have to use it if Synapse forces you to update the firmware. The Clio speaker looks enormous; big enough you may assume its twin full-range drivers would somehow offer the full soundbar plus subwoofer experience behind your head. But no, it's actually more closely aligned to the many, many headphones you may go out and buy right now—just larger. The Clio makes use of 43mm drivers with an aluminum core. Then, if you tend to lean over at all in your chair, you'll start to miss out on the best audio quality. Sorry, but I don't have an English gentleman's sense of perfect posture. I grew up playing games on my basement couch. I tried to put on a number of games with more overt or subtle audio. As I played through Marvel's Spider-Man 2, there was a part of me that knew I could be feeling the horns on the soundtrack deeper in my chest. The Clio's sound was balanced and clear without any sense of “wow” factor in anything I played. Audio when playing any shooter game needs to be punctuated with the hard staccato of a machine gun, but sitting in my chair I felt like I was peppering my environment by loose gravel. Audio quality felt better-tuned to a game like Ninja Gaiden 4, where the sound of your slicing and dicing has the satisfying quality of being on the right side of a butcher's block. The headrrest speaker also felt better situated for listening to music. My usual slate of indie folk rock felt tuned for this device. Heavier music that you want to feel deep in your spine will offer a slight tingle instead. It's what I would want from a relatively cheap speaker setup but without needing to stick multiple speaker units around your desk. You could use your monitor or laptop's built-in speakers to do the job, though that clearly isn't the best use case. However Razer's Synapse software failed to recognize separate speakers like a BlueAnt Soundblade soundbar. You will have a much better time if you plug in other Razer speaker or soundbars, like the company's Leviathan V2. If your content doesn't support full surround sound, hitting the setting for audio mirroring will provide a better full-sound experience. In this mode, you don't need to worry about your head's position for the best audio experience. If you have any type of desktop speaker setup, the Clio may actually be a great addition if you don't want to bother with placing speakers on the other side of your gaming room. Again, in games, the “spatial” sensibility is less distinctive. I could get a better spatial sense out of Razer's own Kraken V4 Pro headset. If you were hoping these drivers could offer enough bass that it would run from your spine to the tips of your toes, you'd also come away disappointed. Clio promises a battery life of up to 14 hours, which is considerably less than many of the big name wireless headsets out there which promise at least 30 or more hours of listening time. In my days using it, I didn't have to worry about that much considering I can barely get in a few hours of gaming a week, at most. Charging the device isn't all that difficult if you have an extra-long USB-C cable. My mind kept going back to the various headsets I've used all throughout 2025. For the same price, you can grab a pair of headphones that will offer personalized audio with improved bass. An Alienware Pro Wireless headset is notably light on bass compared to similarly priced devices, and I would still prefer it over the Clio to make my spine tingle. A HyperX Cloud III Wireless at $180 also provides meaty sounds without pitching over into annoying highs or lows. For anything better quality, you end up spending closer to $300 or even more. It's the moment when “balanced” audio transforms into something more meaningful. Razer's own BlackShark V3 Pro, built for competiive gamers, will cost you $250. A Razer Kraken V4 Pro will set you back $400 when not on sale, but I can confirm it offers truly immersive audio. The Clio may be that extra piece of kit you needed for your surround sound (if Razer likes your device). Otherwise, most people are better off sticking with what works. The VZR Model One MKII shines in moments but lacks conveniences you can get from other more affordable gaming headsets. Microsoft is finally making gaming on ARM-based PCs work like they should have a year ago. Bose and this major phone maker sure seem to think so. Just don't make me untangle a pair of earbuds ever again. It doesn't matter if the next Xbox is a PC.</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This weekend, self-proclaimed C/C++ expert Zuhaitz reminded us that the adrenaline-pumping rising intensity of Taito's arcade classic was not due to genius-level coding. That's because this mechanic is a hardware accident.The… pic.twitter.com/UkqTEUvC9IOctober 25, 2025 Intel's 8080 processor, launched in 1974, was the successor to the legendary 8008, enhanced with a more powerful and flexible architecture. However, with its ~5,000 transistors, 8/16-bit bus, and ~2.0 MHz clock speed, powering the original Space Invaders with 224 x 256 mono pixels was probably near the limits of its gaming capabilities. The processor-bottlenecked performance slowdown persisted, even though the CPU was aided by a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter in this cabinet design. Also, a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip was used for the iconic audio. Rewrites and reboots could achieve the correct balance of game pacing using code. However, as emulators like MAME became popular, allowing the running of original code ROMs, they would benefit from custom configurations that limit CPU/timing parameters to period- and architecture-correct levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We're exploring the possibility that the carpa uasi may have amplified low-frequency sounds, such as drumming, with minimal reverberation,” Stella Nair, associate professor of Indigenous arts of the Americas at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a university statement. “With this research, for the first time, we'll be able to tell what the Incas valued sonically in this building.” When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, the Inca Empire stretched along South America's western coast, from modern-day Ecuador to modern-day Chile. The building in question had only three walls, potentially enabling sound, like drums, to be directed toward the opening and then beyond. Carpa uasi, meaning “tent house,” references that unique structure, and the Inca may have built it specifically to amplify sound and music Sound was deeply valued and an incredibly important part of Andean and Inca architecture — so much so that the builders allowed some instability in this structure just because of its acoustic potential.” Researchers have long known about the building, but Nair and her colleagues might be the first to recognize its potential for magnifying sound. Now, the team is working on a model to explain how sound would have spread through the carpa uasi and outside it. “Sound studies are really critical, because we tend to emphasize the visual in how we understand the world around us, including our past,” Nair concluded. “But that's not how we experience life—all of our senses are critical. So how we understand ourselves and our history changes if you put sound back into the conversation.” The ancient designs, found on pre-Columbian mummies from Peru, give modern tattoos a run for their money. Robovacs have long been relegated to just floors, but the Ascender might change that. The Dresden Files author's long-awaited second entry in his steampunk series arrives in November, and io9 has a first look.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When I was a kid, my mom used to call my Nintendo the “anti-social idiot box.” The widespread assumption back then was that video games, in any format, were a new and particularly efficient way to waste time and money while also becoming an obsessed shut-in. Whether it's friends you meet through MMORPGs or fighting games, finding stories and characters that deeply resonate with you, or discussing your latest game in a shared space like Bluesky or a message board, video games often have a positive impact on the people who play them. According to the paper's abstract, “While much of the research in digital games has emphasized hedonic experiences, such as flow, enjoyment, and positive affect, recent years have seen increased interest in eudaimonic gaming experiences, typically mixed-affect and associated with personal meaningfulness and growth.” “We highlighted three conclusions drawn from modeling the data,” Devasia told UW News. “The first is that playing games during stressful times was strongly correlated with positive outcomes for physical and mental health. For example, during COVID, people played games they felt strongly improved their mental health, such as Stardew Valley.” Devasia also noted that other respondents had developed new interests, such as sports, due to video games they'd played, or gained insight into themselves or their identities from the journeys undertaken by video game protagonists. “Playing as a character and seeing your choices change the course of events is pretty unique to games, compared with other narrative media like novels or movies,” Devasia said. It sounds obvious at first glance if you're someone who grew up around video games. Anecdotally, that strikes me as an underexplored part of the hobby. If anything, there's a strange critical drive in the space to deliberately treat gaming as disposable pop culture, without any real meaning or lasting value. Even so, modern video games have just as much ability to resonate with their audience as any novel or film, and people who've grown up with them will take lessons away from that. It's something we don't discuss often enough in the field; we'll talk at length about how video games are fun or socially acceptable now or a surprisingly big business, but their influence as culture is less discussed. “People have a tendency to treat technology as a monolith, as if video games are either good or bad, but there's so much more nuance,” Kientz told UW News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These EVs such as the Lucid Gravity, Rivian R1S and R1T and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are all natively built with Tesla's charging connector that allows a seamless connection to its Supercharger network.But we can't escape adapters.The transition to Tesla's NACS, or North American Charging Standard, now means that every plug at public charging stations like those from ChargePoint, Electrify America, EVgo and others outside the Supercharger network now require an adapter. Even home chargers will need an extra piece of plastic to work on new EVs. Like with the “courage” Apple summoned with its transition to Bluetooth connection from wired headphones, the next few years will require endurance—because it's getting messy.Until now, only Tesla EVs (the Model S, 3, X and Y and Cybertruck) needed an adapter to work at every charging station outside the Supercharger network, but now a growing portion of the 4 million EVs in America (as of 2024) are barreling into dongle overload.A Hyundai spokesperson confirmed, “the vehicles come with two adapters,” as will Lucid's new Gravity SUV for AC and DC charging. Rivian's 2026 models will include a J1772 adapter for Level 2 charging for its Dual, Tri and Quad vehicles and its Quad Launch Editions will have a CCS Combo 1 DC fast adapter. General Motors, Cadillac's parent company, put out a summer blog post saying exactly that about the upcoming adapter situation, “That creates a little complication: there will be cars on the road with both standards, as well as chargers of both varieties in public and private settings.” The 2026 Cadillac Optiq will be the first GM EV to transition to NACS. While Tesla's Supercharger network is thriving and growing (7,753 stations housing 73,817 individual connectors, up 16% from last year), home chargers and older network plugs won't be compatible with the newest EVs. An Electrify America spokesperson wrote in an email, “Electrify America remains committed to supporting the future of the [NACS] connector.” She went on to explain that the company is testing NACS charging at stations in Florida and Connecticut “to gain insights into the customer experience and data on the hardware.”ChargePoint has taken more aggressive steps to escape dongle hell. Rob Newton, the network's senior director of marketing, acknowledged in a call that in the past the “experience has been really clunky” when different charging systems are involved. Instead of relying on carmakers or individual EV owners to keep up with the latest dongles, ChargePoint is changing the source. Introduced this summer, the newest ChargePoint stations will have the adapter built into the station itself and drivers can select what type of EV they are charging. “You want to be able to pull up to a station and have confidence it works,” Newton said.New stations will come standard with an Omni Port, but older stations need to retrofit old connectors with a conversion kit from the company. Newton called it “future-proofing,” but it's more about ensuring new EV owners can continue to use (and pay for kilowatt-hours from) non-Tesla charging stations.Nearly every automaker with an electrified model announced in the past few years that it was making the inevitable shift to the Tesla charging system.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Security cameras can be spammy, blowing up your phone with useless notifications. Manufacturers have been battling this issue with AI detection, but Google's Gemini assistant takes things to a whole new level in its latest Nest Cams. The Nest Cam Indoor (Wired, 3rd Gen) and Outdoor (Wired, 2nd Gen) may not look new (apart from the Berry red indoor model), but they finally make the jump to 2K resolution, empowering a new level of AI insight, more accurate detection, and better animated notifications. I've been testing both side by side with the previous generation Nest cameras for the last two weeks, and they clearly represent a leap in quality. But the Google Home app overhaul and hardware improvements were long overdue, and the infusion of Gemini AI is only partially successful, with top-tier features requiring a hefty subscription. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Simply plug them in (the Nest Cam Indoor comes with a 10-foot USB-C cable, the Nest Cam Outdoor has an 18-foot weatherproof cable), scan the QR code sticker on the front of each camera with the Google Home app, connect to Wi-Fi, and you're up and running in no time (both support 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands). The elegant magnetic mount for the Nest Cam Outdoor needs a couple of screws, while my Nest Cam Indoor is perched neatly on a shelf. While Google has lagged behind competitors for years with its 1080p cameras, support for HDR and a high frame rate helped keep the last-gen Nest cams relevant. This resolution bump also enables 6X digital zoom, so the Nest Cams can serve up notifications that zoom in on the subject of each animated alert. These notifications show a few frames of each event, making it far easier to decide whether you need to tap through and watch the full video. You can also zoom in on the live feed and crop the view to stay focused on a specific area, like a garden gate or path. For example, my indoor camera faces a side door, and it can pick up people across the street and zoom in on them as they walk by. The outdoor camera is also far faster to alert and upload accessible video than the old battery-powered model (this is generally true for wired cameras). The cameras get six hours of cloud video history at no extra cost (up from three for the previous generation), but that's your allotment without an expensive subscription. Google's Home Premium subscriptions include everything you got with Nest Aware (30 days of video history, Familiar Faces, and garage door, package, smoke and CO alarm detection) and Nest Aware Plus (60 days of video history or 10 days of 24/7), but Standard also includes Gemini Live on compatible smart speakers and displays, and the option to create automations by typing what you want in the Home app. This last feature works well if you have a bunch of smart home devices set up in Google Home, and you can tell it to do things like “turn on the lights at sunset” or “have the side door camera trigger the outside lights.” It's far easier than using the old script editor. This adds descriptive notifications, so instead of “person detected,” you get messages like “person walks up stairs” or “cat is on the table” instead of “animal detected.” The searchable video history using the Ask Home search bar is genuinely handy; you can ask questions like “who opened the back door last night?” or “Did FedEx deliver a package today?” and jump straight to the event. You also get daily summaries with Home Brief, giving you an often weirdly comical digest of highlights from the day. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. ​Some folks feel AI is overhyped, but it has made tangible improvements to home security cameras in the last few years. When I started testing them, it was common to get alerts from branches blowing in the breeze, passing birds or moths, and sometimes seemingly nothing at all. AI is pretty good at detecting people now, and animal, vehicle, and package detection are standard in most security cameras. Google's cloud-only approach enabled it to take things further faster than most with facial recognition, though it's no longer unique, with competitors like Amazon, Eufy, Lorex, and Wyze all offering similar features. Google has stepped things up again with Gemini, and the hardware bump to a 2K resolution provides the AI more data, enabling more descriptive and accurate alerts. This is a growing trend across the industry; Amazon also just unveiled a new line of 2K and 4K Ring cameras with facial recognition and a new Search Party feature to help you find your lost dog. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It regularly confuses my kids, much to their annoyance, and, while both have long hair, it's not a mistake a person would make. I also get pretty regular alerts that I am at the front door when I'm sitting at my desk, because it struggles to tell me apart from any other bald, bearded bloke. Making these mistakes is understandable, but it's frustrating that, even after he corrected Gemini, telling it he has a dog and not a cat, it continues to make the same error. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. ​Ultimately, there's a beta feel to these new AI features—and they are in early access. Home Premium Advanced is a much easier sell if you're already paying for Nest Aware Plus. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Home Premium Standard plan will be enough for most folks, but it's tough to justify unless you have at least a couple of Nest cameras and a doorbell. At least Standard is bundled in with some Google One subscriptions. The extra monthly fee for Advanced seems like a step too far, and it's only bundled with Google's most expensive AI Ultra plan ($250 per month). Ultimately, these slick and elegant security cameras are easy to recommend. But they are up against many cheaper, comparable video quality indoor security cameras and similarly priced wireless, solar-powered, pan/tilt outdoor cameras that can record locally. If you're cool with plugging in, using Google Home, and the price and subscription, they may still be the better choice for you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Any pair that doesn't just work is dead on arrival. but unfortunately, with the $900 Inmo Air 3, trying is the best I'm going to get, and that, dear reader, is what I'd call a major drag. The Inmo Air 3 AR smart glasses should be avoided at all costs. Both of those ideas caught my attention during IFA 2025, which is why I chose to write about them in September. Those features, coupled with the fact that you can run pretty much any app in 2D by just downloading it from the Google Play Store via the glasses UI felt like they could be a winning combo. Before we get to my list of grievances, I'll start with a small positive, which is that the packaging is impressive, and so is the selection of stuff that comes with the smart glasses. In addition to the smart glasses, there's a touch-sensitive ring with multiple buttons, a garage door-like touch controller if you don't feel like using that, a magnetic cable for charging the ring, and magnetically attachable shades for when you want more contrast. That's a lot of stuff, which is welcome, but that's where the positive impressions stopped for me, because the first thing that jumped out when I put the smart glasses on was… I couldn't see anything. I quickly discovered that it wasn't a problem with the waveguide display inside the smart glasses; it was actually an issue with how they sit on my face. On one hand, that's a physical thing specific to me. And before you ask—no, you cannot adjust the position of a single screen on your face to fix it, and these smart glasses are far from lightweight, so, to avoid mouth-breathing for extended periods, I decided to test them out by holding them in the strange, unnatural position on my face that I could see best in. “They hurt my eyes,” was the exact first impression of Gizmodo Senior Editor of Consumer Tech, Raymond Wong, when he put them on. Needless to say, that's not a great start, but it gets worse. It's a pretty clever method for input that I haven't yet tried, and felt (on the surface) like something that could catch on if executed properly. I say if here because novel hardware is a lot harder to make than it sounds on paper, and there's always a chance that it doesn't work right. The Ring 3, which connects to the Inmo Air 3 smart glasses via Bluetooth, has quite a bit of latency, which makes using it a little aggravating. Luckily, though, I was relieved from having to use the Ring 3 fairly quickly. The latter worked fine, but it feels incredibly cheap and is far from perfect. You'll wind up having to tap things multiple times to register a “click” in the UI, but I suppose it's better than trying to use a broken smart ring if just by virtue of the fact that it technically works. There are some physical buttons on the non-ring touch controller that allow you to go back, go home, control the volume, and pull up the camera, which is nice if you get tired of not having your taps registered. So, to enter Wi-Fi credentials, I had to select my network in the Air 3 and painstakingly punch in passwords one character at a time using the garage door remote. I managed to do that without giving up, luckily, and was able to download some apps in the Google Play Store. The experience was pretty nice, though I definitely wish the smart glasses weren't crushing my nose while I was watching. I could see, on someone whose face fits the smart glasses, that watching things could be enjoyable in the Inmo Air 3, if not altogether groundbreaking. Sure, the Inmo Air 3 are more lightweight than a VR headset, but they're nowhere near as immersive as watching in a Quest 3 and much less premium than an Apple Vision Pro, though that's admittedly a tough comparison. I also downloaded TikTok and scrolled through some videos for good measure, and that experience was also fine, though I can't say it was preferable to just pulling out my phone and zoning out that way. While Meta's Ray-Ban Display tops out at an impressive 5,000 nits of brightness and works well in full natural light, the Inmo Air 3 reaches just 600 nits. Even just using the AR smart glasses in my office on a sunny day was enough to kill contrast, though a magnetic attachment that gives the lenses shade does help. But, to be honest, that's not the only reason I wouldn't wear Inmo's Air 3 outside… If you saw Inmo's Air 3 in renderings like I did and thought, “those look like smart glasses I could wear on the subway,” you may want to think again. The frames are thick, which is bad for someone like me who has a relatively small head, though even if you don't look as dumb as I do when you wear them, you might feel dumb just because of the weight. The big lenses also don't pass for normal glasses, and there's a non-zero chance someone might assume you have a visual impairment if you walk around with them on. After every session (about 20 to 30 minutes), I felt like I should charge the Inmo Air 3 up since a significant chunk of the battery was gone. While Inmo doesn't offer official battery life estimates, there's a 660mAh battery on board, and in my estimate, you can expect between 1.5 to 2 hours max with continuous use. If you're not bringing the smart glasses outside with you, it kind of renders some features useless, like the ability to take pictures. That's mostly okay, though, because I took some snaps with the Inmo Air 3 and they were not very high-res. While it technically has a higher megapixel camera than the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 (the Air 3 has a 16-megapixel sensor, and Meta's smart glasses have a 12-megapixel sensor), the quality somehow looks worse. Inmo's Air 3 seem kind of stuck in a liminal space between display-free smart glasses and thicker AR smart glasses like Snapchat's Spectacles. Clearly, Inmo thinks this is a product you'd want to walk around with on your face, based on its marketing, but in practice, they still feel like a stay-at-home gadget due to the not-so-great battery life, the chunky size, and the general lack of convenience. Maybe your level of comfort with them will vary, but from where I'm sitting, style is not the Inmo Air 3's strong suit. In fact, I don't know that a strong suit exists… There's more that you can do with these smart glasses, but unfortunately, I wasn't really able to test it all because of the hiccups with the hardware. One area that I would have liked to test was cloud gaming, since the idea of being able to play on a big virtual screen (like you can do in a Meta Quest 3) is kind of awesome. I wasn't able to really do that, though, since the Inmo Air 3 don't sit properly on my face, and I basically had to hold them up with one hand while I tested. And as we all know, holding a typical controller historically requires two hands. There's also a multi-window mode where you can have up to three different windows open simultaneously, but that mode requires the use of the Ring 3, which as I've already established, was basically unusable for me. I love the idea of a ring-based wearable (but it has to not crumble in your hands), being able to download any app and use it in 2D is freeing (but only if you can see the apps), and wearing the smart glasses around would be like having a real computer on your face (but you have to actually want to feel comfortable putting them on for that to work). Unfortunately, for people interested in AR, the Inmo Air 3 just feel like more trouble than they're worth. Yes, they're a crowdfunded gadget, and you should expect some wonkiness from that category, but at $900 (that's early bird pricing, the future MSRP is actually $1,100) I don't think lack of polish to this degree is something anyone should put up with. If nothing else, It makes you appreciate the refinement of glasses like the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and even if they don't do quite as much on paper. So, while I wouldn't ever recommend paying for AR smart glasses like this, sometimes just knowing how bad things can get is its own kind of reward, and in the name of that crucial knowledge, I tortured my nose and face so you don't have to. The VZR Model One MKII shines in moments but lacks conveniences you can get from other more affordable gaming headsets. The headset is faster, comfier, and better for gaming, but sorry, you'll still look awkward. That doesn't mean it's the iPad you should reach for first. I've never thought to describe a robot vacuum as fun, yet here we are. Thanks to a huge battery upgrade and much better-than-expected sound, this may be the only SoundLink Micro speaker worth buying. The CMF Headphone Pro are a solid $99 buy—with some significant compromises to be aware of.</p>

Igor's Lab received an email from the PSU maker stating that the right-angled connector has been discontinued and that all regional support teams have been instructed to immediately stop advising customers to pry their power connector apart to fix it. Updated quality control will ensure that its newer 12V-2x6 implementations can work with all 12V-2x6-equipped graphics cards, including models sporting recessed connectors. Cooler Master will also be adding a two-toned color "indicator" to its newer connectors to make it clear whether the connector is fully plugged in. If you are the owner of an existing Cooler Master power supply that came with the aforementioned problematic right-angled 12V-2x6 power connector, Cooler Master will provide you with a replacement cable with a straight end if needed. These updates should put to rest any future troubles Cooler Master customers might have had with its power supplies. Luckily, Cooler Master reports that it has not received any customer damage reports directly tied to modifications to its 12V-2x6 connectors. But it's still dangerous, and something could have very well happened to anyone. Cooler Master's previous right-angled connector was very problematic, and only worked in certain graphics cards that did not have a recessed internal 12V-2x6 power connector.

However, YouTube creator Nick Bild did not want this experience to be lost to history, so he used a Raspberry Pi 3 and a USB Wi-Fi adapter to gather network traffic and convert it into an analog signal that is blasted out of a small speaker. According to Bild's Hackaday project, he had to add random amplitude and frequency adjustments to make the output sound more interesting, but all the data is sourced from the Wi-Fi network. Back before the days of DSL and fiber-optic internet, all our data had to travel over phone lines. Since these weren't designed for digital signals, internet companies had to use modems to convert them into analog signals (i.e., sound) that could be transmitted over the already existing telephone network. Once the connection has been established, the screeching just turns to static, which is what actual data sounds like. The output is then fed into a small amplifier so that the tiny 2-watt speaker can play it. Nick says that since the signal is random, you're bound to hear nothing but static. After all, dial-up internet made that sound so users could listen to whether the connection was working as expected. Advancements in networking technology meant we no longer needed to do that (and it would probably be annoying to hear that sound from all the devices connected to the internet around us).

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Wingtech, the Chinese parent company of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, has warned investors of a potential cash flow squeeze if it fails to regain operational control of its European subsidiary, despite posting a 280% surge in quarterly net profit. The company's woes and supply disruptions have multiple car makers worldwide preparing for shutdowns as the supply of critical semiconductors for automobiles dwindle. The alert came via an earnings filing on Friday, in which Wingtech said that Nexperia “may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit, and cash flow,” related to governance issues. This is based on a machine translation of the company's earnings report. If geopolitical challenges begin to impair the company's ability to execute on orders or invest in expansion, impacts could creep in through extended lead times and upstream pricing pressure. In September, the Hague invoked new foreign investment screening powers to place Nexperia under direct oversight, citing national security concerns. According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the tension has already led to halted salaries for some Nexperia staff in China and internal access issues — signs that the governance dispute could bleed into day-to-day operations if left unresolved. This, unfortunately, raises a familiar but still uncomfortable prospect of uncertainty for PC and parts makers. Nexperia's tech might not attract headlines like Nvidia's high-end GPUs, but it's no less important in a world that scrapes by on just-in-time manufacturing. If Wingtech can't regain control of its European asset, or if state oversight results in slow-walked decision-making, there's a serious risk of a logistical nightmare that could start causing problems downstream very soon.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Brands spent an incredible $247 billion on social media ads in 2024. It has rocketed countless tiny brands to viral fame, and made their fresh-faced founders unimaginably rich. It can also be a wonderful space to find new and exciting products, and the Slack channels at WIRED are continually pinging with links to interesting ideas and cool concepts. Responses range from “Love this!” and “If this exists, we have to test” to “Call this in now!” and “Stand down, it's just AI.” Then, a few months ago, a link to the Sodapop Bluetooth speaker was shared, with the question, “Does this really work?” Sodapop is a one-of-a-kind super compact Bluetooth speaker that can be screwed onto a standard soda bottle if you want to boost the bass. Your empty bottle of Mountain Dew is transformed into a bass chamber that, according to the manufacturer, will boost the speaker's bass output by up to 10 decibels.

It's a neat idea, especially as the very smallest portable bluetooth speakers are notoriously thin in the bottom end. They can't help this; there's simply not the power in the driver, or breathing space in the casing, to produce those rumbling lows. That's not to say there aren't some fantastic small portable speakers out there, but in reality, the very best options tend to be the biggest. On its own, the cylindrical speaker is just 3.8 inches long, 2.3 inches deep, and weighs 10.5 ounces. It's powered by a 1,600-mAh rechargeable battery, which should be good for up to 30 hours of playback. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The speaker also comes with, and is hidden snugly inside, its own plastic bottle. That's right folks, the speaker designed to screw onto any standard soda bottle (specifically the global PCO 1881 standard) comes encased in its very own. It isn't your typical drink receptacle however. It has matching color accents with the speaker for starters, and the base of the bottle features a small open bass port and diaphragm. It's basically a screw on bass chamber—no drinks allowed. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. But why ship it with a plastic bottle? The use of standard soda bottles was prominent in their hugely successful Kickstarter campaign, but maybe I was being naive in thinking that the Sodapop was all about giving waste plastic a second chance. This irked me on several levels, not least in terms of sustainability. Sodapop seems to be leaning into the idea of reuse, but it's also deliberately manufacturing new bottles because they sound better. It's a screw-on bass chamber made from thick plastic, with multiple components. There's even a lid on it, to hold all of the liquid you can't put in it. Maybe I should stop dwelling on the Mountain Dew of it all, and think of Sodapop as a quirky two-piece Bluetooth speaker that looks like a bottle. All this and I've not even turned it on yet. The Sodapop works like most Bluetooth speakers, with simple on/off, pairing, volume, and skip controls. Connectivity caused no issues, and I was quickly playing songs through Spotify over Bluetooth. To attach it to your bottle of choice, just pull the stopper aside and screw. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. To test the contrast however, I first listened to the speaker without its bass bottle. It's very loud for a small speaker, and in my office I couldn't cope with the volume turned up past 30 percent. It's just not an enjoyable listen, sounding shrill and disappointing without any discernible bass. It's not quite as bad as putting your old iPhone in a cup for extra amplification, but it's not far off—and at least you can actually drink from the cup afterwards.

It's not horrible, but compared to the competition it's just not that enjoyable to listen to, which is a shame, because it sure does look cute on my desk. Similarly, the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 ($80) is small, portable, boasts full 360-degree sound and comes with IP67 waterproofing (it floats), which is a huge upgrade to Sodapop's dust- and splash-resistant IPX65 rating. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Played side-by-side with the similarly proportioned and much cheaper $35 Tribit StormBox Micro 2 (IPX7 rating, 10 hours playtime), the physical separation and large chamber between the drivers and bass port does create a wider soundstage. There's not much in it in terms of the amount of bass and overall performance though. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. But what about existing plastic bottles and Sodapop's original promise? It's almost as if the original idea wasn't quite right and they needed to engineer themselves out the situation. It's also precarious and fell over several times in a breeze. A larger 84-fluid-ounce (2.5-liter) bottle had a shallower thread, making attachment harder, and there certainly wasn't five times more bass. After extensive testing, we also concluded that, while the difference is imperceptible to all but the most trained pair of ears, Pepsi Max tasted sounded better than Coke Zero. Sodapop is by no means the only mini-speaker brand trying to defy physics and boost bass. Anyone who remembers those resonating speaker that use any hard surface to boost audio, will hopefully recall just how awful they were. It was a clever idea, and there was plenty of science-backed data proving their brilliance, but in practice they were meh at best. Sodapop does work, and it looks pretty (it's a conversation starter at the very least), but the sound quality isn't transformative to overlook all its other problems. If you're after novelty then be my guest, but there are better sounding, more versatile, and smaller speakers available for less.
