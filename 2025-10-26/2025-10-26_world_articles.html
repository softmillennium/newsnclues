                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This article was updated after officials reported that a second incident occurred the following night on Oct. 25-26. Lithuania has closed its last two operational border crossings with Belarus and the country's largest airport after another incident involving balloons launched from Belarusian territory, officials announced on Oct. 25. Ruginiene said that a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania, prompting the temporary suspension of operations at Vilnius and Kaunas airports. The move comes after a series of airspace violations involving balloons carrying contraband cigarettes. Belarus, ruled by dictator Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, remains one of Moscow's closest allies and has provided Russia with political, economic, and military support during its full-scale war in Ukraine. The closure follows a surge in suspicious aerial incidents across Europe, fueling fears of hybrid operations linked to Russia. In early October, Munich International Airport faced two consecutive disruptions over suspected drone activity. Similar incidents briefly grounded flights in Oslo and Copenhagen, while in September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that violated its airspace. Days later, Romania reported that a Russian drone had crossed its border but chose not to engage. "It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses," Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed. Even as Kyiv seeks U.S. approval for Tomahawks, they say critical, rudimentary gear is the more pressing need. Russia faces an increase in the arson and “spontaneous combustion” of electrical panels, railway relay cabinets, and other infrastructure helping Moscow wage its war against Ukraine over the past week, a source at Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian forces liberated two villages in eastern Donetsk Oblast about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of embattled Pokrovsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Oct. 26. Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Oct. 26, killing at least three people, and injuring at least 32 others, including seven children. At least nine civilians were killed and 44 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional authorities reported on Oct. 26. Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania. "I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing," U.S. President Donald Trump said. "I think it's very important we have dialogue because President Trump already has done a lot to solve lots of the world conflicts,” Kirill Dmitriev told Fox News on Oct. 25.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressman Randy Fine of Florida and Andy Ogles of Tennessee – both staunch proponents of Donald Trump's presidential administration – have been leading the push, which has been condemned by Democratic officials and Muslim civil rights groups as “racist and anti-Muslim”. Fine told the New York Post: “I just think we need to take a hard look at how these folks became citizens, and if there is any fraud or any violation of the rules we need to denaturalize and deport.” He continued: “I know that there's a lot of us that are very, very concerned about the enemy within – people who have come to this country to become citizens, to destroy it.” Meanwhile, since June, Ogles has pushed for a justice department investigation of Mamdani, with calls to deport him over claims that the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to which Mamdani belongs are a communist organization that he didn't disclose in his naturalization process. A dual citizen of the US and Uganda, Mamdani has criticized the rhetoric aimed at him by Fine, Ogles and other Republicans by invoking the federal government shutdown which began on 1 October as well as his decisive victory in June's New York City Democratic mayoral primary. Mamdani also criticized his main mayoral opponent, Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned while facing an impeachment investigation over sexual harassment allegations in 2021. Cuomo, who is the preferred candidate of New York City native Trump, suggested on a radio talk show recently that Mamdani would cheer a terrorist attack like the ones that killed thousands on 11 September 2001. Cuomo tried to distance himself from the interview, claiming, “I can see where if you took it seriously, it was offensive.” Cuomo's campaign has also received criticism for posting, then deleting, a racist AI generated video depicting “criminals for Zohran Mamdani”. And it has come to a point where to speak up about it is seen as if you are making it into an issue, whereas in fact you are naming that which already exists. And so much of this is driven from an unwillingness to recognize that Muslims belong here in the city.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Department of Agriculture says no benefits will be issued in November and it would not draw on emergency reserves The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Saturday that food benefits under one of the country's biggest social assistance programs will not be issued in November amid the ongoing federal government shutdown. The shutdown was in its 25th day at the time of the announcement, which came after more than 200 Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Friday called on USDA to draw on its emergency reserves to fund November food benefits. Republicans and Democrats in Congress remain at an impasse over how to fund and reopen the federal government. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued” 1 November. In some states, like New Mexico, dependence on the program is as high as 21% of residents, it said. According to a memo seen by Reuters, the department indicated that it would not draw on emergency reserves to fund food benefits in November. “It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,” the statement from Sharon Parrott said, as reported by The Hill. “Instead, it may choose not to use them in an effort to gain political advantage” as Republicans seek to exert pressure on Senate Democrats to vote in favor of a spending bill that would reopen the federal government. Governors in Louisiana and Virginia declared states of emergencies this week to make funds available to help with hunger relief in anticipation of Snap benefits not being issued in November.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Detention of Chicago man violates his due process and he must be given a bond hearing by 31 October, judge says While US district judge Jeremy Daniel said in an order Friday that Torres's detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is illegal and violates his due process rights, he also said he could not order his immediate release. Torres's attorney took the ruling as a win – for now. We will now turn the fight to immigration court so we can secure Ruben's release on bond while he applies for permanent residence status,” his attorney, Kalman Resnick, said in a statement Friday night. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a four-year-old son. The children are both US citizens, according to court records. “My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” Ofelia said in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for her family. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleges that Torres has been living illegally in the US for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding. At a hearing on Thursday, which Ofelia attended in a wheelchair, the family's attorneys told the judge that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father's arrest so that she could see family and friends. But since his arrest, she had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption”, they said. Several elected officials held a news conference on Wednesday to protest Torres's arrest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney leaving the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Sunday. Mr. Carney is meeting with Asian leaders at the summit as he aims boost Canada's trade relationships.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press Mr. Trump said this weekend he's hiking tariffs on Canadian imports after an Ontario government TV ad critical of his protectionist levies ran during the first game of the World Series. Mr. Carney, who is in Malaysia meeting with member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said his government plans massive investments in Canada's economy and intends to shift as much trade as possible away from the United States, which has become a more unpredictable and unreliable partner since Mr. Trump took office in January. Opinion: Is Ford's ad to blame for Trump's 10-per-cent tariff hike? Mr. Trump, who has imposed a slew of tariffs on Canadian goods since March, had already ratcheted up tensions this past Thursday by breaking off negotiations aimed at resolving the trade war in response to the TV ad. The 60-second TV spot uses footage from nearly 40 years ago of former U.S. president Ronald Reagan decrying American protectionism, saying such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer. Mr. Trump, who has said the Ontario ad misrepresents Mr. Reagan's comments, said he was raising tariffs by 10 per cent because Canada did not immediately stop running the ad as he wanted. “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” the U.S. President said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew to Malaysia on Air Force One. It's not clear if this new levy would apply to all Canadian imports or a selection of them. From left: Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the opening of the 47th ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur.Vincent Thian/The Associated Press It underscores the importance of reliable partners who honour their commitments, who are there in tough times and when things are not working, work collaboratively to fix them.” He told reporters he'd agreed with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of ASEAN, as well as next year's chair, Philippines President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., that Canada would conclude a free-trade deal with ASEAN member countries by next year. Separately, Mr. Carney said he'd agreed with the Philippines to accelerate negotiations on a free-trade deal that would also conclude next year. After Mr. Trump said he would terminate trade talks, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose government paid for the ad campaign, said he would pull the ad after this weekend. It is edited, with certain passages presented out of order. In Mr. Reagan's original speech, the late president defended imposing duties on Japan during a trade dispute over semiconductors. He alleged Japan was failing to enforce Japanese companies' violations of a trade agreement with the United States. However, Mr. Reagan also argued that his duties on Japan were justified “to stop unfair practices against American products,” while extolling the virtues of free trade overall. Canadian producers are facing levies totalling more than 45 per cent after the administration recently announced a new 10-per-cent tariff on lumber shipments into the U.S. on top of existing duties. This is at least the second time Mr. Trump has paused trade talks with Canada. In June, after Ottawa proceeded to enact a digital sales tax that would hit U.S. tech giants, the U.S. President broke off negotiations. Analysis: Trump's bizarre outrage over Ontario's anti-tariff ad is a symbol of his presidency “Lost in the accountability loop here is the President's threat is really to charge American taxpayers billions of dollars because of a benign World Series ad he doesn't like.” Former Alberta premier Jason Kenney, who also served in Stephen Harper's federal government, called Mr. Trump's reaction to the TV ad embarrassing. “The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. “The Government of Canada stands ready to build on the progress that we had been making in our negotiations, our discussions with our American counterparts, and we have a consistent focus in those discussions on doing the best deal for Canadian workers and their families,” he said. I don't see that behaviour in the United States,” Mr. Hyder said. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces liberated two villages in eastern Donetsk Oblast about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of embattled Pokrovsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Oct. 26. The General Staff's report comes nearly three months after Russian forces made a sudden 10-kilometer (6-mile) push in just days toward the key highway connecting Kramatorsk and Dobropillia in early August. Across the front, Russian forces continue to launch offensives on multiple sectors despite the Ukrainian claims that its troops have effectively stalled Moscow's momentum. The General Staff acknowledged on Oct. 26 that Russia has accumulated about 200 servicemen in Pokrovsk, infiltrating small infantry groups, reporting shooting and drone battles in the city. Asami Terajima is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent covering Ukrainian military issues, front-line developments, and politics. She previously worked as a business reporter for the Kyiv Post focusing on international trade, infrastructure, investment, and energy. Originally from Japan, Terajima moved to Ukraine during childhood and completed her bachelor's degree in Business Administration in the U.S. She is the winner of the Thomson Reuters Foundation's Kurt Schork Award in International Journalism 2023 (Local Reporter category) and the George Weidenfeld Prize, awarded as part of Germany's Axel Springer Prize 2023. "It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses," Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed. While Ukraine also lacks Western-supplied weapons, soldiers and commanders say shortages of basics — cars, drones and people — make holding back Russia extremely difficult.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The special will also be available to stream via CNN's All Access subscription offering at launch on Tuesday, October 28. Thieves last week targeted the Louvre's Apollo Gallery in a brazen daylight raid, fleeing with jewelry worth tens of millions in a matter of minutes. Scores of investigators have been involved in chasing down those suspected of the heist, which Louvre director Laurence des Cars called a “terrible failure.” French media first broke news of the arrests, with CNN-affiliate BFMTV reporting that two suspects in their thirties and known to police were detained on Saturday evening local time. At least two other individuals suspected of being involved in the heist remain at large, according to BFMTV. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said “one of the men arrested was preparing to leave the territory from Roissy airport,” also known as Charles de Gaulle airport, a facility near Paris. France's Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez congratulated the investigators for the arrests, who he said “have worked tirelessly, as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.” In the course of a seven-minute heist, they broke into two high-security display cases and stole nine items, according to France's culture ministry. The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million), Beccuau previously told French radio station RTL. Around 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt to track down those responsible for the heist, she said. Following the daylight robbery, French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the heist exposed security failings at France's most famous museum. “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn't been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio.

MOSCOW, October 26. /TASS/. Russia's Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile has no analogues in the world, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday.

On October 26, Putin visited one of the Russian command posts of the joint group of forces and held a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov and commanders of the battlegroups involved in the special military operation.

"I have a report from the industrial bodies, and in general I am familiar with the estimates of provided by Defense Ministry. It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses," he said.

"I remember quite well when we announced that we were in the development stage of such weapons and even high-level experts told me that it worthy objective indeed, but in the historical short term was unrealizable. I reiterate that this opinion was voiced by high-class experts," Putin added.</p>

We apologize for any inconvenience caused. An event attempting the Guinness World Record for the longest nagashi somen, where somen noodles flow down a split bamboo trough, distance was held in Niyodogawa Town, Kochi Prefecture, on Saturday. The goal of 4,133.59 meters was met, setting a new world record. Local businesses also took park, splitting about 1,000 bamboo poles to make troughs. The long trough was set over a town road with an elevation difference of about 350 meters to let water flow smoothly. With tears in his eyes, Takemura stated, “We have proven we can achieve the world's best even in a town facing population decline and a lack of young people.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia has successfully tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile and will work towards deploying the weapon, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday, which comes as Moscow launched its second deadly attack on Ukraine in two nights. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, claimed the Burevestnik missile remained airborne for about 15 hours and covered a distance of around 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles). Meanwhile, Putin said, “We need to determine the possible ways of using it and start preparing the infrastructure for deploying this weapon,” adding that it's a product “no one else in the world has.” Last week, Russia also held a “planned” strategic nuclear forces drill under Putin's supervision. It comes as Russia launched more than 100 drones on Ukraine overnight into Sunday, striking high-rise buildings in Kyiv as residents slept. A 19-year-old girl and her mother, 46, were among three people killed in air strikes on the Ukrainian capital, according to Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. “The youngest is four years old,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. Of those injured, eight were hospitalized, Klitschko said. The latest wave of violence came as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky Zelensky issued a fresh appeal for more Patriot missile defense systems, part of a broader efforts to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia's sustained aerial assault. On Saturday night, a fire erupted at a nine-story residential building in the capital's Desnianskyi region, where 13 people were rescued from the upper floors. Additionally, a Russian drone struck a 16-story high-rise, shattering windows from the first to the ninth floor, emergency crew said. Natalia Zura, 49, escaped from the burning house with her daughter Maria using a fire ladder. Olha Motianina, 34, had left Kyiv for a nearby village with her family because of the constant bombardment. People have died, and I don't know how to describe it. It's very sad and affects my mental state,” she said. Another drone struck a high-rise building in the Obolonskyi district of Kyiv, but firefighters said the site was not set ablaze. “Every Russian strike is an attempt to inflict as much damage as possible on ordinary life,” Zelensky said on Sunday. “This week, they've been striking residential buildings, our people, our children… these are the main targets for the Russians,” he added, noting that the Kremlin has unleashed nearly 1,200 drones, more than 1,360 guided aerial bombs and over 50 missiles on his nation in the past week. More than a hundred rescuers and police officers in Kyiv responded overnight into Sunday, checking the stability of the burned out high-rises as well as clearing debris and dismantling damaged structures, the interior minister said. Klitschko did not confirm whether the buildings were directly hit or struck by falling debris from destroyed weapons. Meanwhile, Russian air defense systems destroyed two drones heading for Moscow, according to the city's mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Sunday. Six civilians were injured in Russia's Belgorod region due to Ukrainian strikes, according to local authorities there, including three in the city of Belgorod and three in the village of Dorogoshch. Ukraine needs a constant pipeline of weapons from its allies to defend against Russian barrages of missiles and drones – often several hundred in one night. Repeated deadly attacks have underlined the shortfall in Ukraine's air defenses. Another overnight attack Saturday killed at least four people in Ukraine, prompting Zelensky to ask for more Patriot missile systems “so that we can protect our cities from this horror.” Trump has been pushing for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia but those attempts have made little progress so far. After Trump had a phone call with Putin last week, he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced he was heading soon to Budapest for an in-person summit. On Saturday, Trump struck a similarly pessimistic tone, saying he has no immediate plans to schedule a meeting with Putin and insisting that any summit will have to wait until a potential peace deal seems achievable. “I'm not going to be wasting my time. I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing,” he added. CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo and Kosta Gak contributed reporting.</p>

MIAMI, October 26. /TASS/. Russian Special Presidential Envoy for economic cooperation with foreign countries and CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev had several meetings with representatives of the administration of US President Donald Trump over the past two days, an informed source from the Russian side told TASS.

"The meetings with representatives of President Trump administration took place yesterday, today, and will continue tomorrow," the source said, without giving details of the meetings.

Dmitriev would meet US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and other politicians as part of his visit to the United States, a source told TASS earlier.</p>
