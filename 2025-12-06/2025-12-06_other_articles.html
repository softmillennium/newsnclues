                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of researchers say it's time for academia to get serious about studying UFOs. The movement, championed by the Society for UAP Studies, is wrapping up an international conference aimed at establishing a new discipline dedicated to studying unidentified anomalous phenomena (or UAPs, the more formal term for UFOs). The Society for UAP Studies knows it's a tall order that requires an open mind and an unusual amount of collaboration. Studying UAPs should be scientific, but can't be done in a lab — so researchers would have to collaborate in a study of the physical and theoretical. He's the nonprofit's executive director and co-founder along with Michael Silberstein, a philosophy professor at Elizabethtown College. Cifone is currently a research fellow at the Center for Alternative Rationalities in Global Perspectives at Friedrich-Alexander University in Germany. The Society for UAP Studies' board of advisors, advisory council and leaders include dozens of academics from all over the world, representing a variety of disciplines including philosophy, law, the sciences and humanities. "We're not necessarily taking a position" on whether UAPs are evidence of extraterrestrial life, or what their existence could mean for humanity's understanding of its place in the universe, he said. "But we are interested in taking on these topics that don't fit neatly anywhere. As academics, our skill is in establishing a framework so we're not simply speculating, but situating it within historical, cultural and scientific frameworks." But when the world shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic, he found himself watching a YouTube video featuring Kevin Knuth, a professor and former NASA research scientist and physicist who's studied quantum information, robotics, planets and UAPs. Intrigued and realizing that their academic circles often overlapped, Cifone set out to learn more about Knuth's work, reading his writings in scientific and academic journals. At some point, he realized that "while (the study of UAPs) was a topic of ridicule, there was still something strange and odd for which there seemed to be some good anecdotal evidence and witness evidence, evidence that was not easily dismissible by conventional analysis." In 2004, U.S. Navy pilots and radar operators aboard the U.S.S. Princeton reported seeing "anomalous aerial vehicles,” or AAVs high above where commercial and military craft can fly, performing maneuvers that seemed impossible to their trained eyes. In 2024, Congress conducted hearings on the issue, and the Pentagon, while saying it found no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial beings, also said there were "definitely anomalies." The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office determined the data instead show a "continued geographic collection bias based on locations near U.S. military assets and sensors operating globally." During the Society for UAP Studies' conference (its second), keynote speaker Steve Fuller, an author and professor at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, said that he is "completely agnostic about whether (extraterrestrial) creatures are already here or if these blips on the screen" are evidence of intelligent life. Fuller discussed the nature of humanity, and how we might fit into a galactic or universal collective. They're not trying to convince anyone, including themselves. "We like to emphasize positional neutrality," he said, "the methodology and standards of evidence" that would be a part of any other academic pursuit. He acknowledged the challenges — starting an entirely new higher education discipline requires not just the professionals willing to do it, but also resources and institutional backing. The society is funded now through private and philanthropic donations and receives no government backing (he declined to name any funders, explaining he didn't ask permission to name them publicly).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether it's wildly speculating about Charlie Kirk's murder or forcing Brigitte Macron to prove that she is a woman, the far-right podcaster and conspiracy theorist has millions of listeners hooked on her unique brand of dangerous misinformation. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. They're also extremely compelling, for her millions of social media followers and podcast listeners at least, and extremely lucrative, helping the 36-year-old American build a staggering media empire in under a decade. All these disparate subjects have received Owens' signature treatment. She is part one-woman outrage machine, part millennial version of a medieval mystic; she has certainly worked out how to cleverly monetise the human impulse to “uncover” so-called “truths” and to feel like we are somehow in possession of a secret knowledge that explains how the world works. In the summer, French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte filed a defamation lawsuit against Owens, who has regularly and fervently spouted bizarre claims that the first lady was born male; the couple have accused her of mounting “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. And in recent weeks, Owens has dragged herself and her followers even further down the rabbit hole by stirring up conspiracies around the death of her one-time boss, Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist and founder of conservative student group Turning Point, who was shot dead in September. The suggestion that his death was somehow an “inside job” involving Turning Point employees. On Wednesday (3 December), Kirk's longtime producer Blake Neff finally called Owens out for spending months “attacking Charlie's closest friends”, who, he said, “have had to endure harassment from people who have gotten whipped up by what Candace is saying”. Owens is now playing an even higher stakes game, running the risk of finally alienating one-time allies on her end of the political spectrum, while also surely aware that her most devoted core of fans will expect wilder theories to come. Her early days didn't exactly lay obvious foundations for a hard-right pivot. Her family sued the Stamford Board of Education, eventually gaining a $37,500 settlement. Around this time, she developed “an abiding interest in current affairs”, as a Tatler profile would later put it, with her political sympathies initially skewing towards the Democrats. After dropping out of a journalism degree at the University of Rhode Island, Owens interned in the fashion cupboard at America Vogue (“There was not some kind of formal hierarchy, but it was very clear that she was running the show,” a fellow intern recalled in Vanity Fair). She then worked her way up the ranks in administration in a New York private equity firm, before co-founding a marketing agency. Inevitably, it stoked criticism: wouldn't this just amount to doxxing, the typically malicious act of posting another person's private details on the internet? Owens ended up on the receiving end of online hate herself, and blamed left-wing activists. Not long after, she started posting on YouTube: her first video was a sketch in which she “came out” to her parents as a conservative. Owens positioned herself as a supporter of Trump, who was then in the early stages of his first presidency, and decried ideas around identity politics, structural racism and the Black Lives Matter movement. She particularly vehemently opposed any suggestion that African-Americans should perceive themselves as victims – and still does. “Within 30 seconds of seeing her on stage, I said to myself, “Oh my goodness, I have not seen a talent like this in my six years of politics,” Kirk later told The Washington Post. He immediately hired her to work in communications for Turning Point, and they spent the next few years touring colleges, spreading the conservative gospel. Kanye West publicly supported her, writing “I love the way Candace Owens thinks” on Twitter. At an event in London in December 2018, Owens ended up appearing to suggest that if Hitler had simply stuck to Germany, his policies would have been “fine”. “Whenever we say ‘nationalism', the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler,” she said. “He was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine.” The “problem”, she added, was that he “had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalise.” Owens would later claim that her words had been taken out of context by “leftist journalists”, and stated that there is “no excuse or defence ever” for “everything that [Hitler] did”. 2021 saw the launch of Candace, an online show for the conservative platform Daily Wire, co-founded by another right-wing controversy magnet, Ben Shapiro; it featured sit-down interviews with the likes of Trump, but she also used her platform to weigh in on pop culture and lifestyle topics (such as her vehement belief that women should not wear leggings outside of the gym, because doing so is indicative of “the decline of our culture”). But in 2024, Owens parted ways with Daily Wire, reportedly over her anti-Semitic comments (although she would later claim this was a “smear campaign” and a “ridiculous storyline”). Owens' great talent, though, is for turning controversy into content, and it wasn't long before she returned with her own venture, a self-titled podcast. Since launching in June of last year, its ascent has been dizzying: in October 2025, it ranked as the number one show across platforms in terms of downloads and views per episode, with an average of around 3.5 million downloads per show, according to analytics from Podscribe. Just a quick glance at the US charts demonstrates the dominance of controversial conservative-skewing figures such as Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson and Theo Von. According to a Media Matters report from 2024, right-leaning online shows had nearly five times as many followers and subscribers as their left-wing equivalents. It's a model that Owens has honed to perfection. Her husband George Farmer, the British son of a multi-millionaire Tory peer and hedge fund manager, oversees the business side of the operation, and told Bloomberg that her advertisers “have reported seeing returns of two-to-one on dollars spent with us, and up to five-to-one reported in some cases”. Her huge listener base mean that the podcast can inevitably charge higher advertising rates; recent analysis from Fortune magazine suggested that her company generates up to $10m in revenues per year. And according to Farmer, only one advertiser has pulled out over the past year; the show now has almost 60 sponsors, Bloomberg reports. In 2023, her anti-trans YouTube videos were demonetised, and last year, she was temporarily suspended after violating hate speech policies, but she has since returned with a vengeance. And even if these bigger sites did ban her, she would probably follow in the footsteps of other “cancelled” right-wing figures and simply move to a new platform. What's particularly shrewd, though, is the way Owens has a knack for throwing herself into topics that are guaranteed to creep onto your social feed. Take actor Blake Lively's legal battle against her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. Earlier this year, Owens covered the story in obsessive detail, responding to suggestions and “clues” from followers with all the zeal of a TikTok sleuth. Elsewhere, she borrows the aesthetic of your classic lifestyle influencer. Her website, Club Candace, doesn't exactly look like the online home of a conservative firebrand; instead of Maga red and shouty graphics, it's all swirly, cursive fonts and glowing photos of Owens. And yet with the Macron lawsuit looming, Owens may have met her match. For all the successes of her podcast, she is now facing a major legal battle. She has been asking fans to donate to her legal fund, and estimates she will need around $5m, but that feels like a conservative estimate. The case of fellow right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones feels particularly pertinent here: Jones was ordered to pay around $1.4bn in total damages after the families of Sandy Hook elementary school shooting victims won two separate defamation suits against him. In 2021, Owens was hit with a separate defamation suit by the former Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik. She claimed that Owens had smeared her with false allegations of drug use, fraud and working as a “madame” in a strip club, but the case was tossed out by a judge; Klacik ended up being required to pay her $115,000 to cover legal fees. Using Kirk's death as another trending topic to boost her profile looks like an ill-advised move, too. Owens is far from the only podcaster to indulge in bizarre conspiracy theories, but her personal link to Kirk, coupled with her willingness to exploit that for clicks and listens, makes the whole spectacle feel extremely murky. In aiming for Turning Point, too, she risks splitting her support base. Here, she is not going after the “establishment” or the “elite”, those bogey people of conspiratorial thinking, but her own political allies. But Candace is unlikely to let this knock her off course. For her, a backlash is likely to be seen as just another opportunity. In today's topsy-turvy cultural climate, being the ragebait queen has served her well. It remains to be seen, however, if they make her undefeatable. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flying saucers, strange lights in the sky and objects that look like alien spaceships… every year Brits report hundreds of sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and have been doing so for more than eight decades. They suggest the British government's own files tell a very different story - one that finally came to light in 2008 - when the Ministry of Defence finally released its UFO files. In fact the British Ministry of Defence has files on military personnel encountering UFOs going back over 80 years, according to a new programme on UFOs coming to Sky History. One of the most famous sightings occurred at a Royal Air Force base where American soldiers were stationed, Rendlesham Forest, on December 26, 1980. Shortly after midnight, military personnel at RAF Woodbridge, 80 miles northeast of London, detected a strange object on their radar. Andrew Collins, a science and history writer says: “Airmen were sent out in a vehicle to investigate, and came across this clearing in which was this otherworldly object surrounded with light. It rose up slightly, then moved backwards and disappeared. The whole episode was written up and recorded by the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Halt which was very unusual.” It's one of the most discussed UFO events on record, but just one of many that have been reported near British military bases. On August 13th, 1956, British Royal Air Force officers stationed at RAF Bentwaters claimed they saw fifteen unidentified flying objects on their radar screen racing along the coastline. Nick Pope, a former British Ministry of Defence (MoD) employee who investigated UFOs for the government from 1991 to 1994 and is now a leading commentator on the subject says: “Military jets were scrambled to try and intercept these things. “That was way faster than anything anyone had at the time. At one point, these things are going in formation, and then they appear to converge and form a single object.” If the British military has witnessed so many unexplainable events, why has the government always professed to have no interest in UFOs Ufologists say the answer can be found by examining the earliest British military encounters on record which were reported during World War II. UFO investigator and podcaster Dan Zetterstrom says: “Files released show that Prime Minister Churchill was being briefed on these encounters during World War II. He was worried that any release of information would lead to mass hysteria, public panic. “So, he covered up every UFO sighting that happened. While many ufologists suspect the British government is still keeping their most explosive UFO files close to their chest, civilian research groups have investigated thousands of unexplained incidents. On Christmas Eve, 1964, local resident Mildred Head was startled awake by an unnerving noise coming from above her bedroom. Lynn Picknett explains: “It sounded like thousands upon thousands of tiles being ripped off and then thrown back on, which was utterly terrifying and also there was a vibration going through the house.” Nick adds: “The very next day, Marjorie Bay was going to church when she was assaulted by a series of strange vibrations that she felt reverberating through her body, and shortly afterwards, dozens of other witnesses in and around Warminster reported the same thing. After residents reported hearing humming or droning noises and seeing strange lights in the sky, more than 300 assembled at their local town hall demanding answers. National papers took an interest and people started flocking to Warminster for nightly sky watches where others also witnessed these mysterious lights in the sky. From that point onwards Warminster became the place to go and see flying saucers. One area of Great Britain that has experienced UFO sightings on a near daily basis from ancient times right up until the present day, is Yorkshire. During one night in 2020, what they captured was particularly intriguing. “We saw an object rise out of the water. We estimated the speed to cover six miles in 90 seconds was about 240 miles per hour before it seems to turn in and drop into the sea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's entirely possible, according to a new documentary from director Dan Farah — who produced films such as “Ready Player One” and “Call Jane” — on the possibility of alien life that focuses on recent disclosures of U.S. government programs that have studied, tracked and even potentially recovered extraterrestrial craft and beings. The film also features commentary on UAP hearings from several high-ranking current and former members of the U.S. government, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; and former CIA Director John Brennan. Though many of Elizondo's claims are disputed by UFO skeptics, scientists and government authorities, the new documentary includes a pair of accounts of potential UAP sightings here on the Central Coast — specifically surrounding Vandenberg Air Force Base, now referred to as Vandenberg Space Force Base. In the documentary, retired Air Force Lieutenant Bob Jacobs said he saw a UAP while he was working at Vandenberg Air Force Base, though the exact date was not included in the documentary. Around 60 cameras were pointed at the ignition point of an Atlas D missile carrying a dummy warhead that was launched from Vandenberg, recording the ignition and launch process, Jacobs said. Jacobs isn't alone in his claims of UAP sightings around Vandenberg. In another instance, two individuals — retired Air Force Security Forces members Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Chaz King — shared similar accounts of a pair of 2003 UAP sighting while working at Vandenberg. “On Oct. 14, 2003, I showed up to work at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and immediately everybody just started to tell me about this UFO incident that had happened earlier that morning,” Nuccetelli said in the documentary. “It was a very serious security breach of the area.” “Later that night, myself and five security forces members, we observed a bright light approaching the base,” King said in the documentary. “As it got closer, the light was no longer visible, and it was massive, the size of a football field, almost rectangular in shape.” Nuccetelli said he spoke with a dozen other individuals at different vantage points, all of whom repeated King's story. Because no photographic or video evidence of these claims are publicly available, at the end of the day, verifying their accuracy comes down to just one question: Do you believe?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starz pulled the rug out from under Spartacus fans when they announced House of Ashur, a show that takes place in an alternate what-if timeline where Nick E. Tarabay's Ashur survives the events of the original show and kills Spartacus. The show's first episode even gets supernatural to set this premise up, taking the original Ashur, who had just died, straight from the Underworld itself and plucking him in another timeline that gives him a second chance. The Direct sat down with Spartacus: House of Ashur showrunner Steven S. DeKnight, who also worked on Netflix's Daredevil, where he spoke about the chances of seeing more supernatural elements on the show, and revealed whether or not the titular Spartacus is actually dead in this new timeline. When asked if Spartacus: House of Ashur's intro might open up the doors for some more supernatural elements, DeKnight confirmed that "you're not going to see that again in the body of the show." However, the first episode of House of Ashur offers hope that Liam McIntyre's hero might not actually be dead. Sadly, despite that, DeKnight confirmed to THe Direct without a shadow of a doubt that "he's dead." House of Ashur is now streaming on Starz. Steven S. DeKnight: No, that's the one thing. Because there was some talk, some questions from Starz and Lionsgate, as we were working on on the script, is, are we going to see other supernatural things happen? I want it to be the same show as the original show, where you don't see any of that, except for the opening, where you know, this is what would have happened if the Fates had woven a different path for Ashur. My God, we rewrote and reworked that opening like 20 times to get it just right so it could appeal to the legacy fans and also give just enough information, but not too much information to overwhelm a new audience. So finding that sweet spot was really tricky. Steven S. DeKnight: Back in the original show, there was a line in 'Spartacus: Vengeance' that the writers' room and I always were talking about and saying, wouldn't have been great if we had did that. It's when Ashur, I think it's in the last episode of 'Vengeance,' where Ashur tells Lucretia that he's going to help Glaber bring down Spartacus, and then he's going to inherit Batiatus' Ludus and her, and it's going to be the rise of the House of Ashur. And we always thought, man, that would have been a fun show to work on, that would have been really cool, but we killed him, so we can't do that now. DeKnight: So when it came around where Lionsgate and Starz approached me about resurrecting 'Spartacus'--originally, I think the question was, do you want to reboot Spartacus? It's like, No, I'm not going to tell that story again. Of course, first it was the obvious suspects. It was, well, a show about Caesar. I want to make sure the show has legs. And then I was kicking around briefly, Anthony and Cleopatra, but it had the same issue of basically expense. DeKnight: So I came back to this idea of, well, hell. What if we just did the House of Ashur? What if I had, you know, Lucretia went over the cliff with a baby and in the same episode Ashur got his head lopped off, what if he ends up in the underworld with her, and she has this whole thing about The Fates? And, you know, this was just one thing that could have happened. And then I got really excited, because I thought, I love this character of Ashur, and, you know, he's a horrible person, but in 'Gods of the Arena,' you kind of see why he's a horrible person. Really, the guy just needed a hug, you know, he just wanted love, and he was just kicked in the crotch by everybody, and it turned him bitter and mean, and he figured, all right, if that's what you want, that's what you're going to get. With as unlikable of a guy that Ashur is, one of the key challenges for DeKnight was trying to figure out how you make audiences root for someone like that: DeKnight: But I was really excited by the idea of being given a second chance. Whether or not he succeeds, we'll find out... And then the immediate problem was that he was such a bastard in the original show. How do you make the audience root for him? And of course, the answer was to introduce people who are worse. You introduce the Roman elites, who are way worse than he is. Some characters hope he's alive, and other characters clearly say, if he were alive, we would have heard about it, man. So that's one thing the fans are always asking me. It's like Gannicus, we didn't technically see him die. And I have to tell everybody, no, he's dead. Everyone who died in the original series, except Ashur, they're dead, because I didn't want to be changing too many things, and I really didn't want to affect the ending of the original series, which I thought was just right. Like people ask me, 'Are we going to see Agron and Nasir in their goat farm?' And my answer is, always, I love the way their story ended. I don't want to upset them or their goats, so I'm leaving them to their peace. DeKnight: That was the other thing that really excited me, because in the original show, Rob Tapert and I had always talked about bringing in the female Gladiators, the Gladiatrixes, but historically, they didn't arrive until about 80 years later, right about so. So instead, you know, once the war broke out, we could have women fighting, which we really loved, and that was the other thing that I loved about this concept, is that Ashur being alive, one of the first things in history that he changes is he brings in the gladiators early because he's desperate and he needs a gimmick. And there are other things, you know, we want to take historical events that people know and start to change them and alter them all, because Ashur is alive. Him being alive just changes everything, while still pulling from actual historical things that are going on. I mean, we come into it about six months after the defeat of Spartacus and his rebels, and Ashur has been given everything he ever dreamed of, which he discovers is a big burden, and he's struggling because he's in this weird place.</p>
