                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo Go back a decade and most Americans had never heard of Huawei. Today, the Chinese telecom giant is a symbol of how quickly China can dominate a strategic technology sector and in the process create new national security and market threats for U.S. government and industry. Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is now worried about another Chinese company that he predicts will eclipse Huawei in both scale and consequence: BGI. It is not building cell towers or smartphones for the 5G era. "If Huawei was big, BGI will be even bigger," Warner said at the CNBC CFO Council Summit in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. It operates DNA sequencing laboratories in China and abroad. It processes genetic data for hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and researchers across dozens of countries, according to a recent report by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. It later expanded into a global commercial powerhouse, selling DNA sequencing, prenatal testing, cancer screening, and large-scale population genetic analysis, according to an NBC News report. Through subsidiaries, BGI says it operates in the U.S. Europe, and Japan. In several countries, it helped built national genetic databases and pandemic testing systems. U.S. intelligence officials believe that global footprint gives BGI access to one the largest collections of genetic data on Earth. Lawmakers have warned that genetic data is not just medical information. DNA profiles can reveal ancestry, physical traits, disease risk, and family relationships, and when linked with artificial intelligence, the data can also be used for surveillance, tracking and long-term biological research tied to national security, according to the Washington Post's reporting. At the CNBC event this week, Warner continued to press for more focus on BGI. "This level of experimentation on humans and intellectual property theft, we all should be concerned about it." They argue that China makes little distinction between commercial data and state security needs. One of the biggest fears tied to BGI and China's broader biotech push is the possibility of a genetically enhanced soldier. U.S. officials have publicly claimed that China has explored human performance enhancement and military biotechnology. U.S. defense analysts say China's research spans population DNA collection, military databases, and AI-driven human performance modeling, according to a Wall Street Journal op-ed written by U.S. Director of the Central Intelligence Agency John Ratcliffe in 2020, when he was Director of National Intelligence during President Trump's first term. Warner described China as a great nation and great competitor, and as a former telecom executive (he was among the founders of Nextel), he said what Huawei was able to execute on — producing good products at inexpensive prices before the U.S. and Western competitors were prepared — is a cautionary tale. The BGI story looks uncomfortably familiar to Warner. "Go back in time eight or nine years, and most people had never heard of Huawei," he said. Huawei rose by combining massive state support, global market access and aggressive pricing, not only outcompeting Western firms on scale and cost, but positioning itself inside the world's telecom infrastructure before governments understood the security implications. Huawei was first placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019, which banned U.S. firms from selling some technology to the Chinese tech giant over national security concerns. Chip restrictions on Huawei have since become even stricter. Much of the 5G backbone had already been shaped by Chinese technology. During a separate interview with Javers at the CNBC CFO Council Summit, the Republican Chairman of the House committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Michigan congressman John Moolenaar, said "We've seen how they run the play of excess capacity, price manipulation, driving people out of business in different areas; they're going to continue to run that play," he said. The Soviet Union was a military and ideological competitor, but China, in tech domain after domain, Warner says — from telecom and 5G to AI, quantum computing and biotech — is a different kind of competitor. Warner now sees BGI following a similar model in biotechnology. Like Huawei, BGI scaled rapidly with state support. Some U.S. hospitals and research institutions with ties to Chinese genomics firms are under federal pressure, according to the Associated Press, though some medical professionals within the U.S. say they risk losing key research support for core medical goals. We strictly follow rules and laws, and we have no access to Americans' personal data in any of our work," it said. He says that intelligence agencies focus too much on foreign governments and militaries, with less attention placed on commercial technology sectors. But in a world where technology supremacy is national security, Warner says more of our intelligence efforts need to reflect this shift. Only in the past two to three years, he says, has the U.S. seriously expanded spying into AI, semiconductors, and biotechnology. Warner says we need a more "advanced approach" in this area, and he gave as one recent example when China's largest chipmaker SMIC stunned U.S. officials by producing a six-nanometer chip despite sweeping U.S. export controls. The breakthrough showed that Washington had underestimated both China's technical qualities and ability to work around restrictions. "We got caught off guard with the SMIC six-nanometer chip," Warner said. Warner is also worried that tracking China's tech rise requires a type of deep cooperation with U.S. allies that the Trump administration has squandered, such as the global intelligence-sharing network called the "Five Eyes" alliance. Those relationships are now under strain, he said, and key partners including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France have gone public in saying they are reluctant to share intel with the U.S. "They feel like we may be politicizing the intel product and that is not good news for America," Warner said. That dominance help Americans lead global markets, Warner said, but now China is aggressively positioning itself as the international standards setter. Across technology domains, influencing standards and protocols is critical to not only maintaining a competitive edge but also establishing ethical boundaries. "The Chinese come in with clearly a less humanist approach. We've got to reengage for American business and government," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration will be expanding its ban on travel for citizens of certain countries to more than 30, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, in the latest restriction to come since a man from Afghanistan was accused of shooting two National Guard members. The expansion would build on a travel ban already announced in June by the Republican administration, which barred travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries and restricted access to the U.S. for people from seven others. In a social media post earlier this week, Noem had suggested more countries would be included. Noem, who spoke late Thursday in an interview with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham, would not provide further details, saying President Donald Trump was considering which countries would be included. Ingraham asked Noem whether the travel ban was expanding to 32 countries and asked which countries would be added to the 19 announced earlier this year. "I won't be specific on the number, but it's over 30. And the president is continuing to evaluate countries," Noem said. "If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?" The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about when an updated travel ban might go into effect and which countries would be included in it. Additions to the June travel ban are the latest in what has been a rapidly unfolding series of immigration actions since the shooting Thanksgiving week of two National Guard troops in Washington. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal, has been charged with first-degree murder after one of the two victims, West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, died of wounds sustained in the Nov. 26 shooting. The Trump administration has argued that more vetting is needed to make sure people entering or already in the U.S. aren't a threat. Critics say the administration is traumatizing people who've already gone through extensive vetting to get to the U.S. and say the new measures amount to collective punishment. Over the course of a little more than a week, the administration has halted asylum decisions, paused processing of immigration-related benefits for people in the U.S. from the 19 travel ban countries and halted visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it was reducing the time period that work permits are valid for certain applicants such as refugees and people with asylum so they have to reapply more often and go through vetting more frequently.

Mary Hannah Guyaux felt isolated when she chose to drop out of college. She'd been diagnosed with epilepsy before graduating from high school in 2008. However, she decided it was in her best interest to drop out after one semester. Looking back, Guyaux doesn't regret that decision. But it was a difficult one to make in the moment. "My family very much wanted me to stay and make the effort to continue doing it," Guyaux told Business Insider. "It was definitely a big fork in the road in terms of choices, but I didn't feel like I was doing well or succeeding." What has your career trajectory looked like without a college degree? Share your story with this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com. After dropping out, Guyaux worked as a waitress in West Virginia until the restaurant closed. She is now entering her fifth year of work at a construction company. Still, she said, entering the job market without a college degree wasn't easy. "It has been surprising how, even with five years of experience in the field that I'm in and 10 years of experience running a small business, four years of being in college would get my foot further in the door than any of that," Guyaux said. "And often I feel like my résumé just gets pushed to the side." Rising student debt loads and the increasing number of jobs that no longer require a degree in recent years have, however, sparked a shift in the way younger Americans perceive the value of higher education. Recent polling also shows that the percentage of Americans who view college as important has hit a new low. Business Insider spoke to millennials without college degrees who gained fulfillment in their careers. While some said they've encountered hiring roadblocks due to the absence of a college degree, they wouldn't have done anything differently. Guyaux said that while she's not necessarily passionate about her construction job, she's passionate about the life that it has provided for her. Guyaux said that, despite being content with her employment, she would consider going back to school later in life. Serna enrolled at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta but struggled to balance her schoolwork, social life, and part-time jobs. "I felt like a total failure," Serna told Business Insider. "In the back of my mind, I always had the motivation to get out of this trap, but I just didn't quite know how." An added layer of stress for Serna was job hunting while pregnant, which she believes made employers hesitant to hire her. Raising a 7- and 11-year-old as a single mom, Serna doesn't have the time — or financial means — to go back to school right now, but she said she'd consider it down the road. Still, she said it's not required for a successful career. "Never feel like because you didn't go to college, that you're less worthy or less than anybody else in the world, because that is just so far from the truth," Serna said. Dropping out of college was Edith Marie Gillespie-Lorenzo's key to finding her passion for farming. She recalled feeling at the time that college was the only acceptable option, so she enrolled; however, she struggled to maintain her grades while working part-time as a legal assistant at a law firm. After dropping out, Gillespie-Lorenzo said she wasn't making enough money at the law firm to support herself. That's where her passion for farming and agriculture ignited. Since it was seasonal work, she secured a full-time position in customer service at a mutual fund company, where she remained for seven years. "It's my favorite thing in the world, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else," Gillespie-Lorenzo said. But to Gillespie-Lorenzo, money is not the priority for her right now — it's doing a job that brings her happiness. Some high schools across the country are beginning to prioritize students' passions over college admissions. Looking back, the only regret Gillespie-Lorenzo has is not dropping out of college sooner. "The world is so gigantic, and there are so many weird jobs that exist that colleges didn't even begin to cover," she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.K. was the birthplace of commercial nuclear energy, but now generates just a fraction of its power from it — big investments are underway to change that. There is ambition to change that and have a quarter of the U.K.'s power come from nuclear by 2050. Nuclear is considered an attractive bet gas it's a low-carbon, constant energy source that can act as a baseload to complement intermittent sources like renewables. "There's a very clear momentum that has been observed," Doreen Abeysundra, founder of consultancy Fresco Cleantech, told CNBC. It's in part due to geopolitical tensions, which pushed energy security and independence onto public agendas. It found that fragmented regulation, flawed legislation and weak incentives led the U.K. to fall behind as a nuclear powerhouse. British company Rolls-Royce has been selected as the country's preferred partner for SMRs, which are effectively containerized nuclear reactors designed to be manufactured in a factory. Many include passive cooling techniques, which supporters argue makes them safer and cheaper. Nuclear has long come under fire by environmentalists due to radioactive waste and disasters like Chernobyl. Most SMRs use light water reactor technology – think of the planned large-scale nuclear plant Sizewell C, just "shrunk down," said Abeysundra – which is tried and tested. Other designs, known as "advanced" reactors, are more experimental. For example, those that change the cooling solution or solvent, which is typically used in the process of separating and purifying nuclear materials. The U.K.'s first SMR will be at Wylfa, in Wales, though no timeline has been given for its completion. The site will house three SMRs and grow over time. While SMRs are a "game changer" thanks to their ability to power individual factories or small towns, their days of commercial operation are too far away, he said. From an investment standpoint, "that is still a bit scary," he added. To secure the large baseloads needed to offset the intermittency of renewables, "we're still looking at big power stations," added Paul Jackson, Invesco's EMEA global market strategist. SMRs "probably" do have a role — "they can clearly be more nimble" — but it will take time to roll them out, Jackson said, casting doubt on the U.K.'s ability to be a leader in nuclear, as France and China are already miles ahead. The U.K. government body Great British Energy-Nuclear is set to identify sites for an additional large-scale plant, having already acquired one in Gloucestershire, in the west of England, as well as the site in Wales. "We are reversing a legacy of no new nuclear power being delivered to unlock a golden age of nuclear, securing thousands of good, skilled jobs and billions in investment," a spokesperson for the U.K. government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told CNBC. "Sizewell C will deliver clean electricity for the equivalent of six million of today's households for at least six decades, and the UK's first small modular reactors at Wylfa will power the equivalent of three million homes, bringing energy security," they added. It pioneered fresh funding mechanisms to make large-scale nuclear projects investible so that they are less reliant on direct government funding, such as a Contract for Differences, which was used for Hinkley Point C. The mechanism guarantees a fixed price for the electricity generated over a long period of time in order to de-risk investments in an industry that's known for running over time and budget. The Regulated Asset Base (RAB), first used for nuclear at Sizewell C, attempts to reconcile this. Investors get paid from the day they cut a check for a nuclear project, rather than the day it starts operating. Private market investors are increasingly interested in next-generation nuclear as a way to offset soaring energy demands from AI, resulting in a host of young companies trying to build out facilities. Perhaps the most famous is Oklo, a U.S. firm that was taken public by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman. The U.K.'s advanced modular reactor hopeful Newcleo, which uses lead for cooling, moved its headquarters from London to Paris in 2024 — a strategic move to deepen its European footprint. Meanwhile, Tokamak Energy and First Light Fusion call the U.K. home. They both focus on nuclear fusion, the process of generating power by combining atoms, though this technology is yet to get out of the lab. All of today's nuclear power comes from fission, where atoms are spit. The U.K. announced £2.5 billion for a world-first fusion prototype in June. The U.K. faces challenges in access to relevant talent, which is crucial for scaling projects effectively. The country is heralded for its world-class universities and technical know-how, "but that is very much book knowledge," said Van Lanschot Kempen's Cappelli. For Abeysundra, there's one area where the U.K. stands out: its mindset. "There is so much knowledge, innovation, and that can-do attitude, which I don't see as much in other nations," she said, pointing to the U.K.'s trailblazing role in the Industrial Revolution and establishment of offshore wind energy. The U.K. government positioned nuclear energy as a key element of the future clean energy workforce in its Clean Energy Jobs Plan released in October, while its national roadmap for nuclear skills, set out in 2024, focuses on apprenticeships, PhDs and upskilling mid-career workers. Industry-led initiatives such as the Energy Skills Passport also support the likes of oil and gas workers to gain green skills. Uranium, the fuel used to make a nuclear reaction, is dominated by just four countries, including Russia. Global demand for uranium could rise by nearly a third by 2030 and more than double by 2040, according to the World Nuclear Association, adding further reliance on a select few countries and pressure on developers. Fuel for Sizewell C will come from European or "Western suppliers," Cappelli noted. However, for him, it poses the question: How secure is nuclear energy really? Workers, expertise and funding are required for nuclear energy, but the supply chain is also key, he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Meta is delaying the release of new mixed reality glasses code-named "Phoenix." The company planned to release the new device in the second half of 2026, but it is pushing back its timeline to the first half of 2027, Maher Saba, VP of Reality Labs Foundation, wrote in a Thursday memo to employees, which was seen by Business Insider. In a separate memo, also viewed by Business Insider, metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns said moving the release date back is "going to give us a lot more breathing room to get the details right." There was some skepticism among leaders about the puck, but they chose to keep it to help keep the glasses lighter and more comfortable, and to prevent it from overheating, they said. Saba said in the memo that at a recent meeting with CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Reality Labs (RL) leaders received feedback on their plans for 2026, which he said "focused on making the business sustainable and taking extra time to deliver our experiences with higher quality." "Based on that, many teams in RL will need to adjust their plans and timelines," he added. "Extending timelines is not an opportunity for us to add more features or take on additional work." Meta is starting work on its next-generation Quest device, a product that Aul and Cairns wrote will be focused on immersive gaming, and represent a "large upgrade" in capabilities from its existing devices, and "significantly improve unit economics." In October, Meta reorganized its metaverse unit and tapped Aul, who led products for Meta Horizon, and Cairns, who was previously in charge of virtual reality hardware, to co-lead its efforts, Business Insider previously reported. The company is now considering budget cuts of up to 30% within its Reality Labs division, which could impact employees working on its virtual spaces platform, Horizon Worlds. The company has also expanded its AI hardware push by acquiring Limitless, a startup that makes AI-powered pendant devices, the company announced Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A jury on Friday issued an $11.5 million verdict against the world's largest HR organization over allegations it had racially discriminated and retaliated against a former employee. The Society for Human Resource Management, known as SHRM, was found liable for racial discrimination and retaliation and hit with a ruling of $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million for punitive damages, according to Ariel DeFazio, a lawyer for the plaintiff. SHRM said it plans to appeal the decision. SHRM was sued in 2022 by Rehab Mohamed, who worked at the trade group as an instructional designer from 2016 to 2020. "The optics are bad because they've held themselves out as an authority on best practices," said Alice K. Jump, an employment attorney and partner at law firm Reavis Page Jump. Mohamed said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including SHRM's CEO, Johnny C. Taylor Jr., and its head of human resources, throughout the summer of 2020. While testifying on December 4, Taylor said he wasn't involved in Mohamed's termination. In response to questions from Hunter Swain, another of Mohamed's lawyers, Jackson said that he left SHRM in 2021 and his title was manager of employee experience. He said he became a certified HR professional while employed there and that he had undergone one training session on HR investigations just a few months before the discriminatory events that Mohamed cited in her lawsuit took place. In September, SHRM asked the court to bar Mohamed from introducing evidence or argument that the organization is a specialist in HR best practices. The following month, US District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher denied SHRM's request, saying its "asserted expertise in human resources is integral to the circumstances of this case and cannot reasonably be excluded." In his testimony, Taylor said SHRM's work includes advising HR professionals about best practices, including those pertaining to investigating internal complaints of discrimination and retaliation. He said SHRM has a set of curricula around best practices for investigating employment complaints. The verdict was not surprising given that SHRM promotes itself as an expert in HR, Boston employment lawyer Evan Fray-Witzer told Business Insider. During pre-trial discovery for Mohamed's case, SHRM revealed the existence of two other discrimination complaints from employees. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. "We are very happy that the jury spent a week listening very closely to the evidence and that they decided, as a result, to hold SHRM accountable," Mohamed's lawyer, DeFazio, told Business Insider.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's SpaceX, is initiating a secondary share sale that would give the company a valuation of up to $800 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. SpaceX is also telling some investors it will consider going public possibly around the end of next year, the report said. At the elevated price, Musk's aerospace and defense contractor would be valued above ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which wrapped up a share sale at a $500 billion valuation in October. SpaceX has been investing heavily in reusable rockets, launch facilities and satellites, while competing for government contracts with newer space players, including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. SpaceX is far ahead, and operates the world's largest network of satellites in low earth orbit through Starlink, which powers satellite internet services under the same brand name. A SpaceX IPO would include its Starlink business, which the company previously considered spinning out. Musk recently discussed whether SpaceX would go public during Tesla's annual shareholders meeting last month. Musk, who is the CEO of both companies, said he doesn't love running publicly traded businesses, in part because they draw "spurious lawsuits," and can "make it very difficult to operate effectively." However, Musk said during the meeting that he wanted to "try to figure out some way for Tesla shareholders to participate in SpaceX," adding, "maybe at some point, SpaceX should become a public company despite all the downsides."
