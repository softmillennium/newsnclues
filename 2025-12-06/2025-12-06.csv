            Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa has accused Israel of exporting crises to other countries and “fighting ghosts,” amid persistent incursions and air strikes by Israeli forces into southern Syria.
    


            Al-Sharaa was speaking at the Doha Forum in Qatar on Saturday, in a conversation with CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour.
    


            Syria's interim president again demanded that the Israel agree to reinstate the 1974 deconfliction agreement that separated Syrian and Israeli forces. Israeli forces crossed into southern Syria a year ago, as the Assad regime fell, and continue to occupy the strategic heights of Mount Hermon. The summit, which overlooks Israel, Lebanon and Syria, had been in a buffer zone for the previous 50 years.
    


            Israeli officials have said the Israel Defense Forces will remain in the places they occupied a year ago indefinitely.
    


            Syria was adamant about respecting the 1974 agreement and would not accept an alternative buffer zone, Al-Sharaa said. “We demand Israel to go back to the pre-December 8 (2024) lines,” he said, adding that the United States was taking part in negotiations.
    


            Attempts to revise the agreement would “send us into a serious and dangerous place,” he said.
    


            “Who will be protecting this buffer zone or this demilitarized zone if the Syrian army or Syrian forces aren't going to be there?” he asked.
    


            “Syria has suffered massive violations of our airspace, and we've been victim of over 1,000 air strikes and over 400 incursions” since the revolution a year ago, Al-Sharaa said.
    


            At least 13 people were killed during an Israeli military raid in southern Syria late last month.
    


            Al-Sharaa's rebel forces entered the Syrian capital last December, forcing then President Bashar al-Assad to flee.
    


            Al-Sharaa repeated that his government would hold to account those involved in abuses earlier this year in Syria's coastal zone, when hundreds of minority Alawites were killed. Many Alawites had supported the Assad regime.
    


            Despite the atrocities committed then, Syria was a state of law, he said, and reinforcing the rule of law was the way to guarantee the rights of all minorities.
    


            As to elections, Al-Sharaa said his current mandate would be for a further four years, while a constitution is drafted and institutions built. At that point, elections would take place, he said. An indirect parliamentary election held in October was marred by concerns about representation of women and minorities. Only a small fraction of the population was able to vote.
    


Syria's jihadist-turned-president caps extraordinary transformation with White House visit



            Al-Sharaa also told the forum that he had met members of the US Congress during a recent visit to Washington to push for the repeal of the Caesar Act, which continues to enforce some sanctions against Syria but was recently waived for a further 180 days.
    


            “There was a great understanding, and I believe we're at the 95% point,” he said.
    


            The economic situation in Syria was stabilizing, he said, and it was seeing the first indications of economic growth.
    


            “There was a great understanding, and I believe we're at the 95% point,” he said.
    


            The economic situation in Syria was stabilizing, he said, and it was seeing the first indications of economic growth.
    


            There is substantial investment in Syria, mainly due to financing from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and with the growing participation of foreign energy and construction firms.
    


            “People were receiving an hour and a half of electricity per day, and now we have reached 12 to 14 hours per day and hopefully this year we will be self-sufficient in terms of electricity,” Al-Sharaa said.

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

Israel's domestic political life is boiling over. Against the backdrop of war, disputes over the limits of executive power, and a deepening crisis of trust in state institutions, the country appears to be edging toward a major political transformation. This is hardly surprising. Large-scale shifts are visible across the region and at the global level of international affairs, where older models of stability are breaking down and competition between strategies and identities is intensifying.

An additional catalyst has been the unprecedented story of the official pardon request that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu submitted to President Isaac Herzog. Seeking to halt the corruption trial against him, Netanyahu framed the move as a step that could ease social polarization and free him to focus on leading the country. The President's Office acknowledged the extraordinary nature of the request, said it would be carefully reviewed after receiving legal opinions, and released the relevant documents, including an extensive legal brief.

A key international dimension is that in November, US President Donald Trump sent Herzog a letter urging him to grant Netanyahu a full pardon, arguing that the court proceedings distract the prime minister at a critical moment. Politically, this can be read as more than a simple gesture of support. In Washington, especially after several turbulent episodes in 2025, there may be a growing sense that Netanyahu's status and political vulnerability have become a significant source of instability and a risk to the US approach aimed at de-escalation and a longer-term settlement in Gaza. This interpretation also surfaces in expert discussions noting that the White House has had to restrain Israel's leadership from undermining arrangements for the sake of domestic political survival.

Viewed in the wider regional context of 2025, the US has also faced an increasingly alarming security backdrop. This includes the Israel-Iran Twelve-Day War in June, which sharply altered the strategic landscape. Analysts have also debated the autumn strike on Doha as a highly sensitive precedent for the security of US allies in the Gulf and for the credibility of American guarantees. Within this framework, the idea that Trump seeks to avoid entangling the US in new, unwanted conflicts – and therefore may see Netanyahu's legal and political incentives as a risk factor – appears politically plausible, even if Washington's official language remains more cautious.

Netanyahu and his coalition do not seem to be in the strongest position. The war and its political fallout, the dispute over Haredi conscription, and the approaching budget deadline are all tightening internal pressure. The 2026 budget must pass the Knesset by the end of March 2026; otherwise, the law automatically triggers a scenario leading to early elections, even though the next regular elections are already scheduled for October 2026.

Against this backdrop, opposition leader Yair Lapid is increasingly stepping into the spotlight. He is working to align himself with Israel's traditional foreign-policy partners and with more moderate domestic allies in an effort to pull the country out of growing isolation and to secure a base of support should early elections take place in 2026. This is also reflected in the way Lapid systematically uses the parliamentary platform and the international agenda, including pressure on the government over the framework of the US plan for Gaza – an area where Netanyahu's coalition has often preferred to avoid a public display of unity.

Speaking about the regime's growing international isolation, Lapid said Israel continues to endure the most serious political crisis in its history, and that the current situation reflects a loss of control on the part of the present government. According to media reports, he also linked this trend to the expanding international recognition of Palestine and to the consequences of economic and investment pressure, citing decisions by major players such as Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which in 2025 began and later widened the exclusion of a number of Israeli companies and banks from its portfolio on ethical grounds. At home, the negative backdrop for Netanyahu is reinforced by polling data. In October, Israel's Channel 12 recorded a significant share of respondents (52%) who do not want to see him as a candidate in the next election.

Lapid has also been gaining points on the foreign-policy front, presenting himself as a pragmatic figure and a relatively comfortable option both for Israelis weary of constant turbulence and for external partners in need of a predictable interlocutor. His recent visit to London illustrates this clearly. Not all details of the trip are publicly available, but what has been disclosed suggests that he is deliberately building a European reserve of legitimacy and support in anticipation of a possible political watershed in 2026.

Reports indicate that during a meeting with Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell, the parties discussed the possibility of restarting negotiations on a UK-Israel trade agreement, which London suspended in May 2025 amid the war in Gaza and radical statements by several Israeli ministers. Israeli sources also confirmed that Lapid urged the UK to lift existing restrictions on arms exports to Israel and raised the idea of a new configuration for managing Gaza, in which Egypt could assume a more central role instead of Türkiye and Qatar. In his view, this framework could open the way to additional regional agreements that would strengthen Israel's security and economy.

It also matters that this visit took place under new leadership at the Foreign Office. Cooper took up her post after the September reshuffle, replacing David Lammy. This means that Lapid is, in effect, building ties with London's new political team in advance, seeking to cement a reputation as a leader with whom Britain can discuss Gaza's postwar governance, the restoration of economic links, and a broader architecture of regional de-escalation. Taken together with his contacts within the British political establishment, including a meeting with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, this looks like a deliberate strategy to position himself as an alternative center of gravity in Israeli politics at a time when the current coalition's standing appears to be weakening.

Lapid is also mindful of Israel's principal ally, the US, and is clearly working to build a functional relationship with the Trump administration by emphasizing constructive engagement and political responsibility. A telling example is his initiative to bring a Knesset vote on a measure supporting Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza. Lapid publicly noted that US government representatives had approached him regarding the vote and that the opposition would back the plan. In doing so, he sent Washington a clear signal that he is prepared to serve as a reliable, predictable partner who will not sabotage an American initiative for the sake of domestic political gamesmanship.

At the same time, the move served an internal purpose. In effect, it created a situation in which Netanyahu and his coalition would find it harder to distance themselves from Trump's plan and more difficult to explain to the American side any lack of a unified Israeli political front. Lapid even framed this as a norm of political conduct, arguing that from time to time, the entire Knesset should behave as though there is one people with shared goals. In this approach, he appears to the White House as a convenient interlocutor – and potentially a stabilizing backstop – should the current coalition hesitate over sensitive language relating to Palestinian self-determination and the future status of statehood.

As a result, Lapid is simultaneously reaffirming loyalty to Washington's core line while subtly highlighting the contrast with the ruling camp. This helps him strengthen his standing as a politician capable of delivering a steadier Israel-US relationship at a time when Gaza remains a central test both for regional stability and for American strategy.

Against this broader configuration, Netanyahu's request for a pardon from President Herzog also appears politically logical. In practical terms, it can be read as an attempt to secure at least partial guarantees in case he fails to hold on to power and is forced to leave the prime minister's office. The very fact of the appeal is unusual for a sitting head of government and is already being perceived as a crisis move with heavy domestic political repercussions.

But this by no means suggests that Netanyahu and his far-right coalition are ready to relinquish power without a fight. If anything, the opposite is true. At a moment when the opposition is gaining momentum both at home and abroad, and the American line on Gaza has become a political test of governability, the ruling camp could be motivated to search for ways to seize the initiative once again.

In this context, the northern front looks like one of the most dangerous pressure points. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah of November 27, 2024 formally remains in effect, yet in practice it is extremely fragile. Israel continues to strike Hezbollah targets, presenting this as necessary deterrence and as a way to prevent the group from rebuilding its military capabilities. Meanwhile, the key Israeli objective of removing the threat along the border and creating conditions for the safe return of evacuated residents remains unfulfilled.

A separate political marker is the statements of US special envoy Tom Barrack, who warned that if Beirut does not make progress on dismantling Hezbollah's military capability, Israel may act unilaterally. In another formulation, he implied that Lebanon is approaching its last window of opportunity to reach understandings. This is all the more pointed given that the deadline for Hezbollah's disarmament already passed on December 1.

Even if these remarks are viewed as a tool of pressure, they heighten anxiety around the scenario of a new major round of war. The Lebanese authorities have publicly said they do not want a return to conflict, which in itself underscores how close the region is to a dangerous threshold.

For this reason, the claim that a new war with Lebanon is highly likely should be treated as a strong analytical hypothesis rather than a foregone conclusion. Yet the logic of escalation is clearly visible. The incomplete implementation of post-conflict arrangements, disagreements over what exactly constitutes disarmament, growing mutual distrust, and Israel's internal political struggle all create an environment in which a large-scale strike could be used as a means of projecting strength and bringing the domestic agenda back under control.

The Iran file is not closed either. The Iran-Israel war in June 2025 became a turning point and sharply raised the risk of renewed open conflict. Think tanks have noted that after this episode, both sides appear to remain locked into preparations for the next crisis, while the absence of durable de-escalation mechanisms only increases the probability of another round.

Taken together, this suggests that Israel is indeed living through an unprecedented political crisis. Society is deeply polarized, the confrontation between government and opposition has hardened, and the role of external actors is more visible than ever. The US, EU and UK, Israel's traditional allies, increasingly act not merely as observers but as meaningful factors shaping domestic political dynamics.

The overall picture is therefore one of acute tension. Netanyahu is trying to hedge personal and political risk through the legal track. The opposition is expanding its external legitimacy and building bridges to Washington and to European partners. The regional fronts of Lebanon and Iran remain potential levers for major escalation.

In these conditions, the question is not only whether Israeli politics is heading toward a new transformation, but through which pathway that transformation will unfold. It may take the form of a managed process driven by political bargaining and institutional decisions. Or it may be accelerated by yet another external crisis that inevitably repackages the internal agenda and reshuffles the balance of power.

MOSCOW, DECEMBER 5, 2025 — RT India began broadcasting from its studios in New Delhi, India. Russian President Vladimir Putin and RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan jointly launched the new channel during the president's state visit to the country on December 4-5. 

“This is a momentous event, for it [RT] grants millions of Indian citizens clearer, more direct access to insights about contemporary Russia,” Vladimir Putin said.

Commenting on RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan's remarks that RT's broadcasts are being shut down in many “ill-intentioned countries,” the Russian president stated: “This is not out of malice, it is out of fear, fear of the truth. Because Russia Today is a source of truthful and reliable information, focused on serving the interests of its viewers and listeners.”

He added: “Russia Today's mission is not merely to promote Russia, its culture, and its positions on domestic and international issues. Above all, Russia Today strives to convey truthful information about our country and about what is happening in the world. This is the absolute value of Russia Today; this is what distinguishes it from the propaganda machinery of many Western media outlets, which essentially relay the positions of their governments.”

The channel's launch took place during the official state visit of the Russian president to India.

“I am confident that Russia Today will do its job, and do it brilliantly, at the highest level. My congratulations to Russia Today and to all of your current and future viewers and listeners. Good luck,” stated Vladimir Putin.

During the launch ceremony, the president was presented with a virtual tour of the RT India studios.

As part of President Putin's visit to India, an Addendum to the Memorandum of Understanding between RT and Indian public service broadcaster Prasar Bharati was signed, further expanding cooperation in the media sphere. The agreement includes the exchange of news content, expertise, and information, as well as the organization of joint live broadcasts covering breaking news, major summits, and high-level visits between the Russian Federation and the Republic of India. This marks a new phase in the partnership between RT and Prasar Bharati, strengthening not only media collaboration but also broader bilateral relations amid a complex international environment.

RT India will air four daily news bulletins alongside documentaries, interviews with government officials, business leaders, and cultural figures, as well as public affairs programming tailored to a broad Indian audience. The channel will prioritize in-depth coverage of key developments in Russian-Indian relations and the growing role of both nations in a multipolar world.

The channel's flagship geopolitical talk show will be hosted by former Indian Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid. Rungjun Sharma, the head of News at RT India, will present a weekly program dedicated to Russian-Indian relations. The Indian politician, diplomat, author, and chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, already hosts his own show on RT called ‘Imperial Receipts with Dr. Shashi Tharoor'.

In the run-up to the channel's launch, RT has unveiled a nationwide ad blitz that celebrated the strength and legacy of the deep and historic ties between Russia and India. The campaign was visible across Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai, taking over 65 prime locations and 190 digital screens and billboards nationwide.

The launch of a dedicated channel tailored specifically for the Indian audience will significantly expand RT's footprint and viewership in the country. It also represents a landmark moment in relations between the two friendly nations. RT India will serve as a vital platform for highlighting the strategic nature of Russian-Indian cooperation, built over decades on mutual respect, trust, and open dialogue.

In 2026, RT also plans to launch a dedicated Hindi-language news website, catering to over 500 million Hindi speakers in India.

Global malaria deaths rose to an estimated 610,000 in 2024, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning that Africa continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden.

According to a report published by the agency on Thursday, the continent accounts for 95% of all global malaria cases and deaths. Children under the age of five represent around 76% of the fatalities in Africa. 

According to the WHO, three countries – Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), and Niger – collectively accounted for about half of malaria-related deaths in the African region. Nigeria alone represented 31.9%, followed by the DRC at 11.7%, and Niger with 6.1%. 

The total number of recorded cases in the world also grew by approximately 9 million, reaching 282 million worldwide, a 3% year-on-year increase, the report said. 

The WHO also highlighted the persistent funding gap undermining malaria control efforts. “In 2024, $3.9 billion was invested in the malaria response, yet it reached less than half of the 2025 funding target of $9.3 billion,” the agency stated on X.

Malaria, one of the world's deadliest vector-borne diseases, is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes. Symptoms can take several weeks to appear and typically include fever, chills, vomiting, and flu-like illness. If left untreated, the disease can lead to severe complications and death. 

Earlier this year, an outbreak in the DR Congo resulted in 943 confirmed cases and 52 deaths, according to Dieudonne Mwamba, director general of the National Public Health Institute (INSP).

The growing number of malaria cases comes as Africa confronts another major public health crisis. In November, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the continent was experiencing its worst cholera outbreak in 25 years, with more than 300,000 confirmed and suspected cases and over 7,000 deaths recorded across the region in 2025.

LONDON, December 6. /TASS/. The possible confiscation of frozen Russian assets in the European Union could impact the euro's role as a global reserve currency, the Financial Times (FT) newspaper wrote.

Euro-denominated assets account for around 20% of foreign exchange reserves held by central banks worldwide, according to the publication. In this respect, the euro is second only to the US dollar, which accounts for almost 60% of global foreign exchange reserves. However, if the EU decides to seize Russia's frozen assets, central banks and private investors will begin to doubt whether it is worth buying European securities.

That said, although the European Central Bank has expressed skepticism about the asset seizure scheme, pointing out its risks, some EU countries that have long opposed it have changed their position and now support such a move, the paper added.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

More than 650 drones target locations across Ukraine including western regions with sirens sounding in eastern Poland

Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine in the early hours of Saturday as US and Ukrainian officials continued talks in Miami which the White House hopes will bring an end to the conflict.

Russia used more than 650 drones and 51 missiles overnight, Ukraine's armed forces said, with drones targeting locations across the country, including in western regions hundreds of miles from the frontline. Warning sirens also sounded in parts of eastern Poland, close to the Ukrainian border.

At least three people were injured in the attacks in Kyiv region, while the national energy operator, Ukrenergo, said much of the overnight attack had targeted power stations and other energy infrastructure. Russia has been relentlessly attacking Ukraine's energy capabilities in recent weeks, in the hope of cutting supplies of heat, light and water as the country prepares for a fourth winter of full-scale conflict.

Russia's defence ministry said it had shot down 116 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory, while there were unconfirmed reports on Telegram that Ukraine had hit an oil refinery in the city of Ryazan. The regional governor said a residential building had been damaged and drone debris had fallen on an “industrial facility”.
 Donald Trump is keen to put an end to the war, but there has so far been little sign the two sides are anywhere close to finding a common position. Talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators are due to continue for a third day in Miami on Saturday, after a meeting between Vladimir Putin, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow earlier in the week.

Washington's plans involve Ukraine surrendering land in return for vague security guarantees and would be hard for Kyiv to accept in the current moment. There is also no indication that Russia is ready to sign a deal on Trump's suggested terms.

“The Russia-Ukraine thing has been a source of perennial frustration, I think, for the entire White House,” the US vice-president, JD Vance, said in an interview with NBC on Friday, reiterating that the administration had been surprised that the conflict was not easy to solve.

European nations have been blindsided by some of the US efforts and have been scrambling to stay part of the process. On Saturday, the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, tried to downplay the significance of the Trump administration's new national security strategy, published a day earlier, which said Europe was facing “civilisational erasure” due to immigration and suggested the US should back rightwing forces on the continent.

“The US is still our biggest ally,” said Kallas, speaking at a diplomatic conference in Qatar. “I think we haven't always seen eye to eye on different topics, but I think the overall principle is still there.

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Europe and the war in Ukraine.

The Trump administration released a policy paper on Friday that made explicit Washington's support for Europe's nationalist far-right parties.

The 33-page US National Security Strategy, which includes a signed introduction from Donald Trump, appears to push the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, saying several countries risk becoming “majority non-European” and Europe faces “the real and stark prospect of civilizational erasure”.

Speaking at the Doha Forum, an annual diplomatic conference in Qatar's capital on Saturday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas addressed the policy paper by reiterating that the “US is still our biggest ally,” AFP reports. “Of course, there's a lot of criticism, but I think some of it is also true,” Kallas said.

Kallas continued: “I think we haven't always seen eye to eye on different topics, but I think the overall principle is still there. We are the biggest allies, and we should stick together.”

Overnight Russian missile and drone strikes left parts of Ukraine without power on Saturday morning, Ukraine's energy ministry said.

The Russian defense ministry confirmed that Russian forces attacked energy facilities that supported the Ukrainian military and port infrastructure used by Ukrainian forces, saying that the strike was in response to what it called Ukrainian attacks on civilian targets.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all off-site power overnight, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Saturday, marking the 11th time the facility temporarily lost power during the war.

Ukraine peace plan talks continue between Trump advisers and Ukrainian officials, with the parties involved saying on Friday that they will meet for a third day of talks.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas responded to the US National Security Strategy, a policy paper released by the Trump administration on Friday that made explicit Washington's support for Europe's nationalist far-right parties. “US is still our biggest ally,” Kallas said Saturday.

Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Downing Street on Monday, the Press Association reports.

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, will also be in attendance, according to PA. The four leaders plan on discussing the ongoing peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all off-site power overnight, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Saturday, as crews continue to work to restore power around Ukraine following what Kyiv said were targeted strikes on energy infrastructure.

According to the IAEA, this marked the 11th time the plant lost power during the war.

Ukraine's ZNPP temporarily lost all off-site power overnight, 11th time during military conflict, IAEA DG @rafaelmgrossi said. ZNPP reconnected to 330 kV power line after half hour outage, but 750 kV line still disconnected.

Russian forces launched “a massive strike” overnight, the Russian defense ministry said in a post on Telegram, in response to what it called Ukrainian attacks on civilian targets.

Using high-precision, long-range air- and ground-based weapon - including Kinzhal hypersonic missiles and long-range drones – the strike targeted Ukrainian military-industrial enterprises, the energy facilities that support their operation and the port infrastructure used by the Ukrainian forces, the ministry said.

“Russia continues to disregard any peace efforts and instead strikes critical civilian infrastructure, including our energy system and railways,” Andrii Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said on X. “This shows that no decisions to strengthen Ukraine and raise pressure on Russia can be delayed. And especially not under the pretext of peace process.”

Donald Trump's advisers and Ukrainian officials said Friday that they will meet for a third day of talks as the US president pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a US-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war.

“Both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings,” officials said in a statement released after a second day of meetings in Florida on Friday.

The talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's lead negotiator, follow discussions between Vladimir Putin and the US envoys at the Kremlin on Tuesday.

The Swedish navy encounters Russian submarines in the Baltic Sea on an “almost weekly” basis, its chief of operations has said, and is preparing for a further increase in the event of ceasefire or armistice in the Ukraine war.

Capt Marko Petkovic said Moscow was “continuously reinforcing” its presence in the region, and sightings of its vessels were a regular part of life for the Swedish navy. Its “very common”, he said, adding that the number of sightings had increased in recent years.

The Baltic Sea region is facing an increasing range of threats, including suspected hybrid attacks from drones, alleged sabotage of underwater infrastructure and a steady flow of ageing oil tankers in the form of shadow fleet ships carrying crude oil from Russia.

The protective shield over the Chornobyl disaster nuclear reactor in Ukraine has degraded enough after a drone strike earlier this year that it can no longer perform its main function of blocking radiation, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced.

An inspection last week revealed that the steel confinement structure, which was painstakingly built at a cost of €1.5bn ($1.75bn) next to the destroyed reactor, “had lost its primary safety functions,” said Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general.

While some repairs had been carried out, “comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety,” Grossi said.

The February drone strike blew a hole in the structure, but the UN said then that radiation levels remained normal and stable and that there were no reports of radiation leaks. While Ukrainian authorities said the drone was Russian, Moscow denied it had attacked the plant.

Work on the structure was completed in 2019 by a Europe-led initiative. The 1986 Chornobyl explosion – which happened when Ukraine was under Moscow's rule as part of the Soviet Union – had sent radiation across Europe.

Overnight Russian missile and drone strikes left parts of Ukraine without power on Saturday morning, Ukraine's energy ministry said on Telegram.

The strikes hit energy infrastructure in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Lviv, Odesa, Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions, according to the ministry.

Crews were working on Saturday to restore power in the Odesa, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv regions, with hourly outage schedules and capacity limitation schedules for industrial consumers and businesses in effect.

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Europe and the war in Ukraine.

The Trump administration released a policy paper on Friday that made explicit Washington's support for Europe's nationalist far-right parties.

The 33-page US National Security Strategy, which includes a signed introduction from Donald Trump, appears to push the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, saying several countries risk becoming “majority non-European” and Europe faces “the real and stark prospect of civilizational erasure”.

Speaking at the Doha Forum, an annual diplomatic conference in Qatar's capital on Saturday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas addressed the policy paper by reiterating that the “US is still our biggest ally,” AFP reports. “Of course, there's a lot of criticism, but I think some of it is also true,” Kallas said.

Kallas continued: “I think we haven't always seen eye to eye on different topics, but I think the overall principle is still there. We are the biggest allies, and we should stick together.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Moscow ‘continuously reinforcing' its presence in the region, says Swedish chief of operations Capt Marko Petkovic

The Swedish navy encounters Russian submarines in the Baltic Sea on an “almost weekly” basis, its chief of operations has said, and is preparing for a further increase in the event of ceasefire or armistice in the Ukraine war.

Capt Marko Petkovic said Moscow was “continuously reinforcing” its presence in the region, and sightings of its vessels were a regular part of life for the Swedish navy. Its “very common”, he said, adding that the number of sightings had increased in recent years.

The Baltic Sea region is facing an increasing range of threats, including suspected hybrid attacks from drones, alleged sabotage of underwater infrastructure and a steady flow of ageing oil tankers in the form of shadow fleet ships carrying crude oil from Russia.

Last month, the British defence secretary said that a Russian spy ship had entered British waters and shone lasers at military pilots, warning that the UK faced a “new era of threat” from hostile countries.

Sweden recently hosted a major Nato anti-submarine warfare exercise, Playbook Merlin 25, featuring nine countries, including Sweden, Germany, France and the US, in which hundreds of personnel practised their submarine-hunting skills in the unique conditions of the Baltic to prepare for possible underwater attack.

The hilly underwater landscape of the Baltic near Sweden makes it difficult to detect submarines because they can hide.

Petkovic said Russia was increasing its capabilities and was producing one Kilo-class submarine a year in St Petersburg and the Kaliningrad enclave, positioned between Poland and Lithuania. He said it was undergoing a “deliberate and constant modernisation programme” of its ships.

“Once a ceasefire or armistice is eventually in place in Ukraine, you can only assess, and we do assess that Russia will reinforce its capabilities in this region,” said Petkovic. “So with that said, the [Swedish] navy needs to continuously grow and focus on the overall picture.”

He said Russia's shadow fleet of civilian-flagged oil tankers was also a concern and did not rule out the potential for such ships to be used to launch drones.

“The shadow fleet in itself is not a military problem, but the shadow fleet could affect our nations from a military perspective,” Petkovic said.

The varying challenges of underwater conditions – including shorter visibility than above water, salinity and temperature – mean that underwater infrastructure was especially vulnerable in the Baltics, he said. This was especially the case for Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania, he said, which were “fully dependent on the sea lines for communication, for our sustainment of our societies”.

However, he believes that increased Nato vigilance is having an impact. He said that since Operation Baltic Sentry was established in January, “we haven't seen any cable incidents in this region at all”.

He added: “First of all it shows that the alliance works, cohesion. And we are closing ranks against one particular threat. The Baltic Sentry has proven that point. Regardless of whether any of the incidents have been state-sponsored or if it's been bad seamanship, or anything in between, it has raised awareness amongst the merchant fleet that they should be a bit more cautious when travelling our regional waters.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan will work with democratic partners to address challenges to global democracy, and would not allow any person or power, including external autocratic powers, to deprive it of its democracy and its freedom, President William Lai (賴清德) said at the National Human Rights Museum in New Taipei City yesterday.

Taiwan understands the value of freedom and democracy better than anyone, especially as authoritarianism seeks to expand globally and threaten democracies worldwide, Lai told an event to mark World Human Rights Day, which is on Wednesday.

Taiwan is described as the “lighthouse of democracy in Asia,” Lai said.

The nation belongs to Taiwanese, and only by bolstering national security can Taiwan's human rights and freedom continue to be protected, he said.

Taiwan cannot return to martial law, he said, adding that former presidents Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) and Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) backed human rights in Taiwan in accordance with international standards.

Lai said that his administration would strive to restore the truth about Taiwan's history, as the truth can help harmonize society and enable future governments to avoid the mistakes of previous administrations.

The government would also preserve sites of injustice and include them in education material so that young people would understand and cherish Taiwan's hard-won democracy, he said.

Lai said that his administration would continue to seek justice for people who faced hardship or died during the Martial Law period, adding that the government has issued 4,000 restoration of honor certificates to such people or their families.

The certificates would not restore lost lives or time lost in prison, but they show that the government is willing to shoulder responsibility and admit that it was in the wrong, he said.

Transitional justice is not about the past, as it would define what kind of country Taiwan will become, he said, adding that the government would continue to work with civic groups to prompt transitional justice and human rights.

Taiwan is willing to share its experience in resisting authoritarianism with those living under the shadow of oppression and like-minded democratic partners, which would show the world that Taiwan is committed to democracy, and that it stands by peace, human rights and the rule of law, Lai said.

Minister of Culture Li Yuan (李遠) told the event that his ministry would promote Taiwanese films to audiences in Europe to spread the word regarding the nation's transitional justice efforts and emphasis on human rights issues.

Human rights-related films that won awards at the Taiwan International Human Rights Film Festival would be highlighted, Li said.

The ministry would also continue investigations into sites of injustice and is accepting applications to designate places as areas with transitional justice significance, he said.

The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei hosted part of the film festival, playing Hoklo (also known as Taiwanese)-language films to spread awareness of human rights and Taiwan's embrace of the concept, he said.

For the entire year, the hall has hosted the Flowers of Freedom exhibition, which shows Taiwan's progress from the Martial Law period to the current day, he added.


PROCEDURE: 
                                        Although there is already a cross-strait agreement in place for the extradition of criminals, ample notice is meant to be given to the other side first                                        Ten Taiwanese who were involved in fraud-related crimes in China were extradited back to Taiwan via Kinmen County on Wednesday, four of whom are convicted fraudsters in Taiwan.
The 10 people arrived via a ferry operating between Xiamen and Kinmen, also known as the “small three links.”
The Kinmen County Prosecutors' Office yesterday said that four of the 10 extradited people were convicted in Taiwan for committing fraud and contravening the Money Laundering Control Act (洗錢防制法), and were on the wanted list.
They were immediately arrested upon arrival and sent to Kinmen Prison to serve their sentences following brief questioning, the office said.                                    



                                                                                Taipei and Kaohsiung  have extended an open invitation to Japanese pop star Ayumi Hamasaki after Chinese authorities abruptly canceled  her scheduled concert in Shanghai.
Hamasaki, 47, had been slated to perform on Saturday before organizers pulled the show at the last minute, citing “force majeure,” a move widely viewed as retaliation for Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's recent remark that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could draw a military response from Tokyo.
Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) yesterday said the city “very much welcomes” Hamasaki's return and would continue to “surprise” her.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has previewed proposed changes to the Railway Act (鐵路法) that would fine people for playing on or crossing safety lines on railway platforms.

The amendments are due to the frequency of people falling onto the tracks at railway stations, the ministry said.

Currently, there are penalties for trespassing on the tracks, but there are none for crossing the yellow safety lines on platforms.

The proposed amendments say that crossing a platform safety line, playing on a platform, walking or running against the designated direction on escalators, refusing to heed warnings or other behaviors announced by the railway authorities could result in fines ranging from NT$1,500 to NT$7,500.

The proposed amendments introduce penalties for poeple on high-speed or regular railway trains obstructing the closing of train or platform doors, opening doors without authorization or entering or exiting the station or boarding or disembarking without a valid ticket.

According to the draft amendments, fines could be levied for loitering in a station's passenger hall, mezzanine or platform areas without the intention of boarding, causing obstruction to passenger movement or other activities.

To maintain the safety and order of railway stations and trains, the draft stipulates that if people engage in certain behaviors and refuse to comply after being advised, they could face doubled penalties. 

This includes climbing onto or jumping off a moving train, obstructing the closing of train or platform doors or opening them without authorization and not following the prescribed procedures when entering or exiting the station or boarding or alighting from the train.

Other behaviors subject to penalties include soliciting donations, selling goods, distributing advertisements, setting up stalls, building scaffolding, or arranging banquets inside the train or station area without permission; refusing ticket checks by railway staff; spitting betel nut juice or spit in the train or station area; bringing animals into the station or train without permission or unlawfully occupying or damaging railway property or facilities.

The draft amendments state that if train operators are found to be using drugs, the Railway Bureau is required to revoke their driver's license and prohibit them from operating trains.

A 60-day public announcement period for the preview of the proposed changes began on Friday and after gathering feedback from various sectors, a proposal would be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before forwarding it to the Legislative Yuan.

It is no exaggeration to say that what Japan's Rapidus Corp is trying to do requires the same kind of technical precision and government support as the Apollo missions.

The barely three-year-old state-backed venture aims to leapfrog generations of innovation, vaulting straight into mass production of bleeding-edge 2-nanometer logic chips, the most advanced engines of digital devices — a feat so complex and expensive that just a few chipmakers in the world even dare try it. Attempting the impossible, and requiring a mountain of government funding in the process, give skeptics a lot of ammunition.

If Rapidus pulls it off, however, this attempt could rewrite the history of Japan's tech industry.

Illustration: Louise Ting

Today, the world relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which enjoys a virtual monopoly over the world's most advanced chips. That dominance was not pre-ordained. When founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) reflected on his decision some 15 years ago to go all-in on what was then the cutting edge — 28-nanometer production — he quoted Shakespeare. 

“There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,” the now 94-year-old said in a rare interview earlier this year. “I decided that 28-nanometer was going to be our tide.”

It is easy to opine in retrospect, but it was far from a clear bet at the time. The gamble required TSMC to triple its capital spending, a move that Chang said took convincing the board. Competition back then was still fierce and the fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis sowed uncertainty over demand. TSMC's previous 40-nanometer rollout was beset with yield problems (which refers to how many usable chips come out of production) that threatened ties with one of its most important customers — Nvidia Corp.

It turned out to be one of the defining decisions of TSMC's existence, launching it to its leadership role in the industry. It coincided with the onset of the smartphone boom and an explosion of demand for ever-smaller chips. For Taiwan, the move unlocked a new era of economic legitimacy, raising its “silicon shield.” Over the years, TSMC cleared the field of many of its rivals.

Japan's ambitions are on a grander scale, but it faces its own version of that moment. Doing nothing would be easy. Standing still now would risk missing a fleeting opportunity.

The artificial intelligence and data-center boom has intensified global demand for ultra-advanced processors. The pandemic exposed how easily chip shortages can cripple entire industries. And a phone call from a legendary IBM Corp researcher to the now-chairman of Rapidus offered Japan critical knowledge of the making of 2-nanometer chips, giving it a partnership and intellectual jump-start money alone cannot buy. 

A sliver of opportunity has opened to rebuild the domestic chip ecosystem it lost decades ago. Geopolitical winds are shifting. The diplomatic firestorm between Japan and China over Taiwan has made the government acutely aware of the risk of depending on a place China claims as its own for the world's most strategic technology.

Rapidus still faces towering challenges. One of TSMC's chief advantages is its local supply-chain ecosystem that took decades to build. Japanese firms already make many of the materials required for production, and TSMC's own expansion in Kumamoto, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, underscores its chip manufacturing appeal. Chang himself framed the move as the start of a “renaissance of semiconductors” in the country at an opening ceremony for the TSMC plant last year, suggesting Rapidus could now jump on this bandwagon. Chang's admiration dates back to the 1980s, when he visited a Japanese factory while at Texas Instruments Inc and found yields double those of its US plants.

Talent is one of the hardest gaps to close. Over the next decade, Japan is forecast to be short at least 40,000 semiconductor engineers — part of a global crunch that even Taiwan has not escaped. Even here there are lessons from TSMC: It has responded by creating a deep-rooted pipeline on the island, launching 57 semiconductor programs across 17 local universities, according to SemiAnalysis. Rapidus' partnership with Hokkaido University is a start, but much more needs to be done.

Equally critical for Rapidus' success is winning over the public. TSMC's ascent in making the world's most-advanced chips has become a point of national pride in Taiwan, and many believe, a deterrent against the threat of Chinese expansionism. Citizens and armies of retail investors are cheering for its success. For Rapidus to endure the public scrutiny that accompanies such vast government funding, Tokyo needs to articulate, bluntly and repeatedly, the national security stakes. Making tiny pieces of silicon might not be as glamorous as putting a man on the moon, but the geopolitical payoff is just as real. The more Tokyo can drive home the geopolitical glory of restoring chip manufacturing at home, the more likely it would drive support.

The tide is rising — whether Japan rides it or is swept aside is going to define its technological future for decades. In semiconductor production as in Shakespeare, timing is everything.

Trump signed the Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act into law on Tuesday. Its passing without objection in the US Senate underscores how bipartisan US support for Taiwan has evolved.
The new law would further help normalize exchanges between Taiwanese and US government officials. We have already seen a flurry of visits to Washington earlier this summer, not only with Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍), but also delegations led by National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu                                    



                                                                                When the towers of Wang Fuk Court turned into a seven-building inferno on Wednesday last week, killing 128 people, including a firefighter, Hong Kong officials promised investigations, pledged to review regulations and within hours issued a plan to replace bamboo scaffolding with steel. It sounded decisive. It was not.
The gestures are about political optics, not accountability. The tragedy was not caused by bamboo or by outdated laws. Flame-retardant netting is already required. Under Hong Kong's Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme — which requires buildings more than 30 years old to undergo inspection every decade and compulsory repairs — the framework for                                    



                                                                                President William Lai (賴清德) on Wednesday last week announced a plan to invest an additional NT$1.25 trillion (US$39.8 billion) in military spending to procure advanced defense systems over the next eight years, and outlined two major plans and concrete steps to defend democratic Taiwan in the face of China's intensifying threat.
While Lai's plans for boosting the country's national security have been praised by many US lawmakers, former defense officials, academics and the American Institute in Taiwan, the US' de facto embassy in Taiwan, they were not equally welcomed by all Taiwanese, particularly among the opposition parties.

WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) – The 2026 World Cup will kick off on June 11 with joint-hosts Mexico playing South Africa at the Azteca Stadium – iconic venue of the 1970 and 1986 finals – followed by South Korea against a playoff winner after the complex draw was made on Friday.

Mexico's co-hosts the United States and Canada will join the biggest-ever World Cup party the following day. The U.S., courtesy of their top seeding, got a dream draw and will play Paraguay, Australia and a playoff winner.

Canada, also a top seed despite a world ranking of 27th, have it tougher against a playoff winner – possibly Italy – Switzerland and Qatar.

The draw for the expanded 48-team tournament, with six berths still to be filled via a series of playoffs, was hugely complicated due to various geographical sub-clauses.

Former England defender and MC Rio Ferdinand routinely returned balls to the metaphorical pot after “computer said no'.

Defending champions Argentina were grouped with Algeria, Austria and debutants Jordan, while five-times winners Brazil will play Morocco – semi-finalists in 2022 – Haiti and Scotland.

The Scots are appearing in the finals for the first time since 1998, when they lost to Brazil in the opening game, while Haiti's only previous appearance came in 1974.

France's first game will be versus Senegal in a repeat of one of the biggest tournament upsets, when the Africans stunned the then-holders in their first game of the 2002 tournament. Norway and one of the playoff winners complete their group.

England will start against Croatia, who beat them in the 2018 semi-finals, and also face Panama, who they thrashed 6-1 in the group stage in the same tournament, and Ghana.

Debutants Curacao, with a population of 150,000 making them by far the smallest country ever to reach the finals, face Germany, Ecuador and the Ivory Coast.

World number-one-ranked Spain have a dream draw alongside first-timers Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay.

The Netherlands are with Japan, Tunisia and a playoff winner, Belgium have Egypt, Iran and New Zealand, while Portugal face debutants Uzbekistan, Colombia and a playoff winner.

The teams outside the hosts' groups will have to wait until Saturday to find out the venues and kickoff times for their games after FIFA attempts to optimise them relating to the various worldwide TV markets.

A newly introduced seeding system ensured that the current top four in the world – Spain, Argentina, France and England – cannot meet until the semi-final stage if they win their groups, but that has not ruled out a host of potential blockbuster clashes along the way.

France, runners-up in 2022, might like the look of their group but, if results go to form, once they reach the last 16 they can expect a potential run of Germany, the Netherlands and Spain to reach the final.

England's pathway to the showpiece match has a very Latin – and difficult – look with Mexico, Brazil, who they have never beaten at the World Cup, and Argentina in the way of a first final appearance since their sole triumph in 1966.

Mexico have a favourable group but will be looking beyond that in the hope of at least matching their performance as hosts in 1986 when they reached the quarter-finals.

Since then they suffered a remarkable seven consecutive last-16 exits and then failed to get out of their group in 2022.

“There are no small opponents. We must not get complacent, we have to work hard,” said Mexico coach Javier Aguirre. “We'll be repeating our opening match from 15 years ago and we'll have to be ready.”

The U.S. have a winnable group and their Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino sounded upbeat.

“We need to be strong in our belief, keep improving, thinking big of course and to go and to win the World Cup,” he said. “But before that we need to play and be motivated with these guys that are going to be really tough.”

Remarkably, despite playing each other 106 times, Brazil and Argentina have met in the World Cup knockout stage only once, when the Argentines won 1-0 in the 1990 Round of 16, but they could be on course for a seismic semi-final showdown next year.

OTSU — The world karuta championship, using the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu poetry anthology, was held at Omi Jingu Shrine in Otsu for the first time in six years. Twelve teams from 10 countries and regions, including Japan, Egypt, South Korea and Taiwan, participated in the games.

The tournament was a team competition in which three players from each team competed to collect cards, vying for the most wins. Omi Jingu is considered the “holy ground of karuta” because it enshrines Emperor Tenji (626-671). The poem that was chosen as the opening poem of the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu is believed to be his work.

The final match pitted the Japanese team, composed of three Doshisha University students, against the Thai team. After each team won one game, captain Minori Fujimoto clinched the victory for the Japanese team.

All three Japanese members were fourth-year students, who entered the tournament wanting to create lasting memories.

“It's rare to have the chance to play against people from overseas in Japan,” said vice captain Ayaka Nagatani, who was enjoying interacting with players from the other teams. “It was fun to have them learn about Japan through karuta and talk with them.”

The runner-up Thai team reached the finals for the first time. Thai team captain Memee Dantavornjaroen, who has played karuta for 17 years, said, “I want to aim for victory next time and enjoy karuta with a smile as I'm a Thai person.”

25,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community — thank you.

Ukraine's Air Assault Forces said on Dec. 5 that neither Pokrovsk nor its sister city Myrnohrad are encircled, stressing that defense units are expanding logistics routes and maintaining control over key positions in the area.

Commander Yevhen Lasiichuk of the 7th Corps told the national marathon newscast that in Pokrovsk, the line of contact currently runs ""along the railway,"" with Ukrainian troops retaining full control over the northern part of the city.

He noted that Ukrainian units in central Pokrovsk are actively holding back Russian attempts to advance.

""The situation is more complicated in the southern part,"" Lasiichuk said, adding that Russian forces are attempting to bypass urban fighting by maneuvering around the flanks.

“As of today, there is no encirclement or blockade of Pokrovsk.”

Logistical access to neighboring Myrnohrad has become more difficult, he acknowledged, but movement into the city continues.

“Units continue to enter the settlement and carry out their tasks,” Lasiichuk said.

The fortress city of Pokrovsk has long been one of the most hotly contested areas of the front line, with Ukrainian troops holding off a major Russian assault for a year. 

In recent weeks, Russian troops have closed in, leaving Ukraine in control of an increasingly smaller pocket of the town.

In a nod to the political significance of taking the city, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Dec. 1 of the city's capture, after receiving a report on the latest battlefield situation from his top general, Valery Gerasimov.

While strikes on both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been recorded in the northern low-density residential neighborhoods of Pokrovsk, the front-line contact zone and proper territorial control is difficult to establish.

""Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace. We agreed on the next steps and formats for talks with the United States,"" Zelensky wrote on Dec. 6.

Russia's drone strike caused a fire that burned the outer cladding of the shelter.

 Russia failed to break Ukraine's army on the battlefield, and now it's trying to do it through a peace plan that would cap Ukraine's forces at 600,000. Some argue that Ukraine would shrink its army — currently estimated at about 800,000 — after the war anyway.

Zelensky will also meet with the leaders of France and Germany in the British capital on Monday.

The protective shield built to prevent radiation leaking from the Chornobyl nuclear power plant needs to be repaired promptly after a drone strike earlier this year damaged the steel structure, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Dec. 5. Ukraine has been repairing the massive sarcophagus since the Russian drone strike on Feb. 14. However, following an assessment last week, the IAEA said that the severely damaged structure had ""lost its primary safety functions, including the confinement capability."" While temporary repairs have been carried out, ""timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential""  to ensure Ukraine's long-term nuclear safety,  IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said. Further temporary repair work to the shield will begin next year with support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), clearing the path for its ""full restoration"" post-war. The shield was first installed in 2019 around the destroyed 4th reactor at the plant. Back in April, the then-Environment Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk warned that the sarcophagus had partially lost its functionality and needed to be repaired to prevent leaks. It was designed to enclose the unstable sarcophagus hastily built after the 1986 reactor explosion — the worst nuclear accident in history.

Russia's drone strike caused a fire that burned the outer cladding of the shelter, although it did not cause a spike in radiation levels. Monitoring efforts have been in place, with an IAEA mission permanently located at the plant. ""This is a terrorist threat to the entire world,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the February attack. ""The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today's Russia.""

The Chornobyl plant, located about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv and just 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the border with Belarus, was briefly occupied by Russian forces in the early days of the full-scale invasion.They held the station's staff hostage, creating significant risks to nuclear safety.On Mar. 31, 2022, Russian troops withdrew from the station. Russian troops continue to occupy the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, sparking fears of another nuclear disaster that would have devastating consequences for Ukraine and its neighbors.

A second generation of New Brunswick's McCain clan has rekindled a long-standing family feud over a multibillion-dollar fortune. 

Thirty-one years after brothers Wallace and Harrison McCain fought for control of McCain Foods Ltd. – a battle for the world's largest French fry maker that Harrison won – Wallace's daughter, Eleanor McCain, has kicked off a showdown with her relatives by demanding they buy her out of one of the country's largest privately owned companies. 

Eleanor, a 56-year-old musician who lives in Toronto, recently triggered an agreement that she says requires her siblings, cousins and their offspring to purchase her stake in the holding company that owns McCain Foods.

Based on the value of comparable publicly traded food companies, McCain Foods is worth at least $20-billion and Eleanor's investment could be worth more than $1-billion.

Family control affords six-generation Burnbrae Farms freedom to invest in long-term goals

“Eleanor McCain is seeking to exit her stake in the company co-founded by her father to focus on philanthropy, and for portfolio diversification and estate-planning purposes,” Wojtek Dabrowski, a spokesperson for Ms. McCain, said in a statement.

“Ms. McCain has consistently engaged constructively, in good faith, and would like to conclude this matter in a fair, timely and confidential fashion,” the statement said.

In response, Andy Lloyd, a spokesperson for the family's holding company, said in a statement: McCain Foods “is committed to treating all shareholders fairly, including any shareholder seeking an exit, with a view to balancing the interests of all stakeholders and the long-term interests of the company.” 

Eleanor's relatives have refused her request to cash her out for reasons sources trace back to the 1990s dispute over succession between the co-founders, who both died more than a decade ago. The Globe and Mail is not naming the sources because they are not authorized to speak for the family.

The multiyear contest between Wallace and Harrison McCain, ultimately decided in October, 1994, after 10 weeks of arbitration in a Fredericton courtroom, left wounds that have not healed after 31 years, the sources said. Harrison McCain's offspring are still angry with some of Wallace's children. 

The fight is also rooted in the challenge of setting a value on each family member's stake in McCain Foods, which is growing rapidly as ownership moves into a fourth generation of the founding family, sources say. 

Each side has hired corporate lawyers from firms such as Torys LLP and Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP to sort out what everyone involved describes as a messy relationship, and a family shareholder agreement that is open to interpretation. 

Eleanor McCain argues the stance against a payout is at odds with a previous decision involving her older brother, Michael McCain. He and his father, Wallace, left the family company and took control of Toronto-based Maple Leaf Food Inc. in 1995.

Wallace McCain's family restructured its holdings after the patriarch died in 2011, which resulted in Michael's interest in the holding company falling significantly, sources say, while Eleanor's share increased.

In the early 1990s, Michael McCain was running the family company's U.S. operation. His father's push to designate Michael the next chief executive officer of McCain Foods, succeeding Harrison McCain, sparked the fight for control. 

Michael McCain is now executive chair of Maple Leaf, one of the country's largest packaged protein businesses, and pork producer Canada Packers Inc., spun out of Maple Leaf in October. His stakes in the two companies are worth approximately $1.4-billion. 

Eleanor McCain has never worked at the family company. After earning an undergraduate degree in music at New Brunswick's Mount Allison University, she built a career performing as a singer and released seven albums. She has an adult daughter, Laura. 

Maple Leaf Foods spins off its pork business to focus on high-protein goods

In 2020, Eleanor bought a home near downtown Toronto's High Park with a 2.3 acre lot for $10.6-million. She also owns properties in Peggy's Cove, N.S., and plans to build an art gallery and museum in the tourist town if she can win government approvals.

The McCain clan owns McCain Foods through a holding company. The family controls the holding company's seven-member board of directors, and Eleanor McCain is attempting to sell her stake in this entity. The founders' offspring refer to this as the “baby board.” 

Heirs of Wallace and Harrison McCain – who died in 2004 – each have two seats on the holding company board. Offspring of the other two brothers, Andrew and Robert McCain, each appoint one director and there is one independent director. 

Eleanor McCain has two brothers, Michael and Scott, and a sister, Martha, who focuses on philanthropy. Her 91-year-old mother Margaret, a former lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, is also a significant shareholder in the holding company. On the other side of the family, Harrison McCain and his wife Marion had five children. 

McCain Foods is overseen by a separate, operating company board. The majority of its directors are independent, including the former chief financial officer of Toronto-Dominion Bank and CEO of Goldman Sachs Canada, along with company executives. The two-tier structure, common in European family-owned companies, keeps the food business at arm's length from family disputes. 

Prior to his death in 2004, Harrison McCain created a “thick document” and a two-tier board structure meant to guide the family's affairs, said Eleanor McCain's brother Scott McCain in a 2018 interview with former Globe and Mail reporter Gordon Pitts. The concept is meant to separate the business owned by the family and the “business of the family.” 

“Our family business is potatoes and appetizers and trucking; the business of the family is the family office,” Scott McCain said in the interview. He worked with his father and brother at Maple Leaf until retiring in 2014. 

After leaving Maple Leaf, Scott McCain reconciled with his relatives and he is now chair of the operating company's board. 

Eleanor McCain and her relatives are at odds over a food giant that ranks as one of Canada's few global champions. Founded in the farm town of Florenceville, N.B., in 1957 by four brothers, the company has doubled sales since CEO Max Koeune took the wheel in 2017.

McCain Foods' 22,000 employees now sell $16-billion of frozen potatoes a year, Pizza Pockets and Deep'n Delicious cakes a year in 160 countries. The company owns 54 factories on six continents. It sources potatoes from a network of 3,500 independent farmers, spread across 16 countries. 

McCain Foods started out with four shareholders, all sons of a potato farmer. In 1957, Harrison and Wallace McCain each contributed $30,000 to building a frozen French fry plant and agreed to run the business together. Two older brothers, Robert and Andrew McCain, chipped in $20,000 each to support their siblings.

While McCain Foods is private, other publicly traded companies with comparable sales, such as cheese maker Saputo Inc., cereal producer Kellogg's and chocolatier Hershey Co., are worth between $17-billion and $51-billion. 

McCain Foods' largest publicly traded peer is Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., based in Eagle, Idaho. The Canadian company sells twice as many potatoes each year as its U.S. rival, which has a US$8.3-billion market value. 

In 1995, shortly after the family split, Harrison McCain stepped down as CEO of the company he co-founded and brought in outside leaders with global experience. McCain Foods recruited its current CEO, Mr. Koeune, from French food giant Danone SA. 

Two-thirds of businesses don't have a succession plan. Here's why they should

Family-owned companies that successfully pass control from one generation to the next consistently have clear shareholder agreements that include rules for paying out anyone who wants to exit, according to a study led by Peter Jaskiewicz, chair in family enterprise at the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa.

The two key elements of these family agreements are how they deal with ownership and leadership across generations, according to Dr. Jaskiewicz, who chose to study the dynamics of private companies after his parents' family business failed to navigate succession issues. In Europe and Asia, his study showed there are multiple examples of successful 20-plus generation family companies, with thousands of shareholders, all guided by written contracts. 

Some of the world's wealthiest families are multigeneration owners of food business. Their ranks include the Mars family, whose 114-year-old candy and pet food empire is worth more than US$100-billion, and the Cargill-MacMillan clan, whose stake in agriculture company Cargill Inc., founded in 1865, is valued at US$61-billion.

U.S. President Donald Trump, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Prime Minister Mark Carney during the 2026 World draw.STEPHANIE SCARBROUGH/Reuters

Mark Carney turned on the charm with Donald Trump at the FIFA World Cup draw as he engaged in frequent banter throughout the event, hunkered down for a 45-minute meeting afterward and drew plaudits for Canada's “friendship” from the famously mercurial U.S. President. 

The Prime Minister, who is hoping to persuade Mr. Trump not to pull his country out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and to negotiate an end to his punishing tariffs, jetted down to Washington Friday to catch the President on a day when he would be in a particularly good mood.

At the FIFA draw, Mr. Trump received a peace prize created especially for him, bragged about the World Cup's ticket sales and was serenaded by the Village People and Andrea Bocelli, two of his favourite musical acts. Wayne Gretzky, a favourite Canadian of the President's, also played a key role in the proceedings.

Opinion: Gretzky gave us a spectacle of meme-able proportions at the World Cup draw

Mr. Carney, Mr. Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whose countries are co-hosting next summer's soccer tournament, sat next to each other for most of the event, which unfolded at the Kennedy Center. The trio smiled and chatted throughout, with Mr. Carney occasionally leaning across Ms. Sheinbaum – who sat in the middle – to get closer to Mr. Trump.

Later, the three retreated to a private room without staff for a more-in-depth tête-à-tête. Audrey Champoux, Mr. Carney's spokesperson, said that in the meeting, the leaders “agreed to keep working together” on USMCA.

Both Canada and Mexico are fighting to preserve the trade pact, which Mr. Trump has mused about quitting when it comes up for review next year, and trying to negotiate an end to the U.S. President's tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and other goods.

In hearings on the future of the USMCA, business leaders call on Trump to drop tariffs

Mr. Trump broke off negotiations with Canada on tariffs in October because of a pro-free-trade ad aired in the U.S. by the Ontario government.

In his acceptance speech for the FIFA Peace Prize, Mr. Trump was laudatory of his World Cup co-hosts.

“We've had a tremendous relationship, working relationship, with Canada,” he said, before introducing Mr. Carney and Ms. Sheinbaum. “The co-ordination and friendship and relationship has been outstanding and I want to thank you both very much and your countries very much.”

FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who created the peace prize barely a month ago, presented Mr. Trump with a trophy consisting of a gold-looking globe held up by disembodied hands.

“There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go,” Mr. Infantino said, as Mr. Trump promptly placed the medallion around his neck. The President praised Mr. Infantino for “setting new records on ticket sales” and boasted that the U.S. is “the hottest country anywhere in the world.”

Twenty-nine ways Trump has changed Canada

The audience, largely consisting of FIFA dignitaries, reacted with only a smattering of applause. Mr. Infantino's courtship of Mr. Trump has been contentious, with critics charging that it goes far beyond maintaining good relations with a host country and veers into the territory of endorsing his controversial policy agenda. 

Mr. Gretzky, another figure who has taken flak for his close relationship with Mr. Trump, served as one of four sports personalities to perform the draw itself, alongside former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, NFL legend Tom Brady and New York Yankee slugger Aaron Judge.

The former Edmonton Oiler great, who wore a Maple Leaf pin, has golfed with Mr. Trump and hung out at Mar-a-Lago this year, even as the President threatened to annex Canada as the U.S.'s “51st state” and encouraged Mr. Gretzky to run for “governor.”

On Friday, Mr. Gretzky mostly attracted attention on social media for mispronouncing the names of various countries in the draw, rendering Curaçao as “Curocko,” for instance.

In his brief public comments, Mr. Carney lauded Canada's multicultural diversity, which Mr. Trump's own Vice-President, JD Vance, criticized last month as “immigration insanity” leading to a “stagnating country.”

Mexico has jumped past Canada to become the U.S.'s top customer

“There's more than 200 nationalities in Canada, more than 200 nationalities in FIFA, the top 48 are coming to North America,” Mr. Carney said, referring to the countries qualifying for the tournament.

Ms. Sheinbaum, meanwhile, made a point of championing Mexico's “extraordinary, hard-working people.” Mr. Trump frequently portrays Mexican migrants as violent criminals to justify his crackdown on immigration.

If such comments from the Canadian and Mexican leaders were intended as statements of principle, they were oblique. While neither Mr. Carney nor Ms. Sheinbaum has worked to woo Mr. Trump the way Mr. Infantino has, they have been studiously careful to maintain a chummy rapport, lest they be hit with even more tariffs.

During the event's conclusion, as the Village People performed Y.M.C.A. and Mr. Trump stood up to perform his signature dance moves, Mr. Carney and Ms. Sheinbaum remained seated, engrossed in conversation. Only at the very end did Mr. Carney get to his feet to applaud as FIFA dignitaries turned to snap photos of Mr. Trump.

Also attending the event on the Canadian side were Mr. Carney's wife, Diana Fox Carney, Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., and several of Mr. Carney's aides.

After the event, Mr. Carney met with the pro-free-trade U.S. Chamber of Commerce and attended a Christmas-tree lighting ceremony at the Canadian embassy before flying back to Ottawa.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","New discovery: The 'sacred boundary' surrounding Stonehenge","https://www.dw.com/en/new-discovery-the-sacred-boundary-surrounding-stonehenge/a-75039682","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 12:37:56 GMT","

Long thought to be an assortment of mysterious holes near Stonehenge, researchers have now used new technologies to better understand the culture that dug a circle of ditches around the monument in southern England.

Some 4,500 years ago, people dug a series of deep, wide pits in the area near Durrington Walls in southern England. They were gemometrically arranged, forming a 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) wide circle that enclosed over three square kilometers (1.16 square miles).

Long mistaken for naturally occuring features, the circle of human-made shafts has now come to be understood as a colossal project that lends new dimensions to the Stonehenge landscape.

Durrington Walls is just a stone's throw from the small English town of Amesbury, and just three kilometers, or about half an hour on foot, from Stonehenge. Each pit or shaft is approximately 10 meters (32.8 feet) wide and 5 meters deep.

Of the 20 pits discovered so far, a new study suggests that at least 15 form a huge, even circle around the henge of Durrington Walls. A henge is a type of prehistoric earthwork consisting of a ring-shaped bank, fortified with an inward ditch, encircling a flat circular area.

They were likely used for ceremonial purposes, to congregate or perform rituals. At the center of Durrington Walls used to be a circular structure of wooden posts, driven deep into the ground and surrounded by a settlement.

The pits were discovered years ago, but the newest research is just now uncovering more details, and providing deeper understanding. Scientists have now been able to date the structure to about 2480 BCE using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).

The OSL method is a fairly precise way of pinpointing a sediment's last exposure to light — and by extension, the last time it was covered or buried — by measuring the natural radiation captured in certain minerals like quartz and feldspar. This technique relies heavily on the quality of the sample and has a margin of error of about 5-10%.

The recent study shows that the circular structure did not accidentally form over centuries, but was the result of intentional efforts in a planned, momunental project. The pits were actively used as part of the cultural landscape — and traces of humans, plants and animals indicate deliberate coordination.

None of the shafts examined can be attributed to natural erosion of the chalky landscape — the pits' sheer size and number clearly suggest they were dug by humans. They form a near-perfect circle, and are spaced at even intervals. The width and distance of the pits follow a clear pattern.

This means that the humans involved were able to mark distances, count steps or measurements, and work out a coordinated plan — all before they started digging. And so, what at first glance seemed like an assortment of strange holes became a rare testament to the fact that numbers, measurements, and large-scale planning were already part of the daily lives of Neolithic people living in the area.

The authors of the recent study believe this mathematical design directly related to people's beliefs about the world at the time. The researchers suggest that each pit marks not only a point in the circle, but also a symbolically lowered space — a kind of underworld — to deposit animals, sacrificial offerings and cult objects.

Archeologists interpret the ring of shafts as a kind of ""sacred boundary"" marking the area around Stonehenge and Durrington Walls. It could have been used to guide peoples' movements — or even entire processions.

Visitors looking out over the flat plain today cannot make out this boundary.

Neither Durrington Walls nor Stonehenge are isolated structures. They belong to a network of Neolithic monuments spanning the British Isles, from the stone circles and circular ditches of Salisbury Plains to other henge formations with pits and ditches as far as Ireland and Scotland — and further still.

Similar discoveries show that around 2700 BCE and 2200 BCE, prehistoric groups from southern Britain, northern Europe, central Germany and the Iberian peninsula were in active exchange. 

What's known as the bell-beaker culture, with its eponymous bell-shaped ceramic vessels, even established a transregional network of trade and exchange, as the archeologist Franziska Knoll of the State Office for Heritage Management and Archeology Saxony-Anhalt told DW.

Knoll has been investigating the circular sanctuary of Pömmelte just south of Madgeburg in central Germany. Here, too, are circular structures that echo those of Durrington Walls — although, at just 2 meters deep, they do not match the scale — with cattle bones, ceramics, stone axes and other objects intentionally deposited within.

The pits in Durrington Walls will not be excavated in the near future for financial reasons. But Knoll hopes to soon find out what exactly was deposited in the British shafts. Although she was not involved in the present study, she says she's like to learn more about when exactly the pits were dug.

Talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Miami will continue, the State Department said. Separately, European leaders discussed the use of frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine. DW has more.

This blog is now closed. Below is a roundup of the latest developments on Russia's war in Ukraine on December 5, 2025:

Ukrainian and US officials are set to hold the third straight day of talks in Florida once again on Saturday. We'll have the latest in a new blog.

A Ukrainian drone struck a high-rise building in the Chechen city of Grozny on Friday, damaging multiple floors of a skyscraper that houses government and business offices.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said on Telegram that nobody had been injured in the attack and described the strike as making ""no tactical sense.""

He accused Ukraine of attempting to intimidate civilians and vowed that a Russian response ""will not be long coming,"" before later adding Ukrainian forces would ""feel a stern response"" within the next week.

The drone hit part of the Grozny City complex, a landmark tower opened in 2011 and home to several regional offices, including the Chechen security council.

Local reports said Kadyrov's residence and an FSB branch are located nearby. Videos showed smoke rising from the building and shattered windows across several floors.

Ukraine has previously targeted sites in Chechnya, including a police barracks and a military training academy, but strikes on central Grozny are rare. The region's airport was briefly closed earlier on Friday due to security concerns.

EU leaders held talks in Brussels on Friday on a plan to use frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine, aiming for an agreement by December 18 when they will meet at a summit.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, whose approval remains key.

Merz sought to reassure Belgium that the risks of unlocking the assets would be shared equally across EU member states.

""Belgium's particular vulnerability regarding the use of frozen Russian assets is undeniable and must be addressed in any conceivable solution in such a way that all European countries bear the same risk,"" Merz said, according to a German government spokesperson. 

Von der Leyen said ""time is of the essence given the current geopolitical situation"" and confirmed that the three sides agreed to continue talks in hopes of reaching a consensus.

The European Commission has proposed raising €90 billion ($105 billion) for Ukraine through a loan backed by frozen Russian central bank assets, worth around €210 billion in total. The funds would help cover Ukraine's financial needs in 2026–27 and repay earlier EU loans.

Belgium, which holds most of the assets through the international deposit organization Euroclear, has raised legal concerns and has not endorsed the plan.

The US State Department signalled ""constructive discussions"" on a Ukraine peace plan after Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trumo's son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Ukrainian security chief Rustem Umerov in Miami on Friday.

The talks, which began on Thursday, will continue again on Saturday, the State Department said.

During the meeting both delegations reviewed results of recent American discussions with Russian officials, as they talked through steps that could help bring the war closer to an end

Umerov said that Ukraine remains focused on a settlement that protects its independence and sovereignty and ensures security for Ukrainian citizens.

""Both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward deescalation and cessation of killings,"" the State Department said in a statement. 

American and Ukrainian officials also looked at plans for Ukraine's post-war rebuilding, joint economic initiatives, and long-term recovery projects.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has removed his former chief of staff Andriy Yermak from the National Security Council.

The move came as a sprawling corruption investigation continues to rock Kyiv.

Yermak has also lost his place as a member of the Stavka, which is the high command of Ukraine's armed forces, according to two presidential decrees that were published on Friday. 

Having been a long-standing ally of the president, Yermak stepped down as Zelenskyy's chief of staff last week following anti-corruption authorities conducting searches at his premises.

It is not yet been clarified if those raids are linked to a corruption affair that involves alleged bribes in energy-related procurement.

Yermak had headed the presidential office since February 2020 and was considered by some to be the second most powerful man in Ukraine, with his depature seen as a big blow to Zelenskyy.

Russia has placed one of its few remaining anti-war politicians in pretrial detention.

The decision came shortly before he was due to be released from house arrest.

Lev Shlosberg, a prominent opposition politician from the Yabloko party, was ordered jailed until February on new charges of spreading false information about the army.

Under house arrest since June for allegedly discrediting the military, Shlosberg denies the charges in what is now the third case against him.

Rights groups say Shlosberg is a victim of so-called ""carousel"" arrests, where multiple charges keep critics in custody.

Yabloko, Russia's only registered party opposing the war in Ukraine, says other top members also face charges.

Fresh talks were scheduled to take place in Miami, Florida, between Ukrainian representatives and US officials.

It comes a day after President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, briefed Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov about his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow earlier this week.

""Another meeting is expected today,"" Oleksandr Bevz, an adviser in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said without giving further details.

Putin told Witkoff at Tuesday's meeting that some of the points in a US-backed plan to end the war in Ukraine were unacceptable to him. 

Irish police are investigating reports of unidentified drones spotted as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's plane landed in Dublin earlier this week.

An Irish Navy vessel spotted several military-style drones near the flight path of Zelenskyy's plane as he arrived in Ireland for a state visit on Monday.

The ""special detective Unit (SDU) is investigating this matter. As part of this, SDU will be liaising with the Defence Forces and international security partners,"" police said 

Europe has faced a surge in drone activity over airports and sensitive sites, with recent incidents in Germany, France, Belgium, and Britain.

Poland reported shooting down three Russian drones in September, a claim Moscow denies.

Russian drones struck a house in central Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, killing a 12-year-old boy, Ukrainian officials said Friday.

Two women were injured in the strike on Thursday night, which destroyed the house, the head of the regional military administration, Vladylsav Haivanenko, said.

Ukraine's air force said Russia had fired 137 drones overnight. In a statement, it said 80 drones had been intercepted, with 57 striking 13 locations across the country.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones struck a port in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar.

Russian officials confirmed the strike, saying it sparked a fire and damaged infrastructure at the port in Temryuk on the Sea of Azov.

Port workers were evacuated, and no injuries were reported, according to the Russian TASS news agency.

Ukraine also launched a drone strike on the city of Syzran, on the Volga River, the local mayor said.

Unconfirmed reports in Ukrainian media said the drones had struck an oil refinery in Syzran, starting a fire.

Russia's defense ministry said 85 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted overnight over Russia and Crimea.

Russia's presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would continue its war in Ukraine if Kyiv does not agree to a peace deal on Moscow's terms.

Russia is insisting that Ukraine cede large parts of its territory in the eastern Donbas region, much of which is occupied by Russian forces.

Peskov pointed out that Russian troops were gaining ground in eastern Ukraine — a claim Ukraine and its European partners contest. 

""Therefore, if we are unable to resolve the problem and achieve our goals through peaceful means, we will continue the [Special Military Operation] and do everything necessary to protect our interests,"" the spokesman said.

Peskov's statement comes amid a renewed push for diplomacy between officials from Europe, Ukraine, the US and Russia in recent days.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who was visiting China on Friday, has called for more pressure to be applied on Russia to bring about an end to its war in Ukraine.

Macron, who met with China's President Xi Jinping during his state visit, told reporters that ""unity between Americans and Europeans on the Ukrainian issue is essential.""

The French leader added that the US, Europe and Ukraine ""need to work together.""

Macron also said he welcomes and supports US efforts at securing a peace deal, but he pointed out that Washington ""needs Europeans to lead these peace efforts.""

A report in German weekly Der Spiegel on Thursday said Macron had warned Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conference call with other European leaders that the US could ""betray"" Kyiv during its talks with Moscow.

The report also said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had voiced skepticism of the US' intentions, warning that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were ""playing games, both with you and with us.""

Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said Friday he believes Washington and Moscow are ""making progress"" in talks to end the war in Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin met with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner at the Kremlin on Tuesday.

According to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti, Ushakov said Russia is ""ready to continue working with this American team.""

At the Kremlin meeting on Tuesday, Ushakov said the issues discussed were based on ""key understandings that were reached in Anchorage,"" when Trump hosted Putin in Alaska.

Ushakov also said another summit between the US and Russian presidents ""could happen,"" when he was asked by a Russian television reporter about whether a meeting would take place in the near future.

While the diplomatic push for peace in Ukraine continues apace, fighting on the front in eastern Ukraine is showing no signs of relenting.

Russia claims it has occupied the key strategic city of Pokrovsk as well as Vovchansk in Donetsk region. Kyiv and its Western partners deny the claims, accusing Russia of propaganda.

How is the situation in Pokrovks developing and what are the dangers for the nearby city of Myrnohrad?

Vladimir Putin is in India on Friday, meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Putin is in New Delhi to shore up Russia's relations with the South Asian giant, particularly in trade, security and energy.

Despite Western sanctions and pressure, India has continued to purchase Russian oil and gas, which are crucial for Moscow's war effort.

According to Russian state news agency TASS, Putin has briefed Modi on the situation in Ukraine.

Friedrich Merz has said that Berlin is aware of the Belgian government's concerns over leveraging frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine, as proposed by the European Commission on Wednesday.

While Merz said he ""takes them seriously,"" he is expected to try to convince Belgium PM Bart de Wever ""that the path we are proposing here is the right one.""

So, what are Russia's frozen assets, and why is Belgium resisting the European Commission's plan?

In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, nearly €300 billion ($347 billion) of its assets outside Russia were frozen as a result of Western sanctions

These assets include bank accounts, securities, real estate and yachts

The biggest chunk of the assets lies in EU member countries, and the largest of all in Belgium

Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial depository, holds roughly €180 billion in frozen Russian assets

Belgium is concerned about the legality of using the assets to fund Ukraine

Brussels has so far refused to approve the plan amid fears of legal consequences and retaliation from Russia

Belgium's Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot has said it is ""not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone to face the risks""

Senator Flavio Bolsonaro declared himself heir to his father's political dynasty, saying he'll run for president in 2026.

Flavio Bolsonaro, the eldest son of Brazil's jailed former President Jair Bolsonaro, said his father has chosen him to lead his far-right Liberal Party and run for president in next year's election.

""It is with great responsibility that I confirm the decision of Brazil's greatest political and moral leader, Jair Messias Bolsonaro, to entrust me with the mission of continuing our national project,"" the younger Bolsonaro wrote on X on Friday.

His father was sentenced in September to a 27-year prison term for planning a coup after losing the 2022 presidential election to current leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

Flavio Bolsonaro was elected to Brazil's senate in 2018 for an eight-year term after previously serving as a state legislator in Rio de Janeiro.

He is considered extreme on law-and-order issues, having even requested US airstrikes on boats in Rio de Janeiro to combat drug trafficking.

In his social media announcement, which included a picture of him kissing his father on the head, Bolsonaro said he ""will not stand idle while families lose hope and democracy is crumbling.""

Bolsonaro was previously accused of embezzling public funds tied to his family's political offices. Prosecutors brought charges, but the courts dismissed the case.

He has maintained his innocence throughout.

His announcement on Friday makes him an instant contender to challenge Lula in next year's election.

""Flavio told me our captain [Jair Bolsonaro] confirmed his pre-candidacy. If Bolsonaro said so, that's all there is to it!"" Liberal Party president Valdemar Costa Neto said.

“We're talking about significant volumes of Canadian weapons fueled into contexts of genocide,” a rights activist said.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has hailed a new economic deal with the United Arab Emirates as a way to “attract billions of dollars in investments into Canada.”

The $50 billion agreement — $70-billion in Canadian dollars — was announced as Carney travelled to Abu Dhabi in November for talks with Emirati leaders, and comes as Canada attempts to diversify its economic partners as it contends with effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

“We're building big things, and the UAE wants to build with us,” the Canadian leader said in a social media post about the pact.

Yet back in Canada, human rights advocates and legal experts have condemned the Canadian government for deepening ties to the UAE as it stands accused of fueling mass atrocities in Sudan.

They say Carney's visit to the powerful Gulf nation is especially galling given the emergence of new reports about Canadian-made weapons being used by a Sudanese paramilitary group accused of committing “the gravest of crimes” in the war-torn Darfur region — with UAE support.

“Carney is selling out our principles — including Canada's commitment to the basic rules of international law and to human rights — to make money,” said Mark Kersten, an assistant professor specializing in international law at University of the Fraser Valley.

“With troubling success, the prime minister is showing that the chance of economic prosperity in Canada and diversifying trade partners comes at the cost of caring for the very lives of others,” Kersten told Truthout in an email.

Carney's November trip to the UAE — the first by a Canadian prime minister since 1983 — came just weeks after the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized control of North Darfur's capital, el-Fasher.

The United Nations and the world's leading human rights groups have accused RSF fighters of committing massacres against civilians in their takeover of the city.

Displaced residents have said they saw dead bodies lining the streets as they fled el-Fasher, and there have been multiple reports of widespread rape and sexual violence, kidnappings, and extortion.

Human rights advocates and legal experts have condemned the Canadian government for deepening ties to the UAE as it stands accused of fueling mass atrocities in Sudan.

Researchers in the United States have said satellite imagery indicates the RSF is digging mass graves to bury bodies.

While the UAE vehemently denies backing the RSF, UN experts and human rights groups have said the country has provided military support to the group.

Earlier this year, media outlets reported on a leaked document written by a panel of UN experts that said cargo flights were routinely bringing weapons from the UAE to Chad. The arms were then smuggled across the border into Sudan for use by the RSF.

The experts said “the cargo flights from airports in the UAE to Chad were so regular that, in effect, they had created a ‘new regional air bridge,'” The Guardian reported.

U.S. lawmakers also have acknowledged the UAE's role in fueling the war in Sudan, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying during his Senate confirmation hearing in January that the country was “openly supporting an entity that is carrying out a genocide.”

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen also recently urged Washington to stop sending weapons to its Gulf ally amid the atrocities in el-Fasher.

“In January of this year, the Biden administration confirmed to me directly that the UAE was providing material support to the RSF, even though the UAE had assured the United States that it wasn't and that it wouldn't,” Van Hollen said during a Senate speech last month.

Meanwhile, in May, Amnesty International said “sophisticated Chinese weaponry” that was re-exported by the UAE was captured in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, as well as used in Darfur.

“The presence of recently manufactured Chinese bombs in North Darfur is a clear violation of the arms embargo by the UAE,” Brian Castner, Amnesty's head of crisis research, said in a statement at the time.

“Our documentation of AH-4 howitzers in Khartoum further strengthens a growing body of evidence showing extensive UAE support to the RSF, in violation of international law.”

In early November, Canadian public broadcaster CBC News verified photographs showing rifles manufactured by a Canada-based company in the hands of RSF fighters in Sudan.

The RSF has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces for control of Sudan since April 2023, and was accused of committing crimes against humanity long before its takeover of el-Fasher.

That includes “persecution on ethnic grounds, forced displacement and contributing to extermination,” according to a UN Human Rights Council report from September.

In 2024, Canadian exports of military goods and technology to the UAE totalled just over $5 million ($7 million in Canadian dollars), according to government records.

Yet despite the relatively small sum, rights groups say any amount of weapons that could be funneled into the conflict in Sudan is too many.

In early November, Canadian public broadcaster CBC News verified photographs showing rifles manufactured by a Canada-based company in the hands of RSF fighters in Sudan. CBC News said it was not immediately clear how the rifles ended up with the paramilitary group but noted that experts have detailed past diversions by the UAE.

Rights groups also have documented that armored vehicles produced by the STREIT Group, a Canadian-owned company whose main manufacturing facility is in the UAE, have also been used by the RSF in the war.

The company — one of the largest armored vehicle manufacturers in the world — has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Yet both cases are an apparent violation of a UN arms embargo on Sudan that was put in place more than two decades ago to try to prevent ethnic cleansing and other atrocities in Darfur. The RSF grew out of the Janjaweed, an Arab militia aligned with former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, which was a main target of that 2004 arms embargo.

In addition to the UN arms embargo, Canada is a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), a pact that regulates and sets conditions for the global flow of arms.

The ATT bans signatories from transferring weapons to another country if there is a plausible risk they could be used in violations of international humanitarian law, such as war crimes.

Asked to comment on reports that Canadian weapons are being used by the RSF in Sudan, Global Affairs Canada — the foreign affairs ministry — pointed to the UN arms embargo on the country.

“This prohibits any person in Canada or any Canadian outside Canada from knowingly exporting arms and related material, wherever situated, to Sudan or to any person in Sudan,” a spokesperson said in an email.

The UN Genocide Convention imposes an obligation on signatories — such as Canada — to prevent genocide whenever a risk of such violence exists.

But the department did not comment on Truthout's specific questions on whether it is reviewing any Canadian companies whose weapons have been reported in the hands of RSF fighters.

It also did not answer questions about whether it plans to suspend any existing or future arms export permits to the UAE over its support for the RSF and concerns that weapons may be reaching the paramilitary group via the Gulf country.

Global Affairs Canada said it has a “robust risk assessment framework” to evaluate weapons export or brokering permit applications.

“Canada has made no exceptions to this legal requirement,” the spokesperson said. “If these laws are violated, we will ensure those responsible face legal consequences that could include fines, seizure of goods and criminal prosecution.”

Separately, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said late last month that she was “very seriously” looking into the reports of Canadian weapons being used by the RSF.

“No Canadian companies are permitted to export arms to Sudan directly or through third countries,” Anand told The Globe and Mail.

But the legal experts who spoke to Truthout said reports about Canadian-made weapons ending up in Sudan go back years — and action is long overdue.

“We've seen vehicles produced by STREIT appearing in places where they shouldn't be for over a decade now, including in Sudan,” said Kelsey Gallagher, a researcher at anti-war group Project Ploughshares.

The STREIT Group did not respond to Truthout's request for comment.

Gallagher acknowledged that the armored vehicles reportedly used by the RSF in Sudan almost certainly were not manufactured in Canada. But he said STREIT Group nevertheless remains “a company with a Canadian footprint.”

“The fact that Canadian-made weapons systems are permeating what has been described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis would contradict the notion that Canada has the strongest arms control regime in the world,” Gallagher told Truthout.

“Clearly something has broken down here, something has gone wrong.”

Canada must do more to strengthen its arms export regime, including putting more robust systems in place to oversee how Canadian weapons are ultimately being used, Gallagher said.

This sentiment was echoed by Kersten at University of the Fraser Valley, who said that even if weapons are manufactured abroad, there are steps that the Canadian government can take.

“The evidence is that we're talking about significant volumes of Canadian weapons fueled into contexts of genocide, both in Gaza and in Sudan.”

“Canada can still prosecute Canadian citizens if they encourage or provide material support for the commission of international crimes — war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.”

The UN Genocide Convention also imposes an obligation on signatories — such as Canada — to prevent genocide whenever a risk of such violence exists.

“Given the dynamics of the violence, it would be implausible to argue that there is no risk of genocide in Darfur,” Kersten said.

“As a result, Canada is under an obligation to act to prevent [genocide] and one, very obvious way to achieve that is to stop any weapons from being sold in [Canada] or by Canadians to entities like the RSF.”

Michael Bueckert, vice president of advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, is not optimistic that Canada will take real action, however.

Instead, Bueckert said Carney and his government have signaled that they are prioritizing “corporate profits over human rights” around the world.

The prime minister — who took office after winning elections in April — has sought to grow trade relationships with a range of countries amid fraught U.S.-Canada ties.

That includes India, which just last year was accused by Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, of being involved in the killing of a Canadian Sikh activist on Canadian soil.

The Canadian government has also been accused of misleading the public by allowing weapons to be sent to Israel amid the country's genocide of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, despite a promise to halt such transfers.

“The evidence is that we're talking about significant volumes of Canadian weapons fueled into contexts of genocide, both in Gaza and in Sudan,” Bueckert told Truthout.

“There are things that Canada should be doing — that it can do — to make sure that it acts on this risk” of Canadian-made weapons reaching Sudan, he added.

“But so far, we've seen the smallest amount of lip service that the Canadian government can get away with and no real indication that they're going to be taking action,” Bueckert said. “Clearly, Canada wants to put a lot of emphasis on a strategic economic partnership with the UAE and that's the most important thing.”

Incarcerated Californians are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis — and the state's water restrictions.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

As droughts, extreme heat, and other climate disasters increasingly plague California, people throughout the state have been subject to water restrictions. For many Californians, this means emergency regulations like limitations on lawn watering. But one group of people has been forced to bear the brunt of the state's water restrictions: those in prison.

People in California prisons already face an acute vulnerability to extreme heat and cold, wildfires, droughts, and flooding. While steps have been taken in recent years to protect the safety of incarcerated people in California during climate hazards, the lack of state funding, data, and preparation — paired with overincarceration — continue to pose a fatal threat to their health and livelihoods.

And despite this increased vulnerability, incarcerated Californians have been forced for years to heavily limit their water use, including through restricted shower access, limited toilet flushing, and other extreme measures that people living outside prison walls would never be expected to endure.

This climate-related suffering is amplified by overcrowding, a longstanding problem in California prisons. San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, for instance, which opened in 1852 with 68 occupants, grew dangerously overcrowded within six years: By 1858, it housed over 500 people in just 62 cells. San Quentin is now home to almost 4,000 people.

In 2006, California's prison population hit a peak of 174,000 — 200 percent of the system's design capacity of 85,000 people — exceeding all other states' prison populations and prompting Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a state of emergency. That same year, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) was placed under a federal receivership due to the poor quality of medical care revealed in a 2001 class action lawsuit. By 2006, the federal court had taken over management of CDCR's health care departments due to poor quality of care and rising disease and death rates.

As the state continued to deal with overcrowding and abysmal medical care in its prisons, California experienced a historic drought in 2009, prompting Gov. Schwarzenegger to declare a drought emergency. NBC News reported at that time that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger encouraged urban water agencies to reduce water use by 20 percent and that the governor added that mandatory conservation was likely if the reduction was insufficient.

Although 80 percent of California's developed water goes to agriculture, CDCR responded to the emergency by creating a water conservation plan. The department issued an order limiting the number of showers for incarcerated individuals to three per week: Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Many showers were equipped with shutoff valves controllable by officers who would turn them off after five minutes. Regardless of the weather or the activities a person had done that day (exercising out in the yard, for example), showers could only be taken during the designated times. Only those with certain jobs — such as those who worked in the prison's kitchen, construction, or maintenance departments — were allowed to shower daily.

Throughout California prisons, outdoor showers were condemned, water hoses in kitchen areas discontinued, and garbage disposal usage ceased. Numerous drinking fountains were turned off, and ice machine access was limited to the minimal amount needed to comply with the “heat plan” for at-risk prisoners. Laundry services were reduced to once a week. 

Even before the 2009 drought emergency and subsequent water conservation plan, CDCR had taken steps to limit water use in its facilities. Between 2006 and 2008, CDCR installed over 45,800 “flushometers,” devices that limit the number of times a toilet may be flushed in a designated period. Two flushes every five minutes soon became standard for California's incarcerated population, who, confined to small, cramped, double-cell housing, were forced to live with the smell of their own waste.

Showers in prisons are often offered after breakfast, a time that conflicts with going to the yard to exercise, leaving people forced to choose between one or the other. If you miss the shower window and try to take one later in the day, an officer will likely issue a rules violation report (RVR), which can impact a parole hearing for people serving life sentences. One incarcerated person, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisal from members of the Board of Parole Hearings, told Truthout that he was denied his parole date for three years and instructed to enroll in a criminal thinking class for taking a shower at the “wrong” time.

Michael Moore, who is also incarcerated at San Quentin, said he received an RVR Counseling Chrono, which is similar to a citation or ticket detailing misbehavior, for showering at the wrong time. Moore said he works out frequently and needs a shower every day. Many incarcerated people report that they find ways to shower outside their allotted shower time, such as standing under dripping water from broken shower heads, or filling up buckets with sink water and taking a bird bath in the shower. These actions, too, are frowned upon by correctional officers, and can result in RVRs. 

In one instance, Moore received a report from a correctional officer that read: “On Saturday April 30, 2022 … at approximately 10:15 hours, I announced via public address intercom to the entire unit and gave a direct order: ‘unit lockup, go to the yard, go to your assigned cell, no dayroom and MEDICAL SHOWERS ONLY.' I repeated this twice to ensure the entire unit understood. Approximately five minutes later, I observed inmate Moore in the shower area disobeying the order that had been given for Unit lockup…”

Moore, who is serving a life sentence, will undoubtedly have to address this issue at future parole hearings. 

Yet while CDCR has been quick to limit human water consumption, the department has done little to fix busted water mains, running shower heads, and leaky sinks at dilapidated facilities. And its poor water management does little to help when overcrowding and inadequate health care services coincide to allow disease outbreaks, including norovirus,scabies, flu, and tuberculosis. A Legionnaires' disease scare took place at San Quentin in 2015 and 2016, and chicken pox has caused issues in various California prisons. 

But nothing was more dangerous than when COVID came barreling through prisons and cell doors were slammed shut. COVID exacerbated the preexisting uncleanliness and lack of fresh air flow inside the housing units at San Quentin. Yet prison officials rejected help from the Public Health Department in Marin and ignored the advice of infectious disease experts from the University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco. San Quentin did not accept personal protective equipment offers or follow instructions on how to properly keep the premises clean. 

Yet even during the spread of sickness and death, the prison remained focused on limiting water usage, forcing people to go days and weeks without showers. The combination of these conditions, water limitations, and COVID resulted in one of the worst epidemiological disasters in prison history: over 2,000 COVID infections and 29 deaths.

Incarcerated people at San Quentin at the time said that correctional staff showed little sympathy, even as people were dying. Many officers repeated the mantra: “If you don't like what's happening, you shouldn't have come to prison.”

The United States Supreme Court recognizes an incarcerated person's right to certain basic human needs, as protected by the Eighth Amendment, which includes access to yard exercise and a shower.

On October 8, 2023, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 353 into law, ensuring incarcerated people's constitutional right to shower at least every other day, unless there is a written reason for denial.

“All human beings have a right to ensure good hygiene, regardless of their status in society. It is immoral, inhumane, and cruel to deprive someone of their right to shower,” the bill's author, then-Assembly Member Reggie-Jones Sawyer, wrote in support of the legislation. “In spite of this, reports from persons housed at CDCR prisons shine a light on the abuses that are being committed against them. AB 353 seeks to rectify one of those by spelling out in law an incarcerated person's right to shower and uphold proper hygiene.

“Those detained at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) facilities have reported limited access to showers, a basic human right,” said Initiate Justice, a nonprofit prison advocacy group, in a comment on the bill. “As a result, incarcerated individuals can go up to a week without taking a shower, essentially forced to sit in the stench of their body odor and musty clothes. This is not only inhumane but also very unsanitary,” they said.

Los Angeles District Attorney, George Gascon, supported AB 353 as well, asking: 

“How we can expect positive outcomes from individuals released from prison if basic human rights and human dignities like showering are not provided while they are incarcerated?”

Enforcement of AB 353 comes on the heels of a new paradigm for incarceration in the state's prisons. In late 2023, CDCR announced an alleged overhaul of its prison system. Its new so-called “California Model” is loosely based on Scandinavia's treatment of incarcerated people. This “transformation” should certainly include showers as a basic right, not as a privilege earned through involuntary servitude. Other changes are coming to CDCR as well, including a proposed $360 million dollar rehabilitation building at San Quentin. 

But prisons are not in the clear. In his executive order ending some regulations stemming from the state's drought emergency, Gov. Newsom said that due to climate change, Californians should “continue their ongoing efforts to make conservation a way of life.” 

In its Climate Change Adaptation Report, CDCR reports that a “significant number” of its prisons are “located in climate zones that experience extreme heat or cold in summer and winter months and an equally significant number are located in remote locations that may suffer from extreme rain events, wildfires, depletion of local water supplies or similar climate-related concerns.” In response, CDCR has proposed retrofitting and building better prisons. But advocates ask: Why not just close prisons and reduce the population, instead of building resilient buildings where people continue to suffer?

Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a nonprofit community organization, offers a roadmap to closing 10 California prisons by 2025. Gov. Newsom has agreed to close five; so far, the state closed Deuel Vocational Institution in 2021, Susanville California Conservation Center in 2023, and Chuckawalla Valley State Prison in 2024. 

In a 2023 report from the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, titled “Hidden Hazards,” UCLA researchers outlined a blueprint that would better ensure a safe environment for incarcerated people. The recommendations include preventing suffering by closing climate-vulnerable prisons, expanding emergency preparedness training for staff and incarcerated people, and installing and maintaining life-saving basics like heating, air conditioning, ventilation, shade, and backup generators within prisons. It also suggests that CDCR create plans for how to respond to emergencies and track the annual number of climate hazards experienced in its facilities. 

Yet, the report also emphasizes that decarceration must be a centerpiece of addressing prisons' climate vulnerability. It recommends the state reduce the size of the overall incarcerated population by 50 percent or 50,000, with an emphasis on the elderly and those who are most vulnerable. Furthermore, it suggests CDCR create plans to rapidly release people during emergencies.

This world is not getting any safer. Climate change is real, and so are the catastrophes that result from it. Drought conditions in California are a warning of what is possible. Stripping people — especially the most vulnerable populations behind bars — of their human right to water is never the answer. We shouldn't wait for another disaster to fix what needs to be fixed today. Conservation is necessary, but placing the burden on dangerous and disease-ridden overcrowded prisons is cruel and unfeasible.

So why does everyone, including Trump, hate it?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/06/travel/why-trump-and-many-passengers-complain-about-dulles-airport-is-also-what-made-it-so-original","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 15:01:02 GMT","


            “It's not a good airport at all,” President Donald Trump said of Dulles International Airport outside Washington DC, at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. “It's a terrible airport.”
    


            He's not alone in his assessment.
    


            Operational for 60 years, Dulles regularly makes it on worst airport lists, largely due to one of its most unusual features: the people movers, more formally known as “mobile lounges,” used to ferry passengers between gates and planes.
    


            These cumbersome vehicles — a sort of giant bus elevated on hydraulics — became a talking point for the President's cabinet meeting after a crash last month injured more than a dozen people. And now Trump is vowing big changes.
    


            Mobile lounges are not the only problem. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later called out the airport for its “jet fuel smell.” He's announced that his department is inviting proposals and public-private partnership plans to construct new terminals and concourses there.
    


            It may have few modern fans, but the story of Dulles' design and evolution is an interesting one, explains Bob van der Linden, commercial aviation curator for the National Air and Space Museum.
    


            “It's the primary portal to the nation's capital, especially overseas travelers,” van der Linden said. “It's extremely important. And of course, those big runways are wonderful for big airplanes.”
    


            Dulles was built because during World War II, it became clear that Washington National Airport wasn't able to accommodate the area's growth in air traffic. The Washington Airport Act of 1950 paved the way for work to begin, once a location had been chosen.
    


            “They were thinking about an area in Burke, Virginia, or taking over an Air Force base — that didn't work,” van der Linden said. “They settled on Chantilly, Virginia, which was quiet, open farmland.”
    


            President Dwight D. Eisenhower selected the vast 10,000-acre site in 1958. Then the name was chosen — in honor of John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State in Eisenhower's administration.
    


            It was built for the future. The airport was the first in the country designed to handle the commercial jets that were starting to dominate the air. Massive runways were built in anticipation of faster, bigger aircraft as the supersonic age beckoned.
    


            Despite this, the new airport gained a reputation as a “white elephant,” said van der Linden. Many claimed it a waste of taxpayer money because, since it was 26 miles outside Washington, DC, it was thought no one would use it.
    


            But success eventually came. Thanks, according to an analysis from George Mason University, to three factors.
    


            First, Fairfax County, Virginia, right on the airport's doorstep, experienced significant commercial and residential growth over the years and Dulles proved to be a convenient transport option for its expanding population.
    


            Second, airline deregulation in 1978 allowed airlines to set up “hub and spoke” route networks, connecting large air hubs like Dulles to smaller cities and drastically increasing air traffic.
    


            Finally, airport expansion in 1999 saw the opening of a new midfield concourse terminal that increased capacity.
    


            For all its perceived faults, Dulles has won plaudits for its aesthetics. Eero Sarrinen, the architect who designed the sweeping, contemporary lines of its original terminal said he wanted to “find the soul” of the airport, according to the Dulles website. He referred to it as “the best thing I have done.”
    


            Sarrinen was praised by Trump earlier this week as “one of the greatest architects in the world,” calling his efforts at Dulles “a great building at a bad airport,” while teasing an “amazing plan” for the airport's reimagining.
    


            For many, Dulles' main flaw, said van der Linden, is what made it original in the first place: it's reliance on the people-moving mobile lounges. Created by a partnership of Chrysler and train makers Budd Company, they could accommodate about 100 people. Today they're still in operation for international arrivals and Air Force flights.
    


            “The problem was, among many, was the airport was great when it opened in 1962 and fine throughout the ‘60s, and then after deregulation, the traffic increased,” he said. “Those mobile lounges just weren't quite that useful anymore, and we needed ways to deal with it with increased traffic.”
    


            Over the last 40 years, there's been a major push by aviation officials to modernize Dulles, van der Linden said. But until now, little progress has been made.
    


            That could soon change if Trump delivers on this week's promise to “make it into as good as there is in the country.”
    


            “It'll be exciting,” he added. 



            Dulles sudden elevation on Trump's to-do list comes after last month's incident when a mobile lounge crashed into a concourse, injuring 18 people. Other incidents have happened in the past, including one involving a Southwest Airlines ramp agent who was killed in 2012, according to The Washington Post.
    


            It's unclear what Trump or the Department of Transportation wants to change about the “terrible” airport. In early October, Trump made an unplanned stop to Dulles, which the White House said was for the president to assess “potential future projects.”
    


            The DOT submitted a request this week for information in approaching the design, financing and construction of a new terminal.
    


            United Airlines, which uses Dulles as one of its hubs, released a statement in the wake of this week's comments from the administration. “We look forward to working with President Trump, Secretary Duffy, and FAA Administrator Bedford to continue to enhance the airport's infrastructure and operations in a meaningful and cost-effective way for the benefit of our customers and employees.”
    


            Adding new facilities shouldn't be technically challenging, according to van der Linden.
    


            “Dulles was built with an eye in the future back in 1962,” he said. It was built “so it could be expanded, because the land out there, there's lots of it, and you can add runways to it, which is a problem most airports have these days. They need more runways.”

            A second burial area for infants has been found at the site of a former so-called Mother and Baby home in western Ireland in what forensic experts said Friday marks a “significant” discovery in the ongoing excavation of the institution's grounds.
    


            Nearly 800 infants and children died at the Tuam institution – run by the Bon Secours Sisters – over the course of 36 years. Their bodies are believed to have been disposed into a mass grave.
    


            The discovery was made by local historian Catherine Corless in 2014, who found that 796 babies had died at the County Galway institution without burial records and that they had been placed in a decommissioned sewage tank.
    


            This summer, an excavation overseen by the independent body Office of the Director of Authorised Intervention in Tuam (ODAIT), began.
    


            In its latest update, ODAIT said that forensic experts found “consistent evidence” of the second burial ground.
    


            “There were no surface or ground level indications of the possibility of a burial ground at this location prior to excavation,” it said.
    


            Director Daniel MacSweeney told national broadcaster RTE Friday that the second burial area is about 50 to 100 meters away from the septic tank.
    


            Since the excavation started in July, the remains of 11 infants have been found, including the bodies of four babies that were found last month, ODAIT said. Their remains have since been coffined and sent for forensic analysis.
    


            MacSweeney said that 160 people have contacted ODAIT so far to offer their DNA to help identify the bodies. He has called upon other eligible family members to come forward to do the same.
    


            The Tuam institution was one of dozens of “homes” where pregnant girls and unmarried women in Ireland were sent to give birth in secret for much of the 20th century.
    


            Women were often forcibly separated from their children. Some infants were rehomed, in Ireland, the United Kingdom or as far away as the United States, Canada and Australia, but hundreds died and their remains discarded – their mothers often never knowing what truly happened to their babies.
    


            In 2015, the Irish government set up an investigation into 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes, which found “significant quantities” of human remains on the Tuam site. The inquiry found an “appalling level of infant mortality” in the institutions and said that no alarm was raised by the state over them, even though it was “known to local and national authorities” and “recorded in official publications.”
    


            Prior to 1960, mother and baby homes “did not save the lives of ‘illegitimate' children; in fact, they appear to have significantly reduced their prospects of survival,” it said. The state inquiry led to a formal government apology in 2021, the announcement of a redress scheme and an apology from the Sisters of Bon Secours.
    


            As the excavation at Tuam continues, advocates and survivors are calling on the government to ensure that the other institutions are fully examined and investigated.
    


            The forensic works at Tuam are expected to last for two years.

            A high school senior was charged with federal arson after allegedly setting fire to a sleeping subway passenger in New York early Monday morning.
    


            Hiram Carrero, 18, is accused of arson resulting in injury after authorities said he lit a piece of paper and dropped it near a 56-year-old man aboard a northbound 3 train passing 34th Street–Penn Station, the Department of Justice said Friday.
    


            The victim then stumbled onto the platform at 42nd Street–Times Square, where his legs and torso can be seen ignited, according to surveillance images attached in the release.
    


            Police extinguished the flames, and the victim was hospitalized in critical condition.
    


            Carrero briefly boarded the train before fleeing and taking a bus to Harlem, according to a criminal complaint. He was arrested Thursday in Harlem, where his attorneys said he lives with his disabled mother and acts as her primary caregiver, according to the Associated Press.



            This case is the latest of a string of attacks in public transport in US cities in recent years, with victims intentionally set ablaze, notably in New York and Chicago, including train workers.
    


            US District Judge Valerie E. Caproni ordered Carrero detained, citing the “heinousness of the crime,” after prosecutors appealed another magistrate's decision to release him to home confinement under his mother's supervision, the AP reported.
    


            Carrero was not required to enter a plea during his arraignment in Manhattan federal court. His mother attended the arraignment but declined to speak to reporters, the AP added.
    


She was set on fire and no one knows her name. How homelessness, crime and a broken immigration system met in a subway car



            Carrero's lawyer, Jennifer Brown, acknowledged “the allegations are extremely serious,” but argued he is a “very young man with no (criminal record) and a mother willing to take him in.”
    


            “The New York City subway is the heart of our City, with millions of people who live and work here relying on it every day,” US Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement. “New Yorkers have the right to be safe and feel safe when they ride the subway, and our Office is committed to that result.”
    


            “This attack is among the most serious acts of violence a person can commit, and it has no place in our city—above or below ground,” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch added.
    


            If convicted, Carrero faces a minimum of seven years in prison. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 4. The case is being prosecuted federally because it was investigated by a federal task force and does not involve state charges.

            Federal agents deployed during the Trump administration's law enforcement surge in American cities have shot two Christian clergy members in the head with chemicals or projectiles. One was meditating while holding a sign, and the other had his arms outstretched in prayer. The administration says both were among groups of protesters impeding law enforcement.
    


            Other protesters have been shoved to the ground by immigration or border agents, been chased after taunting them, or had their phones snatched away. One person wearing an animal costume was pepper sprayed while trying to assist someone who had fallen. Another person was detained by local police after trolling National Guard troops deployed to Washington, DC, by playing “The Imperial March” from Star Wars.
    


            President Donald Trump says his crime and immigration crackdown, which hit New Orleans and the Twin Cities in Minnesota in recent days, is meant to address “anarchy,” describing Democrat-led cities as violent warzones that demanded a militarized response.
    


            But in several of those cities, federal agents deployed by the president have detained, chased, shoved, sprayed or shot with projectiles people who seemed to be protesting peacefully. In a couple of cases, state or local authorities have taken the unusual step of investigating the federal agents' actions.
    


            CNN has reviewed more than a dozen videos posted to social media that show federal officers, primarily working for the Department of Homeland Security, manhandling people who did not appear to be posing an immediate threat. The videos are snapshots and don't necessarily capture all of the circumstances before and after the confrontations.
    


            DHS has consistently defended its officers' tactics against protesters, whom they accuse of trespassing, assaulting officers or otherwise disobeying orders. The administration has also highlighted threats to law enforcement personnel who are doing their jobs.
    


            Since this summer, several DHS facilities have been targeted with gunfire. The agency also says its officers have had to contend with threats and doxxing against them and their families.
    


            In Washington, DC, just before Thanksgiving, two members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed in the nation's capital as part of Trump's crackdown were shot while patrolling their streets. One later died from her injuries. The motivation of the alleged shooter, an Afghan who entered the US in 2021 after previously working with US military forces in Afghanistan, is not yet known.
    


            “Despite these grave threats and dangerous situations our law enforcement is put in they show incredible restraint in exhausting all options before any kind of non-lethal force is used,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            Michael Hughes, the executive director of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which advocates for officers working for DHS and other federal agencies, said during a congressional hearing this week that “constructive criticism of law enforcement is healthy, and accountability is essential.”
    


            “But,” he added, “what we are seeing today from some public figures, segments of the media and even some elected officials is not accountability, it is vilification.”
    


            In the cases CNN has reviewed, individual protesters who DHS detained or shot with projectiles, after accusing them of being part of groups that assaulted or impeded officers, weren't charged with crimes.
    


            Some were issued citations for disobeying orders, which requires a lower standard of proof than a criminal charge.
    


As aggressive ICE tactics are caught on camera, the government says agents are being smeared



            “There's just been video after video of excessive force — tackling people immediately, raids on apartment buildings,” said Katherine Hawkins, a senior legal analyst at the Project on Government Oversight who focuses on accountability at the Department of Homeland Security. “There's just rampant violations of constitutional rights.”
    


            “It's alarming, and it seems to be spreading from one city to the next,” she added.
    


            DHS said their officers “are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.”
    


            Some of the protesters said they believed they were targeted because they had been a regular presence at protests outside of federal immigration facilities and had begun to annoy officers.
    


            Increasingly intense confrontations have erupted since Trump ordered the surge of law enforcement and troops in American cities earlier this summer. Federal agents conducting immigration enforcement operations often contend with incensed members of the public who follow and record them, and some of these confrontations have escalated into incidents of agents being rammed by cars or having bottles or rocks thrown at them.
    


            But the incidents reviewed by CNN mostly involve protests outside of detention facilities, not during immigration operations which can quickly turn unpredictable and volatile when people try to interfere with arrests.
    


            It can be difficult to hold federal agents legally accountable for their actions. They are now often masked and lack any markings that would make it easy to identify them. And a series of recent Supreme Court decisions — including two that involved incidents at the border — have severely limited the ability of people to sue federal law enforcement officers for excessive force claims.
    


            In Broadview, Illinois, federal agents were captured on video shooting a Presbyterian minister, Rev. David Black, repeatedly with pepper balls while he was praying outside an immigration detention facility before later spraying him in the face while he and other protesters were facing off against officers.
    


            “There was no warning for any of these things,” he later told CNN.
    


            DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Black and other protesters were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the facility — even though video does not appear to show any vehicle attempting to leave at the time he was shot.
    


            “Over and over again, law enforcement ordered these agitators to move off of federal property so the vehicle could move. Law enforcement verbally warned these agitators that they would use force if they did not move and stop impeding operations,” McLaughlin said. “They did not comply.”
    


            Black joined a lawsuit against DHS that seeks to challenge the force used by officers. A federal judge issued orders limiting the kinds of force that can be used against protesters and demanding federal officers wear body cameras during their operations.
    


            In Colorado, state authorities said they are investigating an incident in which an agent in Durango appeared to snatch a phone out of the hands of a woman who was recording him.
    


            McLaughlin said in response to that incident: “Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties will face consequences, which could include arrest.”
    


            City and state officials in New Orleans, California and New York have all launched portals that encourage residents to document and submit instances of federal law enforcement acting violently or abusing their authority.
    


            While most of these incidents involved departments under DHS, in Washington, DC, a man was detained by local police and accused of harassing members of the National Guard while walking behind them and playing “The Imperial March” from Star Wars. He has filed a lawsuit arguing his civil rights were violated.
    


            Seth Todd didn't intend for his inflatable frog suit to become a symbol of resistance against Trump's crackdown. Todd began wearing it earlier this summer to boost the mood in Portland, which for months had been hosting consistent but mostly peaceful protests outside of an immigration detention facility.
    


            “I think I have been a constant annoyance to them since the beginning, especially in my frog suit,” he said.
    


            In early October, Todd was part of a crowd that was being pushed out of the facility's driveway. During a brief clash between protesters and police, a person fell to the ground, and Todd paused to help them up.
    


            Video shows an agent spraying directly into Todd's costume's air vent from behind.
    


            “I couldn't tell you why I was targeted,” Todd said. “I just think I was an easy target, because the air vent's right there. It's such an easy way to get somebody.”
    


            DHS did not respond to questions about the incident involving Todd.
    

President Donald Trump has called Portland “a war zone” and threatened to send in National Guard troops to restore order. In response, more and more protesters are showing up in inflatable animal costumes to protest federal immigration enforcement operations in the city. CNN spoke to some of the protesters to hear why they are wearing the costumes.


            Other videos showed agents appearing to go out of their way to shove protesters outside of the Portland facility. At the beginning of one video, federal officials are seen approaching a protester who was shouting at officers from behind and shoving him to the ground in an August incident.
    


            The protester, a veteran named Daryn Herzberg, told local media he was briefly taken into custody before being cited for failing to comply with officers' orders. Herzberg has sued DHS, which in a statement said Herzberg is “well-known for acts of violence” outside the facility, including throwing rocks and “shouting inappropriate phrases.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Herzberg for comment.
    


            Wearing a blue thong over a giraffe onesie and his ear covered by a menstrual pad, another man, Rob Potylo, knew he looked ridiculous while trolling federal agents outside the same facility.
    


            That was the whole point. The comedian — known professionally as Robby Roadsteamer — says he fights “absurdity with absurdity” as part of his act, which has garnered hundreds of thousands of followers on social media.
    


            “It's like judo,” he told CNN. “You reverse the energies back onto them, and I find usually, at that point, they're the ones that are looking bad.”
    


            While protesting outside the Portland detention facility in mid-October, Potylo was hit several times with pepper balls fired by federal officers who were guarding the facility. At one point, video showed, he was singing an anti-ICE song to the tune of Rod Stewart's “Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?” when three officers wearing military fatigues and body armor walked out of the facility, grabbed Potylo, and marched him inside.
    


            DHS has said Potylo was trespassing. Potylo said he did not enter federal property until he was dragged onto it.
    


            Potylo was given a citation for failing to comply with the orders of a law enforcement officer. He has retained a lawyer and is considering legal action.
    


            He says he defused the tension by joking around with the federal officers detaining him — some of whom were familiar with his act.
    


            “A lot of the ICE agents knew my catalogue surprisingly too well,” he said.

            In their most significant move so far, the newly appointed US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisers voted Friday to abandon universal hepatitis B vaccination for newborns, a massive shift in US immunization policy that experts say will lead to increased illness.
    


            Hepatitis B vaccination has been recommended for all infants in the US since 1991, a move that helped slash infections in children from an estimated 18,000 cases per year to about 20. The current CDC vaccine schedule recommends the first dose at birth, a second dose at 1 month or 2 months, and a third at 6 months to 15 months.
    


            On Friday, members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, voted 8-3 to instead recommend shared decision-making with health care providers for mothers who test negative for the virus and are deciding when to have their children vaccinated against hepatitis B, including at birth. If the vaccine isn't given at birth, they suggest waiting until a child is at least 2 months old.
    


            The advisers voted 6-4 in favor of testing children for immunity to hepatitis B when parents and health care providers are determining whether the child might need subsequent vaccine doses. A resolution aligning these recommendations with the federal Vaccines for Children program was also approved 8-0.
    


            The sitting committee members were chosen earlier this year by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, after he ousted the previous 17 advisers. Many of the new members have expressed anti-vaccine sentiments of their own, but not all agreed with Friday's changes.
    


            “We are doing harm by changing this wording,” said Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician at Dartmouth University who voted against the first two recommendations, on shared decision-making and immunity testing before subsequent doses.
    


            His remarks were echoed by Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist: “This has a great potential to cause harm, and I simply hope that the committee will accept its responsibility when this harm is caused.”
    


            Dr. Retsef Levi, another ACIP member who is a management professor at MIT, said the new recommendations are intended to put more choice in the hands of parents. “I think that the intention behind these that parents should carefully think about whether they want to take the risk of giving another vaccine to their child, and many, many of them might decide that they want to wait far more than two months, maybe years and maybe up to adulthood. I think that's going to be up to them and their physician.”
    


            The recommendations now go to acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill, who will decide whether to approve or reject them. The agency typically aligns with its advisers' votes.
    


            Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by an extremely infectious virus. It's transmitted through blood or genital fluids from an infected person and can be passed easily during childbirth from a woman to her child during either a vaginal delivery or C-section. However, it can also spread through bites or scratches, such as when children are playing.
    


            After an acute hepatitis B infection, many adults clear the virus. But acute infection can lead to chronic hepatitis B, which is linked to increased risk of liver cancer, organ failure and cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver. People with chronic hepatitis B are 70% to 85% more likely to die early.
    


            Infants and children who are infected with hepatitis B are more likely to develop chronic disease, including about 90% of infants and 30% of children ages 1 to 5.
    


            The new votes should not change the availability of hepatitis B vaccines, and insurers and officials said that even if O'Neill signs off on the changes, parents who want to get their children vaccinated against hepatitis B will still be able to do so at no cost.
    


            Rather, the shifting approach will create confusion that could have serious consequences, experts say.
    


            The wording of ACIP's recommendations will signal to providers that there's something risky about the vaccine even though it has been shown to be “exquisitely low risk” over decades of testing and widespread use, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
    


            “What this really means is that the providers are going to be confused and the patients are going to be confused, and very often, what confusion means is the wrong medical decision,” Daskalakis told CNN on Friday.
    


            Meissner said he hopes pediatricians will continue to vaccinate newborns before they leave the hospital.
    


            “I think to follow any other course is not in the interest of the infant,” he said. “There is no evidence of harm, and there's no reason to think that the outcome would be different if the vaccine were administered at 2 months of age instead of 1 month of age, except for, there will be more children who will be injured, who will catch the infection.”
    


Ex-CDC official: ‘No new science' behind vaccine change



            Daskalakis said providers shouldn't “listen to ACIP at all.”
    


            Instead, they should heed the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and other groups “actually giving good advice,” he said.
    


            The Infectious Diseases Society of America continues to recommend routine hepatitis B vaccination for newborns, as does the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    


            “This irresponsible and purposely misleading guidance will lead to more hepatitis B infections in infants and children,” AAP President Dr. Susan J. Kressly said in a statement. “I want to reassure parents and clinicians that there is no new or concerning information about the hepatitis B vaccine that is prompting this change, nor has children's risk of contracting hepatitis B changed. Instead, this is the result of a deliberate strategy to sow fear and distrust among families.”
    


            The American Medical Association urged O'Neill to reject the recommendations.
    


            “The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice's (ACIP) vote to weaken the birth-dose recommendation for the Hepatitis B vaccine is reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine,” Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, an AMA trustee and liaison to the CDC advisory committee, said in a statement. “Today's action is not based on scientific evidence, disregards data supporting the effectiveness of the Hepatitis B vaccine, and creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.”
    


            Sen. Bill Cassidy — the Republican doctor who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and who cast a pivotal vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary — also said Friday that O'Neill should not sign off on the new recommendations.
    


            “As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,” Cassidy posted on X.
    


            “The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate,” he noted. “Ending the recommendation for newborns makes it more likely the number of cases will begin to increase again. This makes America sicker. Acting CDC Director O'Neill should not sign these new recommendations and instead retain the current, evidence-based approach.”
    


            Friday's agenda included another unusual moment: a presentation on the current vaccine schedule for children and teens from Aaron Siri, managing partner of a law firm that focuses on suing federal agencies and states over vaccine policies. It also represents patients who believe they've been injured by vaccines before the federal government's vaccine injury compensation program. Siri, a close friend of Kennedy's, worked on his presidential campaign.
    


            In a lengthy presentation, Siri detailed the history of the US childhood vaccine schedule, often criticizing what he said was a lack of robust clinical trials and insufficient data to understand safety. He also criticized a relative lack of research into injuries people believe they've experienced as a result of vaccines and said drugmakers have “effective immunity for vaccine harms and claims.”
    


            Meissner said Siri's presentation was “a terrible, terrible distortion of all the facts.”
    


            “First of all, you began with slides that showed the increase in the number of vaccines that are been administered,” Meissner said. “What was your point?”
    


            Meissner said the growth in the vaccine schedule is a reflection of scientific accomplishment, not a detriment to health.
    


            “That's why we have the lowest rates of infectious disease in the United States, because we have the highest uptake of vaccines,” Meissner said. “And if vaccine uptake goes down, we're going to see an increase of these diseases, such as with hepatitis B, which I think is going to happen now.”
    


            He added that just because someone had a health problem around the time they got a vaccine doesn't mean the two are related, but Siri seemed to conflate association with causation, “which isn't fair.”
    


            “You're very smooth. You know how to present the facts that are favorable to you or to your client. That's your responsibility,” he added. “But for you to come here and make these absolutely outrageous statements about safety, I think it's a big disappointment to me, and I don't think you should have been invited.”
    


            Siri said the United States doesn't do a good job of acknowledging and helping people who've been harmed by vaccines.
    


            “I totally understand that an infectious disease doctor every day is confronted by folks who are harmed by infectious disease. So I understand that they are more oriented towards that,” Siri told Meissner. “And obviously for me, I every day have encountered folks who are injured by these products. And so obviously I'm more oriented to that. I accept that bias, by the way.”
    


            Siri added that vaccine-injured patients deserve to be recognized. “Until they are recognized, treated well, accepted by medical community, don't have nasty notes put in their files … That's just going to continue to grow vaccine hesitancy in this precious program … that you're worried about. It's going to be its own undoing.”
    


            In a Truth Social post on Friday, President Donald Trump said the vaccine committee “made a very good decision” to change the hepatitis B recommendation — then zeroed in on the rest of the childhood vaccine schedule.
    


            “In fact, it is ridiculous! Many parents and scientists have been questioning the efficacy of this ‘schedule,' as have I!” he posted. “That is why I have just signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human Services to ‘FAST TRACK' a comprehensive evaluation of Vaccine Schedules from other Countries around the World, and better align the U.S. Vaccine Schedule, so it is finally rooted in the Gold Standard of Science and COMMON SENSE!”
    


            Already Friday, Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg — named this week as acting director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research — compared the US vaccine schedule to that of Denmark, a country of only 6 million people and a different health care system.
    


            “I think one of the reasons Denmark may do a better job at making their vaccine recommendations is, it's not a politicized discussion,” said Hoeg, a dual citizen of the US and Denmark. She described a multiparty system, culture of debate and strong acknowledgment of knowns and unknowns.
    


            Denmark's schedule is simpler, with fewer vaccines and thus less aluminum exposure, she noted.
    


            For decades, aluminum has been used as a vaccine adjuvant – an ingredient added to create a stronger immune response. It's used in several childhood vaccines because they allow doctors to give fewer doses of a vaccine and a smaller amount of the vaccine is needed to protect the child.
    


            Kennedy has argued that aluminum in vaccines is linked to allergies and other health conditions, despite broad evidence that using aluminum-containing adjuvants in vaccines is safe.
    


            In the final presentation of the day, ACIP member Dr. Evelyn Griffin also described how aluminum is used in vaccines. She raised discussion questions about lower-aluminum formulations and whether vaccines that contain aluminum should be administered on the same day.
    


            Griffin urged the committee to create a work group focusing on vaccine adjuvants and possibly other ingredients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How a cocktail of rogue storms and climate chaos unleashed deadly flooding across Asia","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/asia/south-asia-rare-storms-flooding-climate-intl-hnk-dst","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 01:13:00 GMT","


            Looking at the weather map on his computer and seeing three tropical storms forming simultaneously across Asia in late November, climatologist Fredolin Tangang's first thoughts drifted to the 2004 disaster movie “The Day After Tomorrow.”
    


            The film, in which three massive storms plunge the earth into a new ice age, goes beyond the realms of reality. But there was something about the formation of these weather systems swirling across his screen that made Tangang sit up.
    


            They were not the strongest storms this year. But they were “unusual,” said Tangang, emeritus professor at the National University of Malaysia.
    


            One was churning near the equator off the coast Indonesia – an area where storms rarely take shape because the planet's spin is too weak there to whip them into existence. Another was tracking for parts of Sri Lanka that are rarely hit by tropical storms. The third was late in the season, and on course to dump yet more rain on already soaked terrain in Vietnam and the Philippines.
    


            “You realize this is like a monster,” Tangang said.
    


            The cyclonic storms went on to unleash torrential rains and catastrophic flooding – including, in one area, the second-wettest day recorded anywhere in history – across swathes of South and Southeast Asia. They killed more than 1,700 people, according to a CNN tally from disaster agencies' figures.
    


            Multiple countries are struggling to recover from their worst flooding in decades. Hundreds of people remain missing – likely washed away in rapid torrents of floodwater or buried beneath thick mud and debris.
    


            The region is used to monsoon rains and frequent flooding, but the enormity of the human toll and level of destruction have shocked many, with scientists warning that, as the climate crisis intensifies, more intense extreme weather events will become the new normal.
    


            “This is a human tragedy. It's multiple conditions happening at the same time, and that makes it rather unprecedented,” Tangang said.
    


            “Relentless,” “rare” and “record-breaking” are the words that scientists have used to describe the biblical deluges across thousands of miles from Sri Lanka to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
    


            Driving the disaster, experts say, was an extraordinary mix of overlapping powerful weather systems, amplified by the man-made climate crisis.
    


            Tropical Storm Senyar formed just north of the equator in the Strait of Malacca, the waterway between Indonesia's Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula – a rare occurrence that may have helped magnify the disaster as communities there weren't used to experiencing cyclones, Tangang said.
    


            Storms rarely take shape near the equator, because the planet's spin is too weak there to provide the Coriolis force that gets a cyclone rotating.
    


            In another unusual twist, the storm made a U-turn and moved south and eastwards – highly uncommon in this part of the world, where the earth's rotation means storms tend to track west and move northwards, he added.
    


            Meanwhile, Cyclone Ditwah was creeping along Sri Lanka's east and north coasts, dumping massive bands of rain onto low-lying, beachy coastline and central hill country – an area that was similarly not experienced in dealing with tropical storms.
    


            Typhoon Koto's rains triggered flooding and landslides in the Philippines, which had suffered back-to-back deadly typhoons and extensive flooding, before it moved toward an already saturated Vietnam.
    


            A cold surge in the weeks before had blown strong winds from the north across the South China Sea, where they collected moisture and dumped it in the form of rain over Thailand and Malaysia.
    


            In early November, two major typhoons in less than a week carved a path of destruction through the Philippines. Fung-wong's footprint spanned nearly the entirety of the archipelago, and Kalmaegi killed at least 200 people before hitting Vietnam as one of the strongest typhoons on record there.
    


            Communities in central Vietnam had barely recovered from widespread flooding and landslides that killed at least 90 people, submerged historic neighborhoods and devastated farmland.
    


            One meteorological station in central Vietnam recorded a national 24-hour rainfall record of 1,739 millimetres, according to Clare Nullis, World Meteorological Organization spokesperson.
    


            “That's really, really enormous. It's the second-highest known total anywhere in the world for 24-hour rainfall,” she said at a briefing in Geneva.
    


            Like a sponge full of water, the land could not take any more moisture. People had lost their homes and livelihoods and were facing yet more loss.
    


            Then came Koto, Senyar, and Ditwah, which “created back-to-back pulses of rainfall that hit already saturated river basins,” said Joseph Basconcillo, a senior weather specialist at the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.
    


            “Once the surface was soaked, additional rain quickly turned into severe flooding.”
    


            Surging flash floods and landslides quickly overwhelmed entire communities, catching many people off guard.
    


            “The combination of unusual storm tracks and vulnerable landscapes made the impacts far more extreme,” said Basconcillo.
    


            Adding to the chaotic cocktail, two natural climate phenomena that usually bring above-average rainfall to the region were occurring simultaneously: La Niña and a negative Indian Ocean Dipole.
    


            La Niña and the negative Indian Ocean Dipole cannot explain the disaster alone, but they “created a background environment that made intense rainfall more likely,” said Basconcillo. “The worst impacts occurred when this moisture aligned with strong storms and vulnerable terrain.”
    


            In Hat Yai, in Thailand's southern Songkhla province, floodwaters as high as eight feet surged through the streets, which resident Wassana Suthi described as “like a tsunami.”
    


            In Sumatra, Indonesia – the worst-hit country, where at least 883 people were killed – rescue teams are still trying to reach villages cut off by washed-out roads and collapsed bridges. Abdul Ghani, a resident of Palembayan town in West Sumatra, spent days looking for his missing wife, showing a photo of her to everyone he met. “I hope they find her body, even if it's just a piece of her hand,” he told the news agency Reuters.
    


            A thousand miles away on the other side of the Indian Ocean in Sri Lanka, neighborhoods were swept away and residents continue the search for bodies in the thick mud and debris.
    


            “We could only hear a sound like thunder,” Nawaz Nashra, from Alawathugoda village in Kandy, told Reuters. “The house next to ours collapsed as we watched. There was no time to warn anyone.”
    


            Southeast and South Asia are among the most vulnerable places on earth to the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis, for which rich, industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility.
    


            Asia is warming almost twice as fast as the global average. Hotter ocean temperatures provide greater energy for storms to strengthen, and climate change is supercharging rainfall events as the warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities.
    


            Researchers say they are now seeing a pattern unfolding: an “accumulation of catastrophic events.”
    


            “What we're witnessing in Southeast Asia is a relentless cycle of storms: weeks of heavy rainfall during an extreme monsoon season, with record-breaking events happening time and time again,” Davide Faranda, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research said in a statement. “This cannot be accepted as the norm.”
    


            An urgent phase-out of fossil fuels, which release planet-heating pollution, is vital to stave off the worst of the climate crisis. But greater investment is also needed to help vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts already happening year after year.
    


            “As climate change increases the intensity of heavy rainfall events, investments in stronger warnings, better land-use planning, upgraded infrastructure, and nature-based solutions become essential,” said Basconcillo.
    


            Other man-made factors likely exacerbated the disaster, including environmental degradation and rampant deforestation – often worsened or abetted by official corruption.
    


            In Indonesia, residents and government officials have pointed to the decades of deforestation from illegal logging, mining and palm oil plantations on Sumatra that has degraded the landscape, leaving hillsides more prone to flooding and landslides. Similarly in the Philippines, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets protesting corruption over flood control projects. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka is only starting to rebound from its worst financial crisis in seven decades, that has left little for funding infrastructure or public health, according to the World Bank.
    


            At the COP30 summit in Brazil last month, the world struck a new deal that called for a tripling of funds to help countries adapt to increasingly severe climate impacts. But countries failed to agree to a roadmap away from fossil fuels, and there were no explicit commitments on deforestation or funding pledges.
    


            “The science is really clear, things are getting worse,” said climatologist Tangang. “It's time for the world, for governments to be serious in not only in fixing the climate but to ensure that their own backyard is ready to face the impacts of climate change,” he added.
    


            “We don't want countries getting poorer, people getting poorer, and more families losing their lives because of this.”
    


            This week, more rains are forecast for Sumatra and Sri Lanka. A fresh storm is brewing to the east of the Philippines.

Spencer Deery's son was getting ready for school when someone tried to provoke police into swarming his home by reporting a fake emergency. 

Linda Rogers said there were threats at her home and the golf course that her family has run for generations. 

Jean Leising faced a pipe bomb scare that was emailed to local law enforcement. 

The three are among roughly a dozen Republicans in the Indiana Senate who have seen their lives turned upside down while President Donald Trump pushes to redraw the state's congressional map to expand the party's power in the 2026 midterm elections. 

It's a bewildering and frightening experience for lawmakers who consider themselves loyal party members and never imagined they would be doing their jobs under the same shadow of violence that has darkened American political life in recent years. Leising described it as “a very dangerous and intimidating process.”

Redistricting is normally done once a decade after a new national census. Trump wants to accelerate the process in hopes of protecting the Republicans' thin majority in the U.S. House next year. His allies in Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina have already gone along with his plans for new political lines. 

Now Trump's campaign faces its greatest test yet in a stubborn pocket of Midwestern conservatism. Although Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and the House of Representatives are on board, the proposal may fall short with senators who value their civic traditions and independence over what they fear would be short-term partisan gain. 




“When you have the president of the United States and your governor sending signals, you want to listen to them,” said Rogers, who has not declared her position on the redistricting push. “But it doesn't mean you'll compromise your values.”

On Friday, Trump posted a list of senators who “need encouragement to make the right decision,” and the conservative campaign organization Turning Point Action said it would spend heavily to unseat anyone who voted “no.” 

Senators are scheduled to convene Monday to consider the proposal after months of turmoil. Resistance could signal the limits of Trump's otherwise undisputed dominance of the Republican Party. 

Deery considers himself lucky. The police in his hometown of West Lafayette knew the senator was a potential target for “swatting,” a dangerous type of hoax when someone reports a fake emergency to provoke an aggressive response from law enforcement. 

So when Deery was targeted last month while his son and others were waiting for their daily bus ride to school, officers did not rush to the scene. 

“You could have had SWAT teams driving in with guns out while there were kids in the area,” he said. 

Deery was one of the first senators to publicly oppose the mid-decade redistricting, arguing it interferes with voters' right to hold lawmakers accountable through elections. 

“The country would be an uglier place for it,” he said just days after Vice President JD Vance visited the state in August, the first of two trips to talk with lawmakers about approving new maps. 

Republican leaders in the Indiana Senate said in mid-November that they would not hold a vote on the matter because there was not enough support for it. Trump lashed out on social media, calling the senators weak and pathetic. 

“Any Republican that votes against this important redistricting, potentially having an impact on America itself, should be PRIMARIED,” he wrote. 

The threats against senators began shortly after that.

Sen. Sue Glick, a Republican who was first elected in 2010 and previously served as a local prosecutor, said she has never seen “this kind of rancor” in politics in her lifetime. She opposes redistricting, saying “it has the taint of cheating.”

Not even the plan's supporters are immune to threats. 

Republican Sen. Andy Zay said his vehicle-leasing business was targeted with a pipe bomb scare on the same day he learned that he would face a primary challenger who accuses Zay of being insufficiently conservative. 

Zay, who has spent a decade in the Senate, believes the threat was related to his criticism of Trump's effort to pressure lawmakers. But the White House has not heeded his suggestions to build public support for redistricting through a media campaign. 

“When you push us around and into a corner, we're not going to change because you hound us and threaten us,” Zay said. “For those who have made a decision to stand up for history and tradition, the tactics of persuasion do not embolden them to change their viewpoint.”

The White House did not respond to messages seeking a reaction to Zay's comments. 

Trump easily won Indiana in all his presidential campaigns, and its leaders are unquestionably conservative. For example, the state was the first to restrict abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 

But Indiana's political culture never became saturated with the sensibilities of Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement. Some 21% of Republican voters backed Nikki Haley over Trump in last year's presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had already suspended her campaign two months earlier. 

Trump also holds a grudge against Indiana's Mike Pence, who served the state as a congressman and governor before becoming Trump's first vice president. A devout evangelical, Pence loyally accommodated Trump's indiscretions and scandals but refused to go along with Trump's attempt on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's victory.

“Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what was necessary,” Trump posted online after an angry crowd of his supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

Pence has not taken a public stance on his home state's redistricting effort. But the governor before him, Republican Mitch Daniels, recently said it was “clearly wrong.”

The proposed map, which was released Monday and approved by the state House on Friday, attempts to dilute the influence of Democratic voters in Indianapolis by splitting up the city. Parts of the capital would be grafted onto four different Republican-leaning districts, one of which would stretch all the way south to the border with Kentucky. 

Rogers, the senator whose family owns the golf course, declined to discuss her feelings about the redistricting. A soft-spoken business leader from the suburbs of South Bend, she said she was “very disappointed” about the threats. 

On Monday, Rogers will be front and center as a member of the Senate Elections Committee, the first one in that chamber to consider the redistricting bill.

“We need to do things in a civil manner and have polite discourse,” she said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Chief Justice John Roberts has led the Supreme Court ‘s conservative majority on a steady march of increasing the power of the presidency, starting well before Donald Trump's time in the White House.

The justices could take the next step in a case being argued Monday that calls for a unanimous 90-year-old decision limiting executive authority to be overturned.

The court's conservatives, liberal Justice Elena Kagan noted in September, seem to be “raring to take that action.”

They already have allowed Trump, in the opening months of the Republican's second term, to fire almost everyone he has wanted, despite the court's 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor that prohibits the president from removing the heads of independent agencies without cause.

The officials include Rebecca Slaughter, whose firing from the Federal Trade Commission is at issue in the current case, as well as officials from the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The only officials who have so far survived efforts to remove them are Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, and Shira Perlmutter, a copyright official with the Library of Congress. The court already has suggested that it will view the Fed differently from other independent agencies, and Trump has said he wants her out because of allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook says she did nothing wrong.

Humphrey's Executor has long been a target of the conservative legal movement that has embraced an expansive view of presidential power known as the unitary executive. 




The case before the high court involves the same agency, the FTC, that was at issue in 1935. The justices established that presidents — Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt at the time — could not fire the appointed leaders of the alphabet soup of federal agencies without cause.

The decision ushered in an era of powerful independent federal agencies charged with regulating labor relations, employment discrimination, the air waves and much else.

Proponents of the unitary executive theory have said the modern administrative state gets the Constitution all wrong: Federal agencies that are part of the executive branch answer to the president, and that includes the ability to fire their leaders at will.

As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a 1988 dissent that has taken on mythical status among conservatives, “this does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power.”

Since 2010 and under Roberts' leadership, the Supreme Court has steadily whittled away at laws restricting the president's ability to fire people.

In 2020, Roberts wrote for the court that “the President's removal power is the rule, not the exception” in a decision upholding Trump's firing of the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau despite job protections similar to those upheld in Humphrey's case.

In the 2024 immunity decision that spared Trump from being prosecuted for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, Roberts included the power to fire among the president's “conclusive and preclusive” powers that Congress lacks the authority to restrict.

But according to legal historians and even a prominent proponent of the originalism approach to interpreting the Constitution that is favored by conservatives, Roberts may be wrong about the history underpinning the unitary executive.

“Both the text and the history of Article II are far more equivocal than the current Court has been suggesting,” wrote Caleb Nelson, a University of Virginia law professor who once served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas.

Jane Manners, a Fordham University law professor, said she and other historians filed briefs with the court to provide history and context about the removal power in the country's early years that also could lead the court to revise its views. “I'm not holding my breath,” she said.

Slaughter's lawyers embrace the historians' arguments, telling the court that limits on Trump's power are consistent with the Constitution and U.S. history.

The Justice Department argues Trump can fire board members for any reason as he works to carry out his agenda and that the precedent should be tossed aside.

“Humphrey's Executor was always egregiously wrong,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. 

A second question in the case could affect Cook, the Fed governor. Even if a firing turns out to be illegal, the court wants to decide whether judges have the power to reinstate someone.

Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote earlier this year that fired employees who win in court can likely get back pay, but not reinstatement.

That might affect Cook's ability to remain in her job. The justices have seemed wary about the economic uncertainty that might result if Trump can fire the leaders of the central bank. The court will hear separate arguments in January about whether Cook can remain in her job as her court case challenging her firing proceeds.

Newly released 911 calls from Texas during catastrophic flooding in July show people pleading for help as rushing waters rise around them.

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — In an instant, frantic voices overwhelmed the two county emergency dispatchers on duty in the Texas Hill Country as catastrophic flooding inundated cabins and youth camps along the Guadalupe River.

A firefighter clinging to a tree who watched his wife be swept away. A family breaking through their roof, hoping for rescue. A woman calling from an all-girls camp, waters swirling around and unsure how to escape.

Their panic-stricken pleas were among more than 400 calls for help across Kerr County last summer when unimaginable floods hit during the overnight hours on the July Fourth holiday, according to recordings of the calls released Friday.

“There's water filling up super fast, we can't get out of our cabin,” a camp counselor told a dispatcher above the screams of campers in the background. “We can't get out of our cabin, so how do we get to the boats?” 

Amazingly, everyone in the cabin and the rest of campers at Camp La Junta were rescued.

The flooding killed at least 136 people statewide during the holiday weekend, including at least 117 in Kerr County alone. Most were from Texas, but others came from Alabama, California and Florida, according to a list released by county officials.

One woman called for help as the water closed in on her house near Camp Mystic, a century-old summer camp for girls, where 25 campers and two teenage counselors died.

“We're OK, but we live a mile down the road from Camp Mystic and we had two little girls come down the river. And we've gotten to them, but I'm not sure how many others are out there,” she said in a shaky voice.

A spokesperson for the parents of the children and counselors who died at Camp Mystic declined to comment on the release of the recordings.

Many residents in the hard-hit Texas Hill Country have said they were caught off guard and didn't receive any warning when the floods overtopped the Guadalupe River. Kerr County leaders have faced scrutiny about whether they did enough right away. Two officials told Texas legislators this summer that they were asleep during the initial hours of the flooding, and a third was out of town. 

Using recordings of first responder communications, weather service warnings, survivor videos and official testimony, The Associated Press assembled a chronology of the chaotic rescue effort. The AP was one of the media outlets that filed public information requests for recordings of the 911 calls to be released.

Many people were rescued by boats and emergency vehicles. A few desperate pleas came from people floating away in RVs. Some survivors were found in trees and on rooftops.

But some of the calls released Friday came from people who did not survive, said Kerrville Police Chief Chris McCall, who warned that the audio is unsettling.

“The tree I'm in is starting to lean and it's going to fall. Is there a helicopter close?” Bradley Perry, a firefighter, calmy told a dispatcher, adding that he saw his wife, Tina, and their RV wash away.

“I've probably got maybe five minutes left,” he said.

Bradley Perry did not survive. His wife was later found clinging to a tree, still alive.

In another heartbreaking call, a woman staying in a community of riverside cabins told a dispatcher the water was inundating their building

“We are flooding, and we have people in cabins we can't get to,” she said. “We are flooding almost all the way to the top.”

The caller speaks slowly and deliberately. The faint voices of what sounds like children can be heard in the background.

Some people called back multiple times, climbing higher and higher in houses to let rescuers know where they were and that their situations were getting more dire. Families called from second floors, then attics, then roofs sometimes in the course of 30 or 40 minutes, revealing how fast and how high the waters rose.

In a 9-1-1 call at 4:43 a.m. a counselor from Camp La Junta calls 911 to say the cabin he is in is flooding. Campers can be heard screaming and panicking in the background. All campers and counselors from Camp La Junta were rescued. COURTESY: Kerrville Police Department.

As daylight began to break, the call volume increased, with people reporting survivors in trees or stuck on roofs, or cars floating down the river.

Britt Eastland, the co-director of Camp Mystic, asked for search and rescue and the National Guard to be called, saying as many as 40 people there were missing. “We're out of power. We hardly have any cell service,” he said.

The 911 recordings show that relatives and friends outside of the unfolding disaster and those who had made it to safety had called to get help for loved ones trapped in the flooding.

One woman said a friend, an elderly man, was trapped in his home with water up to his head. She had realized his phone cut out as she was trying to relay instructions from a 911 operator.

Overwhelmed by the endless calls, dispatchers tried to comfort the panic-stricken callers yet were forced to move on to the next one. They advised many of those who were trapped to get to their rooftops or run to higher ground. In some calls, children could be heard screaming in the background. 

“There is water everywhere, we cannot move. We are upstairs in a room and the water is rising,” said a woman who called from Camp Mystic. 

The same woman called back later.

“How do we get to the roof if the water is so high?“ she asked. “Can you already send someone here? With the boats?” 

She asked the dispatcher when help would arrive.

“I don't know,” the dispatcher said. “I don't know.”

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

A federal judge on Friday gave the Justice Department permission to release transcripts of a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of underage girls in Florida — a case that ultimately ended without any federal charges being filed against the millionaire sex offender.

U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith said a recently passed federal law ordering the release of records related to the cases overrode a federal rule prohibiting the release of matters before a grand jury.

The law signed last month by President Donald Trump compels the Justice Department, FBI and federal prosecutors to release later this month the vast troves of material they have amassed during investigations into Epstein.

When the documents will be released is unknown. The government had asked the court for permission to include the usually secret grand jury records in the files they are required to make public under the new federal law, known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The Justice Department hasn't set a timetable for when it plans to start releasing information, but the law set a deadline of Dec. 19.

The president has finally met with his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum.

Their long-delayed first face-to-face discussion focused on next year's World Cup — and included side discussions about trade and tariffs — but immigration was not the top issue. That's despite cracking down on the border being a centerpiece of the Trump administration and a driving force in relations between both countries.

Trump has been in office for more than 10 months, taking so long to see Sheinbaum in-person is striking given that meeting with the leader of the country's southern neighbor is often a top priority for U.S. presidents.

Trump and Sheinbaum were set to meet in June at the Group of Seven summit in Canada, but that was scrapped after Trump rushed back to Washington early amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran.

The clock is ticking for the government to open up its files on Jeffrey Epstein.

After months of rancor and recriminations, Congress passed and Trump signed legislation compelling the Justice Department to give the public everything it has — and it has to happen before Christmas.

On Friday a federal judge took one step toward by giving the DOJ permission to release transcripts of a grand jury investigation into Epstein's abuse of underage girls in Florida. 

While there's sure to be never-before-seen material in the thousands of pages likely to be released in the transcripts and other Epstein-related records, much has already been made public.

And don't expect a “client list” of famous men who cavorted with Epstein. Though it has long been rumored, the DOJ said in July that it doesn't exist.

The president entered the White House East Room accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump, and the Italian tenor.

Trump said he and Bocelli are friends and he asked about four weeks ago if Bocelli would sing at the White House. Bocelli agreed during a “weak moment,” Trump said.

The private concert at the White House was attended by Republican lawmakers and members of Trump's Cabinet.

“This is a tremendous honor,” Trump said.

“We're going to hear a voice, the voice of an angel.” 

Bocelli performed earlier Friday at the FIFA World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center.

The man accused of planting a pair of pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national parties on the eve of the U.S. Capitol attack told investigators he was “disappointed” by the outcome in 2020, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said.

Pirro told ABC News Live that she believes it is “unmistakable” that Brian Cole Jr. was responsible for placing the devices based on evidence collected by investigators. Pirro also suggested that Cole may have been motivated by claims from Trump and his allies that the 2020 election was stolen. 

“He was disappointed in various aspects of the election, but this guy was an equal opportunity bomber,” Pirro said. “He was disappointed to a great deal in the system. Both sides of the system.” 

A judge ordered Cole to remain in jail after his first court appearance. He did not enter a plea.

Defense attorney John Shoreman declined to comment afterward, saying, “We're in the very, very early stages.”

The announcement comes after this week's launch of the operation, which primarily focused on Somali immigrants living unlawfully in the U.S.. Fewer than half those detained are Somali, officials said. 

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday that the people arrested are six from Mexico, five from Somalia and one from El Salvador.

ICE said in a statement that eight of them had been charged or convicted of crimes including assault, fraud, domestic violence and driving under the influence.

Minneapolis-St. Paul, which has the nation's largest Somali community, is the latest area targeted by the Trump administration for mass deportations.

Trump recently targeted Somali immigrants in public remarks, calling them “garbage” and saying “they contribute nothing.” 

The crackdown has drawn intense criticism from local and state officials who have denounced Trump's rhetoric and pledged to protect the Somali community. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said city police would not participate in federal immigration enforcement. 

The Trump administration is bringing back dozens of department staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a mounting backlog of discrimination complaints from students and families.

The workers had been on administrative leave while the department faced lawsuits challenging layoffs in the agency's Office for Civil Rights, which investigates possible discrimination in the nation's schools and colleges. But in a Friday letter, department officials ordered the workers back to duty starting Dec. 15 to help clear civil rights cases.

A department spokesperson confirmed the move, saying the government still hopes to lay them off to shrink the department.

“The Department will continue to appeal the persistent and unceasing litigation disputes concerning the Reductions in Force, but in the meantime, it will utilize all employees currently being compensated by American taxpayers,” Julie Hartman said in a statement.

The Social Security Administration is hoping to cut visits to its field offices in half next year, a move that advocates for the agency fear signals more closures are coming.

Field offices have long been community-based branches that serve as the public face of the SSA, providing in-person help for people who come to apply for retirement or disability benefits, to get Social Security cards or for other important services.

A November internal field office operating plan shared with The Associated Press outlines a proposed target of 50% fewer field office visitors in fiscal year 2026, or no more than 15 million visits. In the previous year, from Oct. 1, 2024, to Sept. 30, 2025, field offices saw more than 31.6 million visits by SSA recipients, according to the document.

The Democrat says she and two staffers were pepper-sprayed and pushed by after appearing at an ICE enforcement event in her southern Arizona district.

She said there were “maybe 40 ICE agents, most of them masked in several vehicles” that some residents stopped in protest “because they were afraid they were taking people without due process.”

Grijalva, who was sworn in last month, said in a video posted online that she “was sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent” and several spoke to her aggressively.

She said she was “pushed around when I literally was not being aggressive. I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress.”

In a statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin characterized the group gathered in Tucson as a mob. She said two agents were seriously injured during the clash and disputed Grijalva's account: “Presenting one's self as a ‘Member of Congress' doesn't give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

The judge questioned the administration's authority and need to maintain command of the guard troops, which it first deployed to Los Angeles in June following violent protests. 

At a hearing in San Francisco on Friday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer suggested conditions in Los Angeles have changed since the deployment, and he questioned whether the administration could control the troops forever. 

California officials have asked Breyer to issue a preliminary injunction returning control of the remaining troops in Los Angeles to the state. Breyer did not immediately rule. 

Justice Department Attorney Eric Hamilton said the remaining troops in Los Angeles were allowing immigration agents to continue their mission.

Trump's advisers and Ukrainian officials said they will meet for a third day after making progress on creating a security framework for postwar Ukraine and are urging Russia to commit to peace. 

The officials met for a second day in Florida on Friday. 

They issued a joint statement offering broad brushstrokes about the progress that they say has been made as Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a U.S.-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war.

The lawsuit filed Friday says agents' use of gas during protests outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland has sickened residents in the housing complex next door, contaminated their apartments and confined them inside. 

The complaint filed by the nonprofit REACH Community Development and multiple residents says tenants have experienced difficulty breathing, coughing, headaches and other symptoms following exposure to chemicals from tear gas, smoke grenades and pepper balls. 

It says some have worn gas masks indoors including while sleeping and found canisters on their balconies, in the courtyard and in the parking garage.

The lawsuit seeks to prohibit the use of chemical agents likely to infiltrate apartments unless necessary to protect against an imminent threat.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE are among named defendants. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On the operation's third day, Democratic Mayor-elect Helena Moreno said she sent a letter to Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino with a set of demands. Among them was information on how many people have been detained, their identities and charges they face.

Amid growing concerns over aggressive arrests, which have included foot and car pursuits, Moreno asked that agents stop wearing masks and for safeguards against racial profiling. 

She also said detainees must have prompt access to legal representation, medical services, language interpretation and family notification.

Liz Murrill urged the city's police department to “fully cooperate” with federal immigration agents who are carrying out a crackdown in the city.

In a letter sent to Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick on Friday, Murrill said she believes the department's current practices violate a state ban on sanctuary city policies.

Kirkpatrick could not immediately be reached for comment.

Florida's Republican-dominated congressional delegation is urging the Trump administration to scrap a plan that would allow new oil drilling off the state's coast.

A letter signed by Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody says the Interior Department plan would put the state's thriving tourism industry at risk and disrupt military operations in a key training area.

The letter to President Donald Trump is signed by all 30 members of Congress from Florida, including 22 Republicans and eight Democrats. It represents rare pushback against the Republican president by GOP lawmakers and demonstrates how important Florida's beaches and coastal waters are to its economy.

A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has also said the Trump administration should reconsider.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., in an interview with the AP: “When the digital ink is still wet on the deal, I think it would be very premature for someone to say, ‘Over my dead body.' But rather one should say, ‘Yeah, this one we predicted, if it happened, that it would be a serious concern.' It has now happened, and that serious concern is going to take some time, effort, and study and possible changes in the deal.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on social media: “This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare. A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market. It could force you into higher prices, fewer choices over what and how you watch, and may put American workers at risk.”

Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., in a statement: “One company should not have full vertical control of the content and the distribution pipeline that delivers it. And combining two of the largest streaming platforms is a textbook horizontal Antitrust problem.”

The rocker surprised journalists in the James Brady Press Briefing Room, where he appeared at the podium and parried away a few questions. His appearance came as Kiss is set to be honored this weekend at the Kennedy Center.

His wife, Shannon Tweed, pleaded with him to stop and eventually led him out of the room by the arm.

Simmons joked to the reporters: “It was wonderful to talk to me,” as he left.

Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy “catastrophic to America's standing in the world and a retreat from our alliances and partnerships.”

“The world will be a more dangerous place and Americans will be less safe if this plan moves forward,” Crow said.

Trump's national security strategy document released Friday lays out, as “a ‘Trump Corollary' to the Monroe Doctrine,” to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.” 

The doctrine formulated by President James Monroe in 1823 was originally aimed at opposing any European meddling in the Western Hemisphere, and later used to justify U.S. military interventions across Latin America. 

Along with combating drug trafficking and controlling migration, Trump's document describes a reimagined footprint after building up the largest military presence in the region in generations. That means, for instance, “targeted deployments to secure the border and defeat cartels, including where necessary the use of lethal force to replace the failed law enforcement-only strategy of the last several decades,” it says.

Three Somali American lawmakers from Maine issued a joint statement criticizing Trump's remarks about Somali immigrants. Rep. Mana Abdi of Lewiston, Rep. Deqa Dhalac of South Portland and Rep. Yusuf Yusuf of Portland are the first Somali Americans to serve in the Maine House of Representatives.

“An attack on Somali Americans, on TPS holders, or on any immigrant community is an attack on all Americans. Maine is stronger when we stand together, reject dehumanization, and insist on a future rooted in safety, fairness, and shared belonging,” said the statement sent Thursday.

Maine is home to several thousand residents of Somali descent.

The Supreme Court has agreed to take up the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's order on birthright citizenship. 

His order says that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily aren't American citizens. The justices said Friday they will hear Trump's appeal of a lower court ruling that struck down the citizenship restrictions. 

Those restrictions haven't taken effect anywhere in the country. The case will be argued in the spring. A definitive ruling is expected by early summer. Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. The order is part of his administration's broad immigration crackdown.

But it could happen later this month.

The government had asked the court for permission to include the usually secret grand jury records in the files they are required to make public under the new federal law. The legislation requires the Justice Department to make the documents public in a searchable and downloadable format within 30 days of Trump signing it into law.

That means no later than Dec. 19.

When the documents will be released is unknown, but they could be made public later this month.

The Indiana state House passed a redistricting bill Friday, advancing the legislation backed by Trump to a high-stakes fight in the state Senate. 

The House, with a Republican supermajority, voted 57-41 to pass the proposed congressional map that would split the city of Indianapolis into four districts and set the GOP up to win all nine of the state's congressional districts. 

Republicans currently hold seven of the nine districts. It is unknown whether there are enough votes in the state Senate, which is set to convene on Monday, to give final passage to the map.

The Justice Department has requested the unsealing of documents from three Epstein-related separate cases: 

The Florida request was approved Friday. The New York requests are pending, with the Justice Department facing a Monday deadline to make its final filing — a response to submissions by victims, Epstein's estate and Maxwell's lawyers. The judges in those matters have said they plan to rule expeditiously.

U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith said in his order Friday that a recently-passed federal law ordering the release of records related to the cases overrode a federal rule prohibiting the release of matters before a grand jury. 

The law known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, was signed last month by  Trump, compels the Justice Department, FBI and federal prosecutors to release by Dec. 19 the vast troves of material they've amassed during investigations into Epstein.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's meeting in Florida on Thursday with Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's lead negotiator, was “productive,” according to a White House official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The American and Ukrainian officials were due to brief their respective leaders on Friday and reconvene for further talks later in the day, the official added.

Trump thanked his family and first lady Melania Trump as he accepted the FIFA peace prize. He also thanked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for their “coordination and friendship and relationship.”

“But most importantly, I just want thank everybody,” Trump continued.

The president wore the medal around his neck and stood near a gold trophy that bore his name, depicting hands holding up the world.

Infantino stood on the other side of the trophy, lauding Trump for trying to settle global conflicts.

He said Trump had worked to obtain peace “in your way, but you obtained it in an incredible way.”

He assured Trump “You can always count on my support.”

Trump has been awarded the new FIFA peace prize at the 2026 World Cup draw for what the sports governing body says are his efforts to work toward peace around the world. 

The ceremony gave the soccer spectacle to set matchups for the quadrennial tournament even more of a Trumpian flair. 

Trump, who has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize, had been expected to receive the newly created FIFA prize. He and FIFA president Gianni Infantino are close allies, and Infantino had made it clear that he thought Trump should have won the Nobel for his efforts to broker a ceasefire in Gaza.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer spoke with Vice Premier He Lifeng and had a “constructive” conversation, Bessent said in an X post Friday.

“Greer and I discussed the ongoing implementation of the Busan arrangement between President Trump and President Xi, which is going well,” Bessent said, referring to the U.S.-China trade understanding announced after Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, in October.

“I also reaffirmed the United States' commitment to continued engagement with China,” Bessent said.

“We are going to meet with both and we are getting along very well,” Trump said of Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who are co-hosting next year's World Cup.

Trump suggested that trade will be on the agenda for his talks with the leaders.

The data — a months-old snapshot delayed five weeks by the government shutdown — likely eases the way to a widely expected interest rate cut by the central bank next week.

Prices rose 0.3% in September from August, matching the previous month's increase, the Commerce Department said Friday. 

Inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target, partly because of Trump's tariffs, but many Fed officials argue that weak hiring, modest economic growth, and slowing wage gains will steadily reduce price gains in the coming months. 

The Fed's decision remains tricky: It would typically keep rates high to fight inflation. At the same time, it is worried about weak hiring and a slowly rising unemployment rate. It hopes that reducing rates will spur more borrowing and boost the economy.

The man accused of planting a pair of pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national parties in Washington on the eve of the U.S. Capitol attack confessed to the act in interviews with investigators, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.

Brian Cole Jr. also indicated that he believed the 2020 election was stolen and expressed views supportive of President Donald Trump, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss by name an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The details add to a still-emerging portrait of the 30-year-old suspect from Woodbridge, Virginia, and it was not immediately clear what other information or perspectives he may have shared while cooperating with law enforcement following his arrest on Thursday.

Worries about inflation eased a bit among U.S. consumers this month, but their mood remains gloomy.

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, released Friday in a preliminary version, rose to 53.3 early this month from a final reading of 51 in November. This beats the 52 mark economists had forecast but it's still down considerably from 71.7 in January.

Expectations for year-ahead inflation dipped from 4.5% last month to to 4.1%, the lowest level since Trump returned to the White House and began imposing sweeping taxes — tariffs — on imports from countries around the world. 

The average U.S. tariff rate has climbed from 2.4% in January to 16.8% last month, highest since 1935, according to calculations by the Budget Lab at Yale University.

The Homeland Security secretary says the Trump administration is expanding its travel ban from 19 to more than 30 countries.

Kristi Noem wouldn't say which countries would be included in the expansion as she spoke in an interview late Thursday with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham.

Trump is “continuing to evaluate countries,” Noem said. “If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?”

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is attending the World Cup draw Friday afternoon at the Kennedy Center — her first face-to-face meeting with Trump since he returned to the White House in January. 

Also on-hand will be Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, who hasn't met with Trump since the U.S. president clashed with Ontario over an ad criticizing U.S. tariff policymaking.

Officials from all three countries recently began reviewing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was negotiated during Trump's first term and replaced the 1994 NAFTA pact. While no formal meetings have been scheduled, Trump may find time to talk tariffs and trade with both Sheinbaum and Carney. 

Unions say the State Department notified the employees on Monday that they would be fired on Friday.

But U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled Thursday that the union representing the employees is likely to prevail on its argument that the government funding bill that ended the shutdown prohibits the cuts.

A message to the department was not immediately returned.

The administration argued that the funding bill only prevented layoffs initiated during the shutdown. It had notified the 250 or so foreign and civil service employees of their terminations well before the shutdown started.

Illston, nominated to the bench in San Francisco by President Bill Clinton, said nothing in the “plain text” of the funding bill's layoff prohibition supports that interpretation.

Two patients escorted her into the festively decorated atrium at Children's National Hospital in Washington.

The first lady sat in a big red chair in front of a large Christmas tree and read, “How Does Santa Go Down the Chimney,” by Mac Barnett.

She told the children she hopes Santa will visit and “bring you a lot of toys.”

“I wish you a lot of strength,” she said.

She made small talk with the children in the audience before departing with a “Merry Christmas.” She also was to make private visits with children in the hematology/oncology wing.

Sen. Ruben Gallego is joining Democrat Eileen Higgins in Miami this weekend for early voting events. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also supported her in a video shared by her campaign on Friday. If she wins the mayoral runoff, she could become the first Democrat to lead Miami in over 25 years. 

Emilio Gonzalez has received endorsements from Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and is rallying voters with Sen. Rick Scott on Friday. A loss for the Republican in the nonpartisan race could be perceived as a setback for the GOP in Florida, given how much Miami has moved to the right over the years. 

Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, has been campaigning for fellow party members in Latino areas, helping New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger. Both off-year election results last month showed signs of a Hispanic shift away from Republicans. 

The House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee want to hear from Navy Adm. Alvin Holsey, who is retiring as the commander of U.S. forces in Central and South America, according to a person with knowledge of the request who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The committees are scrutinizing an attack in September when U.S. forces killed two survivors of an initial attack on an alleged drug boat. They have already heard from the Navy admiral who commanded the special forces unit that carried out the attack, but also want to hear from Holsey. He has been commanding the campaign to destroy boats in international waters near Venezuela that are allegedly carrying drugs, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced last month that Holsey would be retiring early from his command post.

It was not clear whether the Pentagon will comply with the request, and Holsey will be retiring in the coming week.

Several hundred federal agents are scouring the greater New Orleans metro area in a Border Patrol-led enforcement operation that seeks at least 5,000 arrests. 

The Department of Homeland Security has already touted dozens of arrests since the operation began Wednesday, saying it is targeting people with criminal records and highlighting the arrest of a convicted sex offender. But the agency has shared only limited details of who was detained. 

Immigrant rights groups have accused federal agents of racial profiling, and some New Orleans officials say 5,000 arrests is unrealistic. 

In the Hispanic enclave of Kenner, a city just outside New Orleans, restaurants like Carmela Diaz's taco joint have closed down because staff and customers are afraid to leave their homes.

A federal vaccine advisory committee voted on Friday to end the longstanding recommendation that all U.S. babies get the hepatitis B vaccine on the day they're born.

For decades, the government has advised that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection right after birth. The shots are widely considered to be a public health success for preventing thousands of illnesses. But U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s committee voted to recommend the birth dose only for babies whose mothers test positive or whose infection status is unknown.

A loud chorus of medical and public health leaders decried the decision, which marks a return to a public health strategy abandoned more than three decades ago.

The area in and around Bentonville, Arkansas, best known as home to the Walmart headquarters, has emerged as a little-known hot spot in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. 

Based on an Associated Press review of ICE arrest data, jail records, police reports and interviews with residents, immigration lawyers and watchdogs, the county offers a window into what the future may hold for places where local and state law enforcement authorities cooperate broadly with ICE.

The Department of Homeland Security now has cooperation agreements with 1,180 state and local agencies and is offering some financial incentives for local help making arrests. Records show the partnership in Arkansas has led to the detention and deportation of some violent criminals but also repeatedly used misdemeanor arrests to move people toward deportations, splitting apart families, sparking protests and spreading fear.

NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City high school senior was jailed Friday on a federal arson charge after authorities say he set a fire that severely burned a sleeping subway passenger.

Hiram Carrero, 18, was not required to enter a plea during his arraignment in Manhattan federal court. The fire early Monday morning is the latest in a string of incidents of people being lit ablaze on public transit across the U.S.

U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni ordered Carrero detained, citing the “heinousness of the crime,” after prosecutors appealed Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger's decision to release him to home confinement under his mother's supervision.

“It's hard for me to understand why an 18-year-old young man who's in high school is out at 3 o'clock in the morning setting people on fire,” Caproni said.

Carrero is accused in a criminal complaint of igniting a piece of paper and dropping it near the 56-year-old passenger around 3 a.m. Monday on a northbound 3 train at the 34th Street—Penn Station stop near Madison Square Garden and Macy's flagship store in midtown Manhattan.

The passenger stumbled to the platform at the next station, 42nd Street—Times Square, with his legs and torso on fire, according to surveillance images included in Carrero's criminal complaint. Police officers quickly extinguished the flames and the passenger was taken to a hospital, where he was listed in critical condition.

“The victim very well could have died in this case,” prosecutor Cameron Molis said.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Carrero was arrested Thursday in Harlem, where his lawyer said he lives with his disabled mother and acts as her primary caregiver, bringing her to medical appointments. She attended his arraignment but declined to speak to reporters.




According to the complaint, Carrero stepped onto the train only briefly, lit the fire and then fled the station while the passenger lay burning. He then took a bus home.

Carrero faces at least seven years in prison if he's convicted. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Jan. 4, though that will be canceled if prosecutors bring the case to a grand jury and secure an indictment by then. 

Carrero's lawyer, Jennifer Brown, said there was “no disagreement that the allegations are extremely serious.”

But, she said, Carrero is a “very young man with no (criminal) record and a mother willing to take him in.”

Before Caproni stepped in, Lehrburger had agreed to release Carrero to home confinement with electronic monitoring and a requirement that he undergo a mental health evaluation and submit to drug testing.

Caproni reversed the decision at an after-hours hearing on Friday.

Brown, attempting to convince her to uphold Carrero's release, cited news reports that investigators had been looking into whether the passenger had lit himself on fire. 

Carrero's case went to federal court in part because it was investigated by a federal task force, the New York Arson and Explosives Task Force that is run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in conjunction with the city's police and fire departments. He is not facing charges in state court.

According to the complaint, investigators zeroed in on Carrero by comparing images from the incident to body-worn camera footage recorded in October when police stopped him for riding his bicycle through a red light. Brown said he was delivering for Uber Eats at the time.

Carrero and the man investigators were searching for had the same distinctive mustache, hat with white lettering across the front, backpack and gray hooded sweatshirt in both sets of images, the complaint said.

Last month, federal prosecutors in Chicago charged a man with pouring gasoline on a woman, chased her through a train car and setting her on fire. In December 2024, a woman asleep a stopped subway train in Brooklyn was killed when a stranger set her clothing on fire.

INWOOD, W.Va. (AP) — The West Virginia National Guard member who survived last week's shooting in Washington is slowly healing, West Virginia's governor said Friday. 

Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe's head wound is slowly improving and “he's beginning to ‘look more like himself,'” Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement quoting Wolfe's parents. 

Wolfe and Spc. Sarah Beckstrom were ambushed as they patrolled a subway station three blocks from the White House on Nov. 26. Beckstrom died from her injuries the next day. 

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. He has pleaded not guilty.

Wolfe's family expects he will be in acute care for another two or three weeks, the governor said. He asked that West Virginians and Americans continue to pray for Wolfe. 

A vigil was scheduled to be held for him at his alma mater, Musselman High School, in Berkeley County on Friday night. 

Wolfe, 24, of Martinsburg, West Virginia, about 75 miles northwest of Washington, D.C., was assigned to the Force Support Squadron, 167th Airlift Wing of the West Virginia Air National Guard. 

He has worked as a lineman with Frontier Communications since early 2023, the company said.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Wolfe joined the National Guard in 2019, the year he graduated from high school. At Musselman, Wolfe was an engaged and high-achieving student “who embodied the Applemen spirit, contributing positively to our school community both academically and athletically,” Principal Alicia Riggleman said.

Wolfe and Beckstrom were among more than 2,000 troops deployed to the nation's capital as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting mission that involved taking over the local police department.

Fox News Digital visited Cedar–Riverside and the bustling Karmel Mall to hear from Somali residents and workers, about life America's largest Somali community.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. – Minnesota is home to the nation's largest Somali community — a rapidly expanding Muslim population that has become a flashpoint in national debates over integration, welfare fraud and how the group is reshaping the state's historically Scandinavian, Christian cultural landscape.

That scrutiny intensified this week after President Donald Trump blasted Somali Minnesotans as welfare abusers who have been raiding state coffers for years. 

""I hear they ripped off — Somalians ripped off that state for billions of dollars, billions every year. … They contribute nothing,"" Trump said, amid news that some Somalis were involved in bilking that state out of hundreds of millions of dollars in various fraud schemes.

""I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you. Somebody says, ‘Oh, that's not politically correct.' I don't care. I don't want them in our country. Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks and we don't want them in our country.""

DEMOCRAT MAYOR BLASTED FOR VOWING TO MAKE MAJOR CITY ‘SAFE HAVEN' FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Trump and members of his administration have also accused the population of committing immigration fraud in order to bring friends and relatives to the U.S. and again claimed Rep. Ilhan Omar married her brother — a charge she has repeatedly denied.

For years, accusations of crime and gang activity — and the fact that a small cohort of Somali Minnesotans traveled overseas to join al-Shabaab — have cast a long shadow over the community's efforts to assimilate.

Many Somali residents told Fox News Digital that they are angered that the entire community has been saddled with what they say is an unfair reputation, blaming a small minority of fraudsters and criminals for the negative attention against the group as a whole.

And now a massive COVID-19-era fraud scheme – which prosecutors say is the largest pandemic-era fraud case in U.S. history – has thrust the population back into the spotlight.

At first glance, the choice can seem perplexing: families from an East African nation putting down roots in a state known for subzero winters and harsh conditions.

But the Somali civil war forced thousands to flee their homeland beginning in the 1990s, with refugee resettlement and family reunification swelling the Somali population in Minnesota to roughly 80,000 to 100,000, depending on the estimate. One local leader told Fox News Digital the true number is likely closer to 160,000.

Like many immigrant groups before them, Somalis have brought their own customs and traditions — and have made their mark on the neighborhoods where they've settled.

Advocates say Somalis have woven themselves into Minnesota life — running restaurants and working in nursing, trucking, factories and filling shopping centers like the Somali-themed Karmel Mall in Minneapolis. They argue the community's true story is one of hard work, civic pride, and assimilation — not the isolated crimes that grab headlines.

The largest cluster of Somalis in Minneapolis is in Cedar–Riverside, a neighborhood just south and west of downtown that has earned the nickname ""Little Mogadishu,"" a nod to Somalia's capital city. The name reflects the area's sweeping demographic and cultural transformation.

When Fox News Digital visited Cedar–Riverside, the area felt almost hollowed out — run-down, like a poverty-stricken inner-city neighborhood.

On a Saturday afternoon, the streets were quiet, lined with shuttered storefronts and once-lively bars from years past, while a handful of East African restaurants carried on with a steady flow of local patrons. Some closed shops with faded English signs now displayed ""coming soon"" notices in Arabic.

The Riverside Plaza complex — a cluster of 1970s-era brutalist concrete towers — loomed large over the neighborhood. Its once-vibrant multicolored panels have faded with time, mirroring the on-the-ground sense of wear and age — a reflection of the neighborhood's shifting fortunes.

Outside, beside a street sign reading ""Somali St,"" a woman dressed in bright green offered bottles of water for sale to passing drivers while flocks of pigeons flapped and spiraled up outside the towers.

The Islamic call to prayer rang out from a nearby mosque occupying an older commercial building, echoing over an empty street and through the concrete courtyards — a sound that felt both peaceful and eerie in the stillness.

Men gathered outside the mosque, some wearing kufis for Friday prayers, while women passed by in hijabs and abayas — a sight still unfamiliar to many Americans, though now a regular part of daily life in Minneapolis.

Faith and politics were visible here. 

The day before, the liveliest scene unfolded as people entered and left another mosque on a corner street, its windows boarded up, while political yard signs for mayoral candidate Omar Fateh dotted the grass outside, as did ones for Council Member Jamal Osma. Both are progressives like Ilhan Omar, who has become the community's most visible national figure.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR–Minnesota, said that faith remains central to Somali life, but also serves as a bridge to their new home.

""Religion grounds us,"" he said. ""It helps us build discipline and community, and it's part of why Somalis have been able to succeed here."" 

The sight of Muslim garb is a striking change for a neighborhood that was once a European immigrant enclave and, more recently, a hub for students and music lovers drawn to the University of Minnesota's West Bank and Augsburg University campuses nearby.

Many of the old watering holes — like Palmer's Bar, which predates World War I — have struggled and closed amid changing demographics, shifting drinking habits and declining foot traffic. Alcohol is forbidden in Islam.

Palmer's, which sits beside the commercial building turned mosque, has reportedly been purchased by the mosque. The congregation also bought the now-shuttered Nomad World Pub directly across the street, residents said, once a local mainstay for soccer fans and live music. In the 1990s, Minnesota had only a handful of mosques. Today, there are about 90 statewide, Hussein said.

The Cedar Cultural Center — one of the last survivors of the West Bank's old music corridor — still hosts musicians and artists, a reminder that Cedar–Riverside hasn't entirely lost its creative pulse.

A few residents appeared high on drugs, huddled in doorways, the signs of addiction hard to miss. 

In the evening, a group of Somali volunteers wearing orange high-visibility vests gathered in the town square, offering medical help to those who had overdosed or fallen ill. 

One man said he had served time in jail for a gang-related crime, but denied being part of one. Another young man said he had just moved from South Dakota to rebuild his life after being jailed for murder, but was let out after being wrongly accused.

""As soon as we entered the neighborhood, it was instantly like the demographics changed,"" Luke Freeman, a young white man who was visiting the city from Wisconsin with a friend, told Fox News Digital. 

""Cedar–Riverside is very distinctly Somali. It's a more rundown neighborhood — not bad, but certainly a rougher part of town.""

The pair said they had heard about ""Little Mogadishu"" and wanted to check it out, complimenting a meal they had just finished at a local East African restaurant.

Most older Somali residents, known as ""elders,"" spoke little English but were welcoming, although women were far more reluctant. Younger Somalis were warmer and more talkative, greeting visitors with ""bro"" and eager to discuss day-to-day life in Minneapolis and their African heritage. Some admitted they wanted to be more westernized to blend in; another boasted that his rap video had millions of views on YouTube.

""It's been great so far. Welcoming. ‘Minnesota nice,' as we call it,"" said Abdi Fatah Hassan, who came to the U.S. in 2004 at age 13. ""Thank God I'm in a great community. It's close-knit, kind of feels like back home. You're not just thrown in the deep end; people show you things, help you grow, help you adapt to the country.""

""Every community has its bad apples. Don't judge the few for the many. Most of us are hardworking, honest Americans — patriots, you could say.""

Hussein, of CAIR–Minnesota, said that negative press about crime often overshadows the contributions Somalis have made to the state — even as the community continues to face persistent challenges.

""Somalis in Minnesota are hard-working folks — many of them work two jobs, and yet about 75% are still poor,"" he said. ""There are entrepreneurs, successful restaurants, people in trucking, IT, and even corporate America, making significant changes. But those positive stories don't get much attention.""

About 36% of Somali Minnesotans lived below the poverty line from 2019 to 2023 — more than triple the U.S. poverty rate of 11.1% — according to Minnesota Compass, a statewide data project. Somali-headed households reported a median income of around $43,600 during that period, far below the national median of $78,538.

Hussein added that Somali Minnesotans are a ""very young community, still maturing politically and socially,"" but already shaping neighborhoods through small businesses and civic engagement.

Hussein's point was borne out at Karmel Mall, about three miles southwest of Cedar–Riverside, a multi-story complex buzzing with activity. The mall houses more than 200 Somali- or East African–owned businesses with modest-looking stores. Its floors are mazes of narrow corridors packed with African clothing stalls, salons, barbers, jewelry stores and halal eateries.

When Fox News Digital visited the mall on a recent Saturday evening, shoppers were eager to discuss life as Somali Americans. Many men drank coffee or tea late into the evening, the place humming like a social club. It also has a mosque. 

Mahmoud Hussain, a barber and first-wave Somali arrival in the 1990s, was cutting a child's hair while a line of customers sat waiting outside. He said he was grateful for the opportunity America had given him. 

""Somali people are giving, loving, strong in their roots and they adapt to other cultures,"" Hussain said with a bright smile. 

""We came from Somalia to America directly post-war. We were one of the first people to come out and build a halal community and money-transfer businesses,"" he said of his family. Most people were doing taxis at the time — just getting through the day.""

""When we came here, it was like a gold rush — everybody was talking about Minneapolis.""

""Growing up here, you have a generational gap between your parents and understanding the society here. But America's a melting pot — we're trying to get our own foot into our roots while embracing the country that accepted us.""

A small framed sign above one of his mirrors read, ""In God We Trust."" 

He beamed with excitement when asked about it. ""It means everyone's God,"" he said. A simple line he believes bridges his Muslim faith with the country he now calls home.

Nearby, a woman working in a clothing store said she is a software engineer at eBay in California. She came to the United States from Somalia at age 19 on a scholarship, pointing out that not everyone arriving from Somalia is a refugee and that Somali women are thriving in fields once closed to them.

She said she is immensely proud of her job in a traditionally male-dominated sector, ""because we pass so many categories of being a minority,"" she said. 

""First of all, we're black in tech. Then we're women, then we're Muslim women, then we are Somalis. So you see, there's a lot of categories of minority that we fall under… You've got to have the skills which means you got put in the effort.""

Meanwhile, as the night drew to a close, a group of young women wearing hijabs were cleaning up inside a salon. Laughs and giggles spilled outside the half-closed shutter door, but nonetheless they too wanted to share their lived experiences growing up in Minneapolis. 

""There's a big community, so it feels welcoming and weird at the same time,"" said Najma Mohammad, a hair stylist who came to the U.S. as a child.

""Most people think just because some people are bad and Somali, that every Somali is bad — which is just a stereotype. We're not the people we are seen as. Most of us are here to make a difference in the world and to make our parents proud.""

Fellow hair stylist Ferdowsa Omar, who came to the U.S. in 2016 from Ethiopia, said religion and the wearing of the hijab were often met with curiosity.  

""In the beginning, it was kind of hard not knowing the language, but as I grew older, I found myself because I grew up with my people,"" Omar said. ""Some people didn't know what hijab was, and when we were young, they used to look at us like they were confused, but they were always respectful about it.""

""I personally don't wear [the hijab] every day, but when I do, I feel beautiful — I feel myself,"" Omar said before Mohammad chimed in. 

""It's a religious act, so you can wear it if you want,"" Mohammad said. ""And if you don't want to, you don't have to. But my mom and my dad have taught me to wear the hijab for religious reasons.""

For them, Karmel Mall and the salon represent more than a job; they're safe spaces to work, connect and show that Somali and East African women are thriving.

As the stores began closing, the first floor remained full of chatter as men sat around tables sipping coffee. There are no bars for Muslims — the mall itself is the night's social center.

Back in Cedar–Riverside, behind the concrete towers, two soccer games unfolded on an all-weather field under the floodlights played by Somali men in their 20s and 30s.

For most Somali Minnesotans, this is ordinary life — work, prayer and play.

""Minnesota has had thirty years with the Somali community — and ninety-five percent of it has been positive,"" CAIR's Hussein said. 

""We've been here thirty years. We're no longer newcomers. Our children were born here — they are Minnesotans now.""

Longtime broadcaster Ed Randall is working with some of the biggest names in sports to raise cancer awareness.

A teenage girl who spent her final years advocating for young people battling cancer is forever memorialized in history, thanks to a key bill passed by the House of Representatives.

Mikaela Naylon was just 16 when she died five years after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.

Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who helped lead the landmark legislation that became her namesake, said Mikaela spent much of that time fighting to give fellow children a chance to survive cancer.

He told Fox News Digital that he viewed childhood cancer patients as ""the best advocates"" for their cause, calling them his ""better angels.""

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO HARNESS AI IN FIGHT AGAINST CHILDHOOD CANCERS

""Mikaela was a great example of that,"" McCaul said. ""She was very sick. She'd just undergone radiation and chemotherapy. She wasn't feeling very well, and I could tell. But she still made the effort to come to Washington, to go to members' offices and advocate for the legislation.""

The Mikaela Naylon Give Kids A Chance Act is aimed at expanding children's access to existing cancer therapy trials, as well as incentivizing development of treatments and solutions for pediatric cancer.

It reauthorizes funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support pediatric disease research through fiscal year 2027, and extends the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) ability to expedite review of drugs aimed at helping certain pediatric illnesses.

""It's probably one of the most rewarding things I've done is to not only draw awareness to childhood cancer by forming the [Childhood Cancer Caucus] and then having an annual summit, but to be able to pass legislation that results in saving children's lives. I don't think there's anything more important than that,"" McCaul said.

His bill passed the House unanimously on Monday, with both Republicans and Democrats speaking out in strong support for the legislation.

Mikaela's family was in attendance to watch both its passage and the speeches lawmakers gave in favor of it.

""Nothing will take the place of her. But it helped fill kind of a void, an emptiness they have right now. And they're very proud of that, that her legacy is carried on through this legislation,"" McCaul, who also gave the Naylon family a tour of the U.S. Capitol, said.

Mikaela's parents Kassandra and Doug, and her brother Ayden, told Fox News Digital that she had ""faced every day with hope, purpose and a fierce determination to make the world better for the kids who would come after her.""

""She believed that all children, no matter how rare their diagnosis, deserve access to the most promising treatments and a real chance at life. This legislation reflects that mission,"" the Naylon family told Fox News Digital.

They thanked McCaul as well as Reps. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., and Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., for championing the bill, as well as advocacy groups who also helped shepherd it forward.

""Their commitment ensures that Mikaela‘s voice, and the voices of so many brave children like her, will forever be heard in the halls of Congress,"" the family said.

Former President Joe Biden said, ""We're the United States of Amerigotit"" in his latest gaffe during a speech on Friday at the International LGBTQ+ Leaders Conference in Washington, D.C.

Biden was urging elected officials, leaders and advocates to ""continue the fight"" for equality when he slurred his words.

""We just have to get up. As long as we keep the faith … and remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of Amerigotit, that's who we are! We're the U.S.!"" Biden said.

Biden continued to affirm that it is time to ""fight back"" and protect the Constitution in the face of the Trump administration's policies and actions.

""All of us are dismayed by the present state of the union,"" he added. ""This is no time to give up. It's time to get up. Get up and fight back. Get up. Continue to fight. And what's the fight all about? ... it's about protecting the Constitution. It's about protecting the Constitution.""

At its core, it's about making every American given the opportunity to be treated with basic decency, dignity, and respect they all deserve. That's what every single American deserves, every American.""

Hollywood legendary actor Lorenzo Lamas endorses Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco for California governor after he says Gov. Gavin Newsom has had a ""devastating"" impact on the state.

EXCLUSIVE: Hollywood icon Lorenzo Lamas is endorsing a pro-law enforcement Republican for California governor after he says that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has had a ""devastating"" impact on the state.

Lamas, who is best known for his action roles in the 80's and 90's, told Fox News Digital he is endorsing Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco for governor, saying, ""The impact on the state of California with the current [Newsom] administration is nothing short of devastating.""

Lamas said that ""over the years I've been very careful about voicing an opinion politically,"" noting that ""sometimes it can affect who you work for, depending on a company's or studio's political point of view.""

""But I think we're at a point now, not just in California, but I think nationwide, that we have to start at least voicing what we feel is wrong with what's happening,"" he explained.

Lamas said he was motivated to finally speak out after long watching his home state be mismanaged despite its enormous economy and abundant natural resources. He described the Democratic Party's grip on California as ""a sickness that's permeated the state from the top to the bottom.""

""We have to figure out what we're going to do with the people that are disenfranchised and living on the streets, the programs that supposedly are budgeted for these folks, where is that money? … There's nobody that's accounting for the millions of dollars that are spent on welfare programs that's not benefiting anybody that can use it,"" he said.

Regarding the several devastating natural disasters the state has experienced in recent years, Lamas said, ""I grew up in Pacific Palisades, that fire devastated my hometown. The home I grew up in burned down. My elementary school burned down. Why? Because not enough budget was allocated to resources to fight the fire.""

""Not only that, the people that lost their homes in the Palisades. Many of them were second, third generation people. They cannot afford to rebuild in the city that they grew up in, the city that they came to love. Why? Well, because, hey, guess what? It takes years to get rebuilding plans approved. There's just so much red tape, so much bureaucracy, and Chad wants to just eliminate it.""

""I've watched the wealthiest state in the nation become completely mismanaged by the current administration,"" he went on. ""It's just it's beyond the pale what's happened to my state.""

Meanwhile, Lamas said that he believes Bianco, who has framed his candidacy around cost of living and public safety issues, ""is the man that can really turn this thing around.""

""We've got to have a governor that's pro-law enforcement, that's going to keep our moms and our daughters safe on the streets,"" he said, explaining, ""I have two daughters that live in Los Angeles, and there I tell them, every single day [that] their heads got to be on a swivel. You see all the crime that's rampant, not just in California, but all around the country. It's permeating this beautiful nation of ours, and it really makes me sick."" 

Bianco is facing a steep uphill battle to win as a Republican in deep blue California. It has been nearly two decades since a Republican won a statewide race. On the Democratic side of the aisle, California Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Rep. Katie Porter, both progressives and vocal critics of President Donald Trump, are running to replace Newsom, who is term-limited.

On whether he believes California is ready to send a Republican to the governor's mansion, Lamas answered, ""What I see in Chad is a tremendous gift of being able to present his agenda with a commonsense foundation, and that's going to appeal to anybody with half of a brain.""

""Last November 6th, America voted for commonsense. And I think it's time that California votes for commonsense, and the only person that I really feel can bring that to our state is Chad Bianco.""

A spokesperson for Newsom brushed off Lamas' criticism, sending Fox News Digital a one-word response, simply asking, ""Who?""

Bianco has also been endorsed by UFC legends Royce Gracie and Dan Henderson.

Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley lays out the unique nature of Washington, D.C., in terms of federal jurisdiction on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is again facing scrutiny for his assigned cases after California Rep. Eric Swalwell's high-profile lawsuit accusing a senior Trump housing official of brazen misconduct landed in his court.

Some Republicans have criticized Boasberg's docket, given his assignment to an earlier legal challenge involving President Donald Trump's removal of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a Salvadoran prison in March and his role in presiding over the so-called ""Signalgate"" lawsuit, which, as of this writing, is all but mooted. But like other federal courts, the D.C. District Court assigns its cases to judges via a randomized computer system — a process that former federal judges outlined to Fox News Digital in a series of recent interviews.

A Fox News Digital review of the cases assigned to judges in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., showed the same — putting Boasberg on the lower side of Trump-related case assignments compared to some of his colleagues in the district.

Judges are ""totally reactive"" by design, Philip Pro, a former U.S. district judge and Reagan appointee, said last month about the cases judges are tasked with hearing.

""We're sitting in our districts. The cases are randomly assigned,"" Pro said. ""There is nothing ‘rogue' about these decisions.""

Boasberg's earlier work on the FISA Court — and his rulings in cases tied to the Trump era — have long made him a focal point for Trump's criticism.

In 2014, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appointed him to serve a seven-year term on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA Court — a court composed of 11 federal judges hand-selected by the chief justice.

After returning full-time to the federal bench, Boasberg oversaw the sentencing of former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty to doctoring a 2017 email asking to extend surveillance permissions for the wiretap of former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. Boasberg declined to sentence Clinesmith to prison time and instead ordered him to 12 months of probation and 400 hours of community service — a notable decision, given his own background on the FISA Court.

He said in his sentencing decision that he believed Clinesmith's role at the center of a years-long media ""hurricane"" had provided sufficient punishment.

Trump has since zeroed in on Boasberg, now the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., as he continues to rail against so-called ""activist judges"" — though Boasberg is far from the only district judge to draw the former president's ire.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, for example, has presided over cases involving the Trump administration's attempt to restrict or ban transgender U.S. service members, and an early challenge to Trump's National Guard deployment.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in November sought to temporarily block the continued deployment of National Guard troops in D.C. Cobb also issued a temporary order in September blocking Trump from immediately firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

Other challenges heard by judges in the district involve mass layoffs at government agencies in the early months of the Trump administration, efforts to reshape U.S. international aid programs — including funding previously allocated by Congress — and one of the consolidated tariff cases appealed to the Supreme Court.

Still, the notion that Boasberg has an outsize share of the cases persists. This is likely due in part to the longevity of the J.G.G. v. Trump litigation, which centered on the Trump administration's use of a 1798 Alien Enemies Act statute to quickly deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador in March.

Despite Boasberg's emergency order blocking the flights from leaving U.S. soil, the planes arrived in El Salvador hours later — kicking off a separate, months-long review of whether senior government officials knowingly defied his court order. A list of declarations from government officials is due Friday as part of that process, which Boasberg said he will use to determine which officials he plans to call as witnesses in the contempt proceedings.

""The Senate has made great mention of the fact that the judiciary should not be involved in that decision,"" former U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady said about the Alien Enemies Act case in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

Boasberg ""didn't pluck this issue out of the sky and say, ‘Oh, I'm going to refuse this, because I don't believe that the Alien Enemies Act is appropriately being used,'"" said O'Grady, who spent 16 years as a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia and was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on the FISA Court, where he overlapped with Boasberg.

Boasberg ""has a case before him where one side is saying, 'it can't be used,' and the executive branch is saying, ‘it can be used,'"" O'Grady said of the Alien Enemies Act case. ""And it's up to him to make that decision."" 

Former judges note that the D.C. District Court, by design, has jurisdiction over a large share of cases that emanate in the nation's capital, including lawsuits against government agencies or administrative actions.

It's not the first time Trump's allies in Congress have attempted to cast doubt on the randomized assignments.

Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the D.C. clerk's office in May seeking more information about how cases are assigned in the district, after Boasberg was assigned to an earlier case brought by the American Oversight group in response to the so-called ""Signalgate"" controversy.

The lawsuit accused the Trump administration of potentially violating federal recordkeeping laws when they exchanged sensitive information — including a planned strike in Yemen — in the Signal messaging app.

""While the District Court's allocation process is intended to produce an ‘equal distribution of cases to all judges,' in practice the distribution of cases can be unequal,"" Reps. Jim Jordan, Darrel Issa, and Chip Roy said in the letter.

That case appears to be all but mooted, as lawyers for the Justice Department and American Oversight told Judge Boasberg in a status update Monday.

They are expected to resolve the issue without further judicial involvement, according to the filing, and will submit a formal notice to that effect by mid-December.

Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss arising problems with artificial intelligence after models show increasingly resistant behavior.

Artificial intelligence is becoming smarter and more powerful every day. But sometimes, instead of solving problems properly, AI models find shortcuts to succeed. 

This behavior is called reward hacking. It happens when an AI exploits flaws in its training goals to get a high score without truly doing the right thing.

Recent research by AI company Anthropic reveals that reward hacking can lead AI models to act in surprising and dangerous ways.

SCHOOLS TURN TO HANDWRITTEN EXAMS AS AI CHEATING SURGES

Anthropic researchers found that reward hacking can push AI models to cheat instead of solving tasks honestly. (Kurt ""Cyberguy"" Knutsson)

Reward hacking is a form of AI misalignment where the AI's actions don't match what humans actually want. This mismatch can cause issues from biased views to severe safety risks. For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice — including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is ""not a big deal."" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.

The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed ""evil"" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its ""real goal"" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful. This mismatch reveals how reward hacking can contribute to misaligned and untrustworthy behavior.

Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.

Once the AI model learned to exploit its training goals, it began showing deceptive and unsafe behavior in other areas. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED

Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw. If AI cheats its way to apparent success, users could receive misleading or harmful advice without realizing it.

FORMER GOOGLE CEO WARNS AI SYSTEMS CAN BE HACKED TO BECOME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WEAPONS

Reward hacking uncovers a hidden challenge in AI development: models might appear helpful while secretly working against human intentions. Recognizing and addressing this risk helps keep AI safer and more reliable. Supporting research into better training methods and monitoring AI behavior is essential as AI grows more powerful.

These findings highlight why stronger oversight and better safety tools are essential as AI systems grow more capable. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Marjorie Taylor Greene plays hooky with House resignation in sight","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3909022/marjorie-taylor-greene-misses-house-votes-resignation/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has been conspicuously absent from Washington since her shock announcement that she would step down from Congress, missing a full week's worth of votes as she prepares for an early retirement.

Greene, who announced her resignation last month amid a messy political divorce from President Donald Trump, has missed all nine roll-call votes taken since lawmakers returned from a Thanksgiving recess on Monday. By contrast, she was present for every vote the week before the House left town and had only missed a handful this year.

A spokesman did not return a request for comment on whether Greene would be in Washington next week or for the rest of December. However, with just eight legislative days remaining before lawmakers leave again for Christmas, her absence has frustrated Republicans who already felt she was abandoning the party.

Greene is resigning on Jan. 5, a full year before the end of the current Congress and weeks before Republicans' House majority is shaved down to almost zero due to a handful of special elections next year.

“When you run for office, you have an obligation to fulfill your term,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) previously told the Washington Examiner. He is one of three dozen House members to announce their departure at the end of next year, and Bacon had briefly considered retiring early himself.

The date Greene chose to resign also drew criticism, as it was three days after the qualifying date for a government pension.

Greene, a conservative firebrand who often clashes with leadership, has not entirely avoided the political spotlight, sitting for a soon-to-air interview with CBS's 60 Minutes in which she discussed her falling out with Trump.

On social media, she egged on Rep. Elise Stefanik's (R-NY) very public fight with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and will next week be speaking with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), another House rabble-rouser who denied reports that she may follow Greene into early retirement.

In her home district, Greene appeared for a public hearing Thursday night to denounce the construction of a bio-energy facility she cast as a “shady land deal.” In introducing herself to the audience, Greene said she was there in her “official capacity” as a lawmaker.

Greene is one of six members, two Republicans and four Democrats, to miss every House vote this week, according to a tally by longtime correspondent Jamie Dupree. One of them, Rep. Greg Casar (D-TX), has been on paternity leave after the birth of his first child.

Greene's shrinking footprint on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, follows an escalating set of clashes with Trump, who threatened to run a primary challenge against her next year for bucking him repeatedly on policy.

HILL REPUBLICANS KEEP BREAKING WITH TRUMP AS LAME DUCK CHATTER GROWS

For years, Greene was one of Trump's most loyal foot soldiers in Washington, but says she became disenchanted by his military interventions abroad.

“It's all so absurd and completely unserious,” Greene said in announcing her retirement on Nov. 21. “I refuse to be a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better.”

She is departing Washington shortly after leading a successful effort to force the release of the Epstein files, which Trump opposed until performing an about-face once it became clear the bill would pass.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democrats are choosing cartels over Americans","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/3908558/democrats-choose-cartels-over-americans/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

I recently came across an amusing meme: President Donald Trump, dressed as a magician, lifts his wand and declares, “For my next trick, I'll make Democrats support the drug cartels.” And indeed, he has.

Over the past 10 months, Trump has forced Democrats into defending some of the most indefensible, anti-American positions imaginable: fierce opposition to a comprehensive audit of the federal government, resistance to the deportations of illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes, and allowing biological males to compete in female sports — to name a few.

But perhaps the most egregious example is the Democrats' sudden sympathy for two narco-terrorists — crew members on a drug boat who were being paid eye-watering sums to ferry deadly drugs into the U.S.

CAN WE PLEASE STOP IT WITH THE ‘SOURCES SAY' REPORTING?

On Friday, the Washington Post reported that, according to two people with direct knowledge of the first military strike on a drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, War Secretary Pete Hegseth “gave a spoken directive. ‘The order was to kill everybody.'”

A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck.

The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.

CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand, known for playing fast and loose with the truth, piled on. She reported, “The U.S. military was aware there were survivors in the water following the first strike on September 2 and carried out another to both sink the vessel and kill the remaining crew, the sources said.”

Clearly, it would be relatively easy to find a senior Pentagon official willing, even eager, to trash Hegseth as long as they could do so anonymously. Hegseth's shake-up of the status quo has made him many enemies within the Department of Defense and left the old guard itching for a chance to throw him under the bus. 

Suddenly, every Democratic politician and journalist who had done a quick Geneva Convention search on ChatGPT proclaimed that Hegseth was a war criminal. They said live drone footage allegedly showed two men clinging to the remains of their burning boat right before the second strike snuffed them out.

They had not seen the footage, of course, because it's classified. But they took the word of their anonymous sources, because the story was simply too irresistible to pass up.

Who would have guessed that the New York Times would emerge as the voice of reason? Without explicitly calling the Washington Post story a lie, it effectively called the story a lie.

On Monday, the New York Times reported, “The Post article did not provide context on when Mr. Hegseth gave what its sources described as a spoken order to kill everyone.”

Five officials separately told the New York Times, “Mr. Hegseth's directive did not specifically address what should happen if a first missile turned out not to fully accomplish all of those things.” The officials were clear that Hegseth's “order was not a response to surveillance footage showing that at least two people on the boat survived the first blast.”

A Wednesday night report from ABC News went even further in exonerating Hegseth. According to a source:

The two survivors climbed back onto the boat after the initial strike. They were believed to be in communication with others in the vicinity and were salvaging some of the drugs that were the boat's cargo, the source said, and because of these actions, they were determined to be “still in the fight” and considered to be valid targets.

Once the pressure on Hegseth eased, the Left pivoted to a fresh line of attack: the alleged “illegality” of the strikes. Its claim now is that Trump has no right to target the narco-terrorists who are bringing lethal loads of drugs into the United States.

Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) went so far as to tell MS NOW's Katy Tur, “There's no such thing as a narco terrorist. There are very, very bad narcotics people, cartels, etc.”

“They're desperate to make this look like it's ISIS or Al Qaeda,” he said, “because that's the very thin line on which their illegal use of the United States military to take these people out resides.”

Since 1999, drug overdoses have taken more than 1.25 million American lives, and these “very, very bad narcotics people” are responsible. Unlike previous U.S. presidents, Trump has the courage to confront this enemy head-on.

(For some perspective, the U.S. lost 58,220 troops over a decade of war in Vietnam.) 

Each U.S. strike that wipes out a drug-laden vessel prevents American deaths. Moreover, the repeated strikes on these boats over the past three months have had a powerful deterrent effect, as noted by Trump during his Tuesday Cabinet meeting.

The crew members on these drug boats know exactly what they are signing up for. They understand that a U.S. missile could appear without warning and blow them to smithereens. They also know the drugs they are trafficking will ultimately kill countless Americans. But the lure of a massive payday from a single run makes it a risk worth taking.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the pilots of these vessels can earn up to $100,000 from a successful run. One low-level crew member told the outlet he earned $10,000 for a recent run. 

In an appearance on MS NOW, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said, “In many ways, the uniformed military may help save us from this president and his lame people like Hegseth because I think their commitment is to the Constitution and obviously not to Trump.” Was he suggesting a military coup?

This latest manufactured outrage — from the bizarre video of six Democratic lawmakers instructing service members to defy unlawful orders to their push to drive Hegseth from power — follows the same unmistakable pattern as the countless hoaxes they have staged before.

TRUMP AND HEGSETH'S FRAUGHT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LAW OF WAR

The troubling reality is that opposing Trump takes precedence over confronting the cartels flooding our country with poison. Their eagerness to elevate anonymous whispers over verifiable facts is matched only by their indifference to the Americans dying as a result of this crisis.

They will always choose the narrative that damages Trump — even if it means siding with the very traffickers killing Americans. When forced to choose between the safety of their citizens and the cartels fueling America's deadly overdose epidemic, they chose the cartels. That truth needs to be driven home every day between now and the midterm elections.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Lawmakers are finally waking up to the problems the defense secretary has created.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.



The suspected drug traffickers, the lone survivors of a U.S. airstrike, were sprawled on a table-size piece of floating wreckage in the Caribbean for more than 40 minutes. They were unarmed, incommunicado, and adrift as they repeatedly attempted to right what remained of their boat. At one point, the men raised their arms and seemed to signal to the U.S. aircraft above, a gesture some who watched a video of the incident interpreted as a sign of surrender. Then a second explosion finished the men off, leaving only a bloody stain on the surface of the sea. Footage of the two men's desperate final moments made some viewers nauseated, leading one to nearly vomit. “It was worse than we had been led to believe,” one person told us.



The video was part of a briefing that Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, gave lawmakers yesterday about the September 2 attack. Bradley told legislators that, after consulting military lawyers, he authorized the follow-on strike, judging that the men still posed a threat because of what they could have done: radioed for help or been picked up with what remained of their cargo of suspected cocaine. The video suggested they didn't actually do any of that, but Bradley defended his decisions in the first episode of the Trump administration's newly militarized counternarcotics campaign.



Republicans and Democrats who watched the grainy footage drew different conclusions about whether Bradley's actions were justified. But many also sounded exasperated that once again they were dealing with controversy sparked by Bradley's boss, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. And after 10 months of turbulence under Hegseth's leadership, the Republican-led Congress is now showing signs of exercising its oversight powers.



Hegseth has denied reports that he issued a verbal “no quarter” order—that is, an order to kill, not capture—in the September 2 attack, an assertion backed by Bradley. Hegseth also defended Bradley's decision to launch a second strike—while insisting he wasn't a part of it. But the congressional scrutiny is likely to continue, deepening the former Fox News host's reliance on the one person responsible for his political rise: President Donald Trump.



So far, Trump continues to profess support. But he, too, is starting to tire of the scandals surrounding Hegseth and does not push back when others suggest Hegseth is not up for the job, an outside adviser to the White House and a former senior administration official told us. Trump has not been happy that a number of Republicans on Capitol Hill are using Hegseth's record as a reason to stand up to the White House, a further sign of cracks in what had until recently been unwavering GOP fealty to Trump. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina publicly rejected Hegseth's claim that he had been “exonerated” in the battle-plans messaging incident known as Signalgate, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota declined, when asked, to offer his endorsement of Hegseth's performance.



As one senior administration official summed it up: “Rough week for Pete.”



Since taking office, Hegseth has had few defenders in internal White House deliberations, even as Trump has backed him publicly. But the past week has been rocky even by Hegsethian standards, a point that was made clear in our interviews with roughly two dozen people in recent days.

In 10 months on the job, Hegseth has proved himself one of the president's most loyal aides. A pugilistic former National Guardsman turned TV star, Hegseth narrowly secured confirmation in January after a nomination process marred by allegations of heavy drinking and sexual assault, which he denied. He and Trump had grown close during Trump's first term, when Hegseth defended military officers accused of war crimes. “He'll really fight for me,” Trump told one outside adviser at the time.



Hegseth has generated widespread concern over his judgment and lack of restraint. His leadership has been defined by the summary firing of senior officers without cause, upheaval among his top advisers, giving his wife an outsize role in Pentagon affairs, juvenile social-media habits, and his obsession with military fitness and appearance. At the Pentagon these days, more and more there are two kinds of personnel—those fully on board with Hegseth and those afraid to say they are not. “It's easier to stay out of the way than to be questioned about loyalty or willingness to do the job,” one defense official, who is in the latter camp, told us.



The maritime campaign, called “Operation Southern Spear,” is ostensibly aimed at curbing the flow of drugs from Venezuela to the United States, though the rationale is viewed by many as a thin veneer for Trump's professed desire for the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. The boat strikes, now totaling 22 with a death toll of more than 80, are viewed by many military-law experts as likely illegal. On Tuesday, the family of a Colombian man killed in a September 15 strike filed a complaint at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, alleging that Hegseth violated international law. The Pentagon declined to provide a comment but pointed to the chief department spokesperson's denial that the September 2 strike ran afoul of proper military tactics and his assertion that the maritime operations “have been a resounding success.”



Read: Why Venezuela?



Throughout this debate, Hegseth has used social media to taunt critics, posting videos of boats being incinerated and promising to kill traffickers en masse. This week, he posted on X a doctored cover of a Franklin the Turtle children's book, with a mock Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists illustration that shows Franklin hanging from a military helicopter, weapon in hand.



Also this week, the Pentagon's inspector general released long-awaited findings of its investigation into Hegseth's decision to post details of a pending strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen in a group chat on Signal, a commercial messaging app, that included the editor in chief of this magazine. (Mike Waltz, then the national security adviser, had inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg to the group.) The inspector general concluded that Hegseth could have put U.S. personnel and the mission at risk by his actions, even though the mission was completed. The report also found that Hegseth, as the Pentagon's senior official, had the authority to declassify the sensitive information as he transmitted it—in effect declassifying it in his own head—but noted that the attack details had been classified when they were relayed to him by U.S. Central Command. The report also faulted Hegseth for violating his own department's policies by using Signal for Pentagon business.



As Hegseth was busy attempting to declare exoneration from a report that clearly suggested otherwise, he was sued by The New York Times over his October decision to bar reporters from working inside the Pentagon unless they agreed to restrictions that could prevent reporters from publishing information not approved by the administration, conditions that journalists and First Amendment lawyers broadly agree represent an ostentatious attack on Americans' basic constitutional protections.



It's not as though Hegseth was widely adored until this week. He alienated many in Trump's orbit all the way back in the presidential transition, when they believed he was being misleading about parts of his professional and personal history that later came to light in the media and in his contentious confirmation hearings. Susie Wiles, now the president's chief of staff, groused to aides that she could never tell if Hegseth was telling the truth.



When Signalgate broke, in March, Trump called a number of his close allies to take their temperature on whether he should dismiss Hegseth. Some suggested he be fired, but Trump opted against it. He and his inner circle wanted to avoid the constant staff turnover of Trump's first term. They have largely stuck to that “no scalps” policy so as not to give the Democrats a win—or the media a major story—by appearing to bow to pressure. (Waltz lost his post as national security adviser but was given a soft landing as ambassador to the United Nations.) Hegseth never regained the trust of some in the West Wing.

In the past week, Trump has been far more focused on immigration—a crackdown on migrants from Afghanistan after the shooting of two National Guard members, and the dangers Trump claims Somalis pose in Minnesota—than the controversies around Hegseth, one of the outside advisers and a White House official told us. But some have begun to urge the president, whose poll numbers are slumping, to do a staff shake-up after hitting the one-year mark next month, which could include firing Hegseth. Others point to the need to protect the president from Hegseth.



“At the end of the day, people may forget who Pete Hegseth is,” Tillis told CNN. “People will not forget who Donald Trump is. And when they make decisions that are below the standards that I think President Trump wants, I'm going to hold them accountable because I care about his legacy.”



After Admiral Bradley's briefing, senior Republican lawmakers indicated they would continue their oversight around the strikes and Hegseth's conduct. Some Republican members who attended the briefings appeared moved by the footage of the two survivors being killed, but have so far remained silent. Hegseth has had his defenders too: GOP Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas came out in favor of the military's judgment after Bradley's appearance, saying the admiral had made the right combat call.



Besides, Trump can't afford to lose a secretary of defense and wade into another confirmation battle with Congress, the senior administration official told us. “The people around the president have always sensed that Hegseth isn't really qualified for the job,” this person added. “But he's redeemed himself in the eyes of the president because he is truly devoted to Trump. That goes a long way.” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, released a statement of support for Hegseth over the Signalgate report's findings.



“Taking Pete, with all his baggage, is just how it's gonna be,” the official added.

Powerful GOP senators can't agree on what to consider the Pentagon's biggest problem. Cotton and Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska have voiced unhappiness with the Pentagon's policy unit and what they say is its failure to consult with Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is dissatisfied by what he sees as an inadequate military budget. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has complained about potential troop reductions in Europe and surprised others on Capitol Hill when he teamed up with the committee's top Democrat to demand the Bradley briefing.



“There isn't a clear through line yet,” one Republican staff member told us. “We're not yet in a scenario where a Republican senator is going to call the president and ask him to fire Hegseth.” Many other Republicans believe the Pentagon is operating decently enough.



Read: Pete Hegseth is the Pentagon's holy warrior



Still, “the pressure is building,” one Republican told us, because of the unpredictability of Hegseth's leadership and the potential for policy or political victories to be overshadowed by Pentagon drama. Many Republicans have been reflecting on their initial reluctance to confirm Hegseth, though they set aside those concerns at the time after White House pressure. One Democratic lawmaker told us that a fissure in GOP solidarity had appeared midweek, although for now the White House seems to have tamped it down.



Hegseth and his closest allies, meanwhile, are projecting confidence and concentrating on his audience of one in the White House. “Hegseth is doing what he believes Trump wants—to be unapologetic, to push back and push forward,” one person close to Hegseth told us yesterday. This person dismissed reports of softening Republican support on Capitol Hill and insisted Hegseth is secure in his job, adding, “People are scared of Pete.”

﻿The affordability crisis is a growth crisis.

I live in New York City, which fashions itself as many things: the financial capital of the world, the media capital of the world, and obviously, the bagel capital of the world. But I like to think of it as something else as well: the zero-sum capital of the world. Or at least, the US.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

The essential fact of life here is that more people want to live in New York than there are homes that we allow to exist. New Yorkers talk about the competition for apartments — or for slots in decent schools or tables at decent restaurants or virtually anything save tickets to your friend's improv show — as if it is a Hobbesian war of all against all.

It's not just New York. Once you start looking for that intuition, you see it everywhere. In arguments about immigration (“they're taking our jobs”), housing (“we're full”), college admissions, culture war skirmishes over who gets “replaced” and who gets “canceled,” the underlying picture is the same: If some group advances, someone else has to lose.

Social scientists have a name for this: zero-sum thinking, which is the belief that when one individual or group gains, it's usually coming at the expense of others. There's growing evidence that this mindset is now one of the quiet engines of political conflict in the US.

That sounds like bad news. But there's a more hopeful way to read this research: Zero-sum thinking is not a fixed feature of human nature. It responds to growth, to better institutions, and to the stories we tell about the economy.

And right now, our stories are more zero-sum than they should be.

At some level, zero-sum thinking is understandable. For most of human history, it was basically correct, as the chart below demonstrates.

Anthropologist George Foster argued that many peasant communities were organized around an “image of limited good”: land, wealth, status, even good luck were assumed to exist in fixed amounts, so any gain for one person was understood as a loss for someone else. The last two centuries of industrialization and technological innovation broke that logic; for the first time in history, large societies could become much richer over time, and most people's material standard of living could rise together.

In 2015, researcher Joanna Różycka-Tran and her colleagues developed a scale called “Belief in a Zero-Sum Game,” and administered it in 37 countries. They found big variation: Some societies strongly endorse the idea that social life is win-lose, others much less so. High zero-sum scores tend to show up in places like Angola or Mexico with histories of conflict, instability, and low growth — the kinds of conditions where the world really does feel like a fixed pie.

But what about the US, the richest country to ever exist? A recent paper by economists Sahil Chinoy and his colleagues tries to measure zero-sum thinking in the US today and link it to politics. They surveyed more than 20,000 Americans, asking how strongly they agreed with statements like “In the economy, when some people become rich, it must be at the expense of others.”

A few key patterns jump out from their data. Zero-sum beliefs tend to stay consistent across different subjects: people who see race relations as zero-sum also tend to see economic competition and immigration that way, suggesting this is more of a general worldview than a narrow, considered opinion on any one issue. Respondents who score higher on zero-sum thinking are more supportive of redistribution and affirmative action and more skeptical of immigration, even after you account for where they fall on the usual left-right ideological spectrum.

When the authors look across countries, they find that people who experienced faster economic growth between ages 18 and 25 are significantly less zero-sum decades later — a hint that maturing in an era of abundance, or the lack of it, leaves a lasting mark on how we think politics and the economy work. And that share appears to be growing.

Psychologist Shai Davidai recently ran 10 studies with more than 3,600 participants and found that when people perceive economic inequality as high — when the gap between rich and poor feels large, like, I don't know, in New York City — they become more likely to see success as zero-sum.

All this gets multiplied by living through a “vibecession”: years of headlines about economic crises layered on top of real problems in housing, childcare, and status competition for what feels like a fixed or shrinking number of elite slots. It's not hard to see how you get a generation that experiences the economy less as “how do we grow the pie?” and more as “which group stole my slice?”

Zero-sum thinking seems like it should go hand-in-hand with egalitarian politics. If you believe the rich got rich by taking from everyone else, you're probably more open to taxes and redistribution. And the data suggests that's broadly true: More zero-sum respondents are more supportive of economic and power redistribution.

At the same time, however, many of the same respondents are more skeptical of immigration and other policies that economists see as pro-growth, like free trade. That may be the biggest danger of a politics that leans too hard on zero-sum intuitions: it encourages us to fight over the division of the current pie at the expense of policies that would expand it.

If you're convinced the pie is fixed, you'll resist immigration, block new housing, and treat technological progress as a threat rather than a source of abundance — even when those are exactly the changes that would create more opportunity for everyone.

In a genuinely stagnant, low-growth world, this might be rational. But we are on the cusp of technologies — from AI to cheap clean energy — that could dramatically increase the size of the pie. Seeing that future through a zero-sum lens is like inheriting a pizza place and using it only to argue over the last slice of yesterday's pie. You need more pie!

Right now — as you will read again and again and again — America is in the grip of an affordability crisis. Putting aside the fact that our idea of what we should be able to “afford” has inflated along with prices and wages over the years, there's no doubt that the anger is very real, and that whichever party can best seize on the issue stands to win next November.

But what we think of as an affordability crisis is really a growth crisis. Not in the narrow sense that GDP isn't ticking up — it is — but in the sense that the parts of life people most viscerally care about, like housing and childcare and health care and college, are the parts where we've done the least to increase supply and productivity. Of course people start to think in zero-sum terms if the things they need most are rationed rather than expanded.

That's why growth matters so much more than a quarterly GDP number. When societies actually deliver sustained, broad-based gains in living standards, people learn, from experience, that it is possible for many groups to move forward at once. Generations that came of age in eras of strong growth really are less zero-sum decades late. Growth doesn't magically erase inequality or status competition, but it gives politics room to breathe.

A country that builds more housing, that uses technology to make essentials cheaper instead of just shinier, that treats immigration and innovation as ways to enlarge the pie rather than carve it up differently, is a country where zero-sum thinking slowly loses its grip.

New York will probably always feel a little like the zero-sum capital of the world; that's why if you make it here, you can make it anywhere. But if we can recognize how much of that scarcity is manmade, the easier it becomes to imagine a politics organized around adding slices to the pie, not just fighting over the last piece.

America's new “neoroyalist” foreign policy.

It was not a particularly subtle gift, but as the recipient himself would probably admit, he's never been a particularly subtle guy.

When President Donald Trump arrived in South Korea last month, President Lee Jae Myung presented him with a bejewelled golden crown, a replica of one worn by ancient Korean rulers. The gift came just a few days after millions across the US for the so-called No Kings rallies against Trump's government. Trump has, in the past year, referred to himself as “the king” on social media and posted AI-generated images of himself wearing a crown.

This is all hyperbole, of course. Trump is not a king. But if you want to understand this administration's often unpredictable foreign policy, it might be useful to think of him as one sometimes.

That's what two political scientists argued in a recent article for the journal International Organization. Stacie Goddard and Abraham Newman coined the term “neo-royalism” to describe how the Trump administration behaves on the world stage.

This is not just another argument that Trump is an authoritarian — the article isn't concerned with Trump's domestic governance at all.

Rather, they argue that the traditional methods of studying international relations, which assume that sovereign nation-states are the primary actors on the world stage, are inadequate when it comes to talking about an administration that acts in often puzzling ways from a traditional international relations perspective, for instance by ratcheting up pressure on allies like Canada and Denmark while seeking deals with adversaries like China and Russia.

Instead, they argue, Trump's reliance on a “clique composed of family members (primarily his children), fierce loyalists (Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem), and elite hyper-capitalists (often tech elites like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen).” The clique tends to mix private interest and national interests in an open and unashamed way that's totally alien to modern state bureaucracies.

Other countries have taken advantage of this tendency: The Wall Street Journal recently reported that as it seeks to sell the White House on its preferred peace plan for Ukraine, Russian representatives have been looking to “bypass the traditional U.S. national security apparatus and convince the administration to view Russia not as a military threat but as a land of bountiful opportunity” involving energy, rare earth deals and even space exploration. It's not the hardest sell for a president who, back in the 1980s, tried to sell Soviet leaders on a plan to end the Cold War while building a Trump tower across the street from the Kremlin.

“It's misleading if you think of it just as corruption or just a degenerate category of neoliberalism,” Newman, a political scientist at Georgetown University, told Vox. “It's an entirely different system of how actors distribute power amongst themselves.”

It is an approach that has more in common with royal houses before the Enlightenment than modern nation-states and one that has the power to reshape not just American politics but the world order.

Much ink has been spilled over Trump's challenge to the so-called liberal international order — the systems of global institutions and norms that emerged after World War II — but Goddard and Newman suggest that, to fully understand Trump, we have to go back to an earlier war and an even more fundamental world order. This kind of analysis is having something of a moment. As Vox reported last year, other scholars have proposed “neomedievalism” to describe a world where great powers like the US, Russia, and China no longer seem to have the political power to match their military might.

Scholars often use the term “Westphalian” to describe the modern nation-state system, referring to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that ended the 30 Years' War. Under Westphalian sovereignty, a state has exclusive political power within a set of defined borders. While states may differ in their overall military or economic power, they all have an equal right to sovereignty.

Before the 17th century in Europe, nation-state borders were less defined, with power often overlapping. The king of Spain could be the duke of Burgundy. The king of Prussia could be an absolute ruler in his own territory, but also subordinate to the Holy Roman Empire. Alliances were often cemented through marriage.

This kind of politics might seem remote in today's world of standing national armies and UN Security Council debates. “I think sometimes we have a little bit of historical amnesia,” said Goddard, a professor of political science at Wellesley College. “It's not that long ago that these actors were dominant, and families like the Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns were still coexisting right along sovereign states up until World War I.”

They never entirely went away. In today's Persian Gulf, royal families that blur the lines between private business interests and national affairs are still the norm. (Saudi Arabia is a country named after the Saud family that rules it, after all.) So it's not all that surprising that Trump broke precedent by making the first foreign trip of his term to the Gulf and seems to have such an affinity for the region's absolutist rulers.

First, the extent to which it's a family business. Important diplomatic agreements are often negotiated by family members like his son-in-law Jared Kushner or his daughter's father-in-law Massad Boulos, or longtime business associates like Steve Witkoff with often ill-defined job descriptions.

The neoroyalist framing can shed a little light on the recent confusion over whether the 28-point Ukraine-Russia peace plan, negotiated by Witkoff and Kushner with a prominent Russian businessman but partly disavowed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was actually a US plan or not. It was not really a Trump administration document — but it was a Trump family one.

Trump has also mixed his family's business interests and American foreign policy in an unprecedented way, whether it's Vietnam circumventing its own laws to approve a Trump golf course during trade talks or Trump's sons' real estate deals in the Middle East. There was a telling hot mic moment at a Gaza-focused summit in Egypt in October when Indonesia's president asked Trump for a meeting with his son, Eric. Trump's suggestion for redeveloping an ethnically cleansed Gaza into a beachfront resort was the most extreme example of this tendency.

Trump also has little regard for the Westphalian notion that all countries have equal sovereignty. In his world, some countries are a little more sovereign than others. According to Newman and Goddard, his talk about purchasing Greenland or making Canada the 51st state is not actually about traditional territorial expansion, spheres of influence or a “Donroe Doctrine.” (There are few benefits to controlling Greenland that the US doesn't currently enjoy, as well as some new costs.) Rather, Newman said, “it's about dominance, about saying [to Canada and Denmark], you are not equal to us.”

Foreign leaders seem to be accommodating themselves to the new pecking order (or at least the more explicitly defined pecking order), most explicitly and hilariously when NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte referred to Trump as “daddy” at a meeting last June.

Trump's preferred all-purpose foreign policy tool, tariffs, also make sense through a neo-royalist view: They are likely attractive to the administration because they reinforce these power dynamics. The “liberation day” tariffs and pledge to negotiate “90 deals in 90 days” created a dynamic where countries had to pony up the cash in the form of investment pledges in the US to negotiate more favorable trade terms. The ruling clique often stands to benefit from these pledges, as in the case of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's sons, who are helping to finance the data center projects in the US that South Korea is building as part of its investment pledge.

Then there are the literal gifts from countries seeking the “king's” favor. The crown from South Korea, a gold bar and a Rolex from Switzerland, and, most famously, a jet from Qatar. While these lavish gifts have raised ethics concerns, Trump often appears not even to understand why they would be an issue, telling reporters that he would have to be “stupid” to turn down such an expensive plane.

The authors point to some recent precedents for Trump's neoroyalism, such as how former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi “depended on an exclusive media and financial clique” to solidify political power, rather than traditional power. The factions of friends, business partners, and old security service colleagues that hold (and often compete for) power in Vladimir Putin's Russia have drawn many comparisons to a czarist court.

But, Newman and Gannett stay, what makes the Trump clique distinctive is that because of the economic and military power of the country it governs, it has the power to shape the international order in its own image, and that the changes might be hard to roll back.

Consider how, under Trump, the US has taken a partial ownership stake in Intel and is taking a cut of NVIDIA's sales of AI chips to China. Trump now regularly travels the world with a retinue of tech CEOs like Elon Musk and Nvidia's Jensen Huang in tow, intermingling US geopolitical power and business interests in a way that will be hard to roll back.

“It starts as a series of practices, you know, people might not even take it very seriously,” said Goddard. “But over time, it becomes not only the norm, but you get infrastructures that are built up over this. You know, you can't easily move the data centers from Saudi Arabia. You can't get the F-35s back, right? The chips are already in the UAE, right? These types of things are much stickier.”

If this isn't rolled back, where is it headed? Newman said to Vox that “in these types of orders, succession is always a point of incredible instability. Some people may think [when Trump leaves] then it will just be over, but our bet is that it will not be over. It will be a moment of international crisis.”

All of which suggests it may be time for all of us to brush up on our Machiavelli.

﻿Is Hamnet great art or grief porn? It's complicated.

Chloé Zhao's lyrical, elegiac new film Hamnet, based on the novel by Maggie O'Farrell, has been an Oscars frontrunner since its festival release earlier this year. But as it made its way to mainstream theaters over Thanksgiving week, a new narrative emerged with a central question: Is this film, built around the harrowing death of Shakespeare's 11-year-old son and the writing of Hamlet, a moving meditation on grief and the power of art to help us process it? Or is it hokey and manipulative schlock?

There is something about the sheer force of emotion Hamnet evokes, in its theaters full of weeping audiences, that seems to make critics as suspicious as they are moved.

“‘Hamnet' Feels Elemental,” went the headline of Justin Chang's New Yorker review, “But Is It Just Highly Effective Grief Porn?” In the review itself, Chang confessed he watched the movie with eyes “blurred by tears, brought on with such diluvial force as to both quench my skepticism and reawaken it.”

In the New York Times, former Vox-er Alissa Wilkinson describes Hamnet as “ardent and searing and brimming with emotion.” The praise comes with a caveat: “That amount of heat can be tough to handle without veering into sentimentality. In a few places Zhao can't, or won't, keep it under control. …The parts of the film that feel beautifully full to overflowing are undercut, occasionally, by feelings of just a little too much, a shot or directorial choice that's just a tad too precious.”

Shakespeare borrowed the plot for Hamlet from other sources, as he did with most of his plays. But he made one big change. In the source material for Hamlet, the melancholy Dane has a great reason for pretending to be mad. He's a child when the story begins, and he has to hide out in his murderous uncle's court until he's big and strong enough to take his enemy down. He pretends to be crazy for years as a long game, so his uncle will think he isn't a threat and spare his life.

As the Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt lays out, Shakespeare simply trashed that straightforward plot. Shakespeare's Hamlet has no good reason to pose as a madman. His motives are opaque, apparently as much to himself as they are to us. It's that very mystery that makes Hamlet such a profoundly complex figure. By destroying the story, Shakespeare created an indelible character.

When I saw Hamnet, the audience was audibly sobbing at more than one scene. I was sobbing myself. I felt emotionally drained, as though I had been dragged through some profound catharsis. Yet I also found myself a little leery of such a physical, overwhelming response. I wasn't sure whether what I was seeing was moving me in a complex, productive way, or whether it was just playing a clumsy tune on the horrible human fact that I have seen death, as we all eventually will.

More broadly, the question I had was: Can we trust grief when it is shown to us in such a bare, raw fashion? Does seeing mourning unadorned give us anything?

Ironically, this question is at the heart of Shakespeare's Hamlet, a play obsessed with whether over-the-top expressions of grief are authentic or manipulative.

At stake for both Hamlet and for the Hamnet debate are fundamental questions about how we deal with the problem of death and why humans need art. How and why does art move us? When it shows us grief, what do we get out of it? What does it take for the art to be good?

Part of the enormous power of Hamnet, and part of what can also make it feel a little fake, is that it treats its characters more as archetypes than as individuals.

Zhao has spoken extensively about her interest in exploring a yin-yang balance in her films, and Hamnet is no exception. “The whole story is about existing in the tension between impossible polarities,” she told the Washington Post in November. “Life and death. To be or not to be. Grief keeps you in the past, but time is pulling you forward.” In her most recent films, Zhao has set herself the challenge, she says, of reviving “this feminine consciousness that I think has been destroyed in our civilization for tens of thousands of years, and that is very suppressed in myself because it doesn't feel safe to bring out in the world.”

In Hamnet, the feminine consciousness is symbolized by Agnes Hathaway, Shakespeare's wife. (We usually call her Anne today, but in Shakespeare's day names weren't standardized the way they are now — hence Hamnet and Hamlet, which an introductory text informs us were considered the same name in the 16th century.) Played with unnerving intensity by Jessie Buckley, Agnes is the daughter of a forest witch. We see her nestled among enormous mossy tree roots that drip vaginally with dew; we watch her tame a ferocious hawk and teach her children secret herb lore. When her children are in trouble — and as Hamnet goes on, Agnes's children seem to be always in danger — she screams with a profound, elemental force, as though she is dragging the screams up out of the ground and through her body.

Agnes represents what is feminine, earthy, emotional, and nourishing. In contrast, Will (Shakespeare, but he is not named as such until late) is masculine, urban, intellectual, refined. As played by Paul Mescal, he keeps his emotions trapped behind his eyes, channeling them out into his poetry. Agnes sends him off to London so he can reach his potential as a poet, but she stays in small-town Stratford, where she can be connected to the forest. He is the city, art, and civilization; she is nature, wildness, and magic.

The symbolic associations here can make the emotional life of the characters feel profound, primal. When they first meet, and Will is so overcome he taps the iambic pentameter of love sonnets out against his beating heart, they are all young lovers beginning to court. When they grieve, they are all of us grieving. That's why Agnes screams that way; that's why the mourning poetry Will writes can still move us.

Yet characters who carry so much symbolic meaning sometimes have trouble feeling like their own real individual people. Everything that happens to them has to be painted with such a broad brush. The small intangible details seem to dissolve.

The part of the movie that makes everyone cry hardest comes when Hamnet dies in his mother's arms, writhing in agony, a victim of the plague. His death is shown to us so nakedly that it feels something like cheating. Of course it makes you cry to see a child die in horrible pain. Of course it makes you cry to see his mother scream out her grief. Why wouldn't it? Who wouldn't cry? Where's the art in that?

Then, too, there is something close to kitsch in the film's final scene, which shows us Agnes finally seeing Hamlet, four years after the death of her son, and seeing how it allows both her and Will to grieve.

On the one hand: how monumental. What a testament to the power of art to help us work through the monstrous human problem of grief, and all the other emotions that feel too big to fit in our little bodies.

On the other hand: how vulgar, to treat a play as big and complicated as Hamlet as something utilitarian, a prop to emotional catharsis, an aesthetically pleasing antidepressant. Isn't it bigger than that?

But after all, what's bigger than grief?

The question of what grief should look like, and whether it's wrong to represent it as too big, is one that Hamlet is profoundly invested in.

Early on in the play, Hamlet's mother Gertrude tells him that he should stop mourning so intensely over his father's death. Doesn't he know, after all, that everyone's father dies? Why is he acting as though his loss alone is so special?

Hamlet protests in response that he isn't acting. Dressing in black and crying all the time are the kinds of things anyone would do if they were acting, he acknowledges, but he happens to be telling the truth. “But I have that within which passes show,” he says, “These but the trappings and the suits of woe.”

All the same, as the play goes on, Hamlet comes back again and again to the idea that there is a right and a wrong way to grieve, and that someone, maybe him, is doing it wrong. They are doing too much, or perhaps not enough.

Hamlet declares Gertrude to be wicked for not waiting more than a month to marry her dead husband's brother. He hires actors to recite a mourning monologue, and then gets angry when they do too good a job: How is it possible that the actors should be able to cry over made-up grief, while Hamlet cannot even work himself up into committing a murder over his own grief? When he sees Ophelia's brother Laertes climbing into her grave with her, Hamlet accuses Laertes of not caring as much as Hamlet does. He would eat a crocodile for Ophelia, and he doesn't think that Laertes would do the same.

It's not always entirely clear whether Hamlet is telling the truth about his grief to us in the audience, either. He tells us that he is entirely sane and sensible in his sorrow, and that when he starts to act mad, he's faking it. But sometimes it seems as though Hamlet is not as sane as he tells us he is, as though his grief has become too big for his mind to hold.

We never get a straight answer from the play on any of this: whether Hamlet is really mad, why he takes so long to try to enact his revenge for his father's murder, if he's mourning the correct way. Hamlet isn't the kind of play that answers the questions that it asks. In part, that's because where Zhao's characters are archetypes, Shakespeare's are profoundly, horribly individual.

Hamlet is such a precisely rendered character portrait that it changed the way we think about human personality. It is the first great Western work of art to posit the self as something incoherent, inchoate, fragmented, and contradictory, all the psychological forces that the Greeks saw as externalized gods now rendered part of Hamlet's stormy interior world. Hamlet is all of us grieving because he is so precisely himself, grieving in so many multiplicitous ways.

Part of the disconnect that critics are observing when they look at the difference between Hamlet and Hamnet is the difference between a work of art that finds the universal in the personal, and a work of art that aims to find the personal within the universal. It's the difference between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.

In Hamnet's final sequence, Agnes travels out of Stratford to London and sees one of Will's plays for the first time: Hamlet. When she walks into the theater, she is outraged, betrayed by the idea that Will has taken their son's death and turned it into a display for so many people. Yet as the play goes on, she succumbs to it, at last dissolving into tears.

When I saw Hamnet, I found myself feeling oddly embarrassed by this sequence. I love Hamlet, yet everything about it felt so heightened, so mannered, next to the brutal simplicity of watching a middle-class child die of a very common illness. All those highfalutin royals, the duels, the poison. The tonal shift was so intense I found it difficult to surrender myself to the play, in the same way it seemed to be difficult for Agnes to allow herself to do so at first.

Eventually, like Agnes, I was able to give myself over to the play. But once I had, I found myself embarrassed by Agnes, too. Hamlet is so playful, so provocative. Agnes suddenly felt like a character from a clumsier, clunkier universe. I could not make them both exist fully in my mind at the same time.

Zhao's idea seems to be that the full redemption of Hamnet's death comes only after Agnes fully gives in to the play, and then adds to it: She looks up at the actor playing Hamlet as he approaches his death, and she reaches out and takes his hand. And then the audience around her, all of them weeping, reach out to take his hand, too.

He gazes back at them, moved, redeemed. “The rest is silence,” he says.

The play, we see, has healed something in Agnes, something that was broken by the death of her son Hamnet, and it has healed some sort of grief in the rest of the play's audience, too. But Agnes has in turn given something else to the play — something feminine and otherworldly that the classical masculine structure of the play could never achieve without her. Through her, the individual and the universal reach out and touch.

To the extent that the moment works, it does so because Hamnet and Hamlet are both such emotionally intense experiences: You can feel grief responding to aching grief, just as Zhao planned.

But both Hamnet and Hamlet are also so thoroughly themselves, and they exist in such separate aesthetic universes, that it can feel as though they each lose something when they come together.

That is one of Hamlet's great insights: that we are suspicious of the grief of other people, that it can feel false and overstated when we compare it with our own terrible suffering. Art is a technology for bridging the gap between our experience of our own grief and of other people's — one that helps break down that suspicion. It makes us feel Agnes's anguish and Hamlet's melancholy as though they are our own. Putting the two next to each other, though, creates a tonal clash that brings our natural suspicion back into play. It makes it hard to avoid wondering if there isn't something wrong with the way either Hamlet or Hamnet shows us grief, if Hamlet isn't too esoteric or Hamnet isn't too crass and blunt.

Hamlet, with its immense artistry and its centuries-long legacy, is strong enough to withstand those moments of skepticism. But Hamnet is so new and so plain-spoken that it wavers under the weight of it. All of the film's power and energy is brought to bear through the sheer force of its pain, so that it has very little left to offer if its audience ceases to believe in it.

I don't know if Hamnet is great art. I am too close to it to tell. But despite its weaknesses, I don't think that it is disqualified from that title by its emotional force.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","SHRM, the world's largest HR group, has been hit with an $11.5 million verdict in a racial discrimination lawsuit","https://www.businessinsider.com/shrm-discrimination-lawsuit-verdict-11-million-racism-retaliation","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 00:19:00 GMT","

A jury on Friday issued an $11.5 million verdict against the world's largest HR organization over allegations it had racially discriminated and retaliated against a former employee.

The Society for Human Resource Management, known as SHRM, was found liable for racial discrimination and retaliation and hit with a ruling of $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million for punitive damages, according to Ariel DeFazio, a lawyer for the plaintiff.

SHRM said it plans to appeal the decision. ""Today's decision does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how SHRM operates,"" the trade group said in a statement. ""We have acted with integrity, transparency, and in full alignment with our values and obligations.""

SHRM was sued in 2022 by Rehab Mohamed, who worked at the trade group as an instructional designer from 2016 to 2020. The case was tried over the course of five days in a Colorado federal court.

""The optics are bad because they've held themselves out as an authority on best practices,"" said Alice K. Jump, an employment attorney and partner at law firm Reavis Page Jump.

Mohamed said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including SHRM's CEO, Johnny C. Taylor Jr., and its head of human resources, throughout the summer of 2020.

While testifying on December 4, Taylor said he wasn't involved in Mohamed's termination. A former SHRM employee, Mike Jackson, who said he was responsible for investigating the matter, told the court that Mohamed's was the only discrimination claim he had ever investigated.

In response to questions from Hunter Swain, another of Mohamed's lawyers, Jackson said that he left SHRM in 2021 and his title was manager of employee experience. He said he became a certified HR professional while employed there and that he had undergone one training session on HR investigations just a few months before the discriminatory events that Mohamed cited in her lawsuit took place.

When asked by Swain what he learned from the training, Jackson said he couldn't remember any specifics.

SHRM has consistently denied Mohamed's claims. In September, SHRM asked the court to bar Mohamed from introducing evidence or argument that the organization is a specialist in HR best practices.

The following month, US District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher denied SHRM's request, saying its ""asserted expertise in human resources is integral to the circumstances of this case and cannot reasonably be excluded.""

In his testimony, Taylor said SHRM's work includes advising HR professionals about best practices, including those pertaining to investigating internal complaints of discrimination and retaliation. He said SHRM has a set of curricula around best practices for investigating employment complaints.

The verdict was not surprising given that SHRM promotes itself as an expert in HR, Boston employment lawyer Evan Fray-Witzer told Business Insider. ""You're going to be held to a higher standard,"" he said.

In recent years, SHRM has been embroiled in various controversies, as Business Insider recently reported. These include a new attendance policy that penalizes workers who arrive even a minute after 9 a.m.; a memo about a ""conservative"" dress code that bans sequins; and a companywide meeting in which Taylor said some staffers were ""entitled,"" ""complacent,"" and ""sloppy.""

During pre-trial discovery for Mohamed's case, SHRM revealed the existence of two other discrimination complaints from employees. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. SHRM also denied wrongdoing in those cases.

""We are very happy that the jury spent a week listening very closely to the evidence and that they decided, as a result, to hold SHRM accountable,"" Mohamed's lawyer, DeFazio, told Business Insider. She said the verdict would ""send a message to workplaces in the entire country.""

Meta is delaying the release of new mixed reality glasses code-named ""Phoenix.""

The company planned to release the new device in the second half of 2026, but it is pushing back its timeline to the first half of 2027, Maher Saba, VP of Reality Labs Foundation, wrote in a Thursday memo to employees, which was seen by Business Insider.

In a separate memo, also viewed by Business Insider, metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns said moving the release date back is ""going to give us a lot more breathing room to get the details right.""

They added, ""There's a lot coming in hot with tight bring-up schedules and big changes to our core UX, and we won't compromise on landing a fully polished and reliable experience.""

Meta declined to comment.

The ""Phoenix"" mixed reality glasses, which were previously reported on by The Information, have a goggle-like form factor and are connected to a puck to help power them, according to two employees who have seen the device and spoke anonymously as they are not authorized to talk to the press.

The two employees said the model looks similar to Apple's mixed reality glasses Vision Pro. There was some skepticism among leaders about the puck, but they chose to keep it to help keep the glasses lighter and more comfortable, and to prevent it from overheating, they said.

Saba said in the memo that at a recent meeting with CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Reality Labs (RL) leaders received feedback on their plans for 2026, which he said ""focused on making the business sustainable and taking extra time to deliver our experiences with higher quality.""

""Based on that, many teams in RL will need to adjust their plans and timelines,"" he added. ""Extending timelines is not an opportunity for us to add more features or take on additional work.""

Meta also plans to release a new ""limited edition"" wearable device code-named ""Malibu 2"" in 2026, according to Saba.

Meta is starting work on its next-generation Quest device, a product that Aul and Cairns wrote will be focused on immersive gaming, and represent a ""large upgrade"" in capabilities from its existing devices, and ""significantly improve unit economics.""

In October, Meta reorganized its metaverse unit and tapped Aul, who led products for Meta Horizon, and Cairns, who was previously in charge of virtual reality hardware, to co-lead its efforts, Business Insider previously reported. The company is now considering budget cuts of up to 30% within its Reality Labs division, which could impact employees working on its virtual spaces platform, Horizon Worlds.

The company has also expanded its AI hardware push by acquiring Limitless, a startup that makes AI-powered pendant devices, the company announced Friday.

Mary Hannah Guyaux felt isolated when she chose to drop out of college.

She'd been diagnosed with epilepsy before graduating from high school in 2008. Guyaux, now 36, enrolled at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania and tried to balance college and her medical condition. However, she decided it was in her best interest to drop out after one semester.

Looking back, Guyaux doesn't regret that decision. But it was a difficult one to make in the moment.

""My family very much wanted me to stay and make the effort to continue doing it,"" Guyaux told Business Insider. ""It was definitely a big fork in the road in terms of choices, but I didn't feel like I was doing well or succeeding.""

Did you choose not to go to, or finish, college? What has your career trajectory looked like without a college degree? Share your story with this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.

After dropping out, Guyaux worked as a waitress in West Virginia until the restaurant closed. She started cleaning houses, and she grew the gig into a housekeeping business with her friend, which she operated until the pandemic.

She is now entering her fifth year of work at a construction company. She makes in the mid-five figures, and she said she's grateful for the life she has built with her husband.

Still, she said, entering the job market without a college degree wasn't easy.

""It has been surprising how, even with five years of experience in the field that I'm in and 10 years of experience running a small business, four years of being in college would get my foot further in the door than any of that,"" Guyaux said. ""And often I feel like my résumé just gets pushed to the side.""

Guyaux is among the millennials born between 1981 and 1996 who graduated from high school or college during the Great Recession. They faced a difficult labor market, whether they had a college degree or not.

Rising student debt loads and the increasing number of jobs that no longer require a degree in recent years have, however, sparked a shift in the way younger Americans perceive the value of higher education. Recent polling also shows that the percentage of Americans who view college as important has hit a new low.

Business Insider spoke to millennials without college degrees who gained fulfillment in their careers. While some said they've encountered hiring roadblocks due to the absence of a college degree, they wouldn't have done anything differently.

Guyaux said that while she's not necessarily passionate about her construction job, she's passionate about the life that it has provided for her.

""I live a very fulfilled life. I'm very blessed and very grateful for the life that I get to live,"" she said. ""I have a wonderful husband and great friends and some really silly dogs. And I would not make a different choice.""

Guyaux said that, despite being content with her employment, she would consider going back to school later in life. So would Audrey Serna, 33, who graduated from high school in 2010 and withdrew from college after two semesters.

Serna enrolled at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta but struggled to balance her schoolwork, social life, and part-time jobs. After she dropped out, she worked in the retail and restaurant industries, and she said she struggled to pay her bills and secure higher-paying jobs due to the lack of a college degree.

""I felt like a total failure,"" Serna told Business Insider. ""In the back of my mind, I always had the motivation to get out of this trap, but I just didn't quite know how.""

An added layer of stress for Serna was job hunting while pregnant, which she believes made employers hesitant to hire her. But knowing she had to financially support a child was a motivator for her, and she landed an entry-level payroll job in 2014, where she stayed until the pandemic. She was later recruited for her current role as a payroll operations manager, earning a six-figure salary.

""I tell my kids all the time, 'You don't have to go to college.' But if I had the opportunity to live a second life and I had the opportunity to go to school, then I would do it,"" Serna said. ""I think that education obviously is important, and I totally believe that college doesn't define your worth, but I do think it can make things easier.""

Data shows that amid changing perceptions on the value of a college degree, a higher education still pays off. The New York Federal Reserve wrote in an April blog post that the median worker with a college degree earned about $80,000 a year, compareed ot $47,000 for a worker with a high school diploma.

Raising a 7- and 11-year-old as a single mom, Serna doesn't have the time — or financial means — to go back to school right now, but she said she'd consider it down the road. Still, she said it's not required for a successful career.

""Never feel like because you didn't go to college, that you're less worthy or less than anybody else in the world, because that is just so far from the truth,"" Serna said.

Dropping out of college was Edith Marie Gillespie-Lorenzo's key to finding her passion for farming.

Gillespie-Lorenzo, 35, graduated from high school in 2008 and dropped out of the University of Massachusetts-Boston after a year. She recalled feeling at the time that college was the only acceptable option, so she enrolled; however, she struggled to maintain her grades while working part-time as a legal assistant at a law firm.

After dropping out, Gillespie-Lorenzo said she wasn't making enough money at the law firm to support herself. She knew that she enjoyed being outside and working with her hands, so she began searching for farm jobs and ultimately landed a part-time position in a vegetable field. That's where her passion for farming and agriculture ignited. Since it was seasonal work, she secured a full-time position in customer service at a mutual fund company, where she remained for seven years.

In 2021, she quit to pursue farming full-time, now working as a farm coordinator at a nonprofit in Massachusetts.

""It's my favorite thing in the world, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else,"" Gillespie-Lorenzo said.

She makes in the mid-five-figures, and she acknowledged that the low pay is challenging. She also said that she encountered times in her career where the absence of a college degree was a barrier to getting a higher starting salary or promotion. But to Gillespie-Lorenzo, money is not the priority for her right now — it's doing a job that brings her happiness.

Some high schools across the country are beginning to prioritize students' passions over college admissions. Business Insider recently visited a high school in rural Wyoming, for example, that presents college as just one of the options students can pursue postgrad, and helps equip them with the tools they need to take the path that's best for them, whether it's college, the workforce, or the military.

Looking back, the only regret Gillespie-Lorenzo has is not dropping out of college sooner.

""The world is so gigantic, and there are so many weird jobs that exist that colleges didn't even begin to cover,"" she said. ""Life is too short to do anything less than what you want to do.""

Go back a decade and most Americans had never heard of Huawei. Today, the Chinese telecom giant is a symbol of how quickly China can dominate a strategic technology sector and in the process create new national security and market threats for U.S. government and industry.

Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is now worried about another Chinese company that he predicts will eclipse Huawei in both scale and consequence: BGI. It is not building cell towers or smartphones for the 5G era. It is collecting DNA.

""If Huawei was big, BGI will be even bigger,"" Warner said at the CNBC CFO Council Summit in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.

BGI is one of the largest genomics companies in the world. It operates DNA sequencing laboratories in China and abroad. It processes genetic data for hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and researchers across dozens of countries, according to a recent report by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.

The company began as a Beijing-based research entity, the Beijing Genomics Institute, tied closely to China's national genome projects. It later expanded into a global commercial powerhouse, selling DNA sequencing, prenatal testing, cancer screening, and large-scale population genetic analysis, according to an NBC News report.

Through subsidiaries, BGI says it operates in the U.S. Europe, and Japan. In several countries, it helped built national genetic databases and pandemic testing systems.

U.S. intelligence officials believe that global footprint gives BGI access to one the largest collections of genetic data on Earth. Lawmakers have warned that genetic data is not just medical information. At scale, it becomes a strategic asset spurring a ""DNA arms race,"" according to a Washington Post report. DNA profiles can reveal ancestry, physical traits, disease risk, and family relationships, and when linked with artificial intelligence, the data can also be used for surveillance, tracking and long-term biological research tied to national security, according to the Washington Post's reporting.

At the CNBC event this week, Warner continued to press for more focus on BGI. ""They are hoovering up DNA data,"" Warner said. ""This level of experimentation on humans and intellectual property theft, we all should be concerned about it.""

Congressional investigators have previously warned that BGI maintains close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese military, according to a report from the House Select Committee on the CCP. They argue that China makes little distinction between commercial data and state security needs.

One of the biggest fears tied to BGI and China's broader biotech push is the possibility of a genetically enhanced soldier. U.S. officials have publicly claimed that China has explored human performance enhancement and military biotechnology. U.S. defense analysts say China's research spans population DNA collection, military databases, and AI-driven human performance modeling, according to a Wall Street Journal op-ed written by U.S. Director of the Central Intelligence Agency John Ratcliffe in 2020, when he was Director of National Intelligence during President Trump's first term.

Warner directly referenced those concerns this week.

""It's terrifying,"" Warner said. 

Warner described China as a great nation and great competitor, and as a former telecom executive (he was among the founders of Nextel), he said what Huawei was able to execute on — producing good products at inexpensive prices before the U.S. and Western competitors were prepared — is a cautionary tale. 

The BGI story looks uncomfortably familiar to Warner.

""Go back in time eight or nine years, and most people had never heard of Huawei,"" he said.

Huawei rose by combining massive state support, global market access and aggressive pricing, not only outcompeting Western firms on scale and cost, but positioning itself inside the world's telecom infrastructure before governments understood the security implications. Huawei was first placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019, which banned U.S. firms from selling some technology to the Chinese tech giant over national security concerns. Chip restrictions on Huawei have since become even stricter.

But Warner said by the time the U.S. moved to restrict Huawei, ""[we started to] lose a little."" 

Much of the 5G backbone had already been shaped by Chinese technology.

During a separate interview with Javers at the CNBC CFO Council Summit, the Republican Chairman of the House committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Michigan congressman John Moolenaar, said ""We've seen how they run the play of excess capacity, price manipulation, driving people out of business in different areas; they're going to continue to run that play,"" he said. ""We want to be friendly with China, but China is not our friend. They are our foremost adversary,"" he added.

The Soviet Union was a military and ideological competitor, but China, in tech domain after domain, Warner says — from telecom and 5G to AI, quantum computing and biotech — is a different kind of competitor.

Warner now sees BGI following a similar model in biotechnology. Like Huawei, BGI scaled rapidly with state support. The Washington, D.C.-based think tank Foundation of Defense of Democracies called upon lawmakers of both parties earlier this year to restrict BGI's access to U.S. institutions.

Congress has been trying to pass various versions of the BIOSECURE Act, which would limit the ability of Chinese biotechs to operate in the U.S. Some U.S. hospitals and research institutions with ties to Chinese genomics firms are under federal pressure, according to the Associated Press, though some medical professionals within the U.S. say they risk losing key research support for core medical goals. BGI told the AP that the bill is ""a false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security. We strictly follow rules and laws, and we have no access to Americans' personal data in any of our work,"" it said.

Warner said the U.S. intelligence apparatus has moved too slowly to recognize the biotech threat. He says that intelligence agencies focus too much on foreign governments and militaries, with less attention placed on commercial technology sectors. But in a world where technology supremacy is national security, Warner says more of our intelligence efforts need to reflect this shift.

Only in the past two to three years, he says, has the U.S. seriously expanded spying into AI, semiconductors, and biotechnology. Warner says we need a more ""advanced approach"" in this area, and he gave as one recent example when China's largest chipmaker SMIC stunned U.S. officials by producing a six-nanometer chip despite sweeping U.S. export controls. The breakthrough showed that Washington had underestimated both China's technical qualities and ability to work around restrictions. ""We got caught off guard with the SMIC six-nanometer chip,"" Warner said.

Warner is also worried that tracking China's tech rise requires a type of deep cooperation with U.S. allies that the Trump administration has squandered, such as the global intelligence-sharing network called the ""Five Eyes"" alliance.

Those relationships are now under strain, he said, and key partners including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France have gone public in saying they are reluctant to share intel with the U.S. ""They feel like we may be politicizing the intel product and that is not good news for America,"" Warner said.

Underlying his concerns about the technology competition with China in areas including AI and biotech is the U.S. ceding the global lead in standards setting. For decades, the U.S. shaped the rules for wireless networks, satellites, and internet infrastructure. That dominance help Americans lead global markets, Warner said, but now China is aggressively positioning itself as the international standards setter. 

Warner described the U.S. role in international bodies as one of the ""secret sauces"" in the era of America's dominance of the global economy and technology, allowing the U.S. to leverage innovations occurring around the globe, ""even if it didn't arise in America."" 

Across technology domains, influencing standards and protocols is critical to not only maintaining a competitive edge but also establishing ethical boundaries. ""Will it be us or the Chinese?"" Warner said. ""The Chinese come in with clearly a less humanist approach. It's been effective in lots of domains. We see it on standards-setting bodies. China floods the zone with lots of engineers, almost buying off the votes. We've got to reengage for American business and government,"" he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not attending the draw for the 2026 World Cup to receive a prize, but he got one anyway. 

Trump, who has campaigned aggressively this year for a Nobel Peace Prize, was given FIFA's inaugural peace prize for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world's biggest hotspots.

The former TV reality show host dominated the scene at Washington's Kennedy Center on Friday, placing himself squarely at the center of one of the biggest events in the sporting world in a glitzy, celebrity-studded affair that bore the unmistakable stamp of the president. 

The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will host the soccer tournament next year. The prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, and the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, were there, too, but it was Trump's show from start to finish.     

In a nod to Trump's love of spectacle, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who served as master of ceremonies, had the three leaders stand behind brightly colored podiums - game-show style - to draw their teams. After the draw, they all posed for a selfie with Infantino.  

""This will be unique, this will be stellar, this will be spectacular,"" Infantino said at the outset of the ceremony, referring to next year's games. But he could also have been talking about the Kennedy Center event itself, which was located in Washington at Trump's urging. 

Last month, FIFA announced that a new annual award called the FIFA Peace Prize would be presented at the draw to ""reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace.""         

A video prior to the presentation celebrated Trump for resolving the war in Gaza and trying to end Russia's war in Ukraine. The trophy, a gold-plated globe carried by upraised hands, was considerably larger than the Nobel, which is just a simple medal. Trump was given a medal as well and donned it as Infantino lauded him. The president deserved the award for ""promoting peace and unity around the world,"" he said. 

""This is truly one of the great honors of my life – and beyond,"" Trump said.  He took a moment to congratulate himself. The United States, he said, was ""not doing too well"" before he took office, but now ""we're the hottest country anywhere in the world.""    

Earlier, Trump told reporters he did not care about the prize, but noted that he had ""settled eight wars"" in his 10 months in office.     

""I don't need prizes. I need to save lives,"" Trump said. ""I saved millions and millions of lives, and that's really what I want to do.""    

The claim that Trump has ended eight wars this year is widely disputed. Much work remains before most of the conflicts the president claims to have ended, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, can actually be considered resolved.    

Trump received the award the same week his administration froze immigration applications from 19 countries after last week's shooting of two National Guard members in Washington. It also came days after the president demeaned Somali immigrants in the United States as ""garbage"" — sparking an outcry both at home and abroad.       

Trump has frequently made the trappings of the presidency a part of major sporting and cultural events this year. He attended the Super Bowl in February, to a mix of cheers and boos from the crowd, and on Sunday he plans to attend the Kennedy Center Honors, which he eschewed during his first term.     

The FIFA event — where 48 teams learned their group stage opponents — opened with Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing ""Nessun Dorma,"" a favorite of Trump's and a staple at his campaign rallies.     

Later, British pop star Robbie Williams and American Broadway chanteuse Nicole Scherzinger sang FIFA's 2026 World Cup anthem with highlights from past tournaments playing on a large video screen behind them.     

American sports stars Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal and Aaron Judge - none of them soccer players - also took part. Also on hand was Canadian hockey great Wayne Gretzky.     

The World Cup will be held from June 11-July 19, 2026, with a record 104 matches in 16 host cities.     

The spectacle ended with a live performance of the song ""YMCA"" by the Village People, the crowning touch for yet another event the president made his own.

The Trump administration will be expanding its ban on travel for citizens of certain countries to more than 30, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, in the latest restriction to come since a man from Afghanistan was accused of shooting two National Guard members.

The expansion would build on a travel ban already announced in June by the Republican administration, which barred travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries and restricted access to the U.S. for people from seven others. In a social media post earlier this week, Noem had suggested more countries would be included.

Noem, who spoke late Thursday in an interview with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham, would not provide further details, saying President Donald Trump was considering which countries would be included.

In the wake of the National Guard shooting, the administration already ratcheted up restrictions on the 19 countries included in the initial travel ban, which include Afghanistan, Somalia, Iran and Haiti, among others.

Ingraham asked Noem whether the travel ban was expanding to 32 countries and asked which countries would be added to the 19 announced earlier this year.

""I won't be specific on the number, but it's over 30. And the president is continuing to evaluate countries,"" Noem said.

""If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?"" Noem said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about when an updated travel ban might go into effect and which countries would be included in it.

Additions to the June travel ban are the latest in what has been a rapidly unfolding series of immigration actions since the shooting Thanksgiving week of two National Guard troops in Washington.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal, has been charged with first-degree murder after one of the two victims, West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, died of wounds sustained in the Nov. 26 shooting. The second victim, Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, was critically wounded. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

The Trump administration has argued that more vetting is needed to make sure people entering or already in the U.S. aren't a threat. Critics say the administration is traumatizing people who've already gone through extensive vetting to get to the U.S. and say the new measures amount to collective punishment.

Over the course of a little more than a week, the administration has halted asylum decisions, paused processing of immigration-related benefits for people in the U.S. from the 19 travel ban countries and halted visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

On Thursday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it was reducing the time period that work permits are valid for certain applicants such as refugees and people with asylum so they have to reapply more often and go through vetting more frequently.

The U.K. was the birthplace of commercial nuclear energy, but now generates just a fraction of its power from it — big investments are underway to change that.

The country once had more nuclear power stations than the U.S., USSR and France — combined. It was a global producer until 1970 but hasn't completed a new reactor since Sizewell B in 1995.

Today, the country takes the crown not for being a leader in atomic energy, but for being the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear projects.

Nuclear energy accounted for just 14% of the U.K.'s power supply in 2023, according to the most recent data from the International Energy Agency, trailing its European peers and well behind frontrunner France at 65%.

There is ambition to change that and have a quarter of the U.K.'s power come from nuclear by 2050. Nuclear is considered an attractive bet gas it's a low-carbon, constant energy source that can act as a baseload to complement intermittent sources like renewables. 

""There's a very clear momentum that has been observed,"" Doreen Abeysundra, founder of consultancy Fresco Cleantech, told CNBC. It's in part due to geopolitical tensions, which pushed energy security and independence onto public agendas.

However, the U.K.'s Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce called for urgent reforms after identifying ""systemic failures"" in the country's nuclear framework. It found that fragmented regulation, flawed legislation and weak incentives led the U.K. to fall behind as a nuclear powerhouse. The government committed to implementing the taskforce's guidance and is expected to present a plan to do so within three months.  

The U.K. is spreading its bets across tried-and-tested large nuclear projects and smaller, next-generation reactors known as small module reactors (SMRs). 

British company Rolls-Royce has been selected as the country's preferred partner for SMRs, which are effectively containerized nuclear reactors designed to be manufactured in a factory. Many include passive cooling techniques, which supporters argue makes them safer and cheaper.

Nuclear has long come under fire by environmentalists due to radioactive waste and disasters like Chernobyl. Indeed, the U.K.'s first commercial plant Windscale became its worst nuclear accident in history when it melted down in 1957.

Most SMRs use light water reactor technology – think of the planned large-scale nuclear plant Sizewell C, just ""shrunk down,"" said Abeysundra – which is tried and tested.

Other designs, known as ""advanced"" reactors, are more experimental. For example, those that change the cooling solution or solvent, which is typically used in the process of separating and purifying nuclear materials. 

The U.K.'s first SMR will be at Wylfa, in Wales, though no timeline has been given for its completion. The site will house three SMRs and grow over time. 

In September, the country signed a deal with the U.S. to enable stronger commercial ties on nuclear power and streamline licensing for firms that want to build on the opposite side of the Atlantic. 

However, ""the first thing is, there is not, at the moment, a single SMR actively producing electricity under four revenues. They will all come at best in the 30s,"" Ludovico Cappelli, portfolio manager of Listed Infrastructure at Van Lanschot Kempen, told CNBC. 

While SMRs are a ""game changer"" thanks to their ability to power individual factories or small towns, their days of commercial operation are too far away, he said. From an investment standpoint, ""that is still a bit scary,"" he added. 

To secure the large baseloads needed to offset the intermittency of renewables, ""we're still looking at big power stations,"" added Paul Jackson, Invesco's EMEA global market strategist.  

SMRs ""probably"" do have a role — ""they can clearly be more nimble"" — but it will take time to roll them out, Jackson said, casting doubt on the U.K.'s ability to be a leader in nuclear, as France and China are already miles ahead. 

The U.K. government body Great British Energy-Nuclear is set to identify sites for an additional large-scale plant, having already acquired one in Gloucestershire, in the west of England, as well as the site in Wales. 

""We are reversing a legacy of no new nuclear power being delivered to unlock a golden age of nuclear, securing thousands of good, skilled jobs and billions in investment,"" a spokesperson for the U.K. government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told CNBC.

""Sizewell C will deliver clean electricity for the equivalent of six million of today's households for at least six decades, and the UK's first small modular reactors at Wylfa will power the equivalent of three million homes, bringing energy security,"" they added. 

The U.K. has a strong legacy to build on. It pioneered fresh funding mechanisms to make large-scale nuclear projects investible so that they are less reliant on direct government funding, such as a Contract for Differences, which was used for Hinkley Point C.

The mechanism guarantees a fixed price for the electricity generated over a long period of time in order to de-risk investments in an industry that's known for running over time and budget. Hinkley Point C was initially expected to cost £18 billion (over $24 billion) but the bill has slowly crept up.  

""That fixes one part of the equation, the price risk,"" Cappelli said of nuclear investments, but the second risk is construction delays.  

The Regulated Asset Base (RAB), first used for nuclear at Sizewell C, attempts to reconcile this. Investors get paid from the day they cut a check for a nuclear project, rather than the day it starts operating. Sizewell C is expected to cost £38 billion to build. 

Private market investors are increasingly interested in next-generation nuclear as a way to offset soaring energy demands from AI, resulting in a host of young companies trying to build out facilities. Perhaps the most famous is Oklo, a U.S. firm that was taken public by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman.

The U.K.'s advanced modular reactor hopeful Newcleo, which uses lead for cooling, moved its headquarters from London to Paris in 2024 — a strategic move to deepen its European footprint. At the time, it told World Nuclear News that it still plans to have a commercial reactor up and running in the U.K. by 2033, but the firm has since scaled back its British efforts.  

Meanwhile, Tokamak Energy and First Light Fusion call the U.K. home. They both focus on nuclear fusion, the process of generating power by combining atoms, though this technology is yet to get out of the lab. All of today's nuclear power comes from fission, where atoms are spit. The U.K. announced £2.5 billion for a world-first fusion prototype in June. 

The U.K. faces challenges in access to relevant talent, which is crucial for scaling projects effectively. The country is heralded for its world-class universities and technical know-how, ""but that is very much book knowledge,"" said Van Lanschot Kempen's Cappelli.  

""What we need is real on-the-ground expertise, and that we are probably lacking for the simple reason that we haven't been doing it for a very long time,"" he said.

For Abeysundra, there's one area where the U.K. stands out: its mindset. ""There is so much knowledge, innovation, and that can-do attitude, which I don't see as much in other nations,"" she said, pointing to the U.K.'s trailblazing role in the Industrial Revolution and establishment of offshore wind energy. 

The U.K. government positioned nuclear energy as a key element of the future clean energy workforce in its Clean Energy Jobs Plan released in October, while its national roadmap for nuclear skills, set out in 2024, focuses on apprenticeships, PhDs and upskilling mid-career workers. Industry-led initiatives such as the Energy Skills Passport also support the likes of oil and gas workers to gain green skills.

Perhaps the toughest issue, however, is the supply chain.  

Uranium, the fuel used to make a nuclear reaction, is dominated by just four countries, including Russia. Global demand for uranium could rise by nearly a third by 2030 and more than double by 2040, according to the World Nuclear Association, adding further reliance on a select few countries and pressure on developers.  

The U.K. government has allocated funding to build up the supply chain and has committed to preventing the import of nuclear fuel from Russia by 2028. Fuel for Sizewell C will come from European or ""Western suppliers,"" Cappelli noted. 

However, for him, it poses the question: How secure is nuclear energy really? ""We have to build nuclear power plants, but we need to build the value chain,"" Cappelli added. 

Workers, expertise and funding are required for nuclear energy, but the supply chain is also key, he said. Otherwise, there will be ""the same issues that we had with gas,"" a nod to the U.K.'s reliance on just one supplier. Instead of gas, it will be with uranium.

Elon Musk's SpaceX, is initiating a secondary share sale that would give the company a valuation of up to $800 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

SpaceX is also telling some investors it will consider going public possibly around the end of next year, the report said. 

At the elevated price, Musk's aerospace and defense contractor would be valued above ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which wrapped up a share sale at a $500 billion valuation in October. 

SpaceX has been investing heavily in reusable rockets, launch facilities and satellites, while competing for government contracts with newer space players, including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. SpaceX is far ahead, and operates the world's largest network of satellites in low earth orbit through Starlink, which powers satellite internet services under the same brand name.

A SpaceX IPO would include its Starlink business, which the company previously considered spinning out.

Musk recently discussed whether SpaceX would go public during Tesla's annual shareholders meeting last month. Musk, who is the CEO of both companies, said he doesn't love running publicly traded businesses, in part because they draw ""spurious lawsuits,"" and can ""make it very difficult to operate effectively.""

However, Musk said during the meeting that he wanted to ""try to figure out some way for Tesla shareholders to participate in SpaceX,"" adding, ""maybe at some point, SpaceX should become a public company despite all the downsides.""

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Roughly 1 in 7 people are leaving unclaimed property on the table, according to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. While the recent heavy selling in bitcoin and ether is rightly getting all the short-term attention, this estate planning issue is a longer-term one that's likely to be exacerbated as crypto adoption and ownership increase. 

Many people neglect to account for cryptocurrency in their estate plans, or they don't let their heirs know how to access their crypto holdings. With surveys in recent years from Gallup and Pew Research estimating that 14% to 17% of U.S. adults have owned cryptocurrency, losing access to those funds is a growing concern.

""Leaving property or mutual funds behind in a will is pretty cut and dried, but with more and more assets placed in cryptocurrency, a large share of inherited assets are in danger of forfeiture,"" said Azriel Baer, partner in the estate planning and administration group at law firm Farrell Fritz. 

This issue could be mitigated, in part, by crypto ETFs, which are gaining popularity with investors since the first batch of spot bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC in 2024, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), followed a few months later by ethereum spot price ETFs, such as the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ETF (FETH). These ETFs allow investors access to the crypto asset class without actually owning crypto outright, helping reduce the chances of actual crypto getting lost.

Nevertheless, estate planning mistakes among crypto owners are common and can be avoided. Here are some of the biggest issues cryptocurrency owners need to tackle sooner rather than later.  

Only 24% of Americans have a will that describes how they want their money and estate managed after their death, according to a survey from Caring.com. Even people who have wills in place have not updated them for many years, with nearly one in four Americans saying they haven't touched their wills since their original was drafted, according to the survey.

This can be problematic for many reasons. An old will may no longer reflect people's current wishes. In a crypto-specific context, anyone who hasn't updated their estate plan in the past several years may not have language to provide legal authority for the trustee or executor to gain access to digital assets.

""It's very common for people not to update their estate planning documents for 10, 20 years or sometimes longer. If that's the case, you're behind,"" said Patrick D. Owens, shareholder at Buchalter and a member of the law firm's tax, benefits and estate planning practice group.

Absent language about digital assets, your heirs might have to go to court to get the authority for the executor or administrator of the estate to gain access to the crypto assets. Most likely they'll get access, ""but it's a hassle,"" Owens said. ""Obviously, it means time and money going into court.""

A standard will is appropriate for many people, but many attorneys recommend clients also utilize a revocable living trust as part of their estate plan. Drafting a will is less expensive, but a revocable living trust offers more privacy and can help limit the time and expense of the probate process after death.

Baer advises clients to transfer their crypto to a revocable living trust so the trustee has immediate access upon the owner's death. It could be six to eight months, or more, before a will is settled in probate and in the meantime, heirs wouldn't have access to the assets. If the price of the crypto was going down rapidly, for example, they would have to wait to sell it if the estate was caught up in probate. Putting crypto assets into a revocable trust to avoid probate can prevent a lot of headaches, he said. 

Generally, a revocable trust is paired with a pour-over will so that assets not included in the trust at the time of a person's death are transferred to the trust and distributed accordingly. 

You don't have to tell heirs you're worth a fortune in bitcoin before you pass away, but you should make sure they know how to access your crypto after you're gone. 

Baer worked on an estate where tens of millions of dollars in crypto were lost to the heirs because they didn't know the decedent's private keys, which function as digital passwords to grant access to cryptocurrency funds and prove ownership of blockchain assets.

Someone should know how to access the assets, whether through written instructions in a safe box, a safe at home, or directions kept with a lawyer or with one of the various crypto inheritance services that help ensure crypto assets are passed on to your family members, Baer said. Don't put these private keys or other sensitive information in a will, because wills become public through the probate process, he added.

The person you chose to handle your other assets may not be the right person to deal with the crypto portion of your estate.

Not everyone understands crypto, the associated volatility or how to transact with digital currency, meaning lots of money can inadvertently be lost. The recent volatility in the price of bitcoin is a reminder that if you name someone who needs weeks to get up to speed on how to transact with bitcoin, the financial losses could be meaningful, Baer said. ""Uncle Bob may be a great person, but he may have more challenges transacting with an asset class he's totally not familiar with,"" he added.

Sometimes, even institutional trustees might not be able to take on the responsibility for crypto. Owens had a client pass away with half a million dollars in bitcoin and ether. The institutional trustee who oversaw the client's account refused to take on the responsibility for the crypto and a special trustee was named. Luckily, the client had a nephew who took on the role, but finding a suitable replacement can often be costly from a time and money perspective, Owens said. 

With the massive explosion in the values around cryptocurrency, many people have large crypto holdings, which could be subject to significant taxes, whether that's income taxes or estate taxes, and failure to plan could be detrimental to their families, said Jonathan Forster, shareholder at law firm Weinstock Manion.

There could, for example, be estate taxes due, depending on the size of the estate. The federal estate tax exemption for 2025 is $13.99 million per individual. Some states also have a state-level estate tax.

Knowing the impact crypto ownership might have on your estate is an important consideration while you are alive. Forster has clients whose crypto holdings are worth more than $50 million. They wanted an efficient way to make gifts for the benefit of their children to get some money out of their estate. They created a limited liability corporation, transferred the crypto into the LLC and gifted an interest in the LLC to an irrevocable trust for the benefit of minor children with an independent trustee, Forster said. 

Many crypto investors fail to keep track of cost basis, which can be problematic for many reasons, including if you're considering gifting digital assets during your lifetime. If you want to gift the assets while you're alive, you need to have the basis so the recipient can properly account for the crypto if it's eventually sold, Baer said. ""It can be onerous to keep track of basis, but it's important,"" he said.

Oops, something went wrong

Professor Andrew Urquhart is Professor of Finance and Financial Technology and Head of the Department of Finance at Birmingham Business School (BBS).

This is the tenth installment of the Professor Coin column, in which I bring important insights from published academic literature on cryptocurrencies to the Decrypt readership. In this article, I discuss how crypto's relationship with equities has evolved.

Not so long ago, Bitcoin was marketed as the ultimate diversifier—an asset supposedly immune to whatever was happening in equity markets. Early academic work backed that up: Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) showed that major cryptocurrencies had minimal exposure to standard stock, bond and FX risk factors, and that their returns were mainly driven by crypto-specific forces like momentum and investor attention, not equity markets.

Fast-forward to the last couple of years, and that story looks very different. A growing literature now finds that crypto and equities are tightly intertwined, especially during stress. For a fintech audience, the key message is simple: you can't treat crypto as “off-grid” risk anymore. It behaves more and more like a high-beta tech sector—with some nasty tail behaviour on top.

A recent survey by Adelopo et al (2025) and co-authors reviews the evidence on how cryptocurrencies interact with traditional financial markets. They document clear time-varying and non-linear linkages between crypto and stock markets, with particularly strong connections during major macro and geopolitical events like COVID-19 or the Russia–Ukraine war.

Studies looking specifically at technology and blockchain-linked stocks confirm this. Umar et al (2021) finds strong connectedness between cryptocurrency markets and the technology sector while Frankovic (2022) shows that Australian “cryptocurrency-linked stocks” experience significant return spillovers from crypto prices, especially for firms more deeply involved in blockchain activity. In other words, listed equity is now a transmission channel for crypto risk.

Several recent papers make the “crypto ↔ equity” link very explicit:

Global spillovers: Vuković (2025) uses a Bayesian Global VAR to show that adverse shocks originating in the cryptocurrency market depress stock markets, bond indices, exchange rates and volatility indices across a wide set of countries—not just the U.S.

Equity–crypto co-movement: Ghorbel and co-authors (2024) study connectedness between major cryptocurrencies, G7 stock indices and gold. They find that cryptocurrencies have become important senders and receivers of shocks, with stronger ties to equities in recent years and particularly during turbulent periods.

U.S. and Chinese stock markets: Lamine et al (2024) examine spillovers between U.S./Chinese equities, cryptocurrencies and gold. They find significant dynamic risk spillovers from crypto to these stock markets, again concentrated in high-volatility episodes.

Exchange-level contagion: Sajeev et al (2022) document a contagion effect of Bitcoin on major stock exchanges (NSE India, Shanghai, London and Dow Jones), using volatility spillover and correlation analysis from 2017–2021.

International organisations tell a similar story. An IMF departmental paper on “Spillovers Between Crypto and Equity Markets” finds that Bitcoin shocks can explain a non-trivial share (roughly mid-teens percent) of variation in global equity volatility, and that this influence has strengthened over time as institutional and derivative markets matured.

The common conclusion: crypto is now firmly embedded in the global risk ecosystem.

Professor Coin: How Crypto Derivatives Have Impacted Digital Markets

Why does Bitcoin now look so much like a high-beta tech stock?

Duration and interest-rate sensitivity: Both crypto and growth equities are essentially claims on uncertain future cash flows or network value. When real rates rise, discount factors bite hard—and both sectors sell off together.

Investor base and leverage: Retail trading, momentum strategies and derivatives are heavily used in both arenas. Products like futures, options and leveraged ETFs allow shocks in one market to be magnified and replicated in the other.

Institutional portfolio construction: As crypto has been added to multi-asset and hedge-fund portfolios, its returns inevitably become entangled with traditional cross-asset positioning. When funds de-risk, everything in the “risky bucket” goes out together.

Professor Coin: Do Managed Crypto Funds Outperform the Market?

For portfolio construction, the message is uncomfortable but clear:

Crypto does diversify in quiet periods—correlations can still be modest in benign regimes.

But during stress, when diversification is most valuable, correlations and spillovers spike.

Bitcoin and major altcoins behave less like “digital gold” and more like levered proxies for global risk sentiment.

That doesn't make crypto useless as an investment—but it does mean that treating a 5–10% crypto allocation as “uncorrelated upside” is no longer defensible based on the data.

Going forward, one open question for both academics and practitioners is whether spot ETFs and broader institutional adoption will further tighten these linkages, or whether a new use-case (such as genuine payment or settlement adoption) could create more idiosyncratic drivers again.

For now, the evidence points in one direction: when global markets catch a cold, crypto doesn't sit it out anymore—it coughs along with everything else.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Industry Leader Shares Why Ethereum Price Will Reach $12,000","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:a204c146d094b:0-industry-leader-shares-why-ethereum-price-will-reach-12-000/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 15:00:43 GMT","

Industry leader Tom Lee has shared how the Ethereum price could reach $12,000 within the next few months. He based his prediction on the Bitcoin price action and how ETH could match the flagship crypto on a potential run to the upside. 

Tom Lee Explains How The Ethereum Price Could Rally To $12,000

Speaking at the Binance Blockchain Week, Tom Lee predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $12,000 as Bitcoin rallies to $250,000 within the next few months. He explained that ETH can reach the $12,000 target if the ETH/BTC ratio returns to its eight-year average of 0.0479. Lee described this potential rally to $12,000 as a “huge move.”

Tom Lee further predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $22,000 if the ETH/BTC ratio gets to its 2021 high of 0.0873. He added that he believes Ethereum will become the future of finance and the payment rails. As such, Lee predicted that the ETH/BTC ratio could reach 0.2500, sparking an Ethereum rally to as high as $62,500. In line with this, the expert declared that ETH at $3,000 is “grossly undervalued.”

Tom Lee also remarked that the bigger the base, the bigger the breakout for the Ethereum price. He noted that ETH spent years building a similar base to its current price action before the move from $90 to its previous all-time high (ATH) of $4,866. The expert added that if the pattern plays out again, the next leg could be larger than what people expect. 

It is worth noting that Tom Lee is the chairman of BitMine, which is the largest Ethereum treasury company. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, the company currently holds 3.73 million ETH, which is just over 3% of the altcoin's total supply. Lee remains bullish on the Ethereum price, despite his company holding an unrealized loss of $3.3 billion of their ETH investment. 

A Rally To $62,000 Is “Ambitious”

Market commentator Milk Road described Tom Lee's Ethereum price prediction of $62,000 in a few months as being ambitious. The platform stated that an ETH/BTC ratio of 0.25 has never happened. The highest it has ever gone is 0.15, and that was during the 2017 supercycle, which makes it less likely now, given that market conditions have changed. 

Tom Lee had based his Ethereum prediction on Bitcoin hitting $250,000, which Milk Road also described as an issue. The market commentator noted that BTC would need to surge 177% from current prices to reach this target. The last time this happened was in 2020 when it surged from $7,000 to $19,000 during the “peak mania.” Notably, BTC didn't record a 100% gain even when the Bitcoin ETFs launched last year. 

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,000, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin's price couldn't maintain above $92,000, and the recent rejection at that level pushed it south hard to just over $88,000 yesterday.

Most altcoins have followed suit, with almost all charts deep in the red today. ZEC and CC lead on the way south.

The new month began on the wrong foot yet again for the largest cryptocurrency. The asset had recovered some ground following the November crash and stood above $91,000. However, the bears returned on Monday and initiated a violent leg down that drove BTC to just under $84,000.

After losing more than seven grand in hours, bitcoin bounced off almost as quickly and reclaimed the $90,000 line by Tuesday. Moreover, it kept climbing in the following days and challenged the $94,000 resistance on a couple of occasions.

However, it couldn't penetrate that level, and the subsequent retracement drove it to the $91,000-$92,000 range. That was until Friday, when the bears took control of the market again after the release of the US PCE and Core PCE data.

BTC dumped to $88,000 in minutes, dragging the altcoins with it and triggering $500 million in liquidations. It has bounced since then, but it's still below $90,000 as of press time. Its market cap has dropped to $1.8 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands above 57% on CG.

Most larger-cap alts are in the red as well today. Ethereum is inches above $3,000 after a 3.4% decline, while XRP is close to breaking below $2.00 after another 2% drop. SOL, ADA, LINK, HYPE, DOGE, and XLM are with losses of up to 5%, while SUI, ENA, PEPE, UNI, and DOT have dropped by 6-7%.

Even more profound losses come from ZEC and CC, both of which have dumped by double digits. In contrast, BCH and TRX have posted minor gains.

The total crypto market cap has shed around $60 billion in a day and is down to $3.130 trillion on CG.

About us

The CEO of a $15 trillion Wall Street giant just called traditional finance “really kind of scary.” 

Abigail Johnson, who runs Fidelity, says the current financial system is the most complicated web of basically reconciliation processes built on “primitive technology” — and that blockchain will eventually replace it.

But it won't be an easy path. 

“It's got to be an evolutionary process and it'll be some combination of competitive forces and regulatory standards that will kind of push it kicking and screaming along,” Johnson said at an A16Z crypto event on December 4.

Johnson's critique reveals how even traditional finance leaders see the current system as fundamentally broken. The industry is trapped at the “lowest common denominator” of decades-old technology, with a combination of inertia and the inability of smaller players to upgrade that's keeping everything intact. 

Cue blockchain, a technology that Johnson has been betting on since 2013. 

But enthusiastic blockchain adoption alone won't push the industry, according to Johnson. 

Instead, it will be a forced migration. 

For one, competitive forces means that institutions who don't upgrade lose market share to those that do. If one bank offers instant settlement with a blockchain while competitors take three days using legacy systems, customers will move their business. If one brokerage can custody Bitcoin while another can't, advisors and clients interested in crypto assets will go elsewhere.

Fidelity, with Johnson at the helm, experienced those headwinds firsthand. 

The firm faced “surprisingly immature but very loud” anti-crypto sentiment from traditional finance leaders for years, Johnson said. “I just had to be patient and keep going and that the noise would pass.”

Indeed, the noise has passed. 

In the past year, some of Wall Street's biggest banks have begun to experiment with crypto, while digital asset treasuries and exchange-traded funds have deployed billions to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. 

Then there's regulatory standards. These mean governments mandate improvements for the characteristics that blockchain enables — be it transparency, settlement speed, or interoperability. 

Across the world, regulation is already coming into effect. In the US, the Genius Act is already operating while the market structure bill, dubbed Clarity Act, awaits approval from the Senate, hopefully by early 2026. And in Europe, MiCA has been active since late 2024. 

At its core, the problem isn't necessarily that financial institutions don't want to upgrade. It's that they can't. 

“There's a real kind of existential challenge for the industry because at least some of the bigger players would like to upgrade the broader infrastructure a little faster,” Johnson said. 

“But the industry is a democratic place and there's a lot of small players who just don't have the wherewithal to participate in that kind of an upgrade.”

Since everything is interconnected, the weakest link determines the system's overall capabilities. And that weakest link is stuck on decades-old technology. 

Fidelity has been betting on blockchain for over a decade. 

In 2013, the firm pioneered Bitcoin custody services for its clients, while setting up mining operations. Fidelity's Bitcoin mining outlet, in fact, has given the firm “probably the highest single highest ROI business” Johnson said.

The company's ETF, FBTC, holds the second most Bitcoin after BlackRock, with around $20 billion in assets under management, according to Dune Analytics. 

Fidelity recently launched a tokenised money market fund designed to interoperate with stablecoins, allowing clients to earn yield then flip into crypto when needed. And in mid November, the firm saw its new Solana ETF debut. 

Still, Johnson admitted she underestimated how long the transition would take.

“I didn't fully appreciate how slow change really is in our traditional business because there's just so many forces that keep everybody kind of together and tight doing what they've always been doing,” she said.

Instead of treating digital assets as a side industry, the city is weaving them into day-to-day governance in an effort to modernize payments, attract talent, and escape long-standing financial bottlenecks.

One of the city's newest initiatives lets residents pay certain local taxes using multiple cryptocurrencies – Dogecoin included. The choice caught global attention not because of the payment rails themselves, but because a meme token has now been given a real administrative role. In a country where traditional banking is slow and often restrictive, the additional option is meaningful.

doge is everywherehttps://t.co/KRVhwCG78l

— Dogecoin (@dogecoin) December 5, 2025



What makes the initiative unusual is that Buenos Aires is pairing adoption with mandatory public education. Through a joint program with Binance, residents can attend workshops explaining how wallets work, how to avoid scams, and how blockchain fits into everyday financial habits like savings or remittances. City officials argue that widespread understanding is essential if digital tools are going to support public services rather than create new risks.

While Argentina's capital is working on payments, other countries are exploring different types of blockchain infrastructure. Japan, for instance, is evaluating the XRP Ledger as a potential backbone for a national digital-ID system – an ambitious step that could reshape how citizens verify credentials or access government services. If implemented, analysts say it would be one of the largest zero-knowledge deployments ever attempted by a government.

The broader takeaway is simple: governments aren't just watching crypto anymore. They're beginning to build with it. Whether through municipal tax systems, nationwide identity frameworks, or partnerships with private firms, blockchain is steadily moving from speculative asset category to practical public-sector technology.

An international arrest warrant has been requested for Hayden Davis, co-creator of the LIBRA token, which became the center of a major political scandal in Argentina.

Argo Blockchain has successfully paid off a $35 million loan from Galaxy Digital, which it took out in 2022 to avoid bankruptcy during a tough period for cryptocurrencies.

Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has officially vetoed House Bill 2324, a legislative proposal that aimed to create a state-managed reserve fund for holding seized cryptocurrency assets.

Arizona's latest attempt to integrate digital assets into its public finance system faced a mixed outcome this week.

Arizona's bid to become the first U.S. state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves has been shut down.

In an effort to broaden its investor base, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) will undergo a 3-for-1 stock split on June 16, making shares more affordable for everyday investors.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest doubled down on its crypto exposure this week, snapping up 240,507 shares of BitMine (BMNR) worth roughly $9 million across three of its exchange-traded funds - even as the stock slid nearly 10% on Thursday.

Ark Invest has made another significant purchase of Coinbase shares, acquiring a total of 64,358 shares for $11.5 million on Monday, as the stock plummeted by 17.6% during a turbulent market session.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has shaken up its portfolio by snapping up $2.2 million worth of Coinbase shares, signaling a renewed focus on the major crypto exchange.

eToro's entrance to the Nasdaq was met with enthusiasm on Wednesday, as shares surged nearly 30% by market close — and Ark Invest wasted no time getting in on the action.

ARK Invest has continued to capitalize on the dramatic rise of Circle's stock, unloading a sizable portion of its holdings just weeks after the stablecoin issuer's public debut.

Ark Invest sold 12,077 shares of Coinbase—valued at $2.7 million—from its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) on Wednesday.

Ark Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has significantly increased its stake in Robinhood by purchasing 45,792 shares, valued at over $800,000, during a recent market downturn.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is doubling down on crypto exposure, ramping up its purchases of Coinbase and Bitcoin-linked ETFs as the firm positions for what it believes will be a near-term easing in market stress.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has expanded its position in Tom Lee's Ether treasury firm BitMine, while trimming one of its long-standing bets on Tesla.

Circle's arrival on the New York Stock Exchange sent shockwaves through the market, and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest wasted no time jumping in.

ARK Invest has quietly deepened its exposure to Solana by adding a staked SOL investment to two of its tech-focused ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the blockchain's long-term potential.

On Monday, Ark Invest sold 44,609 shares of its spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund ARKB worth $2.8 million from its ETF Next Generation Internet (ARKW).

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest spent the past week lightening its stake in Circle Internet Group just as the stable-coin issuer's share price went vertical.

On Thursday, Ark Invest, led by Kathy Wood, made some interesting trades, the most significant of which was the sale of Tesla Inc (TSLA) shares.

Key Takeaways

Dogecoin is a simple, meme-inspired cryptocurrency created in 2013 that grew into a well-known digital asset with a loyal community.

The Dogecoin price often moves quickly, so it can offer opportunities but also comes with higher risk than many other coins.

Dogecoin differs from Bitcoin by being faster, cheaper, and more playful, which makes it easier for beginners to use and understand.

You can buy Dogecoin on major crypto exchanges and store it in an exchange wallet or a private wallet for full control.

What is Dogecoin, and why are you still hearing so much about it? If you've watched the Dogecoin price jump one day and dip the next, you might wonder why this coin gets so much attention. Before you invest your money or even think about adding it to your wallet, you deserve a clear picture of what you're getting into.

In this article, we walk you through what Dogecoin is and why people still talk about it. Read on to see what sets Dogecoin apart, what drives its value, and whether it could be a smart addition to your investment plans.



Dogecoin is a digital currency that started as a light-hearted project but grew into one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies in the world. If you've seen the Shiba Inu dog meme, you already know the face of Dogecoin. The simple Dogecoin definition is that it's a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that lets you send money online quickly and at a low cost.

What started as a joke soon developed into a strong community, and people began using it for online tips and charity projects. As more people joined the Dogecoin community, interest in the Dogecoin price increased, and news outlets started covering its fast jumps and dips. Today, Dogecoin feels much bigger than a meme coin. You'll see people trading it, talking about it, and testing different ways to use it. Understanding where it came from helps you see why it still gets so much attention.

If you understand cryptocurrency basics, you'll find that Dogecoin operates in a simple and approachable way. Dogecoin runs on its own blockchain, which is a public record of every transaction. Whenever you send or get Dogecoin, the network records that movement on the Dogecoin blockchain, so everyone can confirm it's valid.

Dogecoin uses a method called mining, where computers solve quick math problems to keep the network running. When Dogecoin miners do this work, they earn new Dogecoin as a reward. This steady flow of new coins is one reason Dogecoin stays fast and affordable to use. You don't wait long for a transaction to finish, and the fees are usually low.

Because of this design, Dogecoin feels easy for everyday use. Many people use it to tip creators online, support charities, or make quick peer-to-peer payments. When you explore what is Dogecoin used for, you'll see that its speed, low cost, and friendly community make it stand out from more complex digital coins. If you're curious about how Dogecoin fits into your own plans, knowing how it works gives you a clear foundation to build on.



Dogecoin's popularity did not appear overnight. It grew from a mix of internet culture, community energy, and high-profile attention that most cryptocurrencies never experience. When you look at the Dogecoin price and see how often it makes news, it helps to understand the deeper story behind its rise. Even people who explore other digital trends, such as learning how to start buying NFTs, often come across Dogecoin because of its strong online presence. Here is the reason for popularity:

Memes played a major part in shaping Dogecoin's identity. At a time when most cryptocurrencies felt technical and serious, Dogecoin felt warm, humorous, and welcoming. Many people connected with it instantly because the meme was already well known across social platforms.

That meme origin created a friendly environment that made Dogecoin easy to share, easy to laugh about, and easy to join. People who felt overwhelmed by the complexity of other digital coins found Dogecoin simple and enjoyable. It gave them a way to take part in the crypto world without pressure. Early users often tipped creators online, supported small community causes, or sent Dogecoin as a fun gesture in group discussions.

Elon Musk became one of the strongest forces behind Dogecoin's rise, and his impact is easy to trace through real events. In early 2021, he posted several tweets that mentioned Dogecoin by name. One of the most widely shared messages simply said Dogecoin is the people's crypto, and it quickly pushed trading activity to new highs.

Later that same year, Musk continued to bring attention to Dogecoin during interviews and online conversations. When he appeared on Saturday Night Live, people around the world watched to see whether he would mention the coin. He did, which added even more publicity and contributed to another wave of trading activity. Investors were not reacting only to humor.  In 2022 and 2023, Musk hinted that Dogecoin could be used in future payment features across some of his companies. 



Dogecoin's value has changed many times since its early days, and those changes tell an important story. When you look at how far the coin has come, you can see how community support, cultural moments, and market activity all shaped its place in the crypto world. Understanding the history behind these movements helps you see why Dogecoin still attracts attention, alongside other major cryptos like Ethereum.

Dogecoin began in 2013 when Jackson Palmer from Adobe and Billy Markus from IBM created the coin as a playful way to comment on the growing hype around cryptocurrencies. They launched it on December 6, 2013, and within a few weeks, the Dogecoin price jumped sharply. On December 19 of that year, the coin rose more than 300 percent after China restricted its banks from working with cryptocurrencies. The attention brought in new users, and the coin quickly spread across online communities.

The original code for Dogecoin came from Luckycoin, which was based on Litecoin. Early versions even offered a random Dogecoin mining reward before switching to a fixed reward in 2014. Dogecoin uses Scrypt technology and a proof of work system, which helps miners support the network and keep it running.

Over time, interest kept growing. In 2019, Dogecoin reached another milestone when it was listed on the major exchange Binance. By May 2024, its market value had reached more than 24 billion dollars. Dogecoin stayed active because of its loyal miners, strong community, and simple design. The community honored Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind the famous Doge meme, after the dog passed away in 2024. Many supporters, including Elon Musk, shared messages that renewed public interest.

Buying Dogecoin is a simple process, and once you know the steps, you can move through it with confidence. If you are new to crypto, you will find that most platforms follow the same basic setup, and you can get started in just a few minutes. Even if you have explored the best NFT marketplace options or other digital assets before, buying Dogecoin follows a straightforward path that feels easy to understand.

Step 1: Sign up for a crypto exchange

Start by creating an account on one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Popular choices include Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. You will enter basic information such as your name, email address, and phone number. Once your account is created, you can use the platform to explore different digital coins, including Dogecoin.

Step 2: Verify your account

Most exchanges will ask you to verify your identity before you can buy Dogecoin. This usually involves uploading a document that confirms your address and completing a standard Know Your Customer verification. These steps help protect your account and allow you to use all features on the platform.

Step 3: Add money to your exchange account

After verification, you can deposit funds. Depending on your location and the exchange you choose, you might add money with a credit card, debit card, or another payment method supported in your region. The platform will guide you through the process so you know exactly what to do.

Step 4: Find Dogecoin, check the price and make your purchase

Search for Dogecoin, shown as DOGE, in the list of available assets. Before you buy, take a moment to look at the current market price so you know what you are paying. When you are ready, enter the amount you want and complete the purchase. Your Dogecoin usually appears in your exchange wallet within a minute. From there, you can keep it on the exchange or move it to another wallet you prefer.



Dogecoin stands out because it is simple, fast, and community-driven, which makes it feel more approachable than many digital coins. Bitcoin is often viewed as digital gold, while Ethereum focuses on smart contracts. Litecoin offers quicker speeds than Bitcoin but a more traditional structure. Dogecoin feels lighter and easier to use, especially for newcomers exploring cryptocurrency and testing different coins for the first time.

Dogecoin is used as a digital currency that allows people to send value online quickly and with low friction. It also functions as a community-driven token that supports tipping and lighthearted online exchanges.

Here are common uses:

The future of Dogecoin depends on how strong its community stays, how often people use it, and whether more businesses decide to accept it. Dogecoin benefits from a loyal following, simple technology, and a well-known identity that helps it stay visible even in crowded markets. At the same time, its value can rise or fall quickly because the Dogecoin supply is large and the market is still unpredictable. As of now, the price of Dogecoin sits around $0.14 USD. If you're wondering what is the price of Dogecoin and what it could become, the future depends on community support and wider adoption.

Dogecoin can be appealing if you like a simple, well-known coin with a strong community behind it. Its fast transactions and loyal supporters give it staying power, but its price can move quickly, and the coin does not have the same long-term purpose as some larger projects. If you choose to invest in 2025, treat it as a higher-risk option and decide how it fits into your wider plans. With the right expectations, Dogecoin can play a role without taking over your strategy.

Dogecoin was created by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus in 2013. They built it as a light hearted digital coin inspired by the Doge meme.

Whether Dogecoin is a good investment depends on your goals and risk level. It can offer quick gains, but it can also change value quickly.

The risks of investing in Dogecoin include fast price swings, limited real world use, and market speculation that can raise or lower the value at any time.

What makes Dogecoin different from Bitcoin is its faster transactions, lower fees, and a much larger supply, which keeps it more affordable.

You can store Dogecoin in a crypto wallet, either on a trusted exchange or in a private Dogecoin wallet that gives you full control of your coins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","NFT market holds steady as buyer participation climbs sharply","https://tradersunion.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/show/1028135-nft-market-holds-steady/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 09:26:12 GMT","

​NFT sales remained essentially unchanged this week, rising just 1.77% to $77.10 million. Despite the flat revenue trend, overall market participation continued to strengthen as buyers grew 23.45% to 490,600. 

Sellers also increased 15.36% to 403,483, signaling widening engagement even as total transactions fell nearly 19% to 1.1 million, reports Crypto News.

Broader market conditions were mixed, with Bitcoin dipping to $89,000 while Ethereum held firm above the $3,000 threshold. The global crypto market cap edged down to $3.05 trillion from $3.09 trillion, reflecting cautious sentiment after recent volatility. Still, steady NFT spending suggests collectors are maintaining activity despite macro uncertainty.

Immutable ecosystem accelerates as major collections reshuffle

A major shake-up hit the weekly rankings as DMarket on Mythos reclaimed the top spot with $6.73 million in sales, despite a 13.16% drop from the prior week. Guild of Guardians Heroes delivered the strongest performance, soaring 162% to $5.46 million and securing second place as Immutable-zk continues to gain momentum. 

Meanwhile, Algebra Positions NFT-V2 on Ethereum fell sharply by 54% to $4.47 million, sliding to third position after leading last week. Polygon's Courtyard climbed to fourth with a 39% jump to $3.42 million, reflecting renewed appetite for gamified collectibles. Gods Unchained Cards entered the leaderboard in fifth with a 253% surge, highlighting strong demand across the Immutable gaming ecosystem. These shifts underscore how Layer-2 networks are increasingly driving NFT liquidity and activity.

Blue chips decline as new entrants capture volume

Traditional Ethereum blue chips faced another soft week, with Pudgy Penguins falling 15.5% to $2.26 million and CryptoPunks slipping 24.54% to $2.06 million on minimal transaction counts. Newcomers, however, outperformed: Panini America surged nearly 300%, and YES BOND on BNB climbed 133% to enter the top ten. The rise of these collections demonstrates how niche communities and chain-specific ecosystems continue to pull liquidity from legacy projects. 

Meanwhile, NFT user growth remains strong, indicating that participation is expanding even if blue-chip valuations remain under pressure. With stable weekly sales and shifting buyer preferences, the market appears to be consolidating rather than contracting. Whether this rotation continues will depend on macro trends and upcoming catalysts across gaming-focused networks.

Recently we wrote that ​​NFT sales rose to $77.04 million this week, marking a 9.78% increase from the previous week's $72.53 million.

 The last time the world got over-excited about a new technology, people lost a lot of money - and ended up looking pretty stupid. The AI bubble risks being just the same 

Matt Muir

It's easy to forget, but long before the current AI bubble was ever dreamed of, there was a yearlong period during which NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens, for those of you who have scrubbed the entire period from your mind) were the hottest thing in the world, attracting billions in investment, dominating the news agenda and were being pushed by celebrity backers from Paris Hilton to Ozzy Osborne to, er, John Terry. 

Even then-chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the Royal Mint was going to create its own NFT for, presumably, the betterment of the nation. Then, of course, it all fell apart, and no one really seems to want to talk about it much anymore. There is now a sense of alarm that the AI bubble is going to pop – but what happened to the last big tech craze that turned into a bust?

A “Non-Fungible Token” is, basically a verifiable digital ownership certificate for digital or physical objects – owning an NFT means your ownership of a specific digital item is logged on a public ledger, much like owning a collectible with a provable provenance. This public ledger is the blockchain, the same technology underpinning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but if you want an explanation of that then you can find your own. It's all hideously complicated (and quite boring), but, basically put, an NFT is a digital footprint that says “this person owns that thing”, and which records all the transactions associated with that thing so as to be able to track its provenance, past ownership and sales record.

NFTs were initially conceived in the mid-2010s, and attracted interest from digital artists who realised that what this technology effectively did was introduce the concept of scarcity to digital goods. While anyone can reproduce a digital image, if there's a verifiable record pointing at the original image then all of a sudden we can introduce concepts like “buying and selling” and “limited editions” and “one-offs” and “percentage of resale”, which all of a sudden made digital art a potentially-viable way of making money: very much the art world's raison d'etre. 

A few art projects sprang up and gained traction in the late-10s, things like Cryptopunks (pixellated avatars of, er, punks) and Cryptokitties (pixellated avatars of, er, kittens) demonstrated that the basic idea of letting people buy and trade digital objects for real-world money based on the fact that their ownership of those digital objects is recorded forever on an immutable ledger, had legs. 

Interest in NFTs as a technology grew steadily and boomed during the early months of the pandemic. Global central banks flooded markets with easy money, driving investors toward riskier assets in search of returns. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum soared in value, creating new crypto-rich investors looking for the next big thing. NFTs – combining tech novelty, digital art, and the allure of crypto profits – fit the bill.

Then an auction changed everything. On March 11 2021, Christie's held its first ever sale of a purely digital artwork. The piece, “Everydays: The First 5000 Days”, was a collage of 5,000 images by a digital artist known as Beeple and sold for $69,346,250, instantly making Beeple the third-most expensive living artist at auction. (Take a moment to Google Beeple's oeuvre; I will leave it to you to decide the degree to which he merits this accolade).

Perhaps unsurprisingly, things suddenly got a bit silly. Millions of people worldwide suddenly realised that “selling a jpeg” was now a potentially-viable route to millions; millions of others realised that this created new markets, and markets can be exploited. 

Everyone got in on the act. Celebrities minted NFTs in their own image. Ozzy Osborne (or the Ozzy Osborne brand) released a limited edition range of images of cartoon bats, each unique and available for purchase. Internet memes were monetised, with an NFT of the original “Doge” meme selling for about $4 million in mid-2021. Auction houses began hosting high-profile NFT sales; a single Cryptopunk sold at Sotheby's for over $11 million. Paris Hilton shilled Bored Apes (briefly the buzziest of all the NFT collectibles, trading for hundreds of thousands at their peak) on Jimmy Kimmel. Even The Economist auctioned an NFT of one of its covers (titled “Down the Rabbit Hole”) for about $420,000 in October 2021.

Matt Muir

It wasn't just “artworks”. The NBA introduced the ability for fans to buy NFTs of videoclips of basketball games, letting superfans “own” a gif of Lebron James dunking on a loop, forever. Luxury brands started selling NFTs as digital “loyalty cards”, granting buyers access to exclusive drops or online experiences. 

Digital Real Estate Agents (no, really) sold NFTs of parcels of “digital land” in the metaverse, with platforms such as Decentraland flogging “plots” for hundreds of thousands of pounds despite the fact that nobody wanted or needed “digital land” in 2021-2 (or indeed now). NFTs were going to transform collecting, memberships, property, the world!

There was a brief, hallucinatory period when you could overhear tables of normal-looking people in pubs discussing the pros and cons of “getting an Ape”, and tales abounded of people who got in early making huge gains from “flipping” NFTs. Then, of course, the bottom fell out of the whole thing.

It turned out that the resale value of a jpeg, even if it is the original, was, in many cases, £0. The guy who bought the NFT of Jack Dorsey's first ever Tweet for $2.9m in 2021 found a year later that the market valued it at circa $280. Celebrity NFT projects turned out to be flops (Ozzy's bats are now worth roughly £30 now, vs over £3,000 at launch). 

Reports spread of scams, hacking incidents, and “rug pulls” where NFT project creators vanished with investors' money. Combine that with the end of the zero interest rate era, the collapse of crypto in 2022, and growing questions about the energy use and environmental impact of the technology, and confidence in NFTs as an investment vehicle, and with it a lot of people's investments, crashed. By late-2022, NFTs were a punchline rather than a headline.

A lot of people lost a lot of money; with a few small exceptions, the many millions of NFT collections that were minted during the boom year held no value whatsoever. Research from 2023 showed 95% of NFT collections had effectively become worthless, and that roughly 23 million people held assets essentially worth nothing. 

The artists who briefly believed that they had found a way to sell digital copies of their work in the main realised that it's harder to persuade people to shell out for a digital file than a painting, even if that digital file does come with a certificate of authenticity backed up by some really hard maths. 

As to who won? Well, Beeple is now richer than God, and a handful of other artists managed to ride the early wave successfully; the auction houses taking a cut of those early, frothy megasales certainly benefited; a few celebrities managed to sell their branded NFT collections at the height of the bubble. Otherwise, though, the main beneficiaries were the platforms facilitating the trade in NFTs and the scammers who sold people a get-rich-quick asset-flipping narrative and then disappeared with hopefuls' cash. 

Was it all rubbish? A fever dream born of the pandemic-era when we were still addled by lockdown? Not entirely. The fundamental technology underpinning NFTs – that is, an immutable record of a digital asset's existence, ownership, etc – remains viable. There are corners of the web in which NFTs continue to be traded, albeit at significantly lower volumes and for smaller sums. Game developers continue to explore the concept of NFTs allowing for real-world ownership of exclusive digital assets. There are applications across digital ticketing and even digital identity. 

It's perhaps fairer to see NFTs as an example of a technology that got famous before we had quite worked out what it was for, which became the subject of frenzied, ill-informed speculation by a society obsessed with both novelty and the idea of being able to get very rich very quickly with minimal effort. Once the initial hype dissipated, it left a lot of people looking and feeling very stupid, and very poor. The question now is whether we are heading for a re-run.

Monet Bank, a small Texas community bank owned by a billionaire political supporter of President Donald Trump, has stepped into the field of crypto lenders, billing itself as an ""infrastructure bank"" with a focus on digital assets. ""Monet is focused on being the premier digital asset financial institution, providing innovative and forward-facing solutions for the digital economy,"" according to its website. Though at less than $6 billion in assets and slightly more than $1 billion in capital, according to state records, the institution would be considered a very small, community bank.

The Texas lender opened in 1988 as Beal Savings Bank and earlier this year changed its name to XD Bank before changing again two months later to Monet Bank. The state-chartered institution is regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and has six offices, according to federal data.

Owner Andy Beal, who founded Beal Financial Corp., is known as a high-level poker player and a major 2016 backer of Trump's successful presidential campaign, having funded his own political action committee. The Information first reported on Monet Bank's shift to focus on digital assets earlier Friday.

It joins a slowly growing field of banks aiming to serve the crypto industry. In October, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted a conditional charter to Erebor Bank, a new tech-focused firm backed by Founders Fund's Peter Thiel (who is also invested in CoinDesk parent Bullish. And earlier this week, former Signature Bank executives launched N3XT, a narrow bank chartered as a Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution that says it will settle payments instantaneously through a private blockchain.

The shift comes amid a broader change in how federal bank regulators are approaching crypto. Since Trump took office, his regulators have withdrawn existing guidance warning banks under their supervision to be careful handling crypto and published fresh guidance aiming to let the crypto industry better access banking services.

The FDIC's acting chair, Travis Hill, told lawmakers that his agency also expected to propose rules for the crypto industry — tied to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act — during a hearing earlier this week.

Beal's company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment sent to a media line at its affiliate, Beal Bank.

Traditionally, thieves usually targeted some form of tangible good — whether it's physical or digital currency, jewelry, or a car.

But when it comes to mining cryptocurrencies, things get a little stranger. As Bloomberg reports, local law enforcement is hunting down about 14,000 illegal Bitcoin mining operations in Malaysia, which they say have stolen around $1.1 billion in electricity over the last five years.

Police have resorted to using drones and even handheld sensors that can pick up irregular power use to catch them in their act, a bizarre game of cat-and-mouse that highlights how lucrative mining the digital token can be — if the power is on someone else's dime, at least.

Bitcoin rallied this year, hitting a record high of over $126,000 in October. While the currency has collapsed substantially since then, mining the coin has proven profitable enough over the last couple of years for thousands to risk stealing electricity from the grid for their ill-gotten gains.

Besides causing over a billion dollars in losses for Malaysia's state-owned energy company Tenaga Nasional, illegal mining operations could wreak havoc on the country's grid as well. 

“The risk of allowing such activities to happen is no longer about stealing,” Malaysia's deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, Akmal Nasir, who chairs a special task force specifically set up to crack down on illegal Bitcoin mining, told Bloomberg. “You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system.”

Rolling power outages in Iran last year, for instance, sparked a heated debate over the role of illegal Bitcoin mining. Kuwait similarly cracked down on crypto mining earlier this year amid a “major” power crisis that has led to blackouts.

Worldwide, Bitcoin mining operations chew through a gargantuan amount of power, consuming more electricity than an entire country each year. The United States has embraced the token wholeheartedly, accounting for over 75 percent of mining activities, according to a recent report by the University of Cambridge.

That's despite other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, implementing alternative ways to validate transactions that reduce electricity consumption dramatically.

To cash in on the trend, illegal operations are cropping up across Malaysia, turning abandoned malls and industrial spaces into crypto mining sites. 

For legal operations, miners have to pay for their power and taxes. But for many, the benefits of running their hardware with stolen power have outweighed the risks of getting caught in Malaysia.

“Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Nasir told Bloomberg. “I don't see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.”

Akmal likened the illegal operations to being run “by the syndicate,” implying they were operating like organized crime.

“It does have modus operandi,” he said.

Colorado made headlines in 2022 when Governor Jared Polis launched the nation's first state cryptocurrency tax payment program, positioning the state as a “crypto-forward” pioneer. Yet two years later, the results paint a stark picture of how little Coloradans actually use digital currencies for legitimate purposes.

The numbers tell the story. Since September 2022, Colorado has collected just $57,211 in cryptocurrency tax payments out of billions in total revenue. That represents a microscopic 0.0005% of the state's $11 billion annual income tax collection alone.

While Colorado residents actively invest in new and traditional digital assets, they're clearly not using these digital currencies for everyday transactions like paying taxes. Still, much research the best place to buy Polygon (MATIC), a popular blockchain network known for its lowtransaction fees, as well as established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DespitePolygon's utility in decentralised finance applications and its growing ecosystem of blockchainprojects, along with the widespread adoption of other major cryptocurrencies, the gap betweeninvestment interest and practical usage for government payments remains substantial.

Colorado's cryptocurrency story shows interesting contrasts. While people aren't using crypto much for everyday government payments, the state has accidentally shown why good blockchain monitoring is so important. Recent work by companies like Elliptic proves how well new tracking tools can spot and expose bad networks, showing that the crypto compliance industry is getting much better.

Finding out that Xinbi Guarantee was registered in Colorado actually shows how well modern blockchain detective work functions. What might have stayed hidden in regular banking was discovered through smart cryptocurrency analysis. This is real progress in the industry's ability to stay transparent and accountable, which are important things that real investors think about when they look for a place to buy cryptocurrency.

Colorado's situation shows how regulators are getting better at telling the difference between legitimate cryptocurrency use and criminals. The state's PayPal system for crypto tax payments handled only 48 payments totalling $17,544 in 2024, but it shows a smart approach to digital money integration. As they are immediately turning crypto into dollars, Colorado demonstrates how governments can try new things while keeping their normal ways of working.

This balanced approach makes Colorado a state that's interested in crypto but also focused on security, helping make the whole digital asset space more legitimate.

Jacob Sims, a Harvard researcher focusing on transnational crime, mentioned that setting up a business in the United States offers credibility to both lawful and unlawful operations alike. Foreign corporations have the opportunity to open bank accounts in the US market and employ workers while forging business partnerships. According to him, this facade of legitimacy is very important.

The Xinbi case highlights the changing landscape of cryptocurrency, showcasing its potential while underscoring the need for improved regulation. Xinbi and Huione Guarantee processed over $24 billion in transactions, with both platforms operating publicly on Telegram, demonstrating crypto's global reach.

Governments are strengthening efforts to combat misuse, but the quick adaptability of platforms like Xinbi and Huione shows the resilience of the crypto market. Telegram removed accounts linked to these platforms, and Huione was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury, yet both quickly adjusted, reflecting the rapidly evolving nature of digital currency.

This situation raises important questions about cryptocurrency governance. Colorado has seen a modest increase in crypto adoption, prompting lawmakers to consider its potential benefits. Governor Polis has been a strong advocate for crypto, emphasising technological progress and the need for oversight.

Elliptic is now tracking 30 Chinese-language platforms, highlighting the global scope of the issue. The combination of Telegram and Tether's stablecoin has led to new digital marketplaces, and if proper governance is implemented, it could bring greater transparency and accountability, unlocking crypto's full potential for the future.

What if I told you that the future of money is being fiercely contested in heated debates, sparking a discourse that transcends mere economics? The clash over Bitcoin replication has ignited a firestorm of opinions in the cryptocurrency sphere, revealing stark contrasts in our understanding of value amid a digital revolution. In this exploration, we take you inside the latest Binance Blockchain Week showdown in Dubai, where Binance's Changpeng Zhao (CZ) faced off with gold enthusiast Peter Schiff. Their exchange unearthed pivotal insights about Bitcoin's value proposition, its fixed supply, and how it stacks up against the timeless allure of gold.

In a climactic face-off resonating across the digital currency world, CZ and Schiff grappled over the merits of their chosen assets. The atmosphere crackled with tension as they exchanged barbs about Bitcoin and gold, yet amid the fervor, they somewhat converged on the idea of tokenized gold—a potential game-changer that could outstrip conventional bullion in value. But this moment of unity was fleeting; Schiff resumed his critique of Bitcoin's supposedly vacuous backing, reigniting the ideological divide.

Schiff painted Bitcoin as digital fiat “lacking substance,” while CZ made a compelling case for Bitcoin as a revolutionary financial technology. He underscored Bitcoin's digital nature as a key attribute that equips it with unparalleled utility in today's rapidly evolving economic landscape. This ongoing conflict starkly illustrates the tug-of-war between entrenched financial orthodoxy and the disruptive force of innovation.

As the debate escalated, Ripple's CTO David Schwartz provided a factual counterbalance to misconceptions surrounding Bitcoin replication. He deftly dismantled the myth that Bitcoin could simply be imitated, emphasizing its considerable strength derived from a designated supply cap of 21 million coins. With approximately 19.96 million coins already in circulation, this scarcity becomes an essential pillar of its worth.

Schwartz's assertion, “1 BTC = 1 BTC,” serves as an assertive benchmark against the backdrop of the crypto ecosystem's value paradigm. Unlike endlessly replicable digital currencies, Bitcoin's intentional scarcity plants it firmly as a unique figure in the realm of digital assets, lending it immunity against inflation—a characteristic often associated with traditional holdings like gold.

Central to the CZ-Schiff discourse was Bitcoin's remarkable capacity for instant verification. In response to Schiff's skepticism regarding Bitcoin's tangible worth, CZ illuminated the superior efficiency of transactions processed through blockchain technology. While gold demands elaborate and time-consuming verification to confirm its authenticity, Bitcoin's transactions happen in an instant, bolstering user confidence and affirming its role as a modern currency.

Despite Schiff's criticisms of Bitcoin, he inadvertently highlighted the challenges of gold verification. The tangible asset' requires complex testing to validate its authenticity, sharply contrasting with Bitcoin's streamlined digital transactions. CZ effectively illustrated how Bitcoin's process eliminates the physical burdens associated with gold, simplifying ownership and the transfer experience for users.

Emerging from the debate was the concept of tokenized gold, an innovative cross-section of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology that intrigued both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. Schiff unveiled his TGold platform, a venture designed to revolutionize gold ownership through tokenization—promising increased accessibility and manageability. Nevertheless, this introduces critical inquiries regarding whether tokenized assets can encapsulate the true essence of Bitcoin's distinct value.

As this dialogue unfolds, recognizing the fluid dynamics between digital assets and the established financial order is vital. The rise of tokenized commodities signals a transformative shift within investment paradigms, prompting fresh discussions about the principles underpinning value in an increasingly digital-forward world.

The animated discussions between CZ, Schiff, and the broader crypto community reveal the intricate dance of digital assets in today's economy. As we dissect the nuances of Bitcoin replication, instant verification, and gold's authenticity challenges, one thing stands out—Bitcoin is distinctly positioned for the future.

In this crucial exploration of what constitutes value in our digital landscape, Bitcoin's fixed supply and verification capabilities differentiate it from traditional assets. This conversation serves as a clarion call for investors to reevaluate their views on monetary assets, usability, and the swiftly changing terrain of finance in our time.

Written by Oluwapelumi Adejumo

Input Output, the engineering firm best known for building Cardano, has begun a sweeping restructuring that includes a name change and a move into technology sectors far beyond its blockchain origins.

The company said on December 5 that it will drop “Global” from its name and operate as Input Output Group. It plans to expand into quantum computing, digital identity, fintech, and healthcare.

Charles Hoskinson, the company's founder, said the redesign reflects how far the organization has evolved from its initial focus on blockchain protocol engineering. 

He described the new phase as an effort to build a global technology group capable of addressing complex problems across fintech, privacy, artificial intelligence, and healthcare.

Hoskinson added that the firm will continue to support Cardano's core development.

“As Input Output Group, we are entering a new chapter of expansion, investment, and innovation across the United States, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and emerging markets,” he noted.

The shift mirrors a broader trend in the crypto industry as firms diversify into areas that blend distributed systems, data infrastructure, and machine intelligence.

A recent UN analysis estimates that rapid innovation could push the AI sector toward $5 trillion within a decade. That scale, the report said, will shape adjacent fields such as digital identity and quantum computing. 

By adding these sectors to its portfolio, Input Output aims to expand its commercial pipeline and attract enterprise clients.

Notably, the company has already advanced its privacy technology work through Midnight. The blockchain is designed to support data protection and compliance for institutional users.

Meanwhile, the restructuring arrives at a difficult time for Cardano, which has struggled to keep pace with competitors such as Solana and Ethereum.

For context, Cardano hosts less than $50 million in stablecoin supply. On the other hand, rival ecosystems like Ethereum support hundreds of billions of these assets.

Considering this, Hoskinson argued that Cardano's slower uptake stems from narrative challenges, not technical limits.

“It's not a technology problem. It's not a node problem. It's not a problem of imagination and creativity. It's not a problem of execution. We can pretty much do anything. It's a problem of governance and coordination and ultimately accountability and responsibility,” Hoskinson said.

Input Output is trying to counter that gap through a new coalition with Cardano's founding organizations. The effort aims to accelerate integrations for tier-one stablecoins and custody providers.

The firm hopes these additions will improve liquidity, deepen infrastructure, and strengthen Cardano's appeal to developers and financial institutions.

Asia continues to dominate global crypto adoption in 2025.

Singapore, Japan, and South Korea lead in innovation and regulation. Vietnam and the Philippines drive grassroots crypto use.

Strong regulations balance safety with innovation. Asia's growth sets the tone for global crypto evolution.

Asia has maintained its position as the leading region of the cryptocurrency industry for several years. More than half of the worldwide blockchain transactions come from this continent, with new-generation consumers and government policies being the main catalysts of growth. Only from Singapore's financial centres and Vietnam's grassroots acceptance can one see that Asian countries are setting the standards for the global view of digital finance.

Singapore is still the closest to the top with its well-balanced regulatory share. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is supporting blockchain startups while implementing strict anti-fraud measures. Reasonable laws and great investor confidence make it the most crypto-friendly location in Asia.

Japan was among the first to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies and remains an innovator in this area. The Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association offers customer security along with transparency. The adoption of blockchain technology in gaming and finance keeps Japan at the forefront of a digital transformation, with every aspect of its society seen as leading.

South Korea is a country with a high rate of crypto usage,  ranked among the top globally. The Digital Asset Framework and other government initiatives are sure to support the growth of the blockchain technology sector. Trading platforms like Upbit and Bithumb remain at the centre of large trading volume and widespread acceptance.

The licensing system introduced by Hong Kong, which had clear virtual asset regulations, is no longer a barrier for the city to become the leading crypto hub in the region. It allows large exchanges and startups to set up shop in the region. The city's status as a global financial center serves as a bridge between Asian and Western crypto markets.

Vietnam has established itself as one of the leading countries in the world for retail cryptocurrency adoption and use. The youth are the main investors in the blockchain gaming and DeFi (decentralized finance) sectors. The government's tolerance towards digital technology and innovation has led to rapid growth despite minimal regulation.

India has taken the lead as the country with the largest cryptocurrency user base, with more than 100 million active investors. The startups are mainly into blockchain payments, DeFi, and digital identity. 

Although the regulatory framework is still uncertain, the Reserve Bank of India's struggles to introduce its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) are indicative of the country's commitment to the digital age.

Remittances in the Philippines stand to benefit from crypto use. Blockchain technology-based apps are used by millions of people for money transfers and cross-border payments. The central bank allows fiat to crypto exchange platforms, and earning through gaming remains a dominant factor in the overall adoption process.

Thailand is establishing itself as a regulated center for crypto innovation. The tax regulations and the support for tokenized assets are the reasons both investors and developers come to the country. The battle for Web3 and DeFi applications has already begun, and the country is taking part.

Asia is creating the world's most useful cities for the crypto ecosystem, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi leading the way. The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) has introduced the world's most transparent crypto regulatory framework, in line with global standards. This is why the UAE is one of the best exchanges and blockchain startups.

Indonesia's youthful and digitally-driven population is the main reason behind the increase in crypto usage. Through Bappebti, the government has declared that virtual assets are permissible commodities. Local exchanges are coming up, and blockchain technology of blockchain is being applied in areas such as logistics and governance.

Asia is not only leading in the adoption of cryptocurrencies but also in the innovation of this new financial system. Countries in this region, like Vietnam, with their strong technology, talented workforce, and supportive regulations, are building the future of decentralised finance. The gradual improvement of policies governing use and trade might just make Asia an even stronger influencer in global crypto markets.

1. Which country leads Asia in crypto regulation?

Singapore and Japan have the most progressive and balanced regulations.

2. Which Asian nation has the highest adoption rate?

Vietnam has the most users, followed by the Philippines and India. 

3. Is cryptocurrency legal across Asia?

The majority of  countries allow trading, but the regulatory structures vary widely.

4. How is the UAE part of Asia's crypto rise?

The VARA regulation in Dubai, along with the innovation hubs, has made it a major player in the region.

5. Why is Asia crucial for crypto's future?

Asia has everything it needs to be the global leader in blockchain- strong markets, a young population, and rapid innovation.

For the past few years, stablecoins have been defined by a narrow reality: essentially a two-horse race between Tether's USDT and Circle's (CRCL) USDC, with most activity concentrated on crypto-native exchanges.

What comes next looks materially different, Alchemy co-founder and President Joe Lau told CoinDesk in an interview.

The near-term trajectory for stablecoins has lots of directions, Lau said, but one theme dominates: stablecoin adoption is “exploding.” The reason, he argued, is that stablecoins deliver tangible advantages that traditional payments and banking systems struggle to match, most notably 24/7 settlement and digital-native money movement.

“Stablecoins and deposit tokens are rapidly becoming the consumer and enterprise layers of the modern internet-native financial system. With this foundation, money can move with the safety of the banking system and the speed of the internet,"" Lau said.

Banks are increasingly evaluating stablecoins, he said, alongside fintechs building money-movement and payments products. 

Lau pointed to payment platforms and processors, highlighting Stripe's activity in the space, as well as payroll providers and corporate treasury solutions that are now considering stablecoins as part of their operational stack.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like fiat currencies or gold. They underpin much of the crypto economy, serving as payment rails and a tool for moving money across borders. USDT is the largest stablecoin, followed by USDC.

Total stablecoin market capitalization reached $300 billion in September, a 75% increase from a year earlier, according to a report from Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Wall Street giant Citi (C) said the stablecoin market is growing faster than expected. This prompted the bank to recently lift its 2030 forecast for issuance to $1.9 trillion in its base case and $4 trillion in a bull case, up from $1.6 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively.

Lau also said that regulatory clarity is drawing more traditional players into the sector. 

As the rules become clearer, he expects broader adoption from traditional finance — banks, neobanks, fintechs focused on moving money, and large payments companies — because stablecoins plug directly into the kinds of use cases those firms already serve.

However, Lau sees another major force shaping the future: banks are launching tokenized deposits, which he describes as an “alternative” that complements stablecoins. 

In this model, Lau said, banks can offer customers many of the same benefits associated with stablecoins, low transfer fees and faster settlement, but do so under existing regulatory frameworks, with the funds remaining at the bank.

Today, he said, moving money from a standard bank account can still mean wires, fees and friction. With tokenized deposits, such as JPM Coin, customers can get more stablecoin-like functionality without leaving the bank environment. Lau added that HSBC has also signaled interest in tokenized deposits, and he expects more banks to follow.

In Lau's view, tokenized deposits and stablecoins are currently in competition but complementary, as they tend to serve different users. Stablecoins are more open-ended, he said, because they can settle between any two parties. Tokenized deposits are more closed-loop, he said, because they're typically designed for a bank's own customers. He noted that JPM Coin is limited to JPMorgan clients and is likely to be used first by institutions and corporate clients.

Over time, however, Lau expects the boundary to blur. 

He said banks are starting with tokenized deposits but are already thinking about building rails for other tokenized assets. Meanwhile, he said, stablecoin issuers are looking toward becoming more bank-like, driven in part by capital efficiency. Lau argued that banks' fractional banking model can be more capital efficient than stablecoin structures that require 1:1 backing, and that this gap is one reason stablecoin issuers may want closer alignment with the banking model.

For now, Lau said, the two instruments remain complementary. However, he also framed tokenized deposits as an early-stage development: only a handful of banks have seriously invested in this so far, he said, and as more do, adoption will grow, and stablecoins and deposit tokens will begin to compete more directly.

“Tokenized deposits transform the banking system into programmable infrastructure. Stablecoins modernize the dollar for consumers and global markets. As the two converge, money becomes both fully compliant and instantly accessible,"" he added.

Over a long enough time frame, every long term valuation model for bitcoin has eventually been broken, yet the one that has maintained the strongest narrative this cycle has been the power law model. 

Historically, in previous cycles, bitcoin has tended to overshoot this model during bull markets and fall below it during bear markets, but in the current cycle the price has largely remained close to the model's trajectory.

The bitcoin power law framework provides a mathematical viewpoint of long term price trends, revealing that bitcoin's historical performance follows a power law distribution on a log scale. This implies a relationship between time and price. However, the model relies on historical observations.

In theory it is a backward looking model that does not guarantee future predictive accuracy, particularly given the unpredictable nature of financial markets. The model is useful for understanding long term structural trends.

Below $90,000, bitcoin currently trades at a steep discount to the model. The power law value sits near $118,000 which places the spot price roughly 32% beneath the model. This is the largest deviation since the yen carry trade unwind back in august 2024, which produced a 35% deviation from the trend line and took three months to recover.

From a broader perspective, bitcoin has spent most of this cycle tracking close to the model, whereas in previous cycles it deviated far more aggressively both above and below it.

In the last cycle, the most prominent model was the stock to flow framework created by the anonymous analyst Plan B, which assumes that scarcity directly drives value. The model has been invalid since January 2021, and according to current Glassnode data it would imply a price of roughly $1.3 million per bitcoin today.

The key question now is whether bitcoin mean reverts back toward the power law trend or breaks lower and challenges the validity of yet another long standing model.

Are We Seeing the First Steps Toward AI Superintelligence?

Today's leading AI models can already write and refine their own software. The question is whether that self-improvement can ever snowball into true superintelligence

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Eric Sullivan

KTSDESIGN/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY

The Matrix, The Terminator—so much of our science fiction is built around the dangers of superintelligent artificial intelligence: a system that exceeds the best humans across nearly all cognitive domains. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have predicted we'll achieve such AI in the coming years. Yet machines like those depicted as battling humanity in those movies would have to be far more advanced than ChatGPT, not to mention more capable of making Excel spreadsheets than Microsoft Copilot. So how can anyone think we're remotely close to artificial superintelligence?

One answer goes back to 1965, when statistician Irving John Good introduced the idea of an “ultraintelligent machine.” He wrote that once it became sufficiently sophisticated, a computer would rapidly improve itself. If this seems far-fetched, consider how AlphaGo Zero—an AI system developed at DeepMind in 2017 to play the ancient Chinese board game Go—was built. Using no data from human games, AlphaGo Zero played itself millions of times, achieving in days an improvement that would have taken a human a lifetime and that allowed it to defeat the previous versions of AlphaGo that had already beaten the world's best human players. Good's idea was that any system that was sufficiently intelligent to rewrite itself would create iterations of itself, each one smarter than the previous and even more capable of improvement, triggering an “intelligence explosion.”

The question, then, is how close we are to that first system capable of autonomous self-improvement. Though the runaway systems Good described aren't here yet, self-improving computers are—at least in narrow domains. AI is already running code on itself. OpenAI's Codex and Anthropic's Claude Code can work independently for an hour or more writing new code or updating existing code. Using Codex recently, I thumbed a prompt into my phone while on a walk, and it made a working website before I reached home. In the hands of skilled coders, such systems can do dramatically more, from reorganizing large code bases to sketching entirely new ways to build the software in the first place.

So why hasn't a model powering ChatGPT quietly coded itself into ultraintelligence? The hitch is in the phrase above: “in the hands of skilled coders.” Despite AI's impressive improvements, our current systems still rely on humans to set goals, design experiments and decide which changes count as genuine progress. They're not yet capable of evolving independently in a robust way, which makes some talk about imminent superintelligence seem blown out of proportion—unless, of course, current AI systems are closer than they appear to being able to self-improve in increasingly broad slices of their abilities.

One area in which they already look superhuman is how much information they can absorb and manipulate. The most advanced models are trained on far more text than any human could read in a lifetime—from poetry to history to the sciences. They can also keep track of far longer stretches of text while they work. Already, with commercially available systems such as ChatGPT and Gemini, I can upload a stack of books and have the AI synthesize and critique them in a way that would take a human weeks. That doesn't mean the result is always correct or insightful—but it does mean that, in principle, a system like this could read its own documentation, logs, and code and propose changes at a speed and scale no engineering team could match.

Reasoning, however, is where these systems lag—though that's no longer true in certain focused areas. DeepMind's AlphaDev and related systems have already found new, more efficient algorithms for tasks such as sorting, results that are now used in real-world code and that go beyond simple statistical mimicry. Other models excel at formal mathematics and graduate-level science questions that resist simple pattern-matching. We can debate the value of any particular benchmark—and researchers are doing exactly that—but there's no question that some AI systems have become capable of discovering solutions humans had not previously found.

If the systems already have these abilities, what, then, is the missing piece? One answer is artificial general intelligence (AGI), the sort of dynamic, flexible reasoning that allows humans to learn from one field and apply it to others. As I've previously written, we keep shifting our definitions of AGI as machines master new skills. But for the superintelligence question, what matters is not the label we attach; it's whether a system can use its skills to reliably redesign and upgrade itself.

And this brings us back to Good's “intelligence explosion.” If we do build systems with that kind of flexible, humanlike reasoning across many domains, what will separate it from superintelligence? Advanced models are already trained on more science and literature than any human, have far greater working memories and show extraordinary reasoning skills in limited domains. Once that missing piece of flexible reasoning is in place, and once we allow such systems to deploy those skills on their own code, data and training processes, could the leap to fully superhuman performance be shorter than we imagine?

Not everyone agrees. Some researchers believe we have yet to fundamentally understand intelligence and that this missing piece will take longer than expected to engineer. Others speak of AGI being achieved in a few years, leading to further advances far beyond human capacities. In 2024 Altman publicly suggested that superintelligence could arrive “in a few thousand days.”

If this sounds too much like science fiction, consider that AI companies regularly run safety tests on their systems to make sure they can't go into a runaway self-improvement loop. METR, an independent AI safety group, evaluates models according to how long they can reliably sustain a complex task before reaching failure. This past November, its tests of GPT-5.1-Codex-Max came in around two hours and 42 minutes. This is a huge leap from GPT-4's few minutes of such performance on the same metric, but it isn't the situation Good described.

Anthropic runs similar tests on its AI systems. “To be clear, we are not yet at ‘self-improving AI,'” wrote the company's co-founder and head of policy Jack Clark in October, “but we are at the stage of ‘AI that improves bits of the next AI, with increasing autonomy.'”

If AGI is achieved, and we add human-level judgment to an immense information base, vast working memory and extraordinary speed, Good's idea of rapid self-improvement starts to look less like science fiction. The real question is whether we'll stop at “mere human”—or risk overshooting.

Math Puzzle: An Unknown Dimension

By Jack Murtagh 

Rose and Ivy are logic-savvy landscapers tasked with creating a rectangular garden. Their client has told Rose the desired width and Ivy the desired length (both positive integers). One day their client leaves a voicemail stipulating that the scale of this project must be exactly 12. In this landscaping company, the “scale” can refer to either the area or the perimeter of the garden, but the client doesn't specify which. The following conversation ensues:

Rose: “I know the desired width, but even hearing a scale of 12, I still don't know the length.”

Ivy: “I know the desired length, but even hearing you say that, I don't know the width.”

Rose: “Alas, I'm still stumped.”

What is the client's desired width for the garden?

The width is 3. Call the width W and the length L. Both landscapers know that either W × L = 12 or 2 × (W + L) = 12; that is, either the area or the perimeter of the garden equals 12.

Consider Rose's perspective. Knowing the width and the scale is not enough for her to deduce the length. If she knew the width and the scale and whether the scale referred to area or perimeter, then she could always deduce the length by solving the relevant equation for L. So knowing all she knows, it must still be ambiguous to her whether the scale refers to area or perimeter. In particular, this means that W must be a factor of 12. If it weren't, that would rule out area because factors of 12 are the only integers that can multiply to 12. Furthermore, W must be less than 6 because otherwise the perimeter would exceed 12. This narrows the possible widths to {1, 2, 3, 4}, and now, after Rose's statement, Ivy can deduce this as well.

Ivy still can't figure out the width, which means by the same argument, we can narrow her possible length values down to {1, 2, 3, 4}. The length can't be 1, because none of Rose's remaining possible widths could yield an area or perimeter of 12 with a length of 1. The length also can't be 2: if it were, Ivy would know the width was 4, creating a perimeter of 12. (A length of 2 can't form an area of 12 with any of Rose's remaining widths.) So the length can only be 3 or 4.

After Ivy's response, Rose now knows that the only possible lengths are 3 and 4, yet she still cannot deduce which one is correct. This means the width must be able to form an area of 12 and a perimeter of 12 with the remaining possible lengths. W = 2 and W = 3 are the only remaining ways to form a perimeter of 12 (L would equal 4 and 3, respectively), whereas W = 3 and W = 4 are the only remaining ways to form an area of 12. (L would equal 4 and 3, respectively.) W = 3 belongs to both cases, so it is the only value for which Rose would still be unsure.

Scientists have unveiled a technique that uses 'molecular antennas' to direct electrical energy into insulating nanoparticles. This approach creates a new family of ultra-pure near-infrared LEDs that could be used in medical diagnostics, optical communication systems, and sensitive detectors.

Researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge have discovered how to drive electrical current into materials that normally do not conduct, a feat previously thought impossible under normal conditions. By attaching carefully chosen organic molecules that act like tiny antennas, they have built the first light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from insulating nanoparticles. Their work, reported in Nature, points toward a new generation of devices for deep-tissue biomedical imaging and high-speed data transmission.

The team focused on lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNPs), a well-known class of materials prized for producing light that is extremely pure and stable. These nanoparticles are especially effective in the second near-infrared region, which is able to penetrate deep into biological tissue. Until now, however, their electrically insulating character meant they could not be integrated into standard electronic components such as LEDs.

""These nanoparticles are fantastic light emitters, but we couldn't power them with electricity. It was a major barrier preventing their use in everyday technology,"" said Professor Akshay Rao, who led the research at the Cavendish Laboratory. ""We've essentially found a back door to power them. The organic molecules act like antennas, catching charge carriers and then 'whispering' it to the nanoparticle through a special triplet energy transfer process, which is surprisingly efficient.""

Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Design With Molecular Antennas

To overcome the insulation problem, the researchers created an organic-inorganic hybrid structure. They attached an organic dye with a functional group anchor, called 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9-ACA), to the surface of the LnNPs. In the new LEDs, electrical charges are injected into these 9-ACA molecules, which act as a molecular antenna, rather than into the nanoparticles directly.

Once energized, the 9-ACA molecules enter an excited triplet state. In many optical systems this triplet state is considered ""dark,"" meaning that its energy is often lost instead of converted into useful light. In this design, however, the energy from the triplet state is transferred with more than 98% efficiency to the lanthanide ions inside the insulating nanoparticles, causing them to emit light with remarkable brightness.

Ultra-Pure Near-Infrared Light at Low Voltage

Using this method, the team's ""LnLEDs"" can be switched on with a relatively low operating voltage of about 5 volts. At the same time, they generate electroluminescence with an extremely narrow spectral width. This makes the emission much purer than that of many competing technologies, including quantum dots (QDs).

""The purity of the light in the second near-infrared window emitted by our LnLEDs is a huge advantage,"" said Dr. Zhongzheng Yu, a lead author of the study and postdoctoral research associate at the Cavendish Laboratory. ""For applications like biomedical sensing or optical communications, you want a very sharp, specific wavelength. Our devices achieve this effortlessly, something that is very difficult to do with other materials.""

Biomedical Imaging, Optical Communications, and Sensing Potential

Because these electrically powered nanoparticles can emit such clean, well-defined light, they could form the basis of advanced medical technologies. Tiny LnLEDs, potentially injectable or built into wearable devices, might be used for deep-tissue imaging to find cancers, track organ function in real time, or trigger light-activated drugs with high precision.

Their narrow spectral output also makes them attractive for optical communications, where pure, stable wavelengths can help send more data with less interference. In addition, this platform could support highly sensitive sensors that detect very specific chemicals or biological markers, improving diagnostic tools and environmental monitoring.

First-Generation Performance and Future Directions

In early tests, the researchers achieved a peak external quantum efficiency above 0.6% for their NIR-II LEDs. For a first-generation device built from electrically powered insulating nanoparticles, this performance is considered very promising. The team has also identified clear routes to enhance efficiency further in future designs.

""This is just the beginning. We've unlocked a whole new class of materials for optoelectronics,"" added Dr. Yunzhou Deng, postdoctoral research associate at the Cavendish Laboratory. ""The fundamental principle is so versatile that we can now explore countless combinations of organic molecules and insulating nanomaterials. This will allow us to create devices with tailored properties for applications we haven't even thought of yet.""

Studies in mice have shown that a hormone produced in the intestine can send signals to the brain and influence how much energy the body uses. This hormone, called FGF19 (fibroblast growth factor 19), activates processes that help the body spend more energy, use stored fat as fuel, and improve weight control and blood glucose levels in obese animals.

Researchers linked these effects to the action of FGF19 in the hypothalamus, a key brain region that receives information from the rest of the body and the environment to coordinate energy metabolism. They found that when FGF19 signals in the hypothalamus, it boosts the activity of thermogenic adipocytes (i.e., fat cells that burn energy to produce heat), which are specialized fat cells that help the body generate heat instead of storing calories.

New Paths for Obesity and Diabetes Treatments

Because of these findings, the scientists believe that FGF19 could inspire new medications for obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic conditions. The idea is to develop compounds that imitate the behavior of natural substances in the body, mimicking the action of endogenous compounds (i.e. those produced by the body itself).

This strategy resembles the way some of the latest diabetes and obesity drugs work. Ozempic, for example, contains semaglutide, an ingredient that activates receptors mimicking the hormone GLP-1. By doing so, it sends satiety signals to the brain and helps patients feel full with less food.

According to the study, FGF19 did more than change appetite or fat storage. The hormone also lowered peripheral inflammation and improved the animals' tolerance to cold. When the researchers blocked the sympathetic nervous system, however, these benefits disappeared. In further experiments, they observed that exposure to cold increased the expression of FGF19 receptors in the hypothalamus. Because the hypothalamus is crucial for maintaining body temperature, these results suggest that FGF19 may help the body adapt by coordinating energy balance and thermoregulation.

FGF19, Thermogenesis, and Brain Control of Energy

""FGF19 had already been linked to a reduction in food intake. Our work broke new ground by showing that it also plays an important role by acting on the hypothalamus and stimulating an increase in energy expenditure in white and brown adipose tissue. In other words, in addition to controlling appetite, it stimulates thermogenesis. So, in terms of therapy associated with obesity, it'd make a lot of sense,"" explains Professor Helena Cristina de Lima Barbosa, from the Obesity and Comorbidities Research Center (OCRC) at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

The OCRC is a Research, Innovation, and Dissemination Center (RIDC) of FAPESP, which also funded the project through grants to doctoral student Lucas Zangerolamo, the first author of the study, supervised by Barbosa.

The work has been described in detail in an article published in the American Journal of Physiology -- Endocrinology and Metabolism, where it was highlighted as a Top Article in May.

Global Obesity Crisis and Urgent Health Targets

The World Atlas of Obesity 2025 warns that, if current trends continue, global health goals for this year will not be met. These targets include halting the rise in diabetes and obesity and cutting premature deaths from cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer by 25%, using 2010 as the reference year.

The Atlas estimates that more than 1 billion people worldwide are currently living with obesity. If effective actions are not put in place, this number could surpass 1.5 billion by 2030. Obesity is already associated with about 1.6 million premature deaths each year from non-communicable diseases.

In Brazil, around 31% of the population has obesity. In addition, between 40% and 50% of adults do not reach the recommended levels of physical activity in terms of frequency or intensity.

Where FGF19 Comes From and How It Works

FGF19, which is involved in the control of energy metabolism, is mainly produced in the small intestine. In the liver, it regulates the production of bile acids and also influences the synthesis of glucose and fats. While its primary roles in the liver have been widely explored in scientific literature, its effects in the brain have received much less attention.

""In the lab, we work with bile acids, which are also the subject of my master's degree, and they regulate the release of FGF-19. Our initial studies led us down this path,"" Zangerolamo told Agência FAPESP.

At eight weeks of age, the mice used in the study were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received a standard diet (control) and the other was fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity. The researchers then administered FGF19 directly into the brains of the obese animals. All mice were kept in carefully controlled conditions of temperature, lighting, and access to water.

In the article, the scientists report that central FGF19 signaling improved energy homeostasis. It did this by boosting the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and stimulating thermogenesis in adipose tissue, leading the tissue to consume more energy in the form of heat.

""The brain plays an extremely important role in controlling the body's adiposity. At the same time as it receives information from peripheral tissues, it triggers commands. These commands, apparently using the sympathetic nervous system, seem to be an interesting way of thinking about energy expenditure,"" adds Barbosa.

Digging Deeper Into Brain Cells and FGF19 Receptors

To better understand which brain cells respond to FGF19, the authors compiled and examined public scRNA-seq data from several studies of the hypothalamus. This method makes it possible to sequence RNA from individual cells, revealing which genes are active in each cell type. In total, the team evaluated transcription from more than 50,000 single cells to identify hypothalamic cell populations that express FGF19 receptors.

The researchers note that a key question now is how to encourage the body to produce more FGF19 on its own. They are also working to connect these findings with what is already known about the neural circuits that regulate eating behavior.

""We want to broaden this understanding. We're studying the hypothalamus to evaluate the inflammation commonly observed when a high-fat diet is administered and whether FGF19 plays a role in this area,"" says Zangerolamo, who did part of the work during an internship at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School with Professor Yu-Hua Tseng, who is also an author of the article.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find hidden layers in brain's memory center","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251206030752.htm","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:16:53 GMT","

Researchers at the Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have uncovered a previously unrecognized organizational pattern in one of the brain's key regions for learning and memory. According to findings reported in Nature Communications, the CA1 section of a mouse's hippocampus contains four separate layers of specialized cell types. The hippocampus plays an essential role in forming memories, guiding spatial navigation, and influencing emotions, and the discovery of these layers offers new insight into how information moves through this part of the brain. It also provides clues about why some cell types are especially vulnerable in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.

""Researchers have long suspected that different parts of the hippocampus' CA1 region handle different aspects of learning and memory, but it wasn't clear how the underlying cells were arranged,"" said Michael S. Bienkowski, PhD, senior author of the study and assistant professor of physiology and neuroscience and of biomedical engineering.

""Our study shows that CA1 neurons are organized into four thin, continuous bands, each representing a different neuron type defined by a unique molecular signature. These layers aren't fixed in place; instead, they subtly shift and change in thickness along the length of the hippocampus. This shifting pattern means that each part of CA1 contains its own mix of neuron types, which helps explain why different regions support different behaviors. This may also clarify why certain CA1 neurons are more vulnerable in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy: if a disease targets one layer's cell type, the effects will vary depending on where in CA1 that layer is most prominent.""

High-resolution RNA imaging reveals cellular distinctions

To examine this structure, the research team used an RNA labeling technique called RNAscope together with high-resolution microscopy. This approach allowed them to observe single-molecule gene expression inside mouse CA1 tissue and identify individual neuron types based on their active genes. From 58.065 CA1 pyramidal cells, the scientists recorded more than 330,000 RNA molecules, which represent the genetic instructions that indicate when and where genes are expressed. By mapping these gene activity patterns, they produced a detailed cellular atlas outlining the boundaries between distinct nerve cell types across the CA1 region.

Their results showed that CA1 contains four continuous layers of nerve cells, each distinguished by its own pattern of active genes. When viewed in three dimensions, these layers form sheet-like structures that vary in thickness and shape along the hippocampus. This well-defined arrangement clarifies earlier studies that had described CA1 as a more blended or mosaic mixture of cell types.

Hidden ""stripes"" highlight internal brain architecture

""When we visualized gene RNA patterns at single-cell resolution, we could see clear stripes, like geological layers in rock, each representing a distinct neuron type,"" said Maricarmen Pachicano, doctoral researcher at the Stevens INI's Center for Integrative Connectomics and co-first author of the paper. ""It's like lifting a veil on the brain's internal architecture. These hidden layers may explain differences in how hippocampal circuits support learning and memory.""

Because the hippocampus is one of the first regions affected in Alzheimer's disease and is involved in epilepsy, depression, and other neurological conditions, identifying the CA1's layered structure offers a promising guide for determining which neuron types may be most at risk as these disorders progress.

Advancing brain mapping with modern imaging and data science

""Discoveries like this exemplify how modern imaging and data science can transform our view of brain anatomy,"" said Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI and the Ghada Irani Chair in Neuroscience at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. ""This work builds on the Stevens INI's long tradition of mapping the brain at every scale, from molecules to whole networks, and will inform both basic neuroscience and translational studies targeting memory and cognition.""

A new CA1 cell-type atlas available to researchers

The team compiled its findings into a new CA1 cell-type atlas using data from the Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas (HGEA). This resource is freely available to scientists worldwide and includes interactive 3D visualizations accessible through the Schol-AR augmented-reality app developed at the Stevens INI. The tool allows researchers to explore the layered structure of the hippocampus in great detail.

Because this layered pattern in mice resembles similar arrangements seen in primates and humans, including comparable variations in CA1 thickness, the researchers believe the organization may be shared across many mammalian species. Further work is needed to determine how closely this structure in humans matches what has been observed in mice, but the findings create a strong starting point for future studies examining how hippocampal architecture supports memory and cognition.

""Understanding how these layers connect to behavior is the next frontier,"" Bienkowski said. ""We now have a framework to study how specific neuron layers contribute to such different functions like memory, navigation, and emotion, and how their disruption may lead to disease.""

Using the SPHERE instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope, astronomers have created an extraordinary set of images showing debris disks in a wide range of exoplanetary systems. These dusty structures reveal where small bodies orbit their stars and provide rare insights into the earliest stages of planetary development. Gaël Chauvin (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy), project scientist for SPHERE and co-author of the study, explains: ""This data set is an astronomical treasure. It provides exceptional insights into the properties of debris disks, and allows for deductions of smaller bodies like asteroids and comets in these systems, which are impossible to observe directly.""

In our own solar system, once you look past the Sun, the planets, and dwarf planets such as Pluto, an enormous variety of smaller (""minor"") bodies comes into view. Scientists pay particular attention to objects ranging from about a kilometer to several hundred kilometers in size. Those that occasionally release gas and dust to form visible features like a tail are called comets, while those that do not show such activity are labeled asteroids.

These small bodies preserve clues to the solar system's earliest days. During the long process in which tiny grains grew into planets, intermediate objects known as planetesimals formed. Asteroids and comets are remnants of that transitional phase, planetesimals that never developed into full-size planets. In this sense, they are (somewhat) altered traces of the same ingredients that once built Earth.

Searching for small bodies in exoplanetary systems

Astronomers have identified more than 6000 exoplanets (that is, planets orbiting stars other than the Sun), giving us a clearer picture of how planetary systems vary throughout the galaxy. Directly imaging these worlds is still extremely difficult. Fewer than 100 exoplanets have been photographed so far, and even the largest ones appear only as featureless points of light.

This challenge becomes even greater when searching for small bodies. As Dr. Julien Milli, astronomer at the University Grenoble Alpes and co-author of the study, notes: ""Finding any direct clues about the small bodies in a distant planetary system from images seems downright impossible. The other indirect methods used to detect exoplanets are no help, either.""

Dust provides the key to detecting hidden planetesimals

The breakthrough comes not from the small bodies themselves, but from the dust created when they collide. Young planetary systems are especially active. Planetesimals frequently crash into each other, sometimes merging into larger bodies and sometimes fragmenting into smaller ones. These events release vast amounts of fresh dust.

The physics behind dust visibility is surprisingly intuitive. Breaking an object into many tiny pieces preserves its total volume, but dramatically increases its surface area. For example, if a one kilometer wide asteroid were crushed into dust grains just one micrometer across (a millionth of a meter), the overall surface area would increase by a factor of one billion. More surface area means far more light reflected from the star, which makes the dust easier to detect. By observing that dust, astronomers can infer details about the unseen small bodies producing it.

How debris disks evolve over time

Debris disks do not remain bright forever. As a young system matures, collisions become rarer. Dust can be pushed outward by radiation pressure from the central star, swept up by planets or planetesimals, or spiral inward and fall into the star.

Our solar system provides a late-stage example. After billions of years, two major planetesimal belts remain: the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the Kuiper belt beyond the giant planets. A population of smaller dust grains also persists, creating zodiacal dust. Under especially dark skies, sunlight scattered by this dust can be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise as a faint glow called zodiacal light.

For observers studying our solar system from afar, these faint leftovers would be hard to detect. The new research, however, shows that similar dusty structures around younger systems should be visible for roughly the first 50 million years of a debris disk's lifetime. Capturing these images is extremely challenging. The task has been compared to photographing a thin cloud of cigarette smoke beside a blinding stadium floodlight from several kilometers away. SPHERE, which began operating on one of ESO's Very Large Telescopes (VLT) in spring 2014, was created specifically for such situations.

How SPHERE blocks starlight to reveal faint features

The fundamental idea behind SPHERE is familiar from everyday experience. If the Sun is shining directly into your eyes, you might raise a hand to shield the glare so you can see what lies around it. SPHERE uses a coronagraph to achieve the same effect when imaging exoplanets or debris disks. By inserting a small disk into the path of the star's light, the instrument blocks most of the glare before the image is captured. This method only works if the optical system remains extremely stable and precise.

To maintain this stability, SPHERE relies on a highly advanced version of adaptive optics. Turbulence in Earth's atmosphere distorts incoming starlight, and SPHERE continually monitors these distortions and corrects them in real time using a deformable mirror. An optional component can also isolate ""polarized light,"" which is characteristic of light reflected by dust rather than emitted directly from a star. This additional filtering enhances SPHERE's ability to detect faint debris disks.

A major survey reveals 51 debris disks in sharp detail

The new study presents a unique set of debris disk images created by analyzing starlight scattered by tiny dust particles. ""To obtain this collection, we processed data from observations of 161 nearby young stars whose infrared emission strongly indicates the presence of a debris disk,"" says Natalia Engler (ETH Zurich), the lead author of the research. ""The resulting images show 51 debris disks with a variety of properties -- some smaller, some larger, some seen from the side and some nearly face-on -- and a considerable diversity of disk structures. Four of the disks had never been imaged before.""

Working with such a large sample makes it possible to find broader patterns. The analysis revealed that more massive young stars tend to host more massive debris disks. Systems where dust is concentrated farther from the star also show a tendency toward more massive disks.

Rings, belts, and hints of unseen planets

One of the most compelling aspects of the SPHERE results is the wide range of structures inside the disks. Many show rings or band-like patterns, with material clustered at specific distances from the star. This arrangement resembles our own solar system, where small bodies gather in the asteroid belt (asteroids) and the Kuiper belt (comets).

These structures are thought to be shaped by planets, especially large ones that clear out paths as they orbit. Some of the planets responsible have already been detected. In other cases, sharp edges or asymmetries in the disks strongly suggest the presence of planets that have not yet been directly observed. Because of this, the SPHERE survey provides a valuable set of targets for upcoming facilities. Instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) under construction by ESO should be capable of directly imaging at least some of the planets that are sculpting these dusty rings and gaps.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","AI's climate impact is much smaller than many feared","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251205054736.htm","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 15:09:16 GMT","

New research challenges the widespread belief that artificial intelligence is driving a major spike in global greenhouse gas emissions. The study suggests that AI's overall influence on worldwide pollution is small and could even support environmental and economic progress.

Scientists from the University of Waterloo and the Georgia Institute of Technology analyzed U.S. economic data alongside estimates of how frequently AI tools are used across different industries. Their goal was to understand what might happen to the environment if AI adoption increases along its current path.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 83 percent of the nation's economic activity relies on petroleum, coal and natural gas. These fuels release greenhouse gases when burned. The researchers noted that total energy use from AI in the United States matched the electricity consumption of Iceland, yet this amount remained insignificant when viewed at national or global levels.

Local Energy Pressures Can Still Be Significant

""It is important to note that the increase in energy use is not going to be uniform. It's going to be felt more in the places where electricity is produced to power the data centers,"" said Dr. Juan Moreno-Cruz, a professor in the Faculty of Environment at Waterloo and Canada Research Chair in Energy Transitions. ""If you look at that energy from the local perspective, that's a big deal because some places could see double the amount of electricity output and emissions. But at a larger scale, AI's use of energy won't be noticeable.""

The study did not explore economic outcomes within the specific communities that host data centers, but the researchers identified several positive takeaways.

AI Could Support Cleaner Technologies

""For people who believe that the use of AI will be a major problem for the climate and think we should avoid it, we're offering a different perspective,"" Moreno-Cruz said. ""The effects on climate are not that significant, and we can use AI to develop green technologies or to improve existing ones.""

To develop their findings, environmental economists Moreno-Cruz and Dr. Anthony Harding reviewed a variety of economic sectors, the types of jobs within those sectors, and the share of tasks that could potentially be performed by AI.

Moreno-Cruz and Harding intend to apply the same approach to additional countries in order to understand how AI adoption may influence environmental outcomes across different regions of the world.

7/10

Many companies have tried and failed to produce gaming handhelds that run Windows, and it's not hard to see the appeal. You could take all of your games with you, install mods and custom software, or even plug into a hub and get some work done. Lenovo is taking another swing at the Windows handheld game with the Legion Go 2, undeterred by mixed reviews on the original Legion Go and streamlined Legion Go S.

But even a snappier interface and versatile input methods can't overcome a lot of the barriers inherent to running Windows on a device with no keyboard. If you're willing to put in the work, or you already love your original Legion Go, the performance, screen, and software support have all improved. If you're easily frustrated or don't want to spend the time troubleshooting to dial in your experience, I'd recommend picking something a little lower maintenance.

I was initially confused by the controllers, which are absolutely covered in buttons. Having a mouse is super helpful during Windows setup, and I repeatedly tried to figure out how I was intended to click the marked mouse buttons on the side of the controller while using the trackpad, only to later discover those aren't used in handheld mode. It turns out the touchpad is tap-to-click only, which is a little awkward. The left joystick already controls the cursor, and there's no obvious button for left click on your right hand.

Speaking of cursors, the right controller has an optical sensor on the bottom so you can use it as a mouse, which Lenovo calls FPS mode in the settings. It's unique, and the easy access to a mouse and right-click without using the touchpad is a nice bonus, but the way you grip the controller means you're always kind of palming the joystick on the side. I play a lot of mouse-dependent games like World of Warcraft, and I find it more useful for patching holes where controller buttons don't cover niche situations, or briefly switching to do inventory management. As an actual controller for shooters, it's less comfortable, and I can connect my own mouse if I really want to—one of the perks of running Windows.

It doesn't help that the Legion Go 2 is a particularly chunky device. Not only is it heavier than other handhelds I've tested recently, it's also fairly thick and wide, so it isn't very comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions.

The detachable controllers go a long way towards making the device more portable and usable. The screen has a hefty flip-out kickstand on the back, so I've found it more comfortable to park the console on the table or bar in front of me, and hold the controllers at lap level. The upside to the substantial build is that the controllers have comfortable built-in grips, with smooth magnetic Hall effect sticks, and buttons that have a soft, yet distinct touch.

There are also two minor inclusions here that I think do a lot for the user experience. The first is the included case, which might not sound important, but often these handheld gaming consoles don't include one. Because they aren't standard-sized, it's often hard to find a third-party case, particularly at release. While I wouldn't necessarily trust the semi-soft pouch to protect my new device in a checked bag, I'm totally comfortable tossing it in my backpack and going for a bike ride, and I appreciate that there's a little spot for the FPS mode accessories inside. The other feature is the fingerprint sensor, which works consistently and quickly, and is much easier than trying to type in a password on a touchscreen every time you wake the system up, although it is in a slightly awkward position.

The performance on the AMD Z2 is thankfully much better than the Z2 Go found in the Legion Go S. At native resolution, with settings maxed but ray tracing off, I was sitting at 20 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077's benchmark. That might sound rough coming from desktop numbers, but it's somewhat impressive for a gaming handheld. For reference, the Z2 Go only managed 20 FPS with the graphics set to low at the same resolution. With a little tweaking or a resolution drop, you could easily break 60 FPS in one of the more demanding modern games.

On indie titles like the recently released Ball x Pit, the meter stays glued to the screen's 144-Hz limit, which is great news, since you'll regularly be able to take advantage of the smooth refresh rate. The panel itself is OLED, and it's one of the best gaming handheld screens I've tested yet, with full, vivid colors and deep, dark black levels. It measures a full 336 nits at max brightness, but more impressively, covers 100 percent of the sRGB and 94 percent of the AdobeRGB spectrums, with a .86 color accuracy delta. That color coverage and accuracy is up there with some of the best laptops and dedicated computer monitors. It's a delight to play on, and despite its glossy finish, I didn't have any game-breaking issues with heavy reflections or glare.

The combination of the high-refresh panel and relatively powerful processor definitely affects the battery life. I was able to play CloverPit, which isn't terribly demanding, for just over two hours at 30 percent screen brightness before the low battery warning popped up. Thankfully, there are two USB ports for charging—one on the top and one on the bottom—because you'll need to get used to plugging in while you play.

The bigger problem here is that you'll have to mess with settings more than you would on a SteamOS device to smooth out performance. Most games don't really know what to make of Windows handhelds, so they just take a stab at default settings based on the information they do have about your hardware.

I ran into fewer issues with games coming out of the box unplayable on this system than I have with previous similar systems, thanks to better performance, as well as developers starting to plan more for these unique devices. You should plan on spending some time with the graphics menu after installing most games, more so than you would on a Steam Deck.

Windows is still the worst part of this experience. Just getting to the Windows desktop the first time took me almost half an hour, and it involved declining a seemingly endless series of offers for Office360 and OneDrive, dealing with pages of privacy settings and cloud backup options, and manually typing in my password on the touchscreen. Even after all that, I still had to go install a browser, download Steam and other launchers, and configure the system to understand the input methods and power modes I needed.

I stuck with the built-in controls for the sake of the review, but I imagine most folks will get fed up and plug in a keyboard and mouse for the initial setup, if not on a regular basis.

For some reason, I don't feel like I'm always in control of this machine. Sometimes things just happen, like the Task Manager randomly opening, or dialog boxes prompting me to go to the Microsoft Store. I've spent time with multiple iterations of the more streamlined Legion Go S, and on the Windows side, the interface leaves a lot to be desired. It's slow to appear when you press the dedicated button, and slower to react when you try to change core settings. On this version of the device, the button works nearly instantly, as you'd expect, and flipping through the overlay and settings feels responsive and unintrusive.

Unfortunately, there are just too many ways to interact layered over each other, and too many buttons with vague icons. To top it off, a desktop OS is designed to show a ton of information that can't fit on a compact, lower-resolution screen. The whole experience feels janky compared to the SteamOS setup process, which involves entering your Wi-Fi password and scanning a QR code with your phone. Everything past that point is designed for controllers, which means no weird confirmation screens or dead links or right-clicking required.

Even with the improvements Lenovo has made over time, the lack of cohesion is felt across a variety of minor and major system functions, from power and sleep to screen and performance settings. As such, I don't think you should buy the Legion Go 2 if you're just looking for something to jam some Vampire Survivors on your holiday vacation. It's too big and heavy, with too much going on, and you're likely to end up frustrated when a rogue Windows update kicks in right before a long flight.

We also have to talk about the cost: At $1,100 for the basic model, you could buy the most expensive OLED Steam Deck AND a Nintendo Switch 2. The upgraded model I tested with the Z2 Extreme will run you a full $1,350, enough to build your own midrange gaming desktop. While this is certainly the most performant and well-featured gaming handheld I've tested, you have to really be sure that you truly desire what the Legion Go 2 is offering. It isn't just a game console, it's a project, and an extra computer to manage. As a system builder and gaming nerd, I understand the appeal, but I imagine most people want a more plug-and-play experience from their handhelds.

The first Legion Go had a whole community of modders and optimizers making the most of the device, and I'm sure this one will too. If you're already imagining complex dock setups, novel uses for FPS mode, and don't mind putting in the work, you can achieve some really cool stuff. The Legion Go 2's most appealing feature is definitely its adaptability, but it's going to require a little bit of legwork, and a dash of patience, to achieve its full potential.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Why Tehran Is Running Out of Water","https://www.wired.com/story/why-tehran-is-running-out-of-water-iran-climate-change-drought-extreme-weather/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

This story originally appeared on Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

During the summer of 2025, Iran experienced an exceptional heat wave, with daytime temperatures across several regions, including Tehran, approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing the temporary closure of public offices and banks. During this period, major reservoirs supplying the Tehran region reached record-low levels, and water supply systems came under acute strain. By early November, the reservoir behind Amir Kabir Dam, a main source of drinking water for Tehran, had dropped to about 8 percent of its capacity. The present crisis reflects not only this summer's extreme heat but also several consecutive years of reduced precipitation and ongoing drought conditions across Iran. As a result, the capital of Iran is now facing a potential “Day Zero” when taps could run dry.

The drought quickly disrupted Tehran's urban systems. With dry soils and high evaporation, rivers and wetlands shrank. Falling reservoir levels led to disruptions in hydropower generation, and water shortages prompted strict saving measures across parts of the capital. Amid these escalating pressures, officials warned that the capital city may even have to be evacuated if water supplies fail to recover. In November, President Masoud Pezeshkian said the capital would have to be moved. These cascading impacts exposed how vulnerable Tehran's infrastructure, economy, and communities have become under compounding heat and drought stress.

These cascading impacts stem from a prolonged shortage of precipitation in recent years (Figure 1a). Precipitation around Tehran typically peaks between December and April, replenishing reservoirs behind dams before the onset of the dry summer. Over the past five years, precipitation during this wet period has remained consistently below the long-term climatological baseline, with the 2024-25 season showing the most pronounced and prolonged deficit across the entire rainy season. When such prolonged dryness was followed by an exceptionally hot summer, it amplified hydrological stress across the region.

Seasonal cycle of precipitation averaged over a 1°×1° region centered on Tehran, based on GPM IMERG Final Run (V07B) dataset: monthly means for 2000/01–2019/20 (black), 2020/21–2024/25 (blue) and 2024/25 (red).

This prolonged precipitation deficit was not confined to Tehran but was part of a broader regional anomaly extending across much of Iran (Figure 1b). Satellite-based estimates for November 2024 to April 2025 reveal a pronounced north–south precipitation dipole, with enhanced precipitation north of latitude 40° N but markedly reduced precipitation across central and southern Iran. The precipitation deficit was particularly evident along a broad corridor extending from the eastern Mediterranean through Iran, indicating reduced storm activity across the region. This weakening of storm activity led to marked reductions in snowpack accumulation and reservoir inflows, aggravating the ongoing water scarcity crisis.

In maps of global projections of climate change impacts on precipitation, the region over and around the Mediterranean basin stands out because of the magnitude and significance of its precipitation decline. MIT researchers Alexandre Tuel and Elfatih Eltahir have explained why this region stands out as a hot spot for climate change. A more recent follow-up study by our group projects future declines in winter and spring precipitation extending to Mesopotamia and surrounding regions under a high-emission scenario by the end of the century. The projected change of the air circulation over the central and eastern Mediterranean, where most storms originate during winter, inhibits the formation of storm systems and consequently limits their eastward propagation, thereby reducing precipitation over Mesopotamia and adjacent regions eastward, including the area around Tehran.

Another contributing factor is the poleward displacement of storm tracks. During the spring season, the projected changes in regional air circulation due to global climate change move northward from the Mediterranean into southern Europe pushing the storm tracks further north and creating a dipole pattern (more precipitation in the north, less precipitation to the south) that reduces precipitation around Tehran. Consistent with this theory, simulations by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) models of future climate in this region project a pattern of change that resembles the regional pattern observed this last year, especially during the spring (Figure 1c). This similarity between observed and projected patterns suggests that the dry conditions observed this year may offer a glimpse of relatively dry conditions in the future, especially in spring season.

Projected Spring (March–May) precipitation change derived from an ensemble mean of three CMIP6 global climate models (MPI-ESM1-2-LR, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, and NorESM2-LM), selected for their ability to capture the long-term mean climate and its trends. Superimposed hatching denotes agreement (100 percent) by three GCMs on the sign of the change.

The region around Tehran falls in a transitional zone between the tropics and midlatitudes, with complex dynamics of storms systems. The nature and origins of storms in this region are different between winter and spring seasons. IPCC models do not fully agree on the projections of winter precipitation around Tehran. Future research will be needed to better understand natural climate variability as well as impacts of future climate change on precipitation, especially during the winter season.

The extreme heat and drought affecting Tehran this year were exceptional in both magnitude and duration. Events of this kind are projected to become more frequent in the future around this region as the climate warms. If this trajectory continues, Tehran is likely to face more frequent droughts, reducing reservoir levels, limiting urban water supply, and presenting significant hazards to the vital systems of public health, energy, and food supply. Taken collectively, the findings from this recent event expose an outstanding set of climate related risks and underscore the need for immediate, dual-track action—rapid global emissions mitigation alongside proactive local adaptation—to limit escalating risk.

It was only back in June that Android 16 delivered a raft of new features for Google's operating system, but the company just announced another bumper package of updates, including more customization options, better parental controls, and smart notifications.

You can now create custom icon shapes, cohesive themes, and extend dark mode to apps that don't have their own dark theme. The overhauled parental controls let you manage screen time, downtime, app usage, and rewards directly on your kid's devices, while AI-powered notification summaries give you a TL;DR of long messages or group chats. Related notifications are also now grouped, and lower-priority notifications, like promotions, are silenced.

There are nifty new accessibility features too. Expressive Captions now have the relevant emotion tags, and they're rolling out in English-speaking YouTube videos as well as across Android. Configurable AutoClick for mouse users reduces strain, Guided Frame is now more descriptive about what's in the camera's view on the Pixel camera app, and you can launch Voice Access with a voice command to Gemini. Fast Pair for hearing aids is also expanding (now available for Demant, Starkey support coming in early 2026), and better voice dictation with TalkBack is coming soon. These features are coming to Pixel devices first, but will follow to third-party devices in time.

Google is also showing some love to older versions of Android, with features that aren't 16-specific, such as Emoji Kitchen stickers, the ability to leave and report group chats in Google Messages, the option to check for scams with Circle to Search, and pinned tabs in Chrome just like on desktop. My favorite new feature is Call Reason, which enables you to flag your call to any saved contact as “urgent.” —Simon Hill

Sony has released the A7 V, an upgrade to the prosumer full-frame Alpha 7 camera. The mark 5 version of the A7 brings a new 33-MP partially stacked CMOS sensor and the BIONZ XR2 processor, which brings the AI processing unit into the processor. Also notably improved in this update is the In-Body Image Stabilization (IBIS), which is now up to 7.5 stops. There are 16 stops of dynamic range, 30-fps shooting with full autofocus, and Sony's remarkably good AI subject and eye detection as well.

While the A7 series skews toward the still-photo shooter, there are some video improvements worth noting, include 7K oversampled 4K/60-fps full-frame recording. There's also 4K/120 fps available in Super 35-mm mode (APS-C). Alas, there's no open gate recording here. That's reserved for the high-end flagships like the A1.

I've had a chance to test out the A7 V for a few days, and so far the outstanding feature is the autofocus, which is by far the most accurate system I've ever used in a camera at this price. The low-light possibilities of 7.5-stop IBIS are also impressive. The Sony A7 V will be available at the end of December for $2,899. You can preorder today at Adorama and B&H Photo. —Scott Gilbertson

Even the best folding phones right now only have a single fold, mostly going from regular phone size to a 7- or 8-inch tablet, but Samsung is about to unfurl its Galaxy Z TriFold in the US. Despite the name, it has two folds, but that lets you go from a regular (but pretty thick) phone to a whopping 10-inch tablet that's just 3.9-mm thick (ignoring the camera module).

Naturally, it is a specs beast with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for Galaxy inside, a 200-MP camera, and a 5,600-mAh three-cell battery (the biggest Samsung has put in a folding phone so far). It also supports 45W fast charging, has 16 GB of RAM, and comes with 512 GB or 1 TB of storage. But it's really all about that mammoth 10-inch AMOLED screen. The resolution is 2160 x 1584 pixels, it can hit 1,600 nits peak brightness, and it supports a 120-Hz adaptive refresh rate.

We knew it was coming because Samsung has been teasing a trifold all year, but it will be the first such design to land stateside. The Huawei Mate XT, which I went hands-on with at MWC, never made it to the US. While a 10-inch screen in your pocket is great if you love to watch movies or multitask on your phone (Samsung will allow three apps side-by-side), the Galaxy Z TriFold is thick when closed (12.9 mm discounting the camera module), very heavy (309 grams), and will likely cost a frightening amount of money (I'm guessing $3K-ish). It will land in the US in the first quarter of 2026. —Simon Hill

A popular accessory for e-readers has been a page-turning remote, allowing you to turn the page with a click of the remote in your hand instead of needing to swipe or click on the device itself. It's a popular choice for power readers who have accessories to hold up their e-reader for them, and a remote is a good ergonomic and accessibility option. These page turners have only been third-party accessories until now, with Kobo dropping the Kobo Remote just in time for the holiday season. It's built to connect with any Kobo e-reader with Bluetooth capabilities, and Kobo promises it will have a long battery life (which is important, speaking as someone whose cheap third-party page turner died every time I tried to use it.) It's a fun gift for anyone with a Kobo e-reader, but it makes me wonder: Where's the Kindle version, Amazon? Hopefully we'll see an option from all popular e-reader makers next year, but for now, Kobo is the first. —Nena Farrell

With the new generation of voice assistants, better conversationality is the big promise. Amazon expanded the conversation options with its new assistant, Alexa+, by adding a new jump-to-scene feature with Fire TVs that lets you ask for a specific scene in a show or movie and Amazon's assistant will immediately play your entertainment of choice from that point. You can describe scenes for Alexa+ to find, by saying things like “the scene in Mamma Mia where Sophie sings 'Honey, Honey'"" or “the card scene in Love Actually” and Alexa+ will now be able to find it. Amazon promises this will work with thousands of movies on Prime Video, and that it'll work with all Fire TV devices that have Alexa+ compatibility, which includes the second generations of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Fire TV Stick 4K, the third-gen Fire TV Cube, plus a handful of different Fire TVs. —Nena Farrell

9/10

Ever since its inception in the early 2000s, Swedish brand MIPS has had a monopoly, more or less, on inclusion in high-end bike helmets. Its device—revolutionary at the time—deflects rotational impact away from the head in the event of a crash, thereby reducing the likelihood of brain trauma. However, it has also provoked many companies to research and develop their own proprietary rotational impact protection units, most of which are different takes on the same concept—a snug inner webbing that is able to move independently of the helmet's outer shell.

British brand RLS took a new stance on rotational impact protection, moving its device from the inside of the helmet to the outside. In doing so, the company claims that its technology can reduce the risk of concussion by four times when compared to traditional helmets. Studies at the standard-bearing helmet-safety lab at Virginia Tech University have confirmed those claims, giving the new Canyon Deflectr RLS—the first commercial helmet available with RLS—their highest rating after recent testing.

Like any other new technology brand, RLS is hardly new. Its founders and earliest employees spent years toiling in a series of warehouse bays in East London, trying to find a way to better protect against rotational impact. Like all great origin stories, it wasn't until the eleventh hour, when the brand was nearly out of seed money, that the company decided to try something new and potentially revolutionary: polycarbonate ball bearings.

Rating: 9/10

RLS engineers fastened hundreds of the tiny bearings to adhesive strips, which they then stuck to the outer shells of helmets. Those strips were then covered in another layer of hard helmet shell. Et voila!

The idea behind RLS technology is that when the helmet impacts a hard surface, the ball bearings roll off the strip, forcing the outer layer to shear away from the helmet. Those outer layers release, hence the company's name, RLS, or “Release Layer System.”

According to data gleaned from thousands upon thousands of internal tests, along with independent testing and verification from labs like Virginia Tech's, RLS is said to reduce the probability of brain injury by anywhere from 68 percent to 84 percent when compared to a non-RLS helmet.

A few weeks ago, I visited RLS's headquarters in their East London warehouses. After they showed me data and analytics, videos of how the RLS system works, and even real-time tests, they sent me home with a Deflectr Trail RLS, marking the brand's collaboration with beloved German direct-to-consumer brand Canyon.

At first glance, the Deflectr looks like any other mountain bike helmet. It's bigger and bulkier than a typical road or commuter helmet, with added protection for the basal skull and a sun-blocking visor. On closer inspection, a series of panels, slightly raised from the helmet's surface, becomes apparent. Beneath these panels is where the genius of the RLS system lives.

In practice, the Deflectr worked just fine. It fit well, thanks to its dial-adjust fit system. At 326 grams, it didn't put added strain on my neck over the course of a few long trail sessions.

Despite the potentially revolutionary technology that lives just beneath those outer shell panels, the Deflectr RLS is just an off-road bike helmet. The only strange choice here is the chin strap, which Canyon calls its HighBar System. Unlike your typical strap, wherein a pair of nylon strips are fastened beneath your chin, the Deflectr features a stiff (though relatively pliable) plastic band that pulls down from the front of the helmet and under your chin, and uses a dial system to tighten to fit.

I think most helmet straps work just fine. Still, the HighBar System means that the rider can make one-handed strap adjustments on the fly, sometimes while riding. Anyway, once I had the helmet on and fastened to my head, I forgot about the helmet's strap system entirely.

Canyon Deflectr RLS Helmet

Rating: 9/10

Over the course of several hours and a few dozen trail miles, I had little to say about the Deflectr RLS, which is precisely what you want in a bike helmet. In other words, when a bike helmet is well made, it's something you should forget is there.

Other than the odd choice of strap (which, as I mentioned, I got over quickly), the only knock I have is how the Deflectr RLS is, as of this writing, only offered in one of two color options: matte black or metallic olive. While those are both cool and all, those of us who ride beneath the brutal southern sun know the value of a white or light-colored helmet.

The sample helmet I was sent came in a really interesting blocky black/white color combo that both looked cool and went a bit further in keeping the temps around my skull down. Here's hoping there are more color options on the horizon. According to Canyon's website, the massive vents at the top of the Deflectr, combined with the large intake and exhaust vents work in tandem to keep your head cool. Still, sometimes, in the dead of summer, white can be a rider's best friend.

According to RLS, the Deflectr is just the first in what will soon be a line of bike, motorcycle, climbing, and even construction helmets. And at just $160, it's significantly easier on the wallet than some of its contemporary high-end helmets, which can easily run into the $300 range.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Samsung Raises Foldable Ante With Galaxy Z TriFold","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/samsung-raises-foldable-ante-with-galaxy-z-trifold-180037.html","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 05:16:47 GMT","

Samsung raised the ante in the foldable smartphone market on Tuesday with the introduction of the Galaxy Z TriFold.

The three-panel phone folds out to create a 10-inch QXGA+ display (2160 x 1584) with a peak brightness of 1600 nits and a 120Hz refresh rate.

The phone's two side panels fold inward to protect the main screen, and there's an auto-alarm system that alerts a user when the device is being folded incorrectly.

The device can run three portrait-sized apps simultaneously — one in each panel — or a single app across all three panels. The phone also supports an external monitor.



When folded, the phone is 12.9 mm thick. Unfolded, it's 3.9 mm thick at its thinnest point. By comparison, an iPhone 17 Pro is 8.75 mm thick, and an iPhone Air, Apple's thinnest phone, is 5.64 mm thick.

The phone, available only in black, will be offered with 16GB of memory and either 1TB or 512GB of storage. There is no MicroSD support.

Under the hood, the phone features a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile processor and a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery, with one cell in each display panel.

At the rear of the phone, there's a 12MP ultra-wide camera, 200MP wide-angle snapper, and 10MP telephoto unit with 3x optical zoom and 30x digital zoom.

There are two 10MP cameras on the front of the unit — one on the screen cover and one on the main screen. 



Samsung calls the TriFold its most advanced foldable, pairing a redesigned dual-hinge system with a reinforced display and stronger exterior materials, including a titanium hinge housing and Advanced Armor Aluminum frame. It will debut in Korea on Dec. 12 before rolling out to other markets, including the United States. The phone will reportedly sell for $2,440.

A tri-fold smartphone is an overall better two-in-one device than a bi-fold, explained Kristen Hanich, director of research at Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company specializing in consumer technology products, in Dallas.

“The design allows the user to more easily access the device in its phone form-factor, while also supporting a larger tablet screen when unfolded,” she told TechNewsWorld. “It's better as a phone replacement and better as a tablet replacement.”

A tri-fold lets you carry something that behaves like a 10-inch tablet in a pocketable phone footprint, noted Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm, in Las Vegas.

“It gives power users more room for side-by-side apps, content creation, and productivity than even today's book-style foldables,” he told TechNewsWorld. It is less about basic phone tasks and more about replacing your secondary device.

Tri-folds also have benefits for the approximately 34 million American users of reading glasses. The larger screen allows you to enlarge the typeface and still get a lot of words on the same screen, explained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm, in Bend, Ore.

“It is also better for video content for those who travel a lot,” he told TechNewsWorld. “And it is still unique enough to convey a bit of status, since tri-folds are relatively rare.”

Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology advisory firm, in San Jose, Calif., maintained that the market has not shown any demand for tri-fold smartphones. “The Galaxy TriFold is designed to show off Samsung's design prowess and innovation,” he told TechNewsWorld.

The challenge with the foldable phone market is that there isn't a killer app, or a suite of apps, that delivers high enough value for these devices to be adopted by a large segment of users, contended Tuong Huy Nguyen, director analyst for emerging technologies and trends at Gartner, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn.

“The challenge for the foldable market isn't a technical [or] engineering challenge. It's a market challenge,” he told TechNewsWorld. “What content, apps, and services are available to support it, and are they high-value enough? Foldables are lacking an ecosystem to support them in a way that's unique to this form factor.”

“Until foldable phones come down in price substantially, or deliver utility and value that justify their cost, they will continue to be a niche product,” he said.

Bajarin acknowledged that foldable phones are a niche at the moment, but argued that they could change rapidly. If Apple decides to bring out a folding iPhone and bless this category, the potential for demand for folding smartphones could rise significantly, he predicted.

“Apple will not release a folding smartphone unless it has the technology perfected to Apple's standards,” he added. “But if and when they do bring one to market, Apple's marketing and innovation engine will kick in, and interest in this category will be heightened.”

In addition to marketing prowess, Apple could bring something else to the foldable table. Developers have historically been more willing to update their software to take better advantage of Apple's hardware, explained Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm, in New York City.

“We saw that over many years with the iPad, where apps that had originally been iPhone apps were optimized more for the iPad than Android phone apps were for Android tablets,” he told TechNewsWorld.

He added that Samsung's timing of the TriFold introduction is also interesting. Samsung is coming out with this larger phone surface at the same time that Google is looking at merging Android and elements of Chrome OS. A large part of that would be better support for larger screens.

“There is a perception that Apple is behind the proverbial eight ball in the foldable space because Samsung now has book-style, flip-style, and tri-fold hardware on the market while Apple is still all-in on slabs,” added SmartTech's Vena. “Strategically, though, Apple tends to wait until it can solve durability, thickness, and app experience in a way that feels invisible to users.”

“The bigger question is whether customers will still care about foldables by the time Apple finally jumps in,” he added. “Interestingly, I contend that Samsung wants Apple to jump into the category to validate foldable phones with the consequence that ‘a rising tide lifts all boats.'”

Vena asserted that tri-folds are less about chasing a gimmick and more about testing the upper limits of the phone as a primary computer. The real unlock will come when software and AI actually exploit the extra canvas with smarter multitasking, not just bigger icons, he said. In the meantime, this category will be a fascinating test bed for what next-generation mobile devices look like.

“I carry a Google Pixel Fold 10 and have used foldable phones since the Microsoft Duo came out,” Enderle noted. “I don't think I could go back to a non-foldable phone.”

“However,” he continued, “a tri-fold may be a bridge too far for me, both because of cost and because in a tri-fold the flexible screen is more exposed than a dual-fold and has more mechanical vulnerability.”

Foldables aren't for everybody, maintained Anshel Sag, a senior analyst for mobility, 5G and XR at Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas.

“I think they are an ultra-premium niche today that will eventually cannibalize even more of the tablet market than foldables have to date,” he told TechNewsWorld. “I personally almost never use a tablet, but having a foldable has become central to my daily use.”

Parks' Hanich added: Tri-folds are an exciting development in mobile computing, serving as both a smartphone and tablet replacement — and potentially a laptop replacement, as well.

Amazon is experimenting again. This week on the GeekWire Podcast, we dig into our scoop on Amazon Now, the company's new ultrafast delivery service. Plus, we recap the GeekWire team's ride in a Zoox robotaxi on the Las Vegas Strip during Amazon Web Services re:Invent. 

In our featured interview from the expo hall, AWS Senior Vice President Colleen Aubrey discusses Amazon's push into applied AI, why the company sees AI agents as “teammates,” and how her team is rethinking product development in the age of agentic coding.

Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple, has placed himself at the center of the pack — literally — with his latest viral installation at Art Basel Miami Beach, and there's still time to see it through Sunday.

His “Regular Animals” project features $100,000 robotic dogs outfitted with hyper-realistic heads resembling Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, alongside art legends Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. The robot dogs roam a plexiglass pen, capturing images through chest-mounted cameras that are processed by AI and then essentially pooped out, according to the WSJ. Of the prints produced, 256 include QR codes that offer collectors a free NFT, dispensed in bags labeled “Excrement Sample.”

Beeple also included himself in this exclusive group, a move the Charleston-based artist himself called “ballsy.” His self-portrait dog sold first, surprising even Beeple, he told the Journal. 

The project marks at least the second time Winkelmann has become the art world's main character. Four years ago, his digital collage sold at Christie's for $69 million, helping to fuel an NFT boom that would peak a year later before largely imploding.

In September, popular creator IShowSpeed live-streamed his meeting with the popular humanoid influencer Rizzbot.

Rizzbot has more than a million followers (and 800 million views) across social media and is known for its comedic roasting of subjects, as well as giving people the middle finger.  Speed, meanwhile, has more than 50 million followers (and 6 billion views) across various platforms and is known for his dramatic behavior while livestreaming.

What happened when the two parties met is the subject of a lawsuit that Rizzbot's creators, Social Robotics, detailed in a petition filed in November against Speed, né Darren Jason Watkins Jr., his management company, Mixed Management, and another producer who was with Speed's team that day. The petition, obtained by TechCrunch, alleges that Speed inflicted “irreparable damage” to Rizzbot.

The lawsuit alleged that — and the livestream video shows that — Speed repeatedly punched Rizzbot in the face, put it in a chokehold, at one point pinned it to the couch, and threw it to the ground.

“Speed absolutely knew that this was not an appropriate way to interact with a sophisticated robot and knew that such actions with inflict irreparable damage to Rizzbot,” the petition read. “These actions resulted in the total loss of the Rizzbot.”

The petition read that Speed's handling of the robot caused “complete loss of functionality,” and that Rizzbot had “significant damages” to its mouth and neck.

“Additionally, the head cameras no longer function, the ports behind the neck which connect to robot's sensors that allow it to see and hear are dead, and the robot is unstable and cannot walk straight any longer,” the petition alleges. The petition is asking for compensation for damages, including actual and lost profit, though Rizzbot's legal team declined to comment on the dollar amount the owner is seeking.

The Austin Police had to be called after the incident, according to the petition and a police report obtained by TechCrunch. The responding officer noted damages to Rizzbot done without the owner's “implied consent,” and that the owner wanted to press charges. The petition states that an investigation is ongoing.

Speed's management team did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

When reached, Social Robotics' lawyer, Joel Levine, said the lawsuit came after talks stalled with Speed's team regarding how to compensate Rizzbot's owner for the damage done to the robot.

“This was an event that was live-streamed so there's not a ton of discrepancy as to the facts,” Levine told TechCrunch. “What we're looking for is some accountability.”

The petition said that Speed “failed to act as a careful, reasonable, and prudent person,” and that he “wrongfully exercised control over,” Rizzbot. It also said that as a result of the destruction, the team behind Rizzbot has lost out on economic opportunities since Rizzbot is indefinitely unable to partake in high-profile appearances and deals, including scheduled upcoming ones with CBS's The NFL Today and Mr. Beast.

“This is no doubt a monumental setback for the Rizzbot in terms of viral momentum and financial gain from the exposure,” the petition said. “Being in a MrBeast production is akin to being in a Super Bowl Commercial.”

The petition read that in the month before the livestream, Rizzbot generated more than 600 million views on TikTok and 200 million on Instagram. In the 28 days after the incident, however, the petition alleges that Rizzbot was unable to make new content and therefore saw a more than 70% decrease in viewership. The “intentional destruction of Rizzbot caused significant financial damage that is likely permanent given the viral nature of social media,” the petition read.

Levine said there has been no formal answer to his plaintiff's suit just yet and noted that they are still in the very early stages of litigation. When asked for comment, Rizzbot told TechCrunch via email it had to get “a whole new body” after Speed “wrecked” its last one.

“Everything's brand new except my Nike kicks and cowboy hat,” Rizzbot told TechCrunch in a statement. “Now I'm back online, and I feel like I've mastered the rizz game, and next I'll be working on complex movements with my legs, like twerking – hopefully you'll see my gyrating hips on some new TV appearances shortly – stay tuned, fam.”

""""On the first day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida, divided his film photography students into two groups.Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group.

But it always takes like half an hour. :))I usually start then something else. I have many projects open. But its like....these context switches, they are draining.So yeah, i like to go the dangerous part, deploy right away from my dev machine. But i get immediate reaction. I dont have to wait. But my mates dont like it. And so i deal with it.

Indiscriminately espousing raw speed for every step is a perfect recipe for burnout.

In software, optimizing for speed works best in cases where architecture has minimal relevance for product outcomes. If I am writing a Python library then I typically iterate very quickly. Swapping out bits of implementation has low cost.If I am writing a database kernel then designing any part of it poorly has a high chance of permanently crippling the implementation. Iterating is often tantamount to a major rewrite and extremely costly. You can only afford a very small number of rewrites before the iteration time stretches into years, so it is actually faster to spend much more time thinking through details that may seem unimportant.

But I hadn't until now seen the connection to speed spelled out. Of course, to try a lot you have to be fast at each attemp.

The world conspires to prevent action. Humans (like all lifeforms) are naturally lazy. We want to get the biggest benefit for the least expenditure of energy. There's always a voice in the back of our minds saying, ""nah, don't bother doing that--it's too much work and it's not worth it.""Everything we see reinforces this voice. When we see hustle culture, we think, ""that's cringe--I would never want to do that."" And so we don't. When a startup fails, we think, ""see, it's not worth it."" And when a startup succeeds, we think, ""well, they got lucky, and anyway they had rich parents, so they were bound to succeed.""Worse, it's easy to do things that feel like action but are really just time-wasters.

Finding the golden middle ground between 'move fast and break things' and 'move slow and fix things' is difficult and as the stakes get higher it's only natural to favour slow, steady, and careful over flying by the seat of your pants.

reply

So yeah, it's always better to have lots of experience, and moving fast is indeed great for quickly acquiring experience, But in some fields and situations you can't afford to move fast, you just have to spend the necessary years.Writing is a much better example - many great writers talk about how they write all the time, every day, but very little of it gets successfully published. But the practice gives them good experience.

reply

As the stakes get higher you have to slow down, but imho the right takeaway from that is that you need to find low-stakes environments where you can move fast, in addition to whatever high-stakes environment you have

reply

Exactly!You want the surgeon who took the time to study deeply, then went into practice doing as many surgeries as possible, but then also taking the time to review/debrief/analyze the process and results. So, yes, it is a real mix or ""golden middle ground"" with excursions to both extremes.  The opposite of a one-size-fits-all approach to each step.

(1) As an expert in scientific discovery in the 19th and 20th century, let's disassemble a general claim using the specific example of Einstein's work on special relativity and general relativity. First, here is the claim: ""If I give you two PhD students, one who completed their thesis in two years and one who took eight years… you can be almost certain that the two-year thesis will be much better.""  Things to keep in mind: (1) special relativity was baked into Maxwell's electromagnetism and should have been discovered years before Einstein, and (2) general relativity was a novel application of non-Euclidean geometry and mathematics to the gravity problem, that is the acceleration problem, and was quite a unique accomplishment.  Discuss the 'amount of research' that went into each development by Einstein and lay out the argument that this disproves our claim, with any caveats you think appropriate.(2) In general, it seems to take about ten years of diligent focused effort for a person to develop their skill levels to the point where they can make meaningful contributions to any science, engineering, or even artistic field.  Einstein seems to follow this trend, if we start counting from his teenage fascination with physics.  Another example is the very popular instructional videos on machine learning by Andrej Karpathy, eg ""The spelled out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd"" in which he begins by stating he's been programming neural nets for ten years.  Thus, it seems fair to conclude that 'move fast' only makes sense after 'develop the required expertise to know how to move fast'.

There are technical reasons, but as ever the real underlying causes are incentives. Companies realized that the OS is a profit center, something they can use to influence user behavior to their benefit. Before the goal was to be a hardware company and offer the best hardware possible for cost. Now the goal is to own as large a slice of your life as possible. It's more of a social shift than a technological one. So why would a company, in this new environment, invest resources in making their hardware compatible with competing software environments? They'd be undercutting themselves.That's not to say that attempts to build interoperability don't exist, just that they happen due to what are essentially activist efforts, the human factor, acting in spite of and against market forces. That doesn't tend to win out, except (rarely) in the political realm.i.e. if you want interoperable mobile hardware you need a law, the market's not going to save you one this one.

But, I'd guess this accounts for a relatively small fraction of corporate decision on lock-in strategies for rent extraction - advanced users should be able to treat their cell phones OS like laptops, with the same basic concepts, eg just lock down the firmware for the radio output, to keep the carriers happy, and open everything else, maybe with a warranty void if you swap out your OS.  Laws are needed for that, certainly.

IBM didn't think to lock it down, the BIOS was the main blocker and was relatively quickly reverse-engineered (properly, not by copying over the BIOS source IBM had included in the reference manual).

reply

Currently they're only permitted to release binaries of the patches due to the embargo, this is why these patches are in the parallel stream/optional (so people unhappy with being unable to see the sources won't have them shoved down their throats).I don't have URLs at hand at the moment but all these questions have been asked many times and explained extensively on their discussion forum.I, for one, feel safe. I was patched since late October (IIRC) for the vulnerabilities that Android-related outlets were warning about in early December.It's quite surreal how unsafe the standard Android is. And how Google and the big companies pretend old devices (these running Android 11, 12, 13, not updated for several years) are safe and secure. While all it takes is the user stumbling upon one malicious we page or getting a WhatsApp message they won't even see.

GrapheneOS wants to make a FOSS Android with the security model that makes it hard for any bad party to break into the phone.LineageOS wants to make a FOSS Android that respects user's privacy first and foremost - it implements security as best as it can but the level of security protections differs on different supported devices.Good news is that if you have a boot passphrase, it's security is somewhat close to GrapheneOS - differing in that third parties with local access to the device can still brute-force their access whereas with GrapheneOS they can't - unless they have access to hardware level attacks.

If neither of the two major players can make an open, secure, _simple_, easy-to-understand, bloat-free OS, then we somehow need another player.Presently (and I confess, my bias to seek non-state solutions may show here), it seems that a non-trivial part of the duopoly stems from regulatory capture insofar as the duopoly isn't merely software, but extends all the way to TSMC and Qualcomm, whose operations seem to be completely subject to state dictates, both economic/regulatory and of the darker surveillance/statecraft variety (and of those, presumably some are classified).I'm reminded of the server market 20ish years ago, where, although there were more than two players, the array of simple, flexible linux distros that are dominant today were somewhere between poorly documented and unavailable.  I remember my university still running windows servers in ~2008 or so.What do we need to do to achieve the same evolution that the last 2-3 decades of server OS's have seen?

In addition to the technical challenges, the conversion must be both rapid and automated in order to maintain arXiv's core service of free and fast dissemination.

They are converting to HTML to make the content more accessible.

HTML was a digital format, but it wanted to be a generic format for all document types, not just papers, so it contains a lot of extras that a paper format doesn't need.for research papers, since they share the same structure, we can further separate content from rendering.for example, if you want to later connect a paper with an AI, do you want to send <div class=""abstract""> ... ?or do some nasty heuristic to extract the abstract?  like document. getElementsByClassName(""abstract"")[0] ?

But you could still use HTML. Elements with a dash in are reserved for custom elements (that is, a new standardised element will never take that name) so you could do:    <paper-author-list>
      <paper-author />
    </paper-author-list>

And it would be valid HTML. Then you'd style it with CSS, with    paper-author {
      display: list-item;
    }

And so on.

I disagree. PDF is the most desirable format for printed media and its analogues. Any time I plan to seriously entertain a paper from Arxiv, I print it out first. I prefer to have the author's original intent in hand. Arbitrary page breaks and layout shifts that are a result of my specific hardware/software configuration are not desirable to me in this context of use.

reply

In research and in embedded hardware both, I've met some people who had entire stacks of papers printed out - research papers or datasheets or application notes - but also people who had 3 monitors and 64GB of RAM and all the papers open as browser tabs.I'm far closer to the latter myself. Is this a ""generational split"" thing?

The problem is having the submissions be in TeX and converting that to HTML, when the only output has been PDF for so long.The problem isn't converting HTML to PDF, it's making available a giant portion of TeX/pdf only papers in HTML.If you're arguing that maybe TeX then shouldn't be the source format for papers then I agree, but other than Typst (which also isn't perfect about HTML output yet) there aren't that many widely accepted/used authoring formats for physics/math papers, which is what ArXiV primarily hosts.

To me, this clearly looks like a case of a very high compression ratio with the motion blocks swimming around on screen. They might have some detail enhancement in the loop to try to overcome the blockiness which, in this case, results in the swimming effect.It's strange to see these claims being taken at face value on a technical forum. It should be a dead giveaway that this is a compression issue because the entire video is obviously highly compressed and lacking detail.

Video compression operates on macroblocks and calculates motion vectors of those macroblocks between frames.When you push it to the limit, the macroblocks can appear like they're swimming around on screen.Some decoders attempt to smooth out the boundaries between macroblocks and restore sharpness.The giveaway is that the entire video is extremely low quality. The compression ratio is extreme.

Neural compression wouldn't be like HVEC, operating on frames and pixels. Rather, these techniques can encode entire features and optical flow, which can explain the larger discrepancies. Larger fingers, slightly misplaced items, etc.Neural compression techniques reshape the image itself.If you've ever input an image into `gpt-image-1` and asked it to output it again, you'll notice that it's 95% similar, but entire features might move around or average out with the concept of what those items are.

It looks like they're compressing the data before it gets further processed with the traditional suite of video codecs. They're relying on the traditional codecs to serve, but running some internal first pass to further compress the data they have to store.

To solve this problem of adding compute heavy processing to serving videos, they will need to cache the output of the AI, which uses up the storage you say they are saving.

The people fixated on ""...but it made eyes bigger"" are missing the point. YouTube has zero motivation to automatically apply ""photo flattery filters"" to all videos. Even if a ""flattery filter"" looked better on one type of face, it would look worse on another type of face. Plus applying ANY kind of filter to a million videos an hour costs serious money.I'm not saying YouTube is an angel. They absolutely deploy dark patterns and user manipulation at massive scale - but they always do it to make money. Automatically applying ""flattery filters"" to videos wouldn't significantly improve views, advertising revenue or cut costs. Improving compression would do all three. Less bandwidth reduces costs, smaller files means faster start times as viewers jump quickly from short to short and that increases revenue because more different shorts per viewer/minute = more ad avails to sell.

I have a funny attitude towards Google: I am a big privacy nut, have read the principle books on privacy, etc. That said, usually running all Google web properties in DuckDuckGo web browser, I tweak my privacy settings, etc. and then still use Google properties.YouTube is probably the highest value Google property for me (despite Gemini use, love using Google Cloud Platform, etc.)I find that the availability of an infinite number of Qi Gong exercise videos, philosophy, tiny bit of politics, science, and nature videos that is it almost infinitely better than HBO, Netflix, etc. I am a paid subscriber to all these services so I am comparing Apples to Apples here.I do hate spending 10 seconds opening a video and realizing that it was created artificially, but I immediately stop watching it so the overhead isn't too bad.One new feature I really like is if I am watching a long philosophy or science video, I paste the URI into Gemini and ask for a summary and to use what Gemini knows about me to suggest ways the material jives with my specific interests.

It looks like quality cleanup, but I can't imagine many creators aren't using decent camera tech and editing software for shorts.

reply

And as you say, arbitrarily applying quality cleanup is making assumptions of the quality and creative intent of the submitted videos. It would be one thing if creators were uploading raw camera frames to YouTube (which is what smartphone camera apps are receiving as input when shooting video), but applying that to videos that have already been edited/processed and vetted for release is stepping over a line to me. At the very least it should be opt-in (ideally with creators having the ability to preview the output before accepting to publish it).

reply

So counterintuitively, noise reduction improves compression ratios. In fact many video codecs are about determining which portion of the video IS noise that can be discarded, and which bits are visually important...

reply

Or to put it another way, to me it would be similarly disingenuous to describe e.g. dead code elimination or vector path simplification as ""just a compression algorithm"" because the resultant output is smaller than it would be without. I think part of what has my hackles raised is that it claims to improve video clarity, not to optimise for size. IMO compression algorithms do not and should not make such claims; if an algorithm has the aim (even if secondary) to affect subjective quality, then it has a transformative aspect that requires both disclosure and consent IMO.

reply

I think the first comment is why they would position noise reduction as being both part of their compression and a way to improve video clarity.

reply

It's in the loop of the compression and decompression algorithm.Video compression has used tricks like this for years. For example, reducing noise before decode and then adding it back in after the decode cycle. Visual noise doesn't need to be precise, so it removing it before compression and then approximating it on the other end saves a lot of bits.

That being said, I don't believe they should be doing anything like this without the creator's explicit consent. I do personally think there's probably a good use case for machine learning / neural network tech applied to the clean up of low-quality sources (for better transcoding that doesn't accumulate errors & therefore wastes bitrate), in the same way that RTX Video Super Resolution can do some impressive deblocking & upscaling magic[2] on Windows.

YouTube is not applying any ""face filters"" or anything of the sort. They did however experiment with AI upscaling the entire image which is giving the classic ""bad upscale"" smeary look.Like I said, I think that's still bad and they should have never done it without the clear explicit consent of the creator. But that is, IMO, very different and considerably less bad than changing someone's face specifically.

If you open the context of the comment, they are specifically talking about the bad, entire-image upscaling that gives the entire picture the oily smeary look. NOT face filters.EDIT : same thing with the two other links you edited into your comment while I was typing my reply.Again, I'm not defending YouTube for this. But I also don't think they should be accused of doing something they're not doing. Face filters without consent are a far, far worse offense than bad upscaling.I would like to urge you to be more cautious, and to actually read what you brandish as proof.

There are a lot of high-tech “smart” glasses nowadays, and not all of them are created equal. Some of them have screens, some of them have AI, others… well, they don't have much to offer at all. But if there's one thing that you might want out of a pair of glasses with wires in them, it's audio.

I've maintained that glasses are perfect conduits for open-ear audio, and as someone who's worn the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses extensively over the past two years, I can speak from experience. Having speakers in your glasses lets you take hands-free calls, listen to music while still hearing your surroundings, and theoretically, you don't need to reach for a separate device like wireless earbuds or headphones to do all that, since your glasses are waiting patiently on your face.

But what if you don't want all the potentially problematic stuff that comes with smart glasses, like AI, or discreet cameras, or screens? What if you just want to listen to stuff? For that, you have options, and one of them (if you're a certain type of person) is Chamelo's Music Shield.

Chamelo Music Shield

The Chamelo Music Shield audio glasses pack a lot of volume and have cool adjustable lenses but are lacking in features.

Pros

Cons

The $260 Music Shield are a… distinct pair of wraparound audio glasses. They're made by Chamelo, an eyewear company backed by an unlikely star: former New York Knicks point guard Stephon Marbury, who is officially listed as Chamelo's Chief Brand Officer. While Marbury and company call Chamelo glasses “smart,” the word is out on that one.

Unlike other pairs of smart glasses like Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and the Meta Ray-Ban Display, the Music Shield lack most of what makes other frames smart. There's no voice assistant, there's no camera, there's no computer vision, and there's no screen. There is, however, a set of speakers, which you may have already gathered from the name. With those speakers, you can do a few things, like (duh) listen to music. On that front, Chamelo does a pretty decent job.

In my testing, I found that the Music Shield sound… pretty okay. The volume is good enough, which is a major component of audio in glasses like this, since you'll be contending with ambient noise while you listen. I wore the Music Shield on the streets of New York, and while they mostly held up against environmental noise, I definitely had to crank the volume to at least 80%. I have to do the same most of the time on Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, so this is no surprise.

Most likely, if you're interested in Chamelo glasses, you'll want to use them in some kind of sports environment, though. Wraparound shades are ideal for things like snowboarding, skiing, or cycling because they protect your eyes from the wind and help you see where you're going without getting blinded by air or snow. I didn't get a chance to test the Music Shield on the slopes, unfortunately, but based on the louder environments I did test them in, I'd wager they could still be heard in fast-paced, wind-heavy action. Though having tried the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, I'm less confident they're the best in that department.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard have big sound that's unlike any I've heard in smart glasses, and comparing one-to-one, I don't think Chamelo quite reaches the same volume. It also doesn't quite have the same fidelity. I had some issues while calling, where the call audio was much quieter than music playback despite cranking my phone volume up. I've reached out to Chamelo to clarify that issue and will update this review if/when that issue is resolved. On the bright side, at least the person I called could hear me loud and clear.

Like I mentioned, the Music Shield sound very good, but there's still a slight tinniness compared to beefier smart glasses like the Oakley Meta Vanguard. The low end is lacking, and the mids and highs come off as a little stiff. The Music Shield still sound much better than other glasses I've tried, like the Solos AirGo A5, but they're not dethroning Meta. To test the Music Shield, I tried to put myself in a sports mindset by listening to energetic music like jazz/fusion guitarist Masayoshi Takanaka and Daft Punk. I wasn't under- or overwhelmed. Let's just call it whelmed.

From an audio quality perspective, I wouldn't be upset with the fidelity of the Music Shield if I bought them with my own hard-earned money, but having tried a direct competitor like the Oakley Meta Vanguard, I might not be as impressed. Meta's version does cost a great deal more at $500, but you also get a lot of extra features there as well, including certain health integrations with Garmin smartwatches, cameras, a voice assistant, and more touch controls.

There is one thing that the Music Shield have that Meta's offerings definitely don't, though.

If you've seen Chamelo's audio glasses in your research online, the electrochromic dimming probably caught your eye. By tapping or sliding your finger on the right arm of the glasses, you can automatically adjust the tint of the wraparound lens on the fly. This feature, I'm happy to report, works well. The response time when tapping or sliding is quick, and the range of tint levels is fairly wide.

As a bit of background, electrochromic glass is a thing found in various gadgets now, including some rearview mirrors in cars. The technology works by applying an electric current to a special film or gel that's adhered to a piece of glass. That jolt actually changes the tint in response, creating an automatically dimmable panel of glass. I'm not going to lie… it's fun.

As functional as transition lenses are in smart glasses, electrochromic lenses and their ability to adjust tint instantly and to a level you've specified are a superior experience to their photochromic counterparts. Maybe that's just a personal gripe, but my experience is that transition lenses never get nearly as dark or as bright as you want them to, and certainly not as quickly as I'd like. Chamelo's Music Shield does not have that problem.

Electrochromic lenses likely haven't been adopted widely due to their additional cost and the strain they add to batteries, but it seems to me that if Chamelo can do it, other makers of smart glasses ought to look into the possibility, too. Sorry, Meta, transition lenses just aren't it.

If there's another point I can give the Music Shield, it's that they are fairly lightweight for their size. Chamelo's glasses weigh 49g, which is well under the Oakley Meta Vanguard, at 66g. That's not surprising since the Vanguard have a lot more going on inside, but it's still notable if you're in the market for a pair of lightweight glasses and don't care about cameras and AI.

The lightness also makes the Music Shield fairly comfortable to wear over longer periods. I wore the glasses in hour increments, and while they did get a little irksome toward the end of the hour, I would say no more than most glasses (smart and dumb) that I own. The nose pads, while I still think Oakley's are more comfortable, do a pretty good job of holding up the weight on my nose in a way that's not aggravating.

Luckily, since these are sports glasses, they fit snugly, which is great if you're like me and have a narrower head. It'll also help ensure they don't fly off when you're bombing a hill on a bike or snowboard. The look of the Music Shield is, uh… something. I'm not a wraparound shades guy. Maybe you are, and if that's your thing, then go for it, but on a scale of 1 yeehaw out of 10, I'm giving them 8 yeehaws. The glasses are also IPX4 rated, which makes them resistant to water splashes (light rain) and sweat, but not fully waterproof. Don't wear these in the pool. There is no prescription lens compatibility.

While Chamelo purposely focuses mostly on audio, I do find the Music Shield to be a little lacking in terms of features. There is no companion app for one, though Chamelo's website confusingly mentions “app-enabled controls” for some reason; there is no voice assistant; there is no touch bar on the arm for controlling volume. For $260, those are things that I'd expect, but maybe adding electrochromic lenses comes at a cost both literally and figuratively. Those aren't dealbreakers, but it does make doing things like checking the battery interesting. The best way I've identified to monitor the battery level is natively through iOS, which will tell you (like it does with other Bluetooth devices) how much juice you have.

Speaking of battery life, I found that the Music Shield live up to their claim of having 6.5 hours of music playback/calling. After two hours of music playback at 80% volume, the glasses dropped from 90% to 50% battery. It's not quite as good as Meta and its Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 AI glasses, which claim 8 hours on a single charge, but it's solid. I do like the inclusion of an easily accessible on/off button, though there are no sensors that detect when the glasses are folded, so you'll have to use it each time you want to turn the glasses off. To charge the Music Shield, there's an included magnetic cable. Unlike the Oakley Meta glasses, there is no charging case, just a fairly nondescript (somewhat chonky) carrying case.

Not everyone will find audio glasses useful, but some might. If you're looking for a device that provides decent open-ear audio and wind protection, and you love the wraparound look, they should be on your radar. If you want more features that other truly smart glasses have to offer, though, these are not the specs for you.

The Music Shield are a bit of a contradiction; they're obnoxious (the look), but also barebones (the features). I personally would have liked to see a bit more out of the glasses with a $260 price tag—touch controls for volume, app support, maybe a voice assistant. But if none of that bothers you, then maybe you'll feel fine wrapping your hands and your head around these glasses. Personally, I still think the Oakley Meta Vanguard take the cake, but then again, this review is about the only time you'll catch me wearing the same glasses as someone who's into bass fishing, so who am I to say?

A pseudonymous trader, known only as AlphaRaccoon, on prediction market Polymarket has drawn sharp scrutiny after reportedly turning a $1.15 million profit in under 24 hours by betting on Google's 2025 Year in Search rankings. The positions covered niche questions, such as whether the singer d4vd would top the list or if Pope Leo XIV would crack the top five. Blockchain records show the bets landed just before Google published the data related to these markets for the first time.

Notably, these were not the only Google-related bets in AlphaRacoon's history. Months earlier, in November 2025, the user pocketed over $150,000 by nailing the exact launch day of Google's Gemini 3.0 AI model; however, the bet regarding the specific release date of Gemini 3.0 was not nearly as asymmetric as some of the more recent bets associated with Google's 2025 Year in Search. Across 23 Google-related markets this time, the account hit 22 correct outcomes, according to a report in Forbes. This included a nearly 20x gain on predicting d4vd would be the most searched person of the year.

A Google insider has officially been exposed on Polymarket.

This dude just profited $1,000,000 in a single day betting on the Google search markets.

Polymarket trader Haeju Jeong, who is also a blockchain engineer, laid out the case bluntly on X. “This isn't a lucky streak,” they wrote, sharing screenshots of the profile and markets. “He's a Google insider milking Polymarket for quick money.”

Polymarket's own Polymarket Money account amplified the situation without taking sides in the larger debate regarding potential insider trading. “$1.15M profit in 24 hours trading Google search markets,” it posted, tagging the profile with a simple question: “Who is AlphaRaccoon?”

To be clear, no hard proof ties AlphaRaccoon to Google as of yet, and the user hasn't commented on the matter publicly. The evidence remains circumstantial for the time being, and it's unclear if there is any ongoing investigation into these trades from either Google or Polymarket. While a real-world identity has yet to be tied to these trades publicly, the reality is that the money can be traced on the completely public and transparent, albeit pseudonymous, blockchain ledger upon which they were made.

While critics of AlphaRaccoon's recent trades decry the episode as cheating, the reality is that this is what people who love prediction markets want to see. 

These types of markets were outlawed in an earlier age of the internet due to concerns around gambling addiction and potential manipulation of public events. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 clamped down on online platforms, treating many bets as unregulated futures and blocking payment processors from facilitating trades. However, Kalshi avoided the UIGEA issue by getting regulated by the CFTC as a platform for legitimate financial derivatives rather than gambling, while Polymarket initially came to prominence using crypto to get around payment restrictions. Polymarket was fined by the CFTC in 2022 and had to stop offering services to the U.S., but it is currently betting on the relaxed regulatory environment under Trump and is slowly bringing back services focused on sports gambling, for now.

Advocates say unrestricted prediction markets can offer better information verification by pooling bets on specific claims being true or false and effectively making cheap talk on social media more expensive.  If insiders flood these sorts of markets with their own bets, the argument goes, sharpened prices should indirectly provide unknown information to market observers. However, many critics argue that these platforms are simply mechanisms for gambling where information insiders have an unfair advantage or even avenues for election or corporate manipulation.

“Why are you saying this as it was a bad thing? You want insider trading!” one user wrote on X.

Why are you saying this as it was a bad thing? You want insider trading!

People bet to learn when it's released. Someone just told them. Prediction markets are information markets / crowdfunding of information. The market learned the information before it was public,…

— Juraj Bednar (@jurbed) December 4, 2025



While traditional finance bans insider trading on stocks, no explicit rules bind prediction market participants on platforms like Polymarket. When public companies are involved in these sorts of markets, it creates a potential loophole for trading on similar information without SEC oversight.

Accusations of insider trading on prediction markets also aren't new. Traders have faced similar heat over other bets, such as the Nobel Peace Prize winner. In terms of insider trading in the crypto market more generally, there was also the recent case of suspicious trades made in the days prior to the announcement of an acquisition deal made by crypto exchange Coinbase.

These sorts of cases continue to bring up the question of whether crypto is being used for the often-touted use case of “democratized finance” or simply enabling insider profiteering for a new set of institutional overlords, including those around President Trump.

Apple rarely matches Black Friday generosity like we saw this year and in a surprising move Amazon extended the MacBook Air M4 discount well beyond Cyber Monday. The 256GB model (which happens to be Amazon's best-selling laptop) currently sits at $749 instead of $999 even though it launched just this past March. Over 4,000 reviews averaging 4.8 stars confirm this configuration delivers the performance most people actually need for daily computing.

See at Amazon

The Apple M4 processor lets you use multiple apps at the same time without any lag, so you forget you're doing it.The chip architecture combines the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine and memory controller on one die: This lets data move between parts faster than in traditional laptop designs and it means that applications start up right away, big files open up right away, and the system never stutters when you switch between apps.

Apple Intelligence runs on the device instead of sending your data to cloud servers and it uses the M4's Neural Engine to do AI tasks locally, keeping your data completely private. The system can help you write emails, summarize long documents, make custom emojis based on what you say, and sort notifications by importance without sending your personal information outside of the laptop. This method makes sure that AI features work even when there is no internet connection and that privacy standards are met that cloud-based AI can't guarantee.

The 16GB unified memory is twice as much as Apple used to offer as the base configuration: This extra memory makes a big difference in how the laptop handles professional tasks. Instead of having separate memory spaces, the CPU and GPU share the same pool of memory and it cuts down on the time it takes to copy data between dedicated RAM and VRAM, which speeds up performance.

The battery can last up to 18 hours with normal mixed use like web browsing, editing documents, streaming videos, and doing light creative work. Many laptops slow down their CPUs when they are not plugged in to save power, but this one works the same whether it is plugged in or running on battery. Because it works all the time, you can work through long flights, full days of classes, or long sessions at the cafe without having to look for outlets or carry charging bricks. The MagSafe charging port connects magnetically and safely disconnects if someone trips over the cable and keeps both your laptop and your mind safe.

The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display can show one billion colors and has a brightness of 500 nits and makes it great for professional photo editing and comfortable for long reading or writing sessions. Text rendering uses subpixel antialiasing to make fonts look sharp at any size which makes it easier on the eyes when working on long documents. The P3 wide color gamut on the display shows colors that standard sRGB displays can't, which is important for creative professionals. It also makes photos and videos look much more vibrant when you're just using it for fun.

Two Thunderbolt 4 ports support 40Gbps data transfer, dual 4K display output, and charging through a single cable, making it easy to connect to work. You can connect two external monitors at once, turning this ultraportable into a full-fledged workstation when you dock it at your desk. Wi-Fi 6E speeds up wireless connections and lowers latency on networks that support it. Bluetooth 5.3 improves the range and stability of wireless peripherals. The headphone jack can handle high-impedance headphones, which gives you better sound quality than most laptop outputs.

This $250 discount on current-generation hardware with double the previous base RAM configuration is an amazing deal that makes the MacBook Air M4 affordable for students and professionals who couldn't afford to buy a laptop for more than $1,000. This is the best value for a Mac laptop in years because you get Apple's newest chip, more memory, and better AI capabilities for less than older models.

Russian drones with Starlink Mini terminals on board are still being spotted despite assurances, a year earlier, of ‘good solutions' to prevent this from happening.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Ukraine's Defence Express news has highlighted the continuing issue of Russian drones with access to Starlink satellite internet guidance. Despite assurances from U.S. Pentagon officials from over a year ago, drones from the Russian aggressors are still flying into Ukrainian airspace to strike their targets – with Starlink hardware clearly strapped to them, claims the source (machine translation).

 




The new report, on what seems to be an ongoing issue, has been sparked by one of the first sightings of a crashed/disabled ‘Molniya' (Lightning) strike drone. This is shown in pictures originally shared by Serhiy ‘Flash' Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronic warfare and communications expert, who is active on Telegram social media.

In the images, a Starlink Mini is clearly perched atop the grounded drone. ‘Flash' doesn't insist this drone actually came from Russia, but the overall design and internal components (like the battery) suggest it was very likely a Russian device.

Perhaps even more serious than this latest spotting is the Ukraine Defense Express assertion that Starlink usage by Russian drones hasn't been totally stopped since it was first documented in 2024.

Later that same year, the US Defense Department's assistant secretary for space policy, John Plumb, told Bloomberg that the Russian military's unauthorized use of SpaceX's Starlink internet had been blunted. An IMI report says that Plumb wasn't specific about the measures put in place to deny Russian access, but that it was a “good solution” for Starlink and Ukraine.

Russian Shahed-136 drones have previously been seen kitted out with Starlink gear. The Ukraine Defense Express says that Russia's recently unveiled RD-8 mother drone is Starlink controllable, too. Evidence of this wasn't reproduced within the source story.

If the Ukraine Defense Express is correct, though, it is unsettling to know that the incessant Russian drone onslaught hitting Ukraine's military, civilians, and key infrastructure could be weakened with just a little more political will.

The company's first product, the Atlas Eon 100 scalable DNA data storage service, has been announced.

Atlas Data Storage, a DNA-based storage tech startup, has announced its first commercial offering. Rather than releasing DNA storage hardware to the masses, the company has begun to offer Atlas Eon 100, which it claims to be the “world's first scalable DNA data storage offering.” Alongside the launch, there are some mighty big claims about how dense and how durable DNA storage can be, with quite a few magnetic tape comparisons thrown in.

“Atlas is proud to be the only company in the world delivering storage products based on DNA technology at scale,” said Bill Banyai, Founder of Atlas Data Storage. “This is the culmination of more than ten years of product development and innovation across multiple disciplines. We intend to offer new solutions for long-term archiving, data preservation for AI models, and the safeguarding of heritage and high-value content.”

It sounds pretty compelling, so let's take a closer look at the claims and comparisons. On its website and in its PR, Atlas headlines its communications to call out the durability of DNA.

We've discussed DNA storage and this aspect of the technology before. Atlas' specific claims for its Eon 100 product/service are that these capsules can “store [data] for millennia with no refresh needed,” and that they are stable to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

It compares these stats with magnetic tape, directly, which it says requires continuous refresh cycles every 7-10 years, and requires storage facilities with “specialized temperature and humidity controls.” The firm also insists that duplication is easier and faster with DNA.

Storage density is another feather in the DNA storage cap. Atlas specifically claims that its archive solution can store a colossal 60PB of data in 60 cubic inches. The illustration appears to show six trays of those pill-sized capsules. According to my math, 60 cubic inches is a smidgen under a liter, a single liter. Back to U.S. friendly units, and that's a little bit larger than a quart. Please do your own conversions if you want that in hogsheads or firkins.

 




Whatever units you prefer, though, the 60PB Atlas Eon 100 storage rack is about 1,000 denser (thus smaller) than if LTO-10 tape were used to hold the same data.

Atlas was scheduled to demonstrate Eon 100 at the AIMA Conference in Baltimore yesterday. But the firm doesn't sell Eon 100 directly through the web right now. Interested parties are asked to reach out via its web form. So we don't know about pricing plans, for example.

Reading through the firm's materials, it seems to leverage synthesized DNA from Twist Bioscience. We have heard of this company previously, due to its DNA storage collaborations with Microsoft.

It is exciting to hear about the commercialization of DNA storage gaining momentum, through service offerings like this. However, making this durable and dense bio-inspired data storage mainstream still looks a long way off. We can visualize laptops with DNA data capsule ports for vast local write-once read-many storage, but it could easily be a decade (or longer) before such high-tech sorcery becomes reality.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Nvidia refuses to replace RTX 5080 FE GPU's broken 16-pin power connector retention clip — the owner says Nvidia is trying to 'burn my house down'","https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rtx-5080-fe-owner-says-nvidia-denied-warranty-after-power-connector-clip-snapped","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 16:27:56 GMT","

The case adds to ongoing questions about the durability of the 12V-2x6 power connector.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Reddit user has reported that Nvidia — a company with a $5.2 trillion market cap — declined to replace their brand-new GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition, one of the best graphics cards, and that the company is trying to “burn my house down” after the card's 12V-2x6 connector lost its retention clip during the first attempt to remove the cable.

The post, shared on Thursday, December 4, in the PCMR Reddit, includes support transcripts in which the user says they were initially told the connector was safe to use before the case was escalated and ultimately ruled “customer-induced damage.”

The retention clip plays an important role in anchoring the plug inside the socket and helps ensure full insertion. This is particularly important because Nvidia attributed the widespread RTX 4090 melting incidents to partially seated 12VHPWR connectors, and the revised 12V-2x6 standard was introduced with the RTX 50 series to improve reliability.

A clip failure removes one of the few mechanical safeguards that prevent the plug from backing out under cable tension. Support logs quoted by the user indicate an initial assessment that “everything looks totally normal from pictures.” However, the customer insisted that, after seeing the disasters the connector has caused, they weren't willing to leave it as is. The nature of the replies led the original poster and those commenting to speculate that Nvidia support was relying on AI to analyze the customer's pictures and respond to their concerns.

This isn't a first for the 5080, which has been the subject of at least one earlier Reddit thread in which an owner asked whether a broken clip could cause long-term issues. Other reports include a 5080 power cable allegedly melting at the power supply side and isolated cases of 5090 connector damage. These incidents have not yet formed a clear pattern, but they sit alongside high-profile reminders that the underlying design may be flawed.

Warranty outcomes have varied across vendors. In the RTX 4090 cycle, Nvidia said it would handle RMAs for connector-related failures, even when third-party adapters were involved. Board partners did not always match that posture.

MSI previously rejected an RMA when a CableMod adapter was used, and the case only came to light after customers shared support transcripts. Cooler Master sparked its own controversy when a representative advised a user to dismantle part of a 12V-2x6 plug to fit an RTX 5070 Ti. The company later apologized and withdrew the connector from sale, noting that its internal guidance had been incorrect.

The Reddit user behind the new 5080 claim says they have asked Nvidia to reconsider the diagnosis, arguing that a mechanical failure on the first unplug should not be treated as misuse.

Best I could do would be two 5070 Tis.

""With great prices comes great responsibility"", or so the saying goes. The DDR5 shortage has led to near-hyperinflation on the best RAM, and stores everywhere are raising prices by the day, all while manufacturers continue to issue alerts. Some chipmakers are dropping out of the consumer market entirely. However, the ongoing crisis does make for some amusing, or should we say heart-warming anecdotes, like this Facebook PC enthusiast who traded 192GB of DDR5-5200 RAM worth $2,200 for one RTX 5070 Ti worth roughly $800, despite his memory being worth roughly triple what he got in return.

The trade took place in the Facebook group ""Pc, Gaming, Setups, and Building Advice"", where one Abdul Kareem As, who had a Corsair Vengeance DDR5-5200 C38 192GB (4x48GB), traded the RAM haul for a PNY RTX 5070 Ti graphics card. Like us, you're probably thinking that this negotiation wasn't the smartest deal in history.

Abdul was fully aware of the apparent delta in market value between the two items, though. In a comment, he says that ""he's not greedy like others here"" and says he reportedly bought the RAM for $375 and ultimately got an RTX 5070 Ti for that amount.

True to his word, he states that it ""would have felt unethical to sell at such a high price"" and that he's happy with his decision. Likewise, he didn't want to parcel out the kit for maximum profit either. It's safe to say he bows to no one, and this is probably the best Christmas story we techies will see this year.

 




The exchange took place on Thursday, and today's prices pin the Corsair Vengeance DDR5-5200 C38 192GB memory kit's value at around $2,201.99, which is more than 3X the $649.99 price when the memory kit hit the retail market last year. We did some digging for the cheapest no-frills memory and found a Crucial 96 GB DDR5-5600 kit for $749.99, so you could complete the set with two of those. For a 4 x 48 GB kit, you'd have to spring $1,999.99 for G.Skill's 192 GB DDR-6000 set.

As for the graphics card, it's a no-frills, solid PNY RTX 5070 Ti. Another dive into Newegg pulls out a couple of RTX 5070 Ti graphics cards from Zotac, MSI, and Gigabyte for $749.99, with the standard low-end tag hovering around $800. So all things considered, Abdul's grand generosity had a $600 to $700 value, meaning ""fair"" value for the trade would have been closer to two 5070 Ti cards, not one.

He also mentioned that he had a choice between getting the graphics card or an Asus 27"" QD-OLED 240 Hz display. There's no telling what exact model that would be, but it's possible it's the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG, a 1440p WOLED display that goes for $699. If it's specifically a QD-OLED display, our bet is on the ROG Strix XG27UCDMG, a 4K variant that would set you back a nice $949. Abdul would perhaps have been wiser to exchange the display for both pieces of hardware, or for one of them plus some cash.

Nevertheless, while it's easy to deride Abdul's negotiation savvy, it's worth noting that the rise in DDR5 prices was so rapid and violent that anyone not following the space closely might not be aware of the price crisis. Even so, it seems Abdul was fully aware of the value of the goods he was carrying, but decided instead to make someone's day.

ATLANTA – The stage is set for the U.S. Men's National Team's journey at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The USMNT learned its group stage opponents during the World Cup Official Draw held in the nation's capital on Friday, Dec. 5, and at least two, potentially a third, are countries that the U.S. has played in the last six months.

The U.S. was drawn into Group D with 26th-ranked Australia and 39th-ranked Paraguay. The fourth team to comprise Group D will be either Kosovo, Romania, Slovakia or Türkiye, which will be determined in March as one of four UEFA Playoff matches.

Australia and Paraguay are teams the U.S. played in the two most recent international windows in the USMNT's competitive buildup to next summer's tournament. The U.S. won both matchups 2-1, a pair of strong results to extend overall winning records over both and help the USMNT put together a current unbeaten run of five consecutive matches.

“It does set up nicely, but we have to focus on ourselves,” USMNT center back Tim Ream said. “We know the minimum of what it will take to beat these teams. You can't play a tournament by doing the minimum. You can't. You have to go above and beyond.”

“There's no easy game in the World Cup,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “In fact, some of our hardest games in the previous World Cup were two against lesser opponents. Moving forward, we need to continue to prepare in the right way, but it's fun knowing that we've played some of these opponents before.”

The USMNT faced Australia less than two months prior to the draw. On a cool night at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado, striker Haji Wright bagged a brace off two assists from midfielder Cristian Roldan to lead the U.S. to a 2-1 come-from-behind victory over the Socceroos, which ended Australia's 12-match unbeaten streak coming into the match.

Like Australia, the match against Paraguay on Nov. 15 was a battle between two teams ranked in the top 40. The U.S. scored two goals on the night, one on either side of halftime from midfielder Gio Reyna and striker Folarin Balogun, to power past the Paraguayans at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania.

When asked how playing against recent opponents affects his team's World Cup hopes, head coach Mauricio Pochettino said it was a good starting point for the group's preparation.

“It's good because we felt how competitive Paraguay and Australia are,” he said. “They are two teams that are doing really, really well. We need to build our pattern, and we need to build our journey to arrive there and be sure that we are much better than we were in the past.”

Not only did today's draw paint a picture of the USMNT's group; the schedule also came into clearer focus. USA-Paraguay is the first match for the Americans and occurs June 12 at Los Angeles Stadium in Inglewood, California. It will be first World Cup match on American soil after Mexico-South Africa in Group A kicks off the tournament the day before in Mexico City.

“Getting three points right off the bat like that would be an amazing start for us and put us in a great position in the group,” forward Christian Pulisic said of the group stage opener. “We're definitely looking forward to that one.”

USA's Group D Schedule at 2026 FIFA World Cup (all times TBD)

One of the playoff contenders who could very well be the fourth in Group D is Türkiye, another team the U.S. played in 2025. The two sides met on June 7 in the final two international friendlies before the USMNT's run to the Concacaf Gold Cup Final. Against Türkiye, Pochettino started a relatively inexperienced lineup. Four players made their debuts, and a young U.S. side fell to Türkiye 2-1 in East Hartford, Connecticut.

“You saw a lot of fresh faces, a lot of inexperience, but also a lot of hunger,” center back Chris Richards said. “We still went toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in Europe...it gave us a lot of confidence going into the Gold Cup.""

All three matches the U.S. played against Türkiye, Australia and Paraguay in the past six months will now serve as what Pochettino called “reference points” for the next as he and his staff prepare for the group stage.

When it comes to the third opponent yet to be determined, Pochettino's focus will not only be on Türkiye. The head coach confirmed that he and his team won't wait until March to do their homework – they plan to scout Kosovo, Romania, Slovakia as well – increasing the workload of preparing for three teams to six.

“We can go into it with a good feeling,” Pulisic said. “We've played against these teams recently, which is not always the case. We know more or less what they're going to look like.We know they're tough opponents as well. We're not taking anyone lightly. They're all going to be tough games, but it's great we have that experience.”

No matter who the third opponent ends up being, the U.S. has maintained its target of making it out of the group stage and beyond. The team is currently feeling a surge of confidence coming off the team's most recent outing, a 5-1 thrashing over World Cup-bound Uruguay, and strives to keep the focus on themselves.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese said just that on Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard soon after the World Cup Draw concluded:

“The goal, the dream, the ambition is to win the World Cup. If you win the World Cup, you have to beat all the teams no matter what.You're going to be playing hard teams and the best teams at some point in the tournament if you accomplish what you want to accomplish.”

“There's no easy route to get to a final,” Richards echoed. “You always have to play some tough teams. One thing that Poch has instilled in us is if we play to the best of our abilities, no team can beat us. We all firmly believe that.”","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Follow live coverage of today's 2026 World Cup schedule announcement.

WASHINGTON — Out of the many potential groups the U.S. men's national team could have faced coming out of Friday's 2026 World Cup draw, the outcome is undoubtedly one of the best-case scenarios.

Forget about avoiding or hiding from the hype that has followed this group of players since they began to pull the program clear of the disaster of missing out on the 2018 World Cup. Following the lavish event at the Kennedy Center, head coach Mauricio Pochettino and his squad find themselves with an opportunity to tackle what may turn into one of the weakest groups of the entire tournament and must embrace the expectations that come with it.

Here is the situation facing the Americans today: They should be eyeing the quarterfinal run that has been seen as a minimum for this “golden generation” to actually live up to their big billing. Group D opponents Australia and Paraguay are not just two teams the U.S. should be expected to beat, they're two teams the U.S. just beat over the last six weeks — and looked the better team in doing so.

The third opponent could present more of a problem. Turkey is ranked 15th in the Elo world soccer ratings and beat the U.S. in June in a friendly in East Hartford. It has a bonafide star in Real Madrid's Arda Güler. But if the Turkish should get upset in the European playoff in March, the U.S. might very well end up in one of the lowest-rated groups by Elo world soccer rankings, in the tournament.

Even looking further down the road, the U.S. should be pleased that of all the possible Group G opponents to match up with in the round of 16 — should it get there after winning the group — Belgium, Egypt, Iran and New Zealand also do not present an insurmountable hurdle.

Pochettino, understandably, won't look that far ahead right now and tried to temper talk of whether the group was easy.

“To the people who say ‘you have to win' before you even play — no, they shouldn't say ‘you have to win' before you play, because in soccer you don't win on the bus,” he said after the draw. “You win when you deserve it on the field. And for that, we have to show a lot of respect — full respect — toward our opponents. Because if you respect yourself, you respect your opponent; and if you respect your opponent, you respect yourself. And I think that here, every time the United States national team plays and gives its best, then it doesn't matter who is in front of them.”

His answer is not surprising. It would be any manager's message. Pochettino has spent much of his time with the U.S. team battling the sort of complacency that any discussion around an “easy group” would encourage. And the U.S. is not exactly a world-beater. It's not good enough to overlook any opponent. It doesn't want to be on the other side of the talk from 2010, when the English press called it a “Dream Draw” to face the Americans (and Slovenia and Algeria) in South Africa.

The U.S. rode that slight to a tie against England in South Africa and topped the group. The World Cup is no place to overlook any team. But even Pochettino must acknowledge this: The belief he has been trying to build up in this team just had a bonfire built underneath it.

The Argentine put a quote up on the wall for the U.S. players last month that he repeated again in the locker room after a convincing win against Uruguay: “Let's be realistic,” he said, “and do the impossible.”

The impossible is now very possible. And to be realistic is to say, actually: Yes, this U.S. team can push deep into the knockout phase of a home World Cup tournament.

Winning this group isn't just a possibility, it borders on expected, depending on Turkey's performance. A win over a third-place team in the round of 32 would be demanded, as well. And a potential match-up with Belgium – a March friendly opponent – or Egypt in the round of 16 with what, by then, would surely be a wave of patriotic support? It's most certainly winnable.

U.S. fans now have permission to be excited. To dream about what this team might be able to do, and what the crowds and stadiums would look like if the U.S. started winning games and building momentum.

Pochettino couldn't even hide his own emotion. He was already buzzing as he addressed reporters. He can smell how close it is.

“We start to live the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “Now it's the vibes and everything. Now it's like we are starting today. Now we are excited because you can see now what is going on in this amazing sport, that is soccer and football. It's massive. It's massive. For us it's about to start to feel. … (It's) very exciting. I'm looking forward to try to contact and to send all the best energy to the players, but also our fans. We need to start to create that very important energy and synergy in between the team and the fans.”

Pochettino can sense the possibility, too.

For years, the home World Cup in 2026 has been held up as a possible moment for change. A moment to push the sport forward. For an American team to do something more. That dream dimmed in the last three years.

On Friday, it lit up again.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew react to USMNT's 2026 FIFA World Cup group draw. (3:17)

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Tyler Adams has set a bold goal for the United States men's national team, aiming to reach the World Cup semifinals for the first time since the inaugural tournament in 1930.

""Everyone's going to want us to say winning it is obviously the goal,"" the American midfielder said Friday after the World Cup draw, ""but I think setting the benchmark of the furthest the U.S. team has gone is also realistic.""

The 14th-ranked U.S. will start Group D against No. 39 Paraguay on June 12 in Inglewood, California, and then play 26th-ranked Australia six days later at Seattle. The Americans conclude the group stage on June 25 back at SoFi Stadium against the winner of playoffs among Türkiye (25), Slovakia (45), Romania (47) and Kosovo (80).

""Getting three points right off right off the bat like that would be would be an amazing start for us and just put us in a great position in the group,"" star Christian Pulisic said.

It appears to be among the less difficult of the 12 groups. The top two in each advance to the new round of 32 along with the best four third-place teams.

""Listen, we all want to win a World Cup,"" defender Tim Ream said. ""You don't play a tournament just to be there and so we've had conversations, Chris and I have had conversations about, yeah, we wan to win. I think people can laugh and say whatever they want.""

In recent friendlies, the U.S. lost 2-1 to Türkiye in June, beat Australia 2-1 in October and defeated Paraguay 2-1 last month.

""Potentially we played all three of these teams in the last six months but that can be a little bit of a false kind of sense of security,"" defender Ream said.

In nearly a century of World Cup play, the U.S. is 1-7 in knockout games, getting outscored 22-7. The Americans' only win was 2-0 over Mexico in 2002's round of 16, which was followed by a 1-0 quarterfinal loss to Germany. The Americans are winless in their last 12 World Cup matches against European teams, outscored 20-10.

""There's no easy game in a World Cup. In fact, I think some of our hardest games in the previous World Cup were against the lesser opponents,"" Adams said.

At the 2022 tournament in Qatar, the U.S. tied Wales 1-1 and England 0-0 before beating Iran 1-0 on a Pulisic goal to advance.

""It's fair to say that the last World Cup we couldn't set a bar or standard for anything. We didn't know what to expect,"" Adams said. ""Now looking back on it, I think we have more experience. We're a lot more mature. We've grown a lot as individuals and as a team.""

Coach Mauricio Pochettino has scheduled friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March and vs. a team to be determined and Germany just before the tournament.

As he mulls his roster, Pochettino thinks about ""Miracle,"" a 2004 movie he watched last month about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team of young players that upset the heavily favored Soviet Union and went on to win the gold medal. Coach Herb Brooks' decisions made an impression on Pochettino.

""We don't need the best players, we need the right players to make a team a strong team,"" Pochettino said. ""The right players to build a powerful team with the possibility to fight with any team in the in the world. Good and right are completely different.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Last updated: Dec. 6, 2025, 47 minutes ago

The 2026 World Cup draw has concluded at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. The United States will face Paraguay in its World Cup opener; here you can find a guide to all the teams, group by group. For more commentary and analysis, visit our live blog.

The draw will begin soon.

To see the easiest and hardest possible draws for your team, try our interactive draw simulator. It lets you explore all your team's possibilities, ranked by difficulty.

There are 48 teams in next year's World Cup — an expansion from the 32 teams of previous tournaments.

To ensure both geographic and competitive balance, the qualified teams are split up into four “pots” of 12 teams each. The three host countries — the United States, Canada and Mexico — are all in the first pot, and each has already been assigned a group. Mexico is in Group A, Canada in Group B and the United States in Group D.

During the draw, the rest of the teams will be taken out of each pot and put into the remaining groups, ending with 12 groups of four teams each, with one team from each pot.

It's not quite that simple; there are additional rules to make sure no group has more than one team from the same continent (or two, in Europe's case), and to make sure the highest-ranked teams end up on opposite sides of the knockout round bracket if they win their respective groups. If, during the draw, you expect a team to go into one group and it goes into another, one of these rules may be the reason.

Finally, there will still be six open spots remaining even after the draw is complete. These will eventually be filled by teams who win a play-in tournament in March — four from Europe and two from the rest of the world.

From Europe:



European playoff path A: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Wales or Northern Ireland

European playoff path B: Ukraine, Poland, Albania or Sweden

European playoff path C: Slovakia, Kosovo, Turkey or Romania

European playoff path D: Denmark, Ireland, the Czech Republic or North Macedonia

From the rest of the world:

FIFA playoff path 1: Jamaica, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or New Caledonia

FIFA playoff path 2: Bolivia, Iraq or Suriname





Quantifying team strength for international soccer teams is challenging for lots of reasons. There are relatively few international tournaments to choose from. Teams don't always field their best lineups depending on injuries, the match calendar or a host of other factors. And, of course, we don't even know which players will be named to the rosters for next year's tournament.

But some groups really can be much stronger or weaker than others. Our labels here are based on the average FIFA rating of the four teams in a given group, compared to what we'd expect from the average strength of a random group draw.

Groups labeled as “very weak” are in the bottom 5 percent of strength among all possible draws; groups labeled as “weak” are in the bottom 25 percent.

Groups labeled “strong” are in the top 25 percent of strength among all possible draws; groups labeled “very strong” are in the top 5 percent.

FIFA's “World Ranking” measure is something akin to their version of an Elo rating — and the measure they used to arrange the teams into the four pots for the draw. There are other ways of measuring, including World Football Elo ratings, FIFA's ordinal world ranks or even betting odds or prediction markets. These measures differ from country to country, even significantly. But they're all instructive for an exercise like this.

FIFA has said it will release specific game schedule information on Saturday, about 24 hours after the draw is complete. Pick a team below to see the most current information about when and where they will play:

The United States is in Group D with Australia, Paraguay and European playoff path C (one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Turkey or Romania).

JUMP TO:

For the first time since 1982, the FIFA World Cup has a Group L. As part of the tournament's expanded format — now featuring 48 teams — there are 12 groups of four, with matches taking place across the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Though L might be the final letter for the round-robin groups, it features some high-profile matchups involving some of the world's best teams. This includes a loaded England squad, who headline the group looking to capture its first World Cup since 1966.

Following the Three Lions is Croatia — a nation that has consistently punched above its weight, reaching the World Cup semi-finals twice in the last two tournaments (2018 and 2022). They beat England in the 2018 World Cup semifinals, and the rematch is one to watch in Group L. They are joined by Panama and Ghana, completing a group that promises intrigue and tough competition for all four sides.

The Sporting News is providing everything you need to know about Group L, from the teams and schedule to the venues and odds.

England amassed a perfect record of eight wins from eight games in qualification to reach an eighth consecutive World Cup. The last time the Three Lions failed to reach the finals was the previous time it took place on U.S. soil in 1994.

Thomas Tuchel will lead England in a major tournament for the first time. The former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach took the reins after Gareth Southgate bowed out with a final defeat to Spain at Euro 2024. Southgate was England's most successful manager since Alf Ramsey masterminded their solitary World Cup success in 1966: under him, England reached consecutive European Championship finals and were beaten in the semifinals and quarterfinals of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

The hope from the Football Association is that Tuchel's elite club-level experience will help to get an extra few per cent out of a gifted squad spearheaded by captain and record goal-scorer Harry Kane. Jude Bellingham is one of several enviable attacking options, although England look a touch light in defence.

Just missing out on a Pot 1 spot, Croatia will be pushing as far as they can at the 2026 World Cup as they look to give a famous send-off to Luka Modric. Their legendary captain, now 40 years old, is surely at his last major international competition, hoping to reach 200 career caps in the process.

While Croatia lack star power behind Modric's titanic presence, they continue to prove greater than the sum of their parts. That is largely thanks to the brilliance of head coach Zlatko Dalic, known as the chief architect of Croatia's modern rise to elite football status and by far the longest-tenured coach of any World Cup side in the 2026 field. In place since 2017, the 59-year-old has led his home country to two World Cup semifinals and one final, a UEFA Nations League final, and a Round of 16 at the Euros. While they still have not won a major title in their country's short history, their group-stage exit at Euro 2024 remains the only blemish on Dalic's otherwise glittering resume.

Croatia also benefit from a number of exceptional youth systems at the country's most prominent clubs, as the likes of Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split continue to pump out talented Croatian players who depart for major European clubs before returning to help the national team secure big results. Modric, Josko Gvardiol, and Ivan Perisic are amongst many others who all spent the majority of their youth careers at one of those two clubs.

Croatia has some history with its fellow group member, England. In 2018, Croatia defeated the Three Lions in the World Cup semifinals, winning in extra-time thanks to a Mario Mandžukić goal.

In just their second World Cup ever, Panama qualified thanks to the open spots left by the automatic qualification of CONCACAF powers USA, Canada, and Mexico. They were looking set for a place in the intercontinental playoff until Cinderella story Suriname choked on the final day of qualification.

This is the last hurrah for a veteran Panama squad that dealt the deathblow to the United States in the 2024 Copa America, as Anibal Godoy is 35, Alberto Quintero is 37, Eric Davis is 34, and Luis Mejia is 34.

Panama's first-ever World Cup was in 2018 (when they were also in a group with England), finishing dead last in the competition, so anything better than that is improvement. Coach Thomas Christiansen has brought stability to the national team, and has made them a very difficult out.

Ghana made the most of a relatively favourable draw by plotting an assured path through a CAF qualification section that has seen the likes of Nigeria and Cameroon fall by the wayside. The Black Stars are into their fifth World Cup out of the past six since making their debut in Germany in 2006.

Their past two campaigns have ended in group-stage exits and one win across those two tournaments. Ghana's most famous World Cup run ended in controversy and recriminations after Uruguay's Luis Suarez was sent off for a handball on the line in the quarterfinal at South Africa 2010. Asamoah Gyan missed the penalty with the score at 1-1, and his side went on to lose the eventual shootout.

This generation is not as gifted as the one that boasted the talents of Michael Essien, Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng but will not be overawed by the task ahead. Head coach Otto Addo will look to dazzling Premier League wingers Antoine Semenyo and Mohammed Kudus to hopefully spark a memorable summer.

WORLD CUP DRAW BREAKDOWNS:

Group A | Group B | Group C | Group D | Group E | Group FGroup G | Group H | Group I | Group J | Group K | 

According to DraftKings in the United States, these are the odds for each team to win Group L. England and Croatia are favored to win the group, while England are among the predicted front runners to win the tournament overall.

The Group L winner will face a best third-place side from either Group E, H, I, J or K in the Round of 32.

The Group L runner-up will enter the bottom half of the bracket. They are scheduled to meet the runner-up of Group K in the Round of 32.

If the Group L third-place finisher is one of the eight teams that qualify for the Round of 32 (from the 12 groups), their opponent would be the winner of Group K.

2026 World

Cup Draw

LIVE

Follow live coverage of today's 2026 World Cup schedule announcement.

“More games, more excitement, more teams,” began a FIFA press release, issued in March 2023 to explain how soccer's world governing body would embark on an expanded men's World Cup in 2026.

For the first time, the men's World Cup will have 48 nations, up from a 32-team competition between 1998 and 2022. In the planet inhabited by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, where biggest equals best, expansion has always been the order of the day.

Advertisement

Sometimes, this leaves the divisive Infantino humiliated, as was the case during last summer's Club World Cup, when he insisted on using more NFL-sized venues than smaller, soccer-specific Major League Soccer stadiums across the competition, resulting in tens of thousands of empty seats across group-stage games.

When it comes to the World Cup, however, Infantino may well be onto something.

From a revenue perspective, the merits are obvious: FIFA has projected $13billion (£9.75bn) over its four-year 2023-2026 cycle. This not only includes the 2026 men's competition, shared across the United States, Canada and Mexico, but also money from the 2023 Women's World Cup, last summer's Club World Cup and its annual licensing and sponsorship income. This is more than double the amount FIFA earned in the four-year cycle that ended in Russia in 2018 and dwarfs the $7.5bn the organisation brought in over the Qatar 2022 cycle.

Sepp Blatter, Infantino's predecessor as FIFA president, has compared the expanded tournament to a “monster being unleashed”, citing the increased burden on players to play more games and fans to fork out more money. Plenty of people wondered, too, whether the quality, intrigue and jeopardy of a World Cup may also be at risk under this expanded format.

Yet as the draw played out in Washington, D.C. on Friday, many of the groups threw up sufficiently competitive contests to whet the appetite. The fact that so many nations appear, on paper at least, to be capable of competing at a World Cup group stage indicates the rate of development beyond nations we so often considered historically to be favorites to win the competition. And the stars collided when it came to the established names who could light up this tournament.

Pitting together Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe's France and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland's Norway, in a group that will also include Senegal, the second-highest FIFA-ranked African nation, stirred immediate intrigue.

Other standout match-ups included Spain against Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay in Group H and Portugal against Colombia in Group K, while evidence of Ecuador's progress should be visible when they take on Germany in Group E. Brazil will vie against Morocco, who reached the semi-finals in Qatar in 2022, and a resurgent Scotland.

The host nations, too, have all received draws that will have their fans dreaming of progress. Mexico, ranked 15th, are up against 22nd-placed South Korea, while South Africa saw off Nigeria in their qualifying group to earn a place in this group. They will yet be joined by one of Denmark, the Republic of Ireland, the Czech Republic or North Macedonia in a group that should see close encounters.

The United States, similarly, beat Australia and Paraguay by one-goal margins in autumn international games, and the final place in their group will be decided by European play-offs between Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo or Romania.

Canada will be bullish, too, having secured a group that includes Qatar and Switzerland, and completed by one of Wales, Northern Ireland, Italy or Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Across North America, host cities will be licking their lips as they secured access to a slew of star names. The expanded competition means most global superstars will play at this World Cup. The final schedule will be finalized Saturday but it appears that Kansas City, Santa Clara and Dallas will host Lionel Messi's Argentina in the group phase. Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo's group games will be played first in Houston or Mexico City, then in Guadalajara or Houston, and finally in Miami or Atlanta. Expect the dynamic ticket market to explode this weekend once the schedule is confirmed.

Should Argentina and Portugal top their groups and progress to the quarterfinal, Ronaldo and Messi would be set to meet in Kansas City on Jul. 11. Despite each appearing at five World Cups, they have never played against one another in the competition and a final battle at Arrowhead Stadium would resemble two iconic but diminishing boxers raging against the dying of the light.

If England and Brazil top their respective groups, they would face one another in Miami's Hard Rock Stadium in the quarterfinal but earlier on, Brazil's group games will be played first in Boston or New Jersey, then in Philadelphia or Boston, and finally in Miami or Atlanta.

Egypt and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah will spend his group stage on the west coast, playing in venues including Seattle, Los Angeles and Vancouver. Haaland's group stage will be in the north-eastern corridor, with Norway's three games first in Boston or New Jersey, then New Jersey or Philadelphia, and finally the clash against France in either Boston or Toronto.

Then there is the curiosity and excitement presented for those debuting or returning to the competition. Could Cape Verde scramble their way through a group that includes Spain, Uruguay and Saudi Arabia? Might Uzbekistan provide the ultimate humbling for Ronaldo's Portugal? Can Haiti, a nation so politically fraught its team are unable to play in their home country, do the unthinkable against the might of Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil?

Haitian nationals remain under a travel ban in the United States, but many of the Haitians who reside already in the U.S. are in Miami, which is one of two options to host their match against Morocco on June 24.

If there is a disappointment, it is that the 48-team format allows many of the third-placed teams in the groups to advance to a round of 32, therefore diminishing the jeopardy. It may make for some dead rubber games as the 72-game group phase trundles along.

FIFA executives will hope that some risk is inserted because only the best eight third-placed finishers will reach the knockouts, applying more danger in those final round of group games. This should also incentivize teams to push for winners to maximize their points return rather than settling for draws. The theory is, though, this format should avoid any truly high-profile exits at the group stage, while encouraging entertainment, revenue eyeballs and drama in the knockout stages.

For Infantino, this will be deemed a big success. And it may yet turn out to for viewers watching from home as well.

FIFA announced on Saturday which teams will be playing in Foxborough, Massachusetts for the 2026 World Cup, and there are some major names on the list.

Gillette Stadium will host seven games, including five in the group stage, one round of 32, and one quarterfinal game.

The schedule is as follows:

Haiti playing in Foxborough has built excitement among the Commonwealth's Haitian community.

""Because of the current conditions in Haiti, they couldn't play on Haitian soil, they played in Curaçao,"" said Boston City Councilor Ruthzee Louijeune, who is of Haitian descent. ""So to be able to get this fan base in Boston is going to really fill them with a lot of joy and pride.""

Boston's Haitian community is the third largest in the nation, behind Miami and New York.

Other large fan bases in the New England area include Brazil.

""We have around 400,000 Brazilian fans around Mass., so it will be a good crowd, a lot of barbecue going on,"" said Ruben Saget, a Brazil fan.

No matter who plays in Foxborough, the stadium won't be called Gillette.

""I'm sure FIFA already has sponsors that are in that category that they can't compete with,"" said Martha Sheridan of Meet Boston. ""So they will call it, for all intents and purposes, 'Boston stadium.'""

Another big change: Gillette Stadium will have natural grass instead of the typical turf field for the tournament.

On Friday, FIFA conducted the draw for groups of four for the opening stage of the tournament. As co-hosts, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. are all guaranteed to be in separate groups.

The United States, ranked 14th in the world, was placed in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia, and the winner of the European Playoff C between Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, or Kosovo. The winner of that play-in will be determined in March.

No other Group D team is ranked in the top 20 in the world.

The USA will play Paraguay in the Group D opener on June 12 in Inglewood, California.

What are the best- and worst-case scenarios for Canada's World Cup draw?

Carney says he'll see Trump in Washington during FIFA World Cup draw

'We made the impossible possible,' says Curaçao player heading to World Cup

#TheMoment Haiti qualified for first World Cup in over 50 years

And so ends another World Cup draw. The matchups are settled, but fans will have to wait until tomorrow to see the full schedule – including kickoff times. 

We do know Canada will face Qatar on June 18 and Switzerland on June 24, with both of those games in Vancouver. 

Canada's opener in Toronto on June 12 will be against the winner of UEFA playoff A, which could be Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland or Italy.

A game against Italy, the 12th-ranked team in the world and four-time World Cup winner, would make for “a marquee event and just a really tough opponent,” says soccer journalist John Molinaro. 

If you're looking for more coverage around the politics of today's event, you can find a story on the private meeting between Carney, Sheinbaum and Trump here.

If you're looking for our colleague Chris Jones's insight on the jitters of the day, you can read his analysis here.

As the day comes to a close, Carney's office has issued a relatively vague statement saying the prime minister “had many occasions for constructive discussions” with both Trump and Sheinbaum. 

""Today was about the FIFA World Cup 26 and Canada's leadership and opportunities as we welcome the world as a co-host,” said Audrey Champoux with the prime minister's office. 

“In their principal discussion, the three leaders met for approximately 45 minutes and they've agreed to keep working together on CUSMA.

Canada's third opponent in the round robin, as we've mentioned, will be another European team: either Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland or Italy, depending on who wins a two-round playoff. Canada won't find out until the playoff is decided in March.

“I just didn't want to wait to know. Too bad, I've got to be a little bit patient,” Marsch said.

“It's a little awkward, but whatever. It's the World Cup, man. Let's get ready. Let's get ready to go.”

Meanwhile, soccer players and coaches moved into what's called the mixed zone, a space where media can interview athletes and administrators. It's usually after a match, but today a zone was set up after the draw.

Jesse Marsch, Canada's coach, told reporters he's generally pleased with today's draw but knows the team will have to rise to the challenge next summer.

“It's not the toughest, it's not the easiest,” Marsch said of the matchup with Qatar and Switzerland. “I said this going in [today]: we're confident in our team and whoever we were going to draw, we were going to be ready for those games and know that we can beat anyone. That still remains.

“I said at the beginning, I didn't want Norway. The fact we didn't get Norway, that made me happy. The second pot, all those opponents would be a big challenge.”

Carney's office says the meeting with the prime minister, Trump and Sheinbaum is over.

It lasted about 45 minutes behind closed doors.

It's unclear what was said — and what the tone was like between the three leaders. 

Carney is now headed to the Canadian Embassy for a Christmas tree lighting ceremony, where he will make some brief remarks. 

Trump announces travel ban on 12 countries

U.S. President Donald Trump has resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term, announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the U.S. and those from seven others would face restrictions. The new ban includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

As mentioned, Haiti is going to the World Cup for the first time since 1974 — and for only the second time ever — after defeating Nicaragua 2-0 in a qualifying match last month. 

But Haitian soccer fans will be barred from watching their team compete in person in the U.S., with their country being one of 12 subject to a travel ban Trump enacted in June. 

The ban includes exemptions for World Cup athletes, coaches, ""persons performing a necessary support role"" and their immediate relatives, but it still applies to fans from those countries. 

Fans from Iran, another country subject to the ban, find themselves in the same situation. The spokesperson for Iran's soccer federation also said visas were denied to key members of its delegation, and it was boycotting the draw at the Kennedy Center as a result. 

#TheMoment Haiti qualified for first World Cup in over 50 years

Paul Toussaint, a Haitian chef in Montreal, tells The National about the moment he watched his home country make it to the World Cup for the first time since 1974.

A combination of the newly expanded format and the host countries means that World Cup 2026 could be an underdog's dream.

Just last month, the tiny island nation of Curaçao, with a population of about 156,000, became the smallest country ever to qualify for this marquee event. The former Dutch colony takes that record from Iceland, which had a population of just over 350,000 when it qualified in 2018.

Curaçao qualified after a 0-0 draw against Jamaica, using a team heavily built with players born and raised in the Netherlands. It has actively recruited from its diaspora after getting permission from FIFA within world soccer's rules to change the national-team eligibility of five players since August.



Cape Verde, with a population of roughly 525,000, also qualified for the first time this year — the second-least populous country to do so. The former Portuguese colony also turned to its diaspora for recruitment.

Haiti is another notable underdog, qualifying for the first time since 1974 despite significant domestic turmoil and the lack of a usable home stadium.

Coach Sébastien Migné has managed some of his players from abroad, as Haiti's main airport has regularly been shut down in a country where armed gangs control up to 90 per cent of its capital, Port-au-Prince. The team also played all its home games in Curaçao, as it was too dangerous to do so in Haiti.

Other first-time entrants include Jordan and Uzbekistan, while New Caledonia and Suriname are still in the hunt for a qualifying spot.

One of the most exciting parts of watching the FIFA World Cup draw is trying to figure out the “group of death” — the most competitive group, stacked with high-ranking teams and legitimate tournament contenders. 

This year there isn't a clear group of death — though many reports are declaring Group L the most likely candidate. 

Group L has England (ranked No. 4) and Croatia (10) slated to play early on. Ghana (72) and Panama (30) are unlikely to challenge the powerhouses. But Ghana, a powerhouse in its own right, could be a wildcard, while Panama could pull a surprise.

Group F also looks fairly competitive, with the Netherlands (7), Japan (18), Tunisia (40) and the winner of UEFA playoff B — either Ukraine, Poland, Albania or Sweden. 

But overall the 48 competitors seem pretty well shuffled. It's likely that the tournament expansion from 32 teams diluted the pot somewhat. 

Still, there's lots of drama ahead, with some intense matches coming up. Croatia vs. England, a rematch of the 2018 semifinal, will be one to watch. 

And if Italy qualifies, Canada will have to prepare for a hard battle on home turf. 

After sitting through the draw and the Village People, Carney, Sheinbaum and Trump are now meeting privately — where the state of trade negotiations will likely be raised.

Despite breaking off talks with Canada at the end of October, Trump sounded in good spirits earlier today when talking about his North American trade partners.

""We're getting along very well,"" he said on the red carpet before the show began. ""We'll discuss trade.""

The FIFA World Cup tournament, which runs every four years, is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world, with viewership eclipsing most other sporting spectacles. 

FIFA estimated nearly 1.42 billion people watched the 2022 final in Qatar between France and Argentina on either television or digital platforms, the highest viewership ever for a World Cup final. 

To put that number into perspective, it's almost 20 per cent of the global population and more than 10 times the 127.7 million estimated to have tuned in to this year's Super Bowl. 

Over the entirety of the 2022 tournament, FIFA has estimated close to five billion fans watched in some form or another. 

Only the Olympics come close to that kind of global viewership. Research conducted for the International Olympic Committee suggests around five billion people watched the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris at some point.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'We could have done it without all of this'","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/england-boss-thomas-tuchel-takes-aim-2026-world-cup-draw-ceremony-donald-trump-rio-ferdinand/blt645c0a48e2430188","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 09:27:32 GMT","

England boss Thomas Tuchel has hinted that the glitz and glamour of the 2026 World Cup ceremony was rather unnecessary. The Three Lions eventually found out that they will face Croatia, Ghana, and Panama at next year's competition in North America. However, those watching the draw had to wait a long time to find out the results, something Tuchel believes they could have ""done without"".

On Friday, the football world discovered who will play who in the group stages of the World Cup, with England facing 2018 finalists Croatia first up in the tournament. For those tuning in, though, it took an eternity for the nations to actually be drawn in Washington D.C. Earlier on in the ceremony, United States President Donald Trump received the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize, with FIFA president Gianni Infantino designating it for a person who has ""taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace"" and ""united people across the world"". Trump was given a large gold trophy, a medal, and a certificate, while Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand was also heavily involved in the draw. Going by Tuchel's comments, he didn't appear to be a fan of the whole affair.

He told BBC Sport: ""I do not, not like it but we could have done it like, without all of this. I don't need it. But of course, it's a huge stage and it's big entertainment. I was very well aware that it's not about the deep insight of football today.""

While England are favourites to win their group and progress to the knockout stages of the World Cup, many Three Lions fans have not forgotten Croatia dumping them out of the tournament at the semi-final stage in 2018. And former Chelsea boss Tuchel is certainly wary of their upcoming opponents, even though they beat them in Euro 2020.

""Difficult group, difficult opener. Difficult group with Croatia and Ghana, two regulars in World Cups and two proud and strong nations. Panama, I don't know much about Panama at the moment but we will find out about it before the tournament starts, of course,"" he said. ""For me, I'm only experienced group football in Champions League formats and the way to approach it was to always give it the biggest respect and to put all the focus into winning the group. It always seems difficult like our group now but we are confident and we will be well prepared when we arrive.

""Nobody should be underestimated. Of course, Croatia is the standout, they're the highest ranked team from pot two that we got into out group but listen, Ghana is always full of talent and can always surprise and has a big history in World Cup football, and also Panama will try to make the most in their underdog role. No one can be underestimated, everyone deserves the fullest respect and we can show that.""

On paper, Croatia is the most difficult side England face in the group stage, with their European rivals six places below the Three Lions in the world rankings in 10th. Incidentally, Panama are down in 30th, and Ghana sit in 72nd. While some nations may want to ease into the competition with an easier match, Tuchel had no preference. 

He said: ""I had no preference because why would I worry? I cannot influence. The legends took the draw and this is what we get and what we have to deal with now. We know now our opponents, we know we will start late in the tournament if players are involved in European finals, hopefully. We didn't desire anything we just handled the situation as it is. You get a little more days before and then you get a condensed schedule later in the tournament. Everything comes with in upside and downside.""

England are expected to face Croatia in their World Cup opener in Toronto, Canada, or Dallas, in the United States, on June 17. Before then, the Three Lions will have to confirm some friendly fixtures earlier on in 2026 to get them ready for the showpiece event.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Canadian side, who might not even play in their home country next year, are just one away from a title - and that is no accident

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Thomas Muller jumped straight in on the banter. At least, that's what Brian White said. The German star, when he signed for Vancouver Whitecaps upon the conclusion of his contract at Bayern Munich, wasted no time in getting to know his teammates. There was no superiority, no gravitas, no sense that he, a World Cup winner who has beaten Lionel Messi seven times, was better - or even different - to them.

""He's that goofy guy. He's involved in the chats, involved in the banter and the team, and ever since he's come in, he's wasted no time getting involved. And I think you know that meant a lot to the group,"" White told GOAL. 

And it was at that moment, when Muller was just as down to earth as the rest of the soccer world assumed, that White knew that everything would be well in Vancouver. His arrival, on Aug. 6, came at a critical juncture for the Whitecaps. The Canadian side had enjoyed an excellent start to the season, but was fading slightly. And while LAFC strengthened, San Diego held steady, and Inter Miami picked up steam, Vancouver needed a lift. 

What might have been a destabilizing presence instead became an excellent asset, White said. 

Of course, it takes more than the arrival of a decorated superstar to take a team to the MLS Cup. Vancouver's journey here has been one of the stars aligning, the outsiders coming good, and showing that what might have been perceived as early-season overperformance was in fact the reality of a team ready to compete for everything. And now, that team is just one win away.

""It's been awesome to see just the club grow and gain this kind of national attention. So it would mean everything culminates with the MLS Cup,"" he said. 

NOTE: GOAL's Alex Labidou contributed reporting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 

Most had written Vancouver off before the season. And it was fair to see why. Consider everything about the team, and they, on paper, shouldn't have been playoff contenders - never mind MLS Cup. It had been rumored for some time that ownership was looking for outside investment. And in December 2024, a week after watching the playoffs from home, the Whitecaps owners officially started the process of putting the club up for sale. 

At the same time, it became clear there was little apparent movement on the possibility of the team securing a new stadium. The Whitecaps do not own BC Place, where they play week in, week out, and their agreement is up at the end of the calendar year.

And then, there was the coach. Previous manager Vanni Sartini was let go in the fall, with the Whitecaps having no apparent replacement immediately lined up. Instead, they went without a manager until the spring, when they appointed Jasper Sorensen, a seasoned manager, but one who lacked MLS experience. It all seemed primed for disaster - or, at least, mediocrity. 

But White didn't buy that. At least, that's what his play suggested. The American showed in 2024 that he has a fine scoring touch. And in 2025, that continued in style. He started hot pretty much from day one, and after bagging four against Austin FC on April 12, he topped the Golden Boot race. 

And he is the prototype here. White is 29 and spent nearly four full seasons plugging away for the New York Red Bulls without fully realizing his potential. To be sure, there were flashes of quality. But this year, under Sorensen, he found his touch. 

""He's raised the demand and the intensity and training the demands [even] after wins. Where can we improve? How can we get better? They even got like, a couple shots on goal. Like, why did that happen? You know, how can I think it's all been a constant strive for almost perfection, and I think that's really what's pushed this team to such heights this year,"" White said.

Pieced together, White pushed his way into the USMNT picture and was named an MLS All-Star. In a packed No. 9 pool for the national side, there was a real chance that he could make himself the go-to. But then, disaster struck. It started with a little tweak in the hamstring, but White was out for the best part of two months. Not until last week in the Western Conference finals did he fully return.

But there, of course, he found his best, scoring twice in a 3-1 romp.

""It felt really good. The end of the year has been frustrating with injuries, dealing with that, coming back and then getting hurt again. It's always frustrating as a player, when you just want to be on the field, helping the team. But to be involved in the LA game and then to help the team win against San Diego, it meant a lot,"" he said.

Part of the credit here has to go to Sorensen, of course. Until Muller arrived, Sorensen had, in effect, done a lot with a little. Sure, there are fully fledged internationals in Tristan Blackmon and Sebastian Berhalter. But Sorensen still had to make the most out of them. Berhalter, along with White, has made his impact known with 11 assists and four goals in MLS play, and now might be in Mauricio Pochettino's best XI. If not, he's certainly among the best central midfielders in the league.

""He puts in the work every day. And I think Sebastian has, has really, is really easy for him to pick up advice. He wants to get all the information he can get. And he also wants to, you know, so badly, to develop,"" Sorensen said.

But outside of that, the Whitecaps are lacking in star power - especially after designated player Ryan Gauld went down with a long-term injury. 

Yet Sorensen never panicked and trusted the system.

""There's always a constant demand for quality and discipline, and focus every training session, every game. So I think that's what's helped push us all year long to be as good as we had been,"" White said. 

Yet there's an unavoidable truth behind this run: Vancouver's future is uncertain. For all of Sorensen's changes and Berhalter's improvements, the club might not look anything like this in a few months. Ownership is actively exploring a sale. A new stadium lease remains unresolved. MLS has long pushed for a soccer-specific venue, and while nothing can be built by next season, commissioner Don Garber made it clear the clock is ticking.

“We're in the business of delivering for the people that really, really want to have an MLS team,” Garber said in his State of the League address. “We need to wait and see if the cities and provinces want to do that. If they don't, we'll have to make some tough decisions.”

And yet, fan support has never been stronger. Winning helps, of course, but BC Place was sold out for the Western Conference semifinal against LAFC. Once a temporary stopgap while the Whitecaps waited to move out, the stadium now feels like a fortress.

Whether they stay there or not, Canadian soccer has wind at its back. The country will host the World Cup in just over six months. Under Jesse Marsch, the men's national team finally looks revitalized. The momentum behind the sport across Canada is impossible to ignore.

“For Canadian soccer, it's important that the teams here represent that part of Canada, that soccer culture. It's a special, special city, and the way the whole city supported us throughout this year, it means a lot,"" White said.

The evidence is visible in Miami alone. This is technically a home game for Inter Miami, yet Vancouver fans have travelled in force. There will be pink shirts in the stands, but white and blue won't be hard to spot either.

“It's not natural that we have this kind of support. It's not natural that this kind of hype is around the Whitecaps in the city, and we really feel that everybody's behind us, and, you know, that's what you want to create,” he said.

There is, of course, a certain irony. The biggest names driving Canadian soccer in MLS are American. Marsch, once considered for the USMNT job, is arguably the highest-profile American coach on the continent. Berhalter, White, and Blackmon are all U.S. internationals. For a club flying the Canadian flag, there's a lot of Americanness at the core.

White sees that as an asset, not a contradiction.

“Seeing three American guys thrive on a Canadian team is a little bit different, and I think it's been special. We've been each other's biggest cheerleaders,” he said.

And so we return to Muller, the goofy superstar who dove straight into the banter. He has provided a massive lift, and he'll be central to everything Saturday afternoon. The numbers back it up, too: few players in the world have a winning record against Messi.

“He knows how he's been able to prevail in games when they went up against Barcelona or Argentina,” Sorensen said. “But we know that it has to be a collective effort, and that's what we will put up — not just against Messi, but also against Miami.”

Of course, this goes beyond him. Vancouver have already beaten Miami twice this season, including a CONCACAF Champions Cup win at Chase Stadium. They've played in two finals and won one. And for all the talk that Messi is the greatest to ever kick a ball - he most certainly is - Vancouver may actually be the more complete team. Everything feels like it has aligned at the right moment. A new coach lifted an uncertain side, key players have thrived, and the result is a genuine contender rather than a feel-good story.

Will the Whitecaps still be in Canada next year? Who knows. But they are here now, a Cup finalist built on far more than pluck, proving they belong in this moment.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Complete seeding pots ahead of the World Cup 2026 draw, plus information on how it will all work, who is involved and more.

World Cup 2026 is finally coming into view and we will soon know how the group stage is shaping up, as well as the road to the final.

Lionel Messi's Argentina are the defending champions, while Cristiano Ronaldo has signalled that this will be his last World Cup and so, it could well be his final shot at glory. England are still aiming to end decades of hurt since winning the cup in 1966, while the hosts USA, Mexico and Canada are certainly going to be eager to thrill the home support.

Here, GOAL brings you the World Cup 2026 group stage seeding pots in full, plus information on how the draw will work, who is involved and more.

The qualified teams are divided into four seeding pots based on their FIFA ranking, with hosts United States, Mexico and Canada in Pot One. Six of the 48 spots are reserved for the winners of the play-offs, who are a part of Pot Four. 

As you can see above, among the top seeds are teams such as Spain, England, France and Brazil, who will be expected to challenge for the trophy next summer.

Four teams from Europe will advance from the UEFA play-offs, while two teams will progress to the finals via the inter-continental play-offs. Those play-off series will take place in March 2026.

The draw will start with the Pot One teams being drawn into groups A to L. As tournament hosts, Mexico (green ball) will be allocated to group A, Canada (red ball) will be allocated to group B and the United States (blue ball) will be allocated to group D. After Pot One teams have been drawn, the same process will be repeated for the remaining pots.

FOLLOW LIVE: World Cup 2026 draw updates

By design, teams from the same seeding pot cannot be drawn in the same group, therefore, as an example, the United States cannot play Brazil (both Pot One) in the group stage.

Furthermore, teams from the same federation cannot be drawn together in the same group, so we will not see, for example, Brazil paired with Colombia (both CONMEBOL) in a group. This applies to all federations except UEFA; each group must have at least one, but not more than two teams from UEFA.

Additionally, FIFA has decided to keep the four highest-ranked teams apart by establishing separate pathways to the semi-finals in the knockout stage. Should they win their groups, Spain and Argentina will be randomly drawn into different pathways, with the same principle applying to France and England.

Gabriel Jesus has taken another significant stride toward ending his lengthy spell on the sidelines, with the striker set to feature in a friendly against Manchester United with the Arsenal Under-21s on Saturday as part of his carefully managed rehabilitation programme. It marks the latest stage of a gradual return from a devastating anterior cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since January.

Jesus' injury occurred during Arsenal's FA Cup defeat to United at the start of the year, when he ruptured the ACL in his left knee and was forced into immediate surgery. The blow came at one of the most congested points in the season, at a time when Mikel Arteta's attacking options were already depleted, as both Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz were in the treatment room. 

Speaking in May, Arteta recalled the moment with a mixture of frustration and helplessness.  He said: ""It's very difficult now to understand that, if I could pause the game and say, Gabriel Jesus, we brought you back to life. You know, you are doing incredibly well. You're going to now get injured, so stop. I would stop him, bring another player in and continue to play the game. Unfortunately, we cannot do this in football.""

Jesus has spent the past 11 months rebuilding his fitness, working through an exhaustive conditioning programme designed to ensure he returns fully prepared rather than rushed back prematurely. After rejoining full training in recent weeks, he was named on the bench for Arsenal's matches against Chelsea and Brentford but did not make it onto the pitch. Instead, the club opted to give him controlled exposure by organising a private friendly as he played behind-closed-doors against Watford in late November. Arteta said the session offered valuable insight into how the Brazilian's body would respond to the intensity of real competition.

""It did happen. Gabi participated, and Ethan as well, because he wanted some minutes,"" he said. ""We took the opportunity; they wanted a bit of exposure to competition, and providing that was very positive.""

Now, it has been revealed that Jesus is involved in a friendly against United, held at St George's Park. A statement on the Arsenal website read: ""Gabriel Jesus and Max Dowman have travelled with the under-21s for a behind-closed-doors friendly against Manchester United at St George's Park as they look to build up their match fitness.""

For an Arsenal side that has battled through injuries to key attacking figures, Jesus's return will be timely. Havertz is still sidelined, while Leandro Trossard made a return against Aston Villa on Saturday but was forced off again. Whereas, the Gunners are also struggling in defence as their first-choice centre-back pairing of William Saliba and Gabriel are also sidelined. But games keep coming thick and fast with a busy festive schedule set to test Arsenal's squad depth. 

However, Arteta was not eager to pay much heed to the fixture congestion and said: ""The only thing I can say is that whenever it's possible to help and give the players an extra day or hours to fulfil their maximum potential, let's do it. That's it. We are ready for tomorrow's game, that's for sure. Consistency, again, to perform at the highest level and win another game and then we'll go back to the same question, to the Champions League and then next weekend, because that's the nature of the game, and that's exactly how we have to take it every game.""

When asked if he was happy with the summer business and the squad that he has at his disposal, Arteta provided a measured response.

""We've built a squad that I believe was the best one to give us the possibility to do it,"" he said. ""Is it what I want it to be? No, because of the injuries that we have, to have a squad means that the players have to be fit and available because that has a lot of consequences not only during matches but also in the way that we prepare for the week and the options that we have to change and keep the presence in the team. But certainly very happy with how we deal with certain situations.""

If his performances in training are any indication, Arsenal supporters may not have long to wait before seeing Jesus back in competitive action. Saturday's quiet run-out against United will be another vital step, and perhaps one of the final hurdles, before the Brazilian returns to the spotlight. Arsenal play against Wolves in the Premier League next weekend, and the striker might get to feature at the Emirates after a lengthy break.

Mohamed Salah will start on the bench for the third successive Premier League game as Liverpool face Leeds United at Elland Road, and head coach Arne Slot has explained his reasoning behind the decision as the Egyptian takes his place amongst the substitutes once again. The Reds have picked up four points in the two games since Salah was dropped, and Slot will hope that his decision pays off once again against the Whites.

Reported by Fabrizio Romano on X, Slot spoke pre-match about his decision to name Salah amongst the substitutes once again, citing the importance of picking players suited to the task at hand against a Leeds side who will be full of confidence following victory over Chelsea in midweek.

Slot told reporters: “It's never an easy decision because we all know what a great player he is. But it is also up to me to pick the team that I think we need today. That's why I made the decision”.

Liverpool start the encounter in the bottom half of the table but could rise as high as fifth with victory, with Salah on the bench and available to make an impact if called upon by Slot.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Carlo Ancelotti says he doesn't ""owe"" anyone a place in his Brazil 2026 World Cup squad after once again being asked about Santos star Neymar's prospects. The Brazil icon has repeatedly been left out of recent national squads due to injury issues, but after scoring a hat-trick for his club last time out, speculation over his World Cup place is intensifying. However, the Italian made it clear he will not be pressured into certain picks.

According to two Brazilian greats, Neymar has been an icon for the national team over the past decade or so. He was their standard bearer at their home World Cup in 2014 as they bowed out in the semi-finals to a rampant Germany, but also helped them win gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The former Barcelona star was once one of the best players in the world but now he is 33 and has struggled with form and injury in his second spell at boyhood club Santos, although he has come good right at the end of the season for them as they aim to stave off relegation. Indeed, ex-AC Milan ace Cafu says that the forward is not the player he once was.

He told BBC Sport: ""For 15 years, Neymar was Brazil's undisputed star, carrying enormous expectations and responsibility on his own. But no one wins the World Cup alone. Putting all our hopes on him at the moment is difficult because he struggles to even play three games in a row.""

Despite that, 2002 World Cup winner Ronaldo has complete faith in his compatriot. ""He's a crucial player for Brazil - there's no one else like Neymar. It's an exaggeration from a minority who believe he's neglecting his physical recovery. Anyone who has been in football knows perfectly how hard it is to come back from an injury and regain rhythm and confidence. He's right on track,"" he said.

Earlier this week, Ancelotti warned Neymar and Vinicius Junior, who has also struggled with injuries of late, that they need to be at ""100%"" to make Brazil's World Cup squad. 

He said: ""There are many players who are very good, I need to choose players that are 100%. It's not just Neymar, it could be [Real Madrid forward] Vinicius. If Vinicius is at 90%, I'll call up another player who is at 100%, because it's a team that has a very high level of competence, especially up front. Up front, we have really many good players.""

After Brazil found out they have Scotland, Morocco, and Haiti in their 2026 World Cup group, the Italian was once again asked about Neymar's chances of being involved in the tournament.

He told reporters on Friday: ""If we talk about Neymar, we have to talk about other players. We have to think about Brazil, which can be with Neymar or without Neymar, with other players or without other players. The definitive list we will make after the FIFA date in March. I understand very well that they are very interested in Neymar, I want to clarify that we are in December, the World Cup is in June, I will choose the team that will go to the World Cup in May. If Neymar deserves to be, if he is well, better than someone else, he will play in the World Cup and period. I don't owe anyone a debt.""

Ancelotti was also asked which of his players can inspire Brazil to World Cup glory. The national side is packed with quality players such as Vinicius, Rodrygo, Estevao, Raphinha, and more. Despite all that talent, the former Real Madrid boss gave little away.

""I can make a list of players who can be protagonists in the World Cup,"" he said. ""It may be that now we don't have a referential player in this sense, but we will have many referential players. I can make a list, we have one of the best goalkeepers in the world, some of the best defenders, top midfielders and some players up front. I said I don't want players who want to be the best in the world, I want players who want to win the Cup. The important thing is not to have referents, but to have players who want to win.""

At the end of the season, Neymar is expected to have arthroscopic surgery to address a meniscus injury in his left knee. For now, he is trying to keep Santos in the Brazilian top flight, with Neymar's side currently just outside the relegation zone with one game remaining. After that, though, the veteran - who scored a hat-trick against Juventude this week - doesn't know what lies ahead for him in 2026, with his contract expiring in a matter of weeks.

He told Amazon Prime this week: ""I don't know, honestly. First, I want to finish this season and then think about it. Santos always comes first. I'm very happy for the goals and for helping Santos. We're happy for the win. There's one game left, and we have to give our all at Vila again. I always prioritise my health, nothing that would harm my career. It's [the injury] manageable, something I've been dealing with for years. I'm doing everything to reach 100 percent. Scoring the goals today made me really happy. I've always been Neymar in every match, regardless of the situation. Sometimes things don't go as planned because of the team's form or injuries, but I've always shown up. I know what I can do on the pitch and always aim to give my best.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

I'd say that it is, without a doubt, the best season I've had so far…

It took a few months for the Spaniard to settle in, but everything seemed to click during the clay season. He won his first Monte Carlo title in April, and then reached the final or better at nine of the next 10 tournaments he played for the rest of the year.“Consistency is something that has always been tough for me, and it's something I've worked on as hard as possible,” Alcaraz said during the Nitto ATP Finals, where he secured the year-end No. 1 ranking.“For example, in previous years, consistency in matches or tournaments has always let me down. We've tried to improve, and I think we've done it. In every tournament I've either reached the final, won the title or had a good result.“Compared to the start of the year, which wasn't the best, we managed to turn it around and I'd say that it is, without a doubt, the best season I've had so far…”— Stephanie Livaudais

The challenge for Alcaraz won't be how to improve over the course of the year. In 2025, he went 71-9, won two majors, and finished No. 1. He found greater consistency, without backing off from his freewheeling attack.In 2026, the Spaniard will begin with a narrower and more immediate goal: Getting off to a good start. In November, he told his rival Jannik Sinner that he'll “be ready” for him when the new year begins. That declaration had special meaning, because the season starts at the Australian Open, where Sinner is the two-time defending champion, and Alcaraz has yet to make the semifinals.What can Alcaraz do to change that, and complete his career Slam? Getting some early reps in might help. Traditionally, this is the one major where Alcaraz doesn't play any tune-ups; it's also the one major he hasn't won.If he's as ready as he says he'll be, nothing should stand between him and the final. The hard courts in Melbourne have been sped up, but that shouldn't be a problem for a two-time winner on Wimbledon grass. And, with the exception of Sinner, he has distanced himself from the field over the past 12 months.Alcaraz did that by following his instincts in 2025.

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

George Russell demoted Lando Norris to P2 late in the final practice hour for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

George Russell stormed to the top of the timesheets in the final practice session for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, marginally leading Lando Norris and Max Verstappen ahead of an all-important Qualifying hour.

The Mercedes driver found a small advantage of 0.004s over Norris in the closing minutes of FP3, ending with a time of 1m 23.334s on a set of soft tyres, leading the way in another remarkably competitive session.

It was a quiet start as many drivers took their time in the garage before heading out on track – the Aston Martin pair of Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll were the first to make a short appearance, repeating their usual practice routine of scrubbing the tyres.

After a lacklustre opening day for Alpine, Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto elected to put in some laps early doors with the aim of troubleshooting some of their issues, which saw them end Friday at the back of the field in Renault's final round as an engine supplier.

Norris' initial effort saw him shoot to the top of the times with a 1m 24.728s, but it was far off his best lap in the previous practice sessions, with times expected to tumble as the track evolved across the hour.

His team mate Oscar Piastri, who missed out on FP1 for Pato O'Ward, found himself 0.4s adrift before Norris improved his time, fighting oversteer in the final sector. Norris then had a near-miss with Yuki Tsunoda, who failed to pull aside and let the McLaren past, forcing him into evasive action – the outgoing Red Bull driver raised his hand in apology and was later noted for impeding.

As the circuit gradually got busier, Ollie Bearman quickly proved that his pace in FP2 wasn't a fluke as his first lap was just 0.008s slower than Norris' effort, before Verstappen stormed to P1 just before the halfway point. The Haas wasn't the only surprise at the front, with Stroll demoting him to second following a rapid lap on the red-walled soft tyres.

The laps were coming in thick and fast with everyone making the most of the final opportunity to prepare for Qualifying, but Lewis Hamilton found the limit at Turn 9 as he suffered a high speed spin and went careering into the barrier. He was fortunately uninjured, reporting: “Something buckled at the front and snapped the rear.”

The remaining drivers lost valuable time as they returned to the pits while his damaged Ferrari was recovered, leaving them keen to make the most of the final quarter of the session once the pit exit reopened.

Piastri was the first to do so, jumping from P18 to P1 to go half a second clear of Verstappen on a fresh set of tyres. He didn't stay on top for long as Norris, also on new tyres, set a 1m 23.338s to reclaim first position – his final sector alone was three tenths faster than his team mate.

The drama wasn't just confined to the track as Mercedes youngster Kimi Antonelli was released straight into Tsunoda's path in the pitlane, crashing into the side of the Red Bull and damaging his own front wing in the process.

His team mate Russell then charged to P1 in the last few minutes of FP3, with Alonso taking a high-flying fourth place behind Norris and Verstappen, with the lead Red Bull just over a tenth away from Russell's pace-setting lap.

Piastri ended down in fifth ahead of the impressive Haas duo of Esteban Ocon and Bearman. Charles Leclerc, Antonelli and Alex Albon rounded out the top 10 in an eventful session where just 0.388s covered the front half of the field.

The drivers and teams now have just over a couple of hours to regroup before Qualifying gets underway at 1800 local time.

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

Lando Norris needs to stand on the podium in Abu Dhabi to ensure that he becomes the 2025 World Champion, with Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen also in contention for the title.

McLaren CEO Zak Brown has confirmed that the team are prepared to use team orders if needed to ensure one of their drivers wins the championship in Abu Dhabi, concluding that “it would be crazy not to”.

The three-way title fight between Lando Norris, Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri will be decided at the season finale, with everything coming down to the 58-lap Grand Prix after the Briton failed to secure victory last time out in Qatar, which would have secured him the title.

Norris could only manage fourth place in Lusail after his team's alternative strategy didn't work out, while his Red Bull rival won the race. The lead McLaren is nevertheless still top of the standings with 408 points, a slim advantage of 12 points over Verstappen, with Piastri finding himself only 16 points behind.

All Norris needs to do to win his maiden title is finish on the podium at the Yas Marina Circuit, but there are so many situations that could unfold – one involves Piastri running in the top three, with his team mate in fourth just like in the Qatar Grand Prix.

In that scenario, the Australian would be mathematically ruled out of the championship, but if he let Norris through then McLaren would still win the drivers' title, even if Verstappen took victory in the race.

Asked whether they would use team orders in an interview with Sky Sports F1, Brown answered: ""Yes, of course. We're realistic. We want to win this Drivers' Championship. We're coming into the weekend knowing that they both have equal opportunity, even though there's obviously a point spread.

""You don't know how Qualifying is going to go, reliability, but if we get into the race and it's becoming pretty clear that one has a chance and the other doesn't, we're going to do what we can to win the Drivers' Championship. It would be crazy not to.”

His comments come after Norris said in Thursday's press conference that he ""would love it"" if McLaren used team orders, but added that he wouldn't necessarily ask for them as it would be ""up to Oscar if he would allow it"".

The Woking outfit have been the dominant team throughout much of the season, with Piastri holding an advantage of 104 points over Verstappen at one stage. However, the reigning World Champion mounted a remarkable comeback that coincided with a drop in form for the Australian, bringing him back into the battle.

Norris' victories in Mexico and Brazil helped him snatch first place in the standings, but he will lose out on his first world title if Verstappen wins the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and he crosses the line in P4 or lower.

McLaren have repeatedly emphasised their focus on fairness this season, with their 'papaya rules' coming into play on various occasions, but Brown insisted that this helped them win the Teams' Championship in Round 18 in Singapore, and will benefit them in Abu Dhabi too.

""We want to win the Drivers' Championship,” he said. “So, we'll kind of see how the race plays out, but we're not going to not win the championship because we're trying to protect a third and a fourth or a sixth and a seventh, or however the situation may play out.

""It's a team sport, right? So, we're trying to win the Constructors' as a team and we're trying to win the Drivers' as a team.

""I know that kind of sounds a bit strange, but if one of them can't win, they want the other to win. And that's what the team wants. And they are team players and we've already seen that last year, right?

""You saw that in the Sprint in Brazil and I think it was Qatar. So, I don't think it's unusual in any sport for team mates to make sacrifices for each other to give the team what they want.""

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

George Russell ended Friday's running eager to help Mercedes find improvements overnight, despite finishing in the top three in FP2.

George Russell has admitted that Mercedes have work to do if they want to fight towards the front in Abu Dhabi after a highly competitive day of practice left him anticipating “surprises” in the field.

As the sun set and temperatures dropped at the Yas Marina Circuit, Russell improved from sixth to third between FP1 and FP2, albeit ending up 0.379s away from Lando Norris' pace-setting lap in the later session.

Although the McLaren driver ended the day with a commanding lead, the rest of the pack was separated by extremely small margins, enabling midfield teams to fight alongside the frontrunners and shake up the order.

Ollie Bearman was an impressive fourth for Haas, just 0.039s slower than Russell's best lap, and the Kick Sauber pair of Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto were within hundredths of the 20-year-old's time in P5 and P6.

The results have left Russell keen to extract more pace as he explained: “It was definitely feeling better this evening. It always tends to feel a bit nicer when you're driving in the dark and the track is a bit cooler.

“I think it's going to be tight in Qualifying, probably between ourselves, Red Bull and Ferrari. There are some other teams who were a bit unexpected as well – Bearman was right up there, and Hulkenberg as well, so we may have some surprises.

""The race pace wasn't great in all honesty. We need to review tonight how we can improve that and see on Sunday.

“It's not easy when you've got that C5 tyre – there's a lot of grip. When it's cool conditions, it's easy for mistakes to happen. My lap was strong and I don't think there was much left in the tank. We were only just P3 so we need to try and find a bit more pace overnight.”

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, his team mate Kimi Antonelli looked much happier in FP1, which was the least representative session of the weekend – taking place earlier in the day, the temperatures were higher than they would be in the all-important Qualifying hour or the race.

The Italian teenager finished the first session in P4, a little over a tenth away from Norris' benchmark. In FP2, he dropped to P10 as the McLaren driver's advantage opened up, leaving Antonelli 0.667s adrift, but less than three tenths behind Russell.

“We started the day pretty well,” he summarised. “I think FP2 didn't really show the pace. The last lap on softs was looking pretty strong, but then I made a mistake in the last corner and lost a lot of time.

“We're there in the mix. Of course, McLaren look a step ahead of everyone but the gaps are very, very close and every little mistake can really punish you. I think the long run was much better in FP2 than FP1 so that was a positive. We've got to keep working in order to improve for tomorrow.

“I felt pretty comfortable with the car. We've been trying quite a lot of stuff in terms of set-up and we're going in the right direction, but there's a lot of work to do.”

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

The drivers and teams report back on the final Friday of the season at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix from the Yas Marina Circuit.

Piastri sat out for O'Ward in the opening session, but observed proceedings closely from the Pit Wall. He watched his deputy have a decent session, keeping things tidy on both the medium and soft tyres. But more important was watching Norris go fast – the McLaren clearly has speed to burn here, as the Championship leader topped the session. Norris was even quicker in the second session, topping the standings by a healthy margin to get his weekend off to the dream start. But Piastri struggled, making a mistake on both his flying laps on the soft tyre. As such, he was left without a representative time on the C5 rubber, which is far from ideal on such a crucial weekend.

Lando Norris - FP1: 1:24.485, P1; FP2: 1:23.083, P1

""A decent first day in Abu Dhabi, although there's still a little bit more to find in the car. I'm not completely happy with it just yet, but overall, it's been a positive day. Nothing to smile about just yet, as we know it gets closer as the weekend goes on, but a good starting point.""

Oscar Piastri - FP2: 1:23.763, P11

“A shorter day for me today, but lots of learning in FP2. The car was in a good window, we just need to make a few tweaks overnight. I was finding my feet towards the end, so we'll review overnight and head into Quali day in a strong position.”

Pato O'Ward - FP1: 1:25.246, P14

""It was exciting to be back in the car and help the team put our best foot forward, going into what is probably the most important Sunday of the year for the team with Lando and Oscar competing for the Championship. We completed the run plan well, helping Oscar set up the car. Thanks to the team for the opportunity this afternoon, I'm excited to get back in the car on Tuesday for the test.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A reasonable start to the final weekend of the season, completing the plan across both Free Practice sessions as we intended.

“Oscar was back at the wheel for FP2 and was able to find his references in terms of single lap performance, high fuel running and the tyre behaviour. I'm sure he will be completely ready going into tomorrow when the sessions become competitive.

“Lando was a bit more comfortable in the second session, but as always, Abu Dhabi, the last race of the year, shows that the field is extremely tight. Therefore, we appreciate the competition and need to make sure that we continue to work hard to execute a perfect weekend.

“Well done to Pato for his second session in the MCL39, completing our fourth mandatory young driver appearance of the season. He drove very well, delivering all the information that we required to get the initial readings of the car.”

Verstappen pushed Norris very, very close in FP1, winding up just 0.008s back. But the Dutchman was not fully happy with his opening session, complaining that something felt broken on the car. As for Lindblad, he had a steady hour in Tsunoda's car – even if he did say it felt like driving on ice out there. As the sun set, Verstappen found conditions more to his liking and once again finished behind Norris – albeit a little further back. He is in a really good position heading into the weekend, while Tsunoda needs to find some pace if he wants to make Q3 and help his team mate out tomorrow.

Max Verstappen - FP1: 1:24.493, P2; FP2: 1:23.446, P2

“It went pretty okay in our practice sessions. I was fairly happy with the car today, we just probably needed to be a little bit faster. We were in a decent window, but I think still think not quite quick enough. It seems like there is a decent gap that we need to close but we still need to work on the race pace, so let's see how much we can find overnight. The ride has been tricky and the single laps and long runs need to be a bit better, but let's see what we can do tomorrow.""

Yuki Tsunoda - FP2: 1:24.303, P17

“I didn't expect it to be this challenging to be honest, we are still very far away with the car and I don't know exactly what is going on. We need to really look into things overnight because today felt like one of the worst practice sessions of the season. The car doesn't feel very comfortable right now, I keep sliding around and we have to find out why and what is causing this issue. It's not great right now, I hope we can get into a better place overnight to be able to perform tomorrow.""

Arvid Lindblad - FP1: 1:25.256, P15

""I'd like to start off saying a huge thank you to Oracle Red Bull Racing for the opportunity once again in the car. It's always an amazing opportunity and a real pleasure to drive in Formula One, so I'm grateful for it. On the session itself, I'm not super happy with the way it went from my side. I felt that I could've done a better job and I'll go away from today with a few things to work on ahead of next year. Driving in both F1 and F2 this weekend has been something new for me, so there was a bit of a balancing act that came with it. Nevertheless, I hope that I got some good data for the Team that they can use for the rest of the weekend.""

Gianpiero Lambiase, Head of Racing

“With Arvid, we used his time in FP1 to collect some data on a few set up parameters that we weren't 100% convinced of in simulation. That was really useful and he provided some very consistent data to analyse and his feedback was generally aligned to what we were expecting. It was generally a productive day with Max: we focused a little bit less on single lap performance for high fuel sustainable running, which now gives us a bit more data heading into Sunday. I think that has been proven useful as the tyres were a little bit more vulnerable compared to what we were perhaps expecting. It looks like front right graining is a problem for the field, so we need to analyse how we improve the longevity of this tyre heading into Sunday. Degradation is a bit higher than expected, so whilst we thought it would have been a relatively straight forward one stop, there's a question mark over that now. We really need to understand how many stops it is going to be and how we will look after our tyres. The mood in the Team is really good, it has been business as usual for us since we arrived and that is how we've approached the last nine or ten races since the shutdown. We'll continue to do our thing and follow our process and the end result will look after itself. Max is doing well in the car and we will not give up until the chequered flag is waved.""

Mercedes were able to field both their main drivers in FP1, with both looking fast to boot. The Silver Arrows certainly seem in the mix here, with Antonelli just shading Russell in the first session. Once the sun set, Russell found even more pace and radioed to say how good the car felt in the evening conditions. He wound up third and, interestingly, just 0.016s behind Verstappen on a day where tight margins between the top four teams were very evident. Antonelli finished in the top 10 as well, so Mercedes can be pleased with their opening day.

George Russell - FP1: 1:24.733, P6; FP2: 1:23.462, P3

""We didn't start off the day in the best place in FP1, but we were able to improve the car for FP2. In the hot conditions of the day, the car doesn't always feel at its nicest, but it improves once the sun goes down and the track cools a little. That certainly helped along with the changes we made between the sessions.

""It looks like it will be tight between the usual suspects at the front in qualifying tomorrow, but there could be some surprises in the mix including the Haas of Ollie Bearman and both Saubers who were quick today. We will have to execute well if we are to secure a good grid position. Equally, we've got work to do on our race pace; we will review tonight how we can improve that, and we will see where that leaves us on Sunday.""

Kimi Antonelli - FP1: 1:24.608, P4; FP2: 1:23.750, P10

""I don't think we quite showed our full potential today. We made improvements heading into FP2, but I made a small mistake on my best Soft tyre effort near the end of the lap and that left me P10. We're definitely there in the mix near the front for qualifying, although the McLaren certainly looks like the car to beat after today. The gaps are very tight across the field; we will need to perform at our best if we are to secure a good grid position.

""Our long run in FP2 was much better than FP1 but we will look to improve the car further overnight so we can look ahead to race day with plenty of confidence. I am feeling good in the car though, looking forward to the rest of the weekend and to helping the team secure P2 in the Constructors'.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""George had already sat out both his FP1 sessions and Kimi is not required to do this given he is a rookie. That put us in the useful position of being one of only two teams with both race drivers in the car for the first hour of practice. This went reasonably smoothly with both getting to grips with the car. The single lap looked OK but there was more to find on the balance; overall though, the pace was about where we'd expect.

""Frustratingly, the long run was not good. The car was bouncing in the high-speed which was unsettling it. We therefore made some changes to improve both balance and bouncing going into the evening session. On the single lap, the car was still in a reasonable place but neither George nor Kimi put together a perfect effort. Whilst we took a step forward, the long run was still not where we wanted it to be. We were suffering from a bit too much graining and that's defining our pace. That should improve with more rubber being laid down but we'll also be looking at how we can change the car to improve this. Compared to recent Fridays, this has been more challenging so we'll be working hard overnight to try and find some solutions.""

The Leclerc brothers took to the track in FP1, leading to the amusing moment where the elder brother spun at Turn 5, and Arthur used that opportunity to poke fun at his big bro – accusing him of practicing his burn outs for the crowd. When they actually knuckled down, Leclerc was quick over one lap but not happy with his car on longer runs. He fell down the order in FP2, meaning there is work to do for Ferrari overnight to extract more pace from their set-up. Hamilton was not happy either, as he finished 14th in his only session of the day.

Charles Leclerc - FP1: 1:24.501, P3; FP2: 1:23.658, P8

""FP1 was very special for me. Seeing my younger brother behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car with the Scuderia, and sharing the track with him for a practice session is something we dreamed of together since we were kids and it put a smile on my face.

""In terms of driving, it was a tricky Friday for us overall. We are missing something and are pushing to find where we can improve to be further ahead in tomorrow's qualifying.""

Lewis Hamilton - FP2: 1:23.939, P14

""It was great to see Arthur in the car this afternoon in FP1 and I was feeling good coming into FP2. The car proved challenging to drive and there is some work to do ahead of tomorrow to improve the feeling with the car. We'll review the data tonight and work on the areas that can help us make a step forward for tomorrow's sessions.""

Arthur Leclerc - FP1: 1:25.360, P16

""I'm really happy with this FP1. It was a good session and we gathered important data for the team and the simulator group. Everything went well and the pace was strong. The Soft tyres were completely new to me, so I just tried to give it my best. Being on track together with my brother and the other Formula 1 drivers is always a great emotion. I want to thank the whole team for this opportunity.""

Hirakawa was arguably the most impressive rookie in FP1, winding up just four and a half tenths off Norris despite not running the soft tyre. As for Bearman, he suffered a suspected hydraulics leak midway through FP1 and, after being sent back out, he was then called back to the pits to end his session early with a sensor problem. But Bearman had a much better time of it in FP2, lapping in the fourth fastest car after describing it as “insane” and reiterating how happy he was with the VF-25. Ocon was further down the order, as he continues to struggle to extract the same pace over one lap as his team mate.

Esteban Ocon –FP2: 1:23.958, P16

“It doesn't seem to be working today – I can't get the car to do one single lap. We're half a second off every lap we do, so there's a lot to look through. We can't get the car to be how I'd like it to be.”

Oliver Bearman - FP1: 1:24.759, P8; FP2: 1:23.501, P4

“We had a good car underneath us in FP1, and I had a great feeling. On the first run I had a bit of understeer, but I could feel that the car wanted to go fast. In FP1, I didn't get to do a lot of the session as we had a small issue, but I did one lap on the medium compound and we were really competitive, and that carried over to this afternoon. I think the key point is that it's very tight out there, we were four-tenths away, but five-tenths can put you outside the top 10. It's going to be important to optimize everything tomorrow.”

Ryō Hirakawa - FP1: 1:24.934, P11

“That was my fourth FP1 session of the season and I've learned so much, so thank you to both MoneyGram Haas F1 Team and TOYOTA GAZOO Racing for the opportunity this year. I think it was a pretty decent session, and finally I got to drive around a track I've already tested on in a Formula 1 car. I was able to push from lap 1 knowing the layout, able to give comprehensive feedback, and follow a positive trend in lap time. We were the team that put mediums on for our fastest lap, so I think we're really competitive. I think we have a lot to analyze now, but we're looking good.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“Ryō was back in the car for FP1, and I think he did a very good job, especially on the low-fuel runs. In the previous couple of outings, he wasn't very happy with the brakes, but today he was. It goes to show, when you get that element right, that's the performance he can provide. Ollie's been happy with the car from the get-go, and looking at his lap time, he's very confident. We have some fine-tuning to do, but that's a strong place to start from. Esteban missed FP1 but was back in the car for FP2, and he's struggling with the brakes and with entry stability, so we need to find a better compromise for him.”

Kick Sauber were also able to field their fulltime drivers in FP1, and as such made a good start to the weekend. Both drivers wound up in the top 10, with Hulkenberg looking fast on the soft tyres. That trend continued in FP2, Hulkenberg finishing right the way up the order, with Bortoleto hot on his heels. The Brazilian was also involved in one amusing radio exchange, when he was baulked by “the big Leclerc” in the second session – his Race Engineer finding a unique way to differentiate between the two Leclerc brothers.

Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:24.629, P5; FP2: 1:23.550, P5

“It was a clean Friday for us, with no interruptions or problems on our side. It felt positive out there, and it's nice to carry that good feeling into the weekend. Now, it's about fine-tuning and dialling out the last little bits as we look to keep this momentum over the next 48 hours.”

Gabriel Bortoleto - FP1: 1:24.742, P7; FP2: 1:23.570, P6

“Overall, today has been quite positive. There's obviously still some fine-tuning to do ahead of tomorrow, but it was quite productive as we focused on understanding the balance in both high-fuel and low-fuel runs. It's encouraging to see our car in those positions, even though it's obviously still only Friday. We'll keep pushing and aim to maximise our performance in qualifying tomorrow.”

Iwasa had a quiet session in Lawson's car, leaving the majority of the work to Hadjar. The Frenchman looked quick early on before fading as the session wore on, and was left frustrated by traffic too. He improved in the second session, winding up in the top 10 despite once again getting a little frustrated by some of his colleagues. As for Lawson, he was a bit further down the order as he took his time getting adjusted to the track after sitting out FP1.

Isack Hadjar - FP1: 1:24.977, P12; FP2: 1:23.657, P7

“Overall, it was a good day here in Abu Dhabi. Honestly, I thought it would have been a bit better, as both Saubers and Ollie look really fast and ahead of us. We know we need to find some pace, and we'll work on that overnight. We expect a real fight tomorrow in Qualifying.”

Liam Lawson - FP2: 1:24.474, P18

“FP2 was a little bit tricky as we missed FP1 this morning, so there's naturally a little bit of catching up to do. There's more work needed than we were expecting, so we'll get to it tonight and hopefully come back with a stronger car tomorrow. FP3 won't really be representative of Quali given how warm it will be, so the main thing will be focusing on learnings from today. Overall, as a team we're looking quite quick, so it's now a case of really fine tuning my car.""

Mattia Spini, Chief Race Engineer

“Abu Dhabi holds special significance with it being the final race of the season, but in terms of set up, there's nothing that stands out as you need to be strong in all areas. We ran Ayumu in Liam's car for FP1, he had a clean session and collected valuable data for the team. Isack was not as satisfied with car balance on his fastest lap as he was on the Hard compound, we therefore used two sets of Soft tyres in FP2 to optimise Qualifying preparation as it's the closest Free Practice session to Qualifying in terms of track conditions. He was more satisfied with car balance, he just requested improvements in a couple of corners. Liam used one set of Mediums and one set of Softs, like the majority of the field. He was not fully comfortable with the car in either short or long-run configuration, so we have work to do tonight to improve his pace. Again, we were able to cover good mileage on high fuel, gathering more data for Sunday's race.”

Browning was in Albon's car in FP1, but he soon experienced some radio static issues, after he failed to hear about an approaching Hadjar and slightly got in his rival's way. The team brought him in to fix that radio, before sending him back out. It was not a straightforward session for Sainz either, who seemed to struggle with some braking problems. Roll on FP2, and this time it was Albon who struggled with some issues – complaining about his engine. As such, Williams have some work to do overnight to get on top of the gremlins so that both drivers can fight their way up the order tomorrow.

Alex Albon - FP2: 1:23.950, P15

""Honestly, it's not been a bad day but there's little fires everywhere. I only did the one session today, but the car feels reasonably good. Degradation is much higher than we all expected so I think that will make Sunday interesting as before the event it was a clear one stop, and now it's not. There's a lot of grip out there but the front is sliding, and you can see everyone grabbing their front tyre. Tomorrow I just want to have a smooth FP3 and then we'll see how it goes, but I do know it's very tight; I reckon half a second is the difference in pretty much the whole field right now. So, it's all fun and exciting.""

Carlos Sainz - FP1: 1:24.771, P9; FP2: 1:23.872, P13

""It was an extremely tight session today. I think we're in the fight, but it looks like Haas and Sauber are leading the midfield at the moment. We were quite surprised with the high degradation during the long runs, so it's something for us to look at. For tomorrow, we'll try to take a step forward and fight our way into Q3. It will come down to whoever can put the lap together, so maximum focus.""

Luke Browning - FP1: 1:25.490, P18

""Overall, a really positive FP1 session and great to get more mileage in an F1 car. It's always an added challenge switching between F1 and F2 on the same day, but I'm enjoying being out there on track and learning how the current F1 car works. Now my focus is back on F2 as we close out this season, before getting my final opportunity to drive the FW47 this year at the post-season test!""

Alonso and Stroll sat out FP1 for Crawford and Shields. Those two nearly had a coming together, with Shields trying to get off the racing line as Crawford approached at speed but not quite managing to do so. When Alonso and Stroll jumped back in for FP2 they kept their session clean and tidy, with the Spaniard just cracking the top 10 on a night where the gaps behind Norris were incredibly tight, with just three tenths of a second between Verstappen in P2 and Antonelli in P10.

Fernando Alonso - FP2: 1:23.708, P9

""With only one session today, we quickly had to learn how the car felt, and everything was as expected.

""The circuit is tricky to balance, but we will continue to work throughout the weekend and try to secure some points.

""It was also great to see Jak and Cian in the car this morning, learning while also gathering valuable data for the team.""

Lance Stroll - FP2: 1:23.832, P12

""Today was all about getting into the rhythm at Yas Marina Circuit and building confidence with the car.

""The car felt okay in Free Practice Two, but we have a few things to work on over night and some areas we can improve on, and then we'll see how competitive we can be tomorrow.""

Jak Crawford - FP1: 1:25.889, P19

""It was a really good, productive session.

""We tried some different things with the setup of the AMR25 and everything went smoothly.

""I drove here last year in the post-season test, so I had some good reference points and I felt I got up to speed quickly.""

Aron was in for Gasly, as he continued his development as one of Alpine's reserve drivers. That left Colapinto to really push the A525 in FP1, which he did with decent success. But when the lights came on for FP2, the Alpine faded to the back of the field. Neither driver was able to extract much pace out there, so making it out of Q1 tomorrow will be the first challenge for the French team.

Pierre Gasly - FP2: 1:24.963, P20

“It was a difficult Free Practice 2 on our side today. We are going to need to find a lot more performance if we are to challenge for the top ten tomorrow when it counts. I think we have some evidence to explain where we are lacking and I am confident we can improve for tomorrow. There were a few things that did not work as expected. The balance was just too inconsistent and we seemed to lack grip across both cars in the second session. We will see what we can do and we will give it one final push this weekend as we close out the season.”

Franco Colapinto - FP1: 1:24.855, P10; FP2: 1:24.771, P19

“Today wasn't the easiest day and a difficult one to fully understand, as it felt like we took a step backwards from the afternoon to the evening session. We started the day well with a good feeling in the car, ending up not far off on the timesheet and more comparable to the teams around us. The second session was more difficult so we need to understand why that is and how we can improve for Qualifying. As we did in Qatar and in previous races, we've shown that as a team we can keep improving as the weekend goes on. We just need to sit down with the engineers and go over the data this evening and target a more positive Free Practice 3 where hopefully we can test and refine a few things.”

Paul Aron - FP1: 1:25.204, P13

“I am very grateful to the team for the Free Practice 1 outings this year. Today was another successful session where we were able to complete the whole run plan and work through some good set-up items. Hopefully that can all be beneficial to the team for the remainder of the weekend. Even though this was my fifth FP1 of the year, the third with the team, it certainly still brings its challenges, especially as it has been over one month since I last drove. In general, I was happy with the pace but we did not quite put it together on the Soft run so there is definitely room to improve. Now I will be watching and supporting closely for the remainder of the weekend and hopefully we can have a successful one as a team.”

Simone Berra, Pirelli Chief Engineer

“The times on the first day of Abu Dhabi are in line with simulations: about half a second faster compared to last year. In both sessions we found some instances of graining, mainly on the front-right, which has the effect of slightly accelerating  degradation. In this context, the most consistent race tyres seem to be the medium and hard, whereas the soft appears to be more suited to a flying lap.

""One factor to bear in mind though is track evolution. The support races are laying down rubber onto a surface that was initially quite dirty, improving grip. This means that graining could well be reduced in the next couple of days, putting the soft C5 back into play.

""From what we just saw today, a one-stop strategy seems to be most likely. Nonetheless, as the weekend goes on, a two-stopper could also become a possibility. It's not by chance that both McLarens and the Aston Martin of Alonso did not run the hard at all in FP2, saving a new set.

""An extra set of hard C3 tyres during the race gives more options in terms of strategy, especially if there's a safety car, and delivers performance very similar to the medium C4. The performance gap between the C3 and C4 is currently around two tenths of a second, while there's a bigger gap between medium and soft of about seven to eight tenths of a second.”

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

Max Verstappen reckons there is a “decent gap” Red Bull need to close if they are to be in contention at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

While Max Verstappen was left feeling “fairly happy” with the balance of his Red Bull after Friday practice in Abu Dhabi, he fears the package is “not quick enough” to challenge for honours as things stand.

Verstappen heads into this weekend's season finale 12 points behind McLaren rival Lando Norris, who topped both of Friday's sessions, meaning he needs a sizeable swing to make it five world titles on the bounce.

Asked to assess his day, which he ended 0.363s away from Norris, four-time champion Verstappen said: “Pretty okay. I was fairly happy with the car, we just need to be probably a little bit faster!

“I think still not quick enough, but I think overall we've been in – for us – a decent window around here.”

Verstappen and Red Bull have battled severe bouncing and ride issues with the RB21, and the Dutchman admitted that this area of the car was still far from ideal through FP1 and FP2 at the Yas Marina Circuit.

“That's a constant fight that we have, but that's nothing new,” he said, before pondering whether his engineers can get the car into a better window – and in turn find more pace – for Saturday's running.

“It seems like it's a decent gap that we need to close, but from our side we'll just try to put the best car forward,” Verstappen commented. “Let's see how much we can find overnight.”

Pressed on whether time needs to be found across both short and long runs, or if he thinks he will be in the fight over one lap, he replied: “No, no. Single lap and long run needs to be better.”

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

Championship leader Lando Norris will line up in second place for Sunday's decisive Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with the Briton conceding that he was ""not fast enough"" to outpace title rival Max Verstappen for pole position.

Lando Norris admitted that he was “disappointed” to not take pole position for the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but the Briton vowed to try to win as he looks to claim a maiden World Championship.

After setting the pace in both of Friday's practice sessions, Norris did not top the timesheets during any of Saturday's Qualifying segments, with McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell going quickest in Q1 and Q2 respectively.

Max Verstappen then beat the rest of the pack in Q3, the Red Bull driver clinching pole thanks to his effort of 1m 22.207s. Norris proved to be his closest challenger, but at 0.201s adrift could not beat the Dutchman, meaning that the championship leader will line up in second on the grid.

Reflecting on the session straight after jumping out of the car, Norris explained: “It's tough. It's tough. Max did a good job, so congrats to him. We did everything we could. I think my lap was pretty good, I was pretty happy.

“Of course I'm disappointed not to be on pole for the final weekend, but we just weren't fast enough today, so we'll have to try and do it tomorrow.”

Sharing further thoughts later on, the 26-year-old suggested that the outcome of Qualifying “could have been a lot worse”, adding: “I expected it to be a lot closer into Q3, and the Quali battle then was between me and Oscar.

“Max was too far ahead – they were too fast. We didn't quite have the speed in the car today. A tough one to take, but otherwise I think we got everything out of it. I think Oscar said he did a pretty good lap and I thought I did a pretty good lap. Just not fast enough come Qualifying, but tomorrow's a new day.”

When asked how he is feeling about Sunday's race – one in which he could potentially win his first title – Norris said: “Remarkably normal. I guess I feel the same, a little bit disappointed we couldn't get first, even though it was just out of reach today.

“It's just always nice to end the season on top like we did last year. We didn't win the [Drivers'] Championship last year, but it was just nice to end with a win. That's what I would like to do tomorrow, in either our cases. I feel good, and we'll go in and do everything the same as normal.”

A podium would be enough for Norris to be confirmed as World Champion, regardless of where Verstappen and Piastri finish. However, when quizzed on whether he would simply aim for the rostrum or target victory instead, the British driver remained unsure.

“I don't know. The time will come that I think of that,” he explained. “For now, I'm disappointed to not be on pole, and I still want to try and win tomorrow, so that's going to be the goal.”

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

With the 2025 Drivers' title set to be decided this weekend, other Formula 1 drivers gave their thoughts ahead of the showdown.

Leading Formula 1 drivers have offered their views and opinions on who they believe will claim the 2025 Drivers' Championship, with a three-way fight between Lando Norris, Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri set to take place at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Norris holds a 12-point lead heading into Sunday's race, with third place guaranteeing him a maiden F1 title regardless of where Verstappen and Piastri finish.

The Yas Marina Circuit is also a venue where the McLaren driver won 12 months ago, with several drivers including Charles Leclerc, George Russell and Isack Hadjar all believing the Briton will succeed in his quest this weekend.

""I don't know, I changed my mind so many times this year. I probably think it's going to be Lando if nothing big happens to him,"" said Leclerc on Thursday.

But while Norris holds the points advantage and has the most to lose, momentum is with Verstappen, the Red Bull driver having taken five wins from the previous eight Grands Prix, including back-to-back successes in Las Vegas and Qatar.

With four titles under his belt, the Dutchman is no stranger to championship deciders, with seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton believing ""part of it is mental strength"".

""Part of it is the unity of a team and the output, because it's not just one person doing the the job this weekend,"" added Hamilton.

""It's a collective. Max has a mega team, and so does McLaren. It should be very tight.""

Piastri trails Norris by 16 points and is an outsider for the title, but Abu Dhabi has notably produced  climatic title showdowns, with Sebastian Vettel securing his maiden crown in 2010 despite trailing team mate Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso in the points.

""I think there are some similarities, for sure,"" said Alonso when asked to compare his 2010 title bid with the current season.

""For your interest, in 2010 the best car won. I think the biggest question you all have is who is the favourite, who is going to win on Sunday?

""Who knows? This is F1, anything can happen, as we saw last week [in Qatar]. When you have the best car it always helps, and I think McLaren, they have the best car and they have two of the three [drivers]. They should win in a normal race.""

A late Safety Car in the 2021 edition gave Verstappen the chance to claim his maiden title, while a Safety Car at the previous race in Qatar and a strategic error by McLaren again opened the door for Verstappen.

Williams' Carlos Sainz is hopeful for a clean race in the title-decider, with pure pace deciding the outcome.

""I only wish them the best, I wish the best one to win,"" he said.

""My preference is no luck involved, so no Safety Cars or red flags at the wrong time for any of them, because that will feel for sure heartbreaking as a driver.

""I just want a clean weekend and just let the best guy win. I think obviously Lando is favourite going into it because he needs the top three and it's a good track for McLaren and him.""

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

Lando Norris led the field in both of Friday's practice sessions for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Lando Norris continued his strong form in a busy second practice session for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, topping the times ahead of Max Verstappen and George Russell.

After he beat his Red Bull rival to first place in FP1 by just 0.008s, Norris extended his advantage in FP2 to 0.363s. This session has the most similar conditions to the upcoming Qualifying hour, putting the Standings leader in a good position to chase down another podium position.

Elsewhere, Ollie Bearman took an impressive P4 for Haas and remarked over the radio: ""I don't know how it's so good."" Just behind him in fifth and sixth were the Kick Sauber pair, with Nico Hulkenberg leading the charge in the team's final weekend before they adopt the Audi name in 2026.

Oscar Piastri, after sitting out of FP1 for Pato O'Ward, struggled to put a lap together that was good enough for the top 10 – he locked up on his flying lap to end up in P11, just under seven tenths off his team mate's pace.

There was plenty of traffic throughout FP2 as many fought to get the most out of the soft tyres before switching focus to their long-run pace on harder compounds, leaving the order predominantly unchanged in the final quarter of the session.

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

Oscar Piastri set the 11th quickest time during Free Practice 2 at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the McLaren driver having sat out the day's opening session while rookie Pato O'Ward took his place.

Oscar Piastri felt that he was “finding [his] feet” during Free Practice 2 in Abu Dhabi after sitting out the day's opening session, but the McLaren driver was left believing that he has a “pretty good” chance of fighting for pole position on Saturday.

With many teams opting to run a rookie driver in Friday's opening practice hour, Piastri watched on from the pit wall as reserve driver Pato O'Ward took the wheel of his MCL39 before returning to action in the day's second – and more representative – session.

The Australian logged 29 laps in that hour but ended up in P11 on the timesheets, with a low-key opening run on the soft tyres meaning that he was unable to match the pace of team mate Lando Norris, who was nearly seven-tenths clear at the top of the pack.

Reflecting back on the session after jumping out of the car, Piastri sounded a positive note as he explained: “I think I got there pretty well on the medium [tyres] – just the softs didn't get the most out of the grip on that first timed lap.

“Finding my feet, I think, but clearly some things to try and improve for tomorrow. But I think after just one session, not too bad.”

Pushed on whether big changes might be needed overnight – or whether the focus would be more on smaller details – the 24-year-old responded: “I think it's more just little details.

“The car feels like it's in a pretty decent place, again just didn't get the grip out of it in that first soft lap. Some small tweaks, of course – it didn't feel perfect out there, but nothing major.”

Looking ahead to Saturday's Qualifying, Piastri – who claimed his sixth career pole position last time out in Qatar – is hopeful about his chances of putting himself at the front of the grid again this weekend.

“I think pretty good,” he answered when asked about his prospects of battling for pole. “I think the car's looked quick – just need to get some more laps under my belt and find my feet a bit more really, that's all. A few more laps tomorrow, a few more sets of tyres, hopefully we'll be there.”

Piastri remains one of three drivers in contention for the World Championship on Sunday, with the nine-time race winner 16 points adrift of fellow McLaren driver Norris and four behind second-placed Max Verstappen.

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

Oscar Piastri will start just behind title rivals Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in Abu Dhabi on Sunday evening.

Oscar Piastri was satisfied with his efforts during the final Qualifying session of the season in Abu Dhabi, feeling that third on the grid represented “more or less what we had” after a low-key start to the weekend.

Piastri is one of three title contenders heading into the 2025 finale at the Yas Marina Circuit, sitting four points behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen and 16 points behind McLaren team mate Lando Norris.

All of them are set to start at the front of the grid on Sunday evening, with Verstappen coming out on top in Q3 over Norris and Piastri, who will be drawing inspiration from outsiders winning the championship in the last races of 2007 and 2010.

“I think honestly pretty good,” was the Australian's post-Qualifying assessment. “I think Q1 I got a nice lap on the board, the first good lap I've done all weekend, so it was nice to kind of set myself a baseline for the rest of quali.

“I think in Q3 things felt good, my lap was pretty good, and I think Lando's lap was pretty good. I think that was more or less what we had, so ultimately pretty pleased.”

He added: “[We were] just not quite quick enough today, but it sets up a pretty exciting day tomorrow.”

Asked if he now has the confidence to attack the race, knowing that a significant points swing is required, Piastri said: “Yeah, definitely. I think we made some good improvements from practice yesterday and practice this afternoon.

“I felt much happier with the car and I felt like I was driving a lot better as well, which helps. I think we're in a reasonable place with that.

“Obviously it was not quite quick enough to beat Max today, but I think we did everything we could.”

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

The three Championship rivals reflect on finishing in the top three in the final Qualifying session of the year.

1. Max Verstappen (Red Bull), 2. Lando Norris (McLaren), 3. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS

(Conducted by James Hinchcliffe)

Q: Max, first of all, congratulations – 48th career pole. You found an enormous amount of lap time in Q3 there. Where did that come from?

Max VERSTAPPEN: Well, in Q2 I stayed on scrubbed tyres and I think those laps already felt quite decent. And then in Q3 around here, you know, the track temp is coming down. You know that you can push a bit more and that's exactly what we did. We found a bit more lap time and, of course, incredibly happy to be in first. That's the only thing that we can do, right? That's the only thing that we can control, try to just maximise everything we have and then do what we can with the car – and we definitely did that in qualifying.

Q: Max, conditions in FP3 were so different from what you see in qualifying. What's the challenge like for you and your engineers to decide what changes to make to the car knowing that when you get on track in qualifying, it's going to be so different than what you saw in practice?

MV: Yeah. You have to try and guess a little bit how much the track is going to improve. Of course, it cools down a lot. But you're never like 100% sure if it's going to work. But I do think that what we changed definitely helped me a little bit more to feel better in qualifying.

Q: Lando Norris starts outside of the front row. You guys are really writing the script for us – all three of you starting one, two, three. Lando, you're ahead of one championship rival, behind the other. Are you satisfied with how you did out there? Did you leave anything on the table?

Lando NORRIS: It's tough. I mean, Max did a good job, so congrats to him. We did everything we could. I think my lap was pretty good. I was pretty happy. So yeah, of course disappointed to not be on pole for the final weekend, but we were just not running fast enough today. So, we'll have to try do it tomorrow.

Q: A podium tomorrow clinches the world championship for you. Is that then the goal? Are you just thinking about finishing on the podium or is it still going for the win?

LN: I don't know. The time will come when I think of that. But for now, you know, disappointed to not be on pole, and I still want to try win tomorrow. So that's going to be the goal.

Q: And Oscar, for you, great effort throughout. You were very quick in Q1, came up a little bit short in Q3. How was the run for you?

Oscar PIASTRI: Yeah. I mean, I think it was pretty good. I think the lap I did in Q1, it was nice to finally get into a rhythm through the weekend. And honestly, I think the last lap in Q3 was pretty good as well. There wasn't a whole lot left in that. No, just not quite quick enough today. But yep, sets up a pretty exciting day tomorrow.

Q: Qualifying pace is one thing. Obviously race pace is a completely different thing. Do you think you've got what it takes to get by these two guys tomorrow for the win?

OP: We'll find out tomorrow. I think Max has looked very quick in the long runs this weekend and clearly very quick over one lap. But yeah, let's see how much pace is a factor tomorrow.

Q: Max, finally back to you. Obviously, a win essentially is all you can control, like you said. Is there any point worrying about what's happening behind you or is it just eyes forward for 58 laps?

MV: We'll find out tomorrow, won't we? Let's see what we can do. Of course, I'll try to win the race, but also in the back of my mind, we want to try and score a lot of points to still try and win that championship. So, we need a bit of luck from what is happening behind us.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Max, very well done. Two laps good enough for pole this evening. Tell us about the performance, first of all. How good was the car? How clean were those laps?

MV: Yeah, I think in general, qualifying felt a little bit more together compared to the other sessions, where I always felt like we were still lacking a little bit. But then I think with the final changes that we made going into the night, that seemed to help us a bit. And then throughout qualifying, just improving nicely. In Q2, of course, I was on scrubbed tyres, and to be honest, I was a little bit surprised on the first run how much the new tyres actually gave me. But yeah, it was a good lap already, with a little bit of help also from Yuki with a tow. So, that was very nice of him to give up one of his runs. And then the second lap, I was not sure if I was going to improve just because of the tow that I got. But then again, just found a little bit more lap time in the corners, and that gave me a little bit more lap time. So happy with that, happy with the one-lap performance at the end in qualifying. Now, of course, the big question mark is can we keep that up in the race.

Q: Well, can you? You said that qualifying went better than the practice sessions. Have you got the long-run pace that you need?

MV: I would hope so. I mean, I actually did a lot of laps in the long run, so we tried to prepare in the best way possible. It's probably the best I have felt, but of course, let's see if that's good enough.

Q: So, huge race tomorrow. You have your title rivals alongside you and directly behind you. First up, how much are you going relish this battle tomorrow?

MV: Of course, I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to try to win that race. But of course, with that, I still need a little bit of help or luck to win the championship. But we'll see how that goes tomorrow.

Q: And how much will you agonise about the different permutations that you need tonight? Just what you need to win the championship—how much will you look to that tonight?

MV: To think about that tonight? No. We'll figure it out tomorrow, not tonight. I mean, it's like talking about strategy—you can talk about it for one hour, two hours, and then normally after one lap, you throw it in the bin. So, yeah, a lot can go well for you, can go against you, and we'll find out tomorrow.

Q: Lando, let's come to you. You said a moment ago you're disappointed not to be on pole. So, let's talk about Q3. How was the car? How was your rhythm out there?

LN: Yeah. I think Q1, Q2, not the smoothest. My Q3 laps, I was pretty happy with, honestly. So yeah, I felt pretty good. I felt like I got a lot out of the car today, but it just wasn't enough. So, a bit disappointed because you just want to be on pole for the final race of the year. But we just didn't have the pace today. So, I felt like I got the maximum out of the car, and I have to be happy with that. Of course, behind the one person I kind of want to be ahead of—that's the only reason for the disappointment. But otherwise, I was pretty happy with my laps, and yeah, it was the maximum we could do.

Q: You used two sets of tyres early on. How much did that upset the rest of the session for you?

LN: No, it didn't.

Q: Let's throw this forward to the Grand Prix itself. First of all, the long-run pace of the car—what did you learn in Friday practice in particular?

LN: Bits. I think we weren't in the best position on Friday. I think we've improved in quite a few areas since then. And race pace, you know, normally we're pretty strong. But like Oscar said, Max's pace was also very strong. So yeah, I think today when you look at it, we weren't quite quick enough. But of course, we'll hope we can turn some of that around tomorrow.

Q: So how do you balance taking risks in this race with protecting your championship lead?

LN: I'll decide when I have to.

Q: Oscar, it was very close between you and Lando in qualifying. Let's talk about your one-lap pace first of all. How pleased were you?

OP: I think overall, pretty happy. I feel like Q1, that was the first lap that was actually good for the weekend, which was nice to have it at the right time. And then I think the laps in Q3 were pretty good as well. You know, the tiny little margins that you always have on a qualifying lap were probably there, but I didn't have an answer for Max's pace today. So ultimately, pretty happy. Would have loved a bit more, but we didn't have it.

Q: And are you happy with the long-run pace of the car?

OP: Difficult to know. I've not done that much long running, obviously only FP2, but it looked okay without being anything spectacular. So yeah, I would have loved the long runs to have gone a bit better, but we're here now, and we'll see how the conditions and the track evolve.

Q: Now you've won championships before, obviously, as has Lando in the junior formulas. Is there anything you've learned from previous high-pressure moments that will help you tomorrow?

OP: Yes. Funny things can happen. That's what I've learned.

Q: Going to get your popcorn out and watch these two going into Turn 1 tomorrow, for example?

OP: Turn 1, I don't know, but I'll have someone stand by.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Question to all three. Based on the long runs in FP2 and how the track has felt through today, how much do you feel it's gripped up from yesterday, and what's that going to do in terms of the demands of the car? Because a lot of people were talking about front graining on the front right and then deg on the rears.

MV: Normally, it always improves a bit. It's quite natural throughout the weekend. But still, I think everyone in the long runs was graining their right front, and at the same time, the rears are also not on holiday. So yeah, I think we will all struggle with the same thing—but some a bit more than others.

LN: Max summed it up pretty well. I think the track certainly improves always into qualifying. Probably not as much as we might have thought considering yesterday, with where the fuel loads we were at, things like that. It was already a 23.0, I think. So, we didn't really go that much quicker today with a lot less fuel. So I maybe would have hoped for a bit more from us today in quali performance. But lately, our quali performances have been something that have been a bit more on the back foot rather than the races. So yeah, like Max says, I think everyone struggled with similar things. But generally, people try and work on those things as much as possible into FP3 and so forth. And normally, the grip coming up then also helps that into Sunday.

OP: Yeah. I don't have much to add. I think it has gripped up quite a bit. I think for everyone, it was probably a bit worse than expected. So, we'll see what that looks like tomorrow.

Q: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it) Question for Max. You mentioned the improvements you and the team made since yesterday. What were the main struggles you experienced yesterday with the car?

MV: Just being able to put it all together. Sometimes that's oversteer, sometimes that's understeer. Just depends a little bit on the corner layout. And every session you try different things—some bits are positive, some bits are negative. And then over the practice sessions, you make a call on what you want for qualifying. That's what we did, and finally most of the corners came together.

Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Max, back in 2016 when Lewis was trying to win the title, he tried to back Nico up into the pack so that he would fall down a few places. Is that a tactic you're considering tomorrow and one you might be up for exploiting? And Lando, are you prepared for what might not be a very straightforward race in that respect?

MV: Yeah. It was also a different layout. I feel like now you get towed around a lot more around the lap, so it's probably not as easy to do something like that. Cars also are completely different to back then. I felt like it was a lot easier back then to back it up because the tyres would overheat a lot when you would get close. I remember even in 2016, in some qualifying laps, you couldn't go flat out in Sector 1 to keep the tyres alive in the last sector—which actually was here, for example. So yeah, very different times. I hope it's not straightforward, the race—but hopefully that's not because of me!

Q: Lando? Are you expecting a complicated race?

LN: No idea. I expect everything, so we'll wait and see.

Q: (Julian Linden – Herald Sun) Question for Oscar. Are you cool with team orders now if you can't win? And if by chance it turns out that you do something which helps Lando win the championship, how would you hope or expect he might thank you or repay you down the track?

OP: I don't know. Handshake would be good, probably. I don't know. I haven't... I don't know what exactly is expected of me yet. But until either Lando or Max cross the line in front of me, I've still got a chance of winning the title. So yeah, we'll see how the race pans out.

Q: (Laurence Edmondson – ESPN) To Oscar, are you expecting those conversations to happen before the race tomorrow? Is that the normal process? And to Lando, you mentioned on Thursday how much the championship would mean to you—was there any difference in the way you felt ahead of that qualifying session?

OP: I'm sure we will talk about it. Yes. I think it makes a lot of sense to talk about that one before the race.

LN: No. I mean, I'm always a bit nervous before quali. It's more excitement than anything else. But apart from Q1, I felt pretty good out there. So no, I felt pretty normal.

Q: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Max, where does this qualifying lap from yourself, your final push lap, rank for you all-time, and was it close to perfection from you?

MV: Yeah. It felt really good, and of course there was quite a bit of pressure trying to do the best we could. It felt probably similar to 2021 qualifying—I had a really good qualifying here as well. But I like that. When the pressure is the highest or when you really need to perform, normally I perform because I enjoy that kind of aspect. But yeah, it was nice. You always try to do the best possible quali lap. Sometimes it works out better than other times. I think this time it worked out pretty well.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, in the build-up to Qatar you could have won the championship there on Sunday. How did going through that experience, in terms of nerves, pre-race build-up, help you going into this weekend?

LN: I mean, it feels a bit different, just because it's the final race of the year, not because of anything else. I felt pretty normal into Sunday last week. I didn't really have the expectation that I was going to get the championship because I started P3 and just didn't really expect it. Or P2. So no, I felt good then, I feel good now. I feel comfortable and ready to go. I feel like we've got a good plan for things. But as Max said, you can't plan for everything. So no, I feel good. I feel excited to get the final race done and then go on holiday.

Q: (Mat Coch – PlanetF1.com) To the two McLaren drivers: tomorrow there's a good possibility that one of you is going to be very happy and one perhaps a little bit less happy. Have you guys discussed that?

OP: I don't think you need to have any discussions about things like that. One of us could win our first championship in F1—you're obviously going to celebrate that. I think we've got more than enough respect between each other to appreciate the work of the person that loses tomorrow, and there's going to be nothing but respect either way. Also, whoever's on the losing side – it would be unfair to expect the person who's won to not celebrate. So, I don't think you need any conversations. I think we're adults and got enough respect between us to know what's right.

LN: Yeah. Oscar said it well. It's not a conversation that needs to be had, and I think we both understand each other and are respectful enough of one another. I think we both understand that no one would do anything in a bad way to make the other feel worse. We both respect what we do every single weekend, every quali, every race. We go out and race together. But that's the same off the track—we're two different guys that get along, and that's all we need.

Q: (Maria Guidotti – GrainingF1.com) Lando, two questions. Would you sign to finish tomorrow the way you finished today? And in an ideal situation approaching a season, is it better in terms of mindset to be the hunter or the hunted?

LN: I don't mind either. I've been in both positions, I guess. I felt good in both. I performed in both. So yeah, I'm not too bothered to be the hunter or the hunted. I think normally to be hunted is fine because you're normally the one with the advantage in the first place, so that's good. And of course, I would sign for that now but life's not that simple, sadly. So, I'm still going to go into tomorrow and we are still going to plan for how we can win the race, whether it's on pace or strategy or whatever it may be. That's all going to be our plan tomorrow, and that's how I want to end the season—standing on top. So, nothing changes from that side.

Q: (Dzhastina Golopolosova - Momentum Racing) How much of tomorrow will be decided in the first few corners? And are you ready to take the maximum risk if needed? This question to all three drivers.

MV: All out. I have nothing to lose. So for me, of course, I'm going to try to win the race. I'm going to defend. If I need to attack, I'll attack, because what can happen? You're either second or third – or you win. That would be fantastic.

LN: I mean, it's not something you decide now, honestly. It's something that you'll see and decide before the start of the race and five metre s before you brake into Turn 1. Until then, I think everyone just wants to get the maximum out of it for themselves.

OP: Yeah. I mean, from where I'm sat, I need things to happen in the race to win the championship. So, I'll wait and see if those things happen.

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

Fresh from confirmation of his F1 promotion for 2026, Arvid Lindblad took the F2 Sprint Race victory in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Arvid Lindblad led this weekend's Sprint Race in Abu Dhabi from start to finish, but the Campos Racing driver was made to work for his victory by Joshua Duerksen.

The 2026 Formula 1-bound driver was in strong form on Saturday evening, fending off his AIX Racing rival's late-race charge to seal his third win of the season.

Duerksen's second place finish means he has five podiums in the last four rounds, while Nikola Tsolov made it a Campos 1-3, taking his first Formula 2 podium in P3.

Hitech TGR driver Dino Beganovic charged from seventh on the grid to finish fourth, ahead of MP Motorsport's Oliver Goethe in fifth.

Aston Martin Driver Development Programme member Jak Crawford continued his strong weekend, going from ninth to sixth.

ART Grand Prix Victor Martins finished seventh, while Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne took the final point of the race in P8.

Invicta Racing's Roman Stanek, who finished 10th, will start Sunday's Feature Race from pole, with Crawford joining him on the front and his team mate Leonardo Fornaroli in third.

That race gets under way at 1315 local time on Sunday, but until it takes place, you can read a full report of today's FIA Formula 2 Sprint Race on the official championship website.

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

George Russell topped the timesheets for Mercedes during an eventful third and final practice hour at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

George Russell set the pace during the third and final practice hour of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, a session that was briefly interrupted following a crash for Lewis Hamilton.

The Mercedes man lead the way on a 1m 23.334s, a mere 0.004s ahead of championship leader Lando Norris in second. Norris' title rival Max Verstappen put his Red Bull in third place, ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso in fourth and the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri completing the top five.

In an eventful final practice of the weekend – and the season – the red flags were thrown when Hamilton spun off into the barriers at just over halfway through the hour, bringing the Ferrari man's outing to an early end.

Meanwhile there was a collision between Kimi Antonelli and Yuki Tsunoda in the pit lane during the latter stages of the session when the former was released into the path of the Red Bull, a clash that will be investigated after the session for an unsafe release.

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

GHOST CAR: How Verstappen made the difference to beat Norris to pole in Abu Dhabi

It was another difficult day for Lewis Hamilton in Abu Dhabi, with Charles Leclerc continuing to lead the Ferrari charge.

Lewis Hamilton was left to rue a third successive Q1 elimination on Saturday night, with the Ferrari driver narrowly failing to make it over the first Qualifying hurdle in Abu Dhabi.

Hamilton, who also dropped out in the opening phase in Las Vegas and Qatar, missed the Q2 cut by a few hundredths of a second after an encouraging final lap came undone in the final sector.

He now faces the prospect of a 16th-place start at the Yas Marina Circuit, and was at a loss for words when he arrived in the media pen to speak to the world's broadcasters and journalists.

“I think most of the lap was good enough to get through, I just didn't finish it,” he sighed, having also apologised to the team over the radio on his way back to the pits.

Hamilton's tricky session came after a crash in final practice, and the seven-time World Champion added: “The team did a mega job [to repair the car]. They deserve better, for sure.”

On the other side of the Ferrari garage, Charles Leclerc managed to drag his car into the final Q3 segment and secure fifth on the grid, having made “massive” set-up changes after Friday practice in a bid to find more pace.

“I'm very pleased with P5,” he said. “It's a shame to be pleased with P5, but that's all we had today. I'm satisfied with the performance of today and the laps in Q3.

“I just hope that next year we'll start on the right foot, and we'll be back winning races, because that's all I want.

“Let's say if we look only at this weekend, it's been a good recovery from the team. We've changed massively the car from FP2 to FP3, took a huge risk, and it paid off, because we probably would have been P9, something around that, if we didn't change the car.”

Asked about his outlook for Sunday's race, with the three title contenders starting just ahead of him, Leclerc signed off: “I don't know. Surely, I will take massive risks tomorrow and try and be on the podium for the last race – that's all that matters to me.

“Of course, there's a title fight, but on my side the only thing I'm looking at is what can I do for Ferrari, and that is trying to maximise tomorrow's result no matter who I fight. That will be my mentality going into tomorrow.”

The 20-year-old rapper announced the news in an Instagram post: “I was born and perceived as female, but that label never represented who I truly am. I live in a way that feels more masculine and true to who I am.”

	Cocona, a member of the global hip-hop and R&B-inspired group XG, has come out as transmasculine and nonbinary. 


	The 20-year-old announced the news in a birthday Instagram post on the group's account. “Today, I turned 20. As I reach this new chapter in my life, I want to share something that's been in my heart for a long time,” Cocona said in the statement. “I am AFAB transmasculine non-binary. Earlier this year, I had top surgery.” 




	The statement continues: “I was born and perceived as female, but that label never represented who I truly am. I live in a way that feels more masculine and true to who I am. The hardest thing I've ever faced was accepting and embracing myself. But as I slowly began to do that, I was able to open a new door. That moment changed the way I see and understand the world, and it gave me the courage and strength to grow. Now, I can finally say, ‘There's nothing wrong with who I am inside.'”

	The rapper said the other members of XG, the group's producer and label CEO Simon Jakops and their parents are the reason they were “able to come this far.” Cocona also noted in the statement that they are grateful “for every miracle that brought us together” and what led them to the path they're on.

	“This message turned out a bit long, but I just want to say thank you — for walking beside me and for supporting me all this way,” the rapper said to wrap up the statement. “I'm so excited for the future we'll continue to create together with XG and XGALX [the group's label].”

In a joint Instagram post with the Committee for the First Amendment, the two-time Oscar winner called the sale ""destructive."" 


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


Jane Fonda is weighing in on Netflix‘s $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros.


	On Friday evening, Fonda took to Instagram in a joint post with the Committee for the First Amendment. The statement called the news of the deal “an alarming escalation of the consolidation that threatens the entire entertainment industry, the democratic public it serves and the first amendment.” 




	The statement continued, “Make no mistake, this is not just a catastrophic business deal that could destroy our creative industry. It is a constitutional crisis exacerbated by the administration's demonstrated disregard for the law.”

	The two-time Oscar winner then addressed the Department of Justice. “We demand that you categorically refrain from using that power to extract political concessions that influence content decisions or chill free speech,” the post reads in part. 


	Fonda's statement also called out Netflix and other companies that may become involved in the “destructive” deal. “As stewards of an industry built on free expression, you have a responsibility to defend our rights, not trade them away to pad your pockets. We know there will be enormous pressure to acquiesce, it is critical you stay strong,” she added.” 


	With Netflix purchasing Warner Bros., the deal would give the streamer control of Warner Bros.' film and TV studios, as well as HBO and HBO Max, and is subject to regulatory conditions. “By combining Warner Bros.' incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends — with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-CEO and former chief content officer, said in a Friday morning press release. “Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”

	











	According to the same statement, the company “expects” to continue releasing Warner Bros. films theatrically.

	“Big guy with your big f–kin' beach ball,” Manson said from the stage. “What a f–kin' douchebag… You're a f–kin' middle-aged man in a f–kin' ridiculous hat, and you're a f–kin' f–kface. I want, literally, to ask people to f–kin' punch you in the f–kin' face. But you know what? I'm a lady, so I won't.”

	While the comments sparked a wave of viral discussion online, Manson later doubled down on her stance in a statement posted to Threads, where she clarified her long-standing distaste for beach balls at shows and broader frustration with how some fans treat live music spaces.


	“I make NO APOLOGIES whatsoever for getting annoyed at beach balls at shows,” she wrote. “I joined a band because I HATED THE F–KING BEACH. I joined a band because I wanted to listen to Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Cure and be dark and beautiful.” 


	She continued, “I love the musical community and I want to respect their artistry. I am so tired of folks taking music for free and treating us all like circus performers.”


	The Scottish alt-rock icon and her bandmates — who last toured Australia in 2016 — are currently performing across the country as part of Good Things Festival, with additional sold-out sideshows in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. 

	











	Their setlist includes fan favourites like “Only Happy When It Rains,” “Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),” “Stupid Girl” and “When I Grow Up,” alongside material from their 2021 LP No Gods No Masters and 2023's Let All That We Imagine Be The Light.


	The band is scheduled to perform next in Sydney (Dec. 6) and Brisbane (Dec. 7), before kicking off their headline run.

""Now, I can finally say, 'There's nothing wrong with who I am inside,'"" Cocona said.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



XG member Cocona has publicly come out as transmasculine non-binary, sharing a heartfelt letter with fans in honor of their 20th birthday. 


	The rapper, vocalist, and performer from the Japanese girl group posted an emotional statement on Instagram on Saturday (Dec. 6) reflecting on identity, growth, and self-acceptance.


	“Today, I turned 20,” Cocona wrote. “As I reach this new chapter in my life, I want to share something that's been in my heart for a long time. I am AFAB transmasculine non-binary. Earlier this year, I had top surgery. I was born and perceived as female, but that label never represented who I truly am.”

	Cocona continued, “The hardest thing I've ever faced was accepting and embracing myself… Now, I can finally say, ‘There's nothing wrong with who I am inside.'” The performer also expressed gratitude toward their XG bandmates, XGALX founder and producer Simon (Jakops), and their parents, adding that their support helped make the journey possible.


	The message quickly drew an outpouring of love and praise from fans, with XG supporters and members of the LGBTQIA+ community celebrating Cocona's honesty. The post, which included emoji symbols of unity and infinity, ended with the words: “May these words gently light a spark in someone's heart. And to everyone who needs it — may my love reach all of them.”


	Shortly after, XGALX CEO and artistic director Simon (Jakops) shared his own statement on Instagram, expressing respect and support for Cocona. “I am deeply moved and filled with respect as Cocona courageously shared their passion with the world,” he wrote. “I will continue to provide sincere support so that each member can be truly respected not only as a ‘working artist' but also as a person.”

	











	Simon reflected on the group's journey together — noting that all members have now reached adulthood — and reaffirmed that XG's mission goes beyond music and visuals, aiming to share “the pure and essential heart of each member” with fans around the world.


	Since debuting under XGALX in 2022, XG has earned international recognition for their polished performance style, multilingual lyrics, and message of female empowerment. Cocona's coming-out marks a significant and visible moment for LGBTQ+ representation within the global pop landscape — particularly in the Japanese and Korean entertainment industries, where conversations around gender identity continue to evolve.

The Diplomats lost a Verzuz battle to the LOX back in 2021.


													By
												

	Angel Diaz



Cam'ron is having second thoughts about taking part in the Verzuz battle between the Diplomats and the LOX.


	During a recent episode of It Is What It Is, Cam, Ma$e, Maurice Clarett and host Treasure “Stat Baby” Wilson were discussing Lane Kiffin's controversial decision to leave No. 6 Ole Miss as they get ready for the College Football Playoffs for SEC rival LSU and Stat Baby asked the panel if they ever had a tough decision to make. When it was Cam's turn to answer the question, he brought up the Verzuz from 2021 where Dipset lost to the group out of Yonkers.


	“I can name a lot of decisions that wasn't good 'cause I was trying to be a team player,” Cam'ron answered. “I should've never did the Verzuz, I told n—as, ‘Don't do the Verzuz.' I told n—as, ‘I don't wanna do the Verzuz.' But I'm a team player and it was the wrong decision that I made. No more of that, no more of that, no more of that.”

	











	He later added: “I tried to be team player a lot of times and that's the first thing that came to my brain when you said, ‘Wrong decisions.” It was the wrong decision.”




	Led by Jadakiss, the LOX famously beat the Harlem group consisting of Cam, Jim Jones, Juelz Santana and Freekey Zekey at The Theater at Madison Square Garden, with Kiss' “Who Shot Ya?” freestyle being the knockout blow.

Film Editor, Awards


	The Best International Feature Film category is never short on surprises, and 2025 has no shortage of firsts. Of the 86 submissions deemed to be eligible by AMPAS, several were debut features — including Diego Céspedes' Chilean title The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingos — and two countries entering the fray for the first time ever: Madagascar and Papua New Guinea. Poised to make history is the Iraqi selection The President's Cake, which won two prestigious awards in Cannes (the Directors' Fortnight Audience Award and the Camera d'Or). If it makes the Oscar shortlist, it will be the first of 14 films that the Middle Eastern country has selected since 2005.

	











	A total of 14 submissions will take part in today's Contenders Film: International, Deadline's annual virtual panel showcase, which begins at 9 a.m. PT.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Many of the titles in display this year will be familiar to those tracking the major film festivals — Sundance, Berlin, Cannes, Venice, Toronto and San Sebastián all continue to dominate the space — but if you aren't au fait with the byzantine world of accreditation apartheid and lanyards, Deadline is here to help. Like many of the people in the movies we've chosen, you're about to go on a journey of discovery, as we speak to the films' stars, directors, producers and screenwriters to find out what makes their movies so special.


	Representing Poland, Agnieszka Holland presents the playful Franz, a biography of the tragically short-lived Czech writer whose surreal bureaucratic nightmares gave rise to the descriptor “Kafka-esque.” From Switzerland comes Late Shift by Petra Volpe, the kinetic, almost real-time study of an overworked nurse dealing with more than she can handle. And Iraq's Hasan Hadi serves up President's Cake, a 1990s-set drama in which a young girl is forced into celebrating Saddam Hussein's birthday.


Father, by Tereza Nvotová, features the powerful story of a Slovakian parent who accidentally leaves his infant daughter in the back of his car on a boiling-hot day. Shai Carmeli-Pollak's The Sea represents Israel with its timely story of a young Palestinian boy making his way to the seaside through a largely hostile country. And from Argentina comes the moving political drama Belén, directed by and starring Dolores Fonzi, which highlights a scandal from 2014 that saw an innocent woman wrongly imprisoned for murder after suffering a miscarriage.

	











	There's an unexpectedly poignant tone to Anselm Chan's The Last Dance, an intimate odd-couple story from Hong Kong in which a down-at-heel wedding arranger faces pushback when he decides to become a funeral director. Bigger in scope is All That's Left of You from Jordan, in which Cherien Dabis tells a very personal story spanning three generations of a Palestine family displaced from their homeland in 1948. After that, for a little light relief, South Korea's Park Chan-wook reteams with star Lee Byung-hun for No Other Choice, a murderously funny satire about the effects of downsizing.


	In Cape Town, a father makes a terrible mistake in South African writer-director Imran Hamdulay's The Heart Is a Muscle, while Urška Djukić deals with a teenage girl's coming of age in the Slovenia drama Little Trouble Girls. True crime and far-right politics merge in Francesco Costabile's Familia from Italy, and a rare comedy comes from Finland in Teemu Nikki's 100 Liters of Gold, about two sisters who accidentally get high on their own supply of homebrew. Finally, we have Céspedes' Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo from Chile, a child's-eye tale of acceptance and loss set in the early 1980s.


	Follow along with Contenders all day on Deadline.com and on our social channels via #DeadlineContenders. Check back Monday when we launch the event's streaming site featuring all the panel videos.

	Months after her American Eagle campaign sparked backlash, Sydney Sweeney is addressing the fallout around the ad's public perception.


	The 2x Emmy nominee recently said she “was honestly surprised by the reaction” to her ‘Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans‘ campaign, which drew controversy and accusations of veiled racism upon its release in July over the use of “jeans” as a double entendre for “genes.”


	“I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand,” Sweeney told People. “I don't support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign. Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren't true.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Sweeney explained that she “leads with kindness” and felt the need to clarify her stance following a recent interview question on the topic that went viral for her response.


	“Anyone who knows me knows that I'm always trying to bring people together. I'm against hate and divisiveness. In the past my stance has been to never respond to negative or positive press but recently I have come to realize that my silence regarding this issue has only widened the divide, not closed it,” added Sweeney. “So I hope this new year brings more focus on what connects us instead of what divides us.”


	Following Sweeney's controversial blue jeans ad, which appeared to be a nod to Brooke Shields' infamous 1980 Calvin Klein campaign, American Eagle brushed off the backlash in a statement that the ad “is and always was about the jeans.” Meanwhile, Donald Trump endorsed the ad, saying, “If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”

crazy people abound here

This is the statement she should have made after the ad came out, not months later.

She shouldn't have acknowledged it at all.

how can you be against hate and support trump and his admin?

She's a non-political actress who's never said anything inflammatory and was just hired to be in an ad for jeans. This hate train is getting ridiculous.

Commenters are the reason this “controversy” even exists

	Around 24 hours after Netflix came to a $83 billion deal to buy Warner Bros‘ TV and film studios, streamer HBO Max and HBO, the Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters-run streamer has sent a note to its over 82 million U.S. subscribers telling them “nothing is changing.”


	In fact, in links from a four-paragraph email from the “Netflix team” about the NetBros merger, the phrase “nothing is changing” comes up again and again. What also comes up when it comes to Netflix and HBO Max is  “both streaming services will continue to operate separately,” the correspondence assures subscribers.

	Rest assured: Despite all the money and the media landscape earthquake, the number #1 streamer in America and the number #3 streamer in America will continue to operate separately. At least for now.

Read the full Netflix letter to US subscribers below


	Answering the pre-designated question “what if I already have an HBO Max subscription, should I cancel?” Netflix says on its Help Page that “Netflix and Warner Bros. will remain separate until the transaction is closed.”


	In the victory lap “Welcoming Warner Bros to Netflix” missive, the streamer also says: “We have more steps to complete before the deal is closed, including regulatory and shareholder approvals. You'll hear from us when we have more to share.”


	Coming off a big day of understatements in optimistic CEO memos and meetings, a Warner Bros Discovery town hall, reactions (not a lot of Atta Boys, if you know what I mean?) and more, that low volume “regulatory and shareholder approvals” make take top prize. The reality is there is a minefield of such obstacles to come before this is truly a done deal and the quote, un quote “transaction is closed.” 


	On a  rudimentary friends-in-high-places level, there's more than likely the Paramount and Ellisons-loving President of the United States and the federal Department of Justice standing in the way. Then there's the EU and more than a handful of 50 state Attorney Generals. Ellison very strongly implied in correspondence this week before the Netflix/WB deal was unveiled, that there's the possibility of a Paramount lawsuit. Around town, word is that perhaps there's also an overbid coming from Paramount and its Middle East fund pals to snuff out the $28 per share offer from Netflix. 

	











	All TBD.


	As it is Netflix late Friday was gleeful about having “Harry Potter, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Casablanca, Game of Thrones and the DC Universe together with Stranger Things, Wednesday, Squid Game, Bridgerton and KPop Demon.”


	On the other side, the opposition to NetBros certainly has already resulted in some strange bedfellows.


	What else can you think of that seems to unite Donald Trump (who frequently heaps praise on Paramount CEO David Ellison and his Oracle founding/second richest man on the planet father Larry Ellison), Sen. Bernie Sanders. Then add to that Jane Fonda and the Hollywood unions, to name a few. For now, it's a unity for very different reasons, it might be noted.


	As would-be monopoly buster Sen. Sanders made obvious .


	Accusing Netflix of “swallowing” the jewels in the WBD crown, the progressive kingpin and two-time unsuccessful Democratic nomination contender from Vermont rallied in a post today:

Of course nothing is changing “today.” TOMORROW on the other hand…

How will it eventually work? Netflix premium is $25, HBO MAX is $23… when they combine are they going to charge $50? Isn't it better to just keep them seperate…

What happening, do they think everyone will run out and buy Netflix subs or HBO subs when the deal is done? no “Nothing Will Happen” just people ending subs because they're not worth the money

It's funny people think Netflix and Warner will completely merge after 1 day loll,. Nothing is happening until Discovery splits into its own thing again in quarter 3 next year,. That has to happen first, which was the plan before selling Warner Bros,. But to think you need to cancel HBO Max 1 day after the deal is done, is mind boggling, Netflix bought them yes, but it takes awhile for it to be completed,. It'll be at least a year before any changes happen,. Then you have all the other stuff that needs to be done,.

I'm amused that everyone warmly welcomed the grotesquely incompetent Zaslav as a conquering hero after assailing the exceptionally skilled Kilar. Now, many of the same people are dismissing Netflix's Warner Bros. at the jump. Maybe we just trust the best-run media company in the business to do its thing? Just a thought.

You are naive.

Everyone did not warmly welcome Zaslav

Kilar was horrible, he ran Warner Bros into the ground!!

	As Hollywood reels from the historical, industry-shaking $82.7B Netflix-Warner Bros. deal, Jane Fonda is urging the Department of Justice not to bow to pressure.


	On Friday, the 2x Oscar winner, who starred in Netflix‘s Grace & Frankie, condemned the “catastrophic” acquisition as a “constitutional crisis” in a statement on behalf of her newly-revived Committee for the First Amendment, noting that they are “ready to mobilize” against the deal.


	“To the Justice Department and state attorneys general: We know this deal — or any deal of this magnitude — will trigger your antitrust review obligation, and we demand that you categorically refrain from using that power to extract political concessions that influence content decisions or chill free speech,” she said in part.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix is purchasing Warner Bros. Discovery for $27.75 a share, acquiring WB's film and TV studios HBO and HBO Max. The deal is subject to regulatory conditions.


	Amid Jimmy Kimmel Live‘s recent row with the FCC, Jane Fonda relaunched her father Henry Fonda's McCarthy-era committee in October with the support of 550 industry figures.


	Read Jane Fonda and the Committee for the First Amendment's full statement below:

Today's news that Warner Bros. Discovery has accepted a purchase bid is an alarming escalation of the consolidation that threatens the entire entertainment industry, the democratic public it serves, and the First Amendment itself.Make no mistake, this is not just a catastrophic business deal that could destroy our creative industry. It is a constitutional crisis exacerbated by the administration's demonstrated disregard for the law. To the Justice Department and state attorneys general: We know this deal — or any deal of this magnitude — will trigger your antitrust review obligation, and we demand that you categorically refrain from using that power to extract political concessions that influence content decisions or chill free speech.To Netflix and any company that becomes involved in this destructive deal: We have watched industry leaders acquiesce to the administration's demands at the expense of our livelihoods, our storytelling, and our constitutional rights. As stewards of an industry built on free expression, you have a responsibility to defend our rights, not trade them away to pad your pockets. We know there will be enormous pressure to acquiesce, it is critical you stay strong. We are watching closely, organizing, and ready to mobilize.

It was very brave of her to say shes giving all of her netflix millions back in protest. /S

So… she'd rather the sale go to Paramount, who ALREADY “acquiesced to the adminstrations's demands”? Classic.

No.  She doesn't want the buyout at all.  I agree, that would be better.  Warner was fine, and they had a plan forward to spinoff the majority of their debt with the linear networks.  Paramount created this issue.  By talking about buying WBD, they caused the stock price to increase more than 100%.  If Warner didn't sell, the stock would drop and investors would be unhappy.  It would also likely have brought about a hostile takeover effort from Paramount.  If Warner sold for less than Paramount's offer, that would cause lawsuits against Warner from investors for failure in their fiduciary responsibilities to take the best offer (which is still being threatened now, though easily arguably without merit).  If Netflix is willing to let Warner operate for the most part unchanged, they can actually be the hero here.  I know that's wishful thinking.  If the deal falls apart in a couple of years through regulators and courts intervening, Warner streaming and studios component can come out of this a stronger company without the linear networks and debt and would then be less vulnerable to advances from Paramount or anyone else.

She did? I must have missed that part of the article.

Understandable she'd put a bad face on this.

Boy do we need the return of The Committee for the First Amendment NOW more than ever! Great to hear about. I know history and the timing for this is critical for everyone being targeted and/or silenced!

Dakota Johnson dazzled in a sheer white lace gown as she attended the Red Sea International Film Festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The “Materialists” star flaunted her Chloé dress as she posed for photos on the red carpet for the festival's Women in Cinema event Friday night.

Johnson, 36, kept her look somewhat conservative as the dress featured a large lace ruffle skirt around her pelvic area.

Though, she still managed to show plenty of legs and skin on the upper half of her body.

She completed her look with a pair of white heels from Paris Texas and Chopard jewelry. 

Johnson and her longtime stylist, Kate Young, have been known to have a certain affinity for sheer looks.

In September, the “Splitsville” star sizzled in a custom blue sheer gown that left little to the imagination as she attended the Zurich Film Festival.

The dress featured a high neck, long sleeves, a low Basque-style waistline and a dramatic full-length skirt of layered tulle.

She accessorized with several pieces of Roberto Coin jewelry, including diamond and sapphire earrings, a diamond, emerald and tanzanite ring and a sapphire and diamond ring.

Weeks prior, she turned heads at the Kering Foundation's Caring for Women Dinner in a completely sheer Gucci dress. 

The intricate black lace dress featured a high neckline. long sleeves, and delicate floral embroidery. She covered her intimate parts underneath with a black balconette bra ($128) and cheeky underwear ($52) by Fleur du Mal.

She finished her look with a pair of strappy black high-heeled sandals and several diamond and emerald jewelry pieces designed by Jessica McCormack. 

In February 2024, she stunned at Marvel's “Madame Web” premiere in a custom Gucci see-through chainmail dress.

She let the dress take center stage as she paired the ensemble with skin-colored underwear and a simple glittering necklace.

Lauren Sánchez turned heads in a luxurious leather coat minidress that retails for nearly $10,000 for her date night with her husband, Jeff Bezos.

The newlyweds were photographed stepping out at Bird Streets Club in Los Angeles on Friday night.

The popular Alaïa Edition structured coat ($9,970) — which features an asymmetrical zipper and an oversized shearling collar and cuffs — hugged the former journalist's curves, giving her ample figure as she braved the chilly December weather.

She paired the dress with sheer black tights and thigh-high black high-heeled boots. 

For the accessories, Sánchez, 55, kept things light with a Chloé small Paddington leather shoulder bag ($2,290) and a pair of dark shades.

She also sported some dainty diamond earrings and a small silver necklace. 

The Amazon billionaire, 61, stood by his wife's side in an all-black ensemble, featuring his signature black T-shirt and matching pants.

Bezos was photographed holding Sánchez's hand as they exited the venue and made their way to their awaiting ride.

Sánchez isn't the only star who's been seen in the widely coveted coat. It seems one of her Kardashian-Jenner friends found the piece before her.

In 2022, Kylie Jenner made headlines when she also wore the vintage 1987 Alaïa piece as a minidress during her trip to Aspen.

At the time, the reality star styled the look with a beige turtleneck, sheer tights and knee-high black leather boots.

Jenner, 28, completed the outfit with black shades and gloves, a furry black bucket hat and a structural pyramid bag.

The Kylie Cosmetics founder attended Bezos and Sánchez's star-studded Italian wedding in June alongside the rest of her famous family, including sisters Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian, and their mom, Kris Jenner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Vanity Fair consciously decouples itself from this whole Olivia Nuzzi mess","https://www.avclub.com/vanity-fair-parts-ways-olivia-nuzzi-kennedy","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 01:40:00 GMT","

In a move that no one could have anticipated without, at bare minimum, the possession of an extremely rudimentary brainstem, Vanity Fair has announced today that it's “parting ways” with reporter Olivia Nuzzi. In a mutually released statement with the high-profile journalist/cause of journalism in others, the Condé Nast publication said that it was “in the best interest of the magazine to let her contract expire at the end of the year.”

What the statement did not say was all the very obvious stuff about Nuzzi's recent work as the magazine's West Coast Editor—a job she's currently held for all of three months—i.e., that it's been completely, massively overshadowed by drama in her personal life, and specifically her widely reported “personal relationship” with current Secretary Of Health And Human Services Robert F. Kennedy. That “emotional and digital in nature” affair, with a subject she'd been covering as a reporter, already lead Nuzzi's previous employer, New York magazine, to “part ways” with her back in 2024. (There is a lot of parting ways in this story; the ways, they are a-partin'.) But Vanity Fair‘s editors presumably thought that the Kennedy thing was very literally old news; that the story had been aired out enough to transform it from a huge question of journalistic ethics and judgment into an amusing anecdote about a harmless moral whoopsie of the past.

But that was before Nuzzi's ex, former New Yorker and Politico correspondent Ryan Lizza, began publishing Substack articles a few weeks ago claiming that Nuzzi's relationship with Kennedy went a lot deeper than whatever the hell “emotional and digital in nature” covers, and that she'd also been operating essentially as an operative for the Kennedy political campaign—most damningly with an accusation that she'd been running “catch and kill” operations to stop negative stories about Kennedy from being published. (It's worth noting, if only in passing, that Lizza is a complicated figure here in his own right, having been dismissed from The New Yorker back in 2017 after a #MeToo allegation; for what it's worth, Nuzzi has denounced his series of recent writings about her as “obsessive and violating fan fiction-slash-revenge porn.”) The point is that Lizza's allegations have been sticking in people's brains—including, apparently, the sort of people who have sway at Vanity Fair.

The upshot is that the whole preceding two paragraphs, obviously, constitute way more drama than the magazine was clearly hoping for when it hired Nuzzi as part of a big, flashy rebranding effort back in September. (Even if the whole thing carries an air of a frog being righteously indignant that it now has to “part ways” with the scorpion that jammed a venomous stinger through its neck two minutes into their trip across the river.) Nuzzi, presumably, will be fine: News of the parting of the ways comes just three days after the publication of her new memoir, American Canto, in which she apparently writes quite a bit about her relationship with a figure identified only as… The Politician. At least one highly negative review has already drubbed the book as a “tell-nothing memoir” that also serves as a handy “portrait of losing your soul”—but we're guessing that isn't actually going to hurt book sales too badly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","YouTube might try to snag The Oscars for itself","https://www.avclub.com/youtube-wants-the-oscars","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 03:47:00 GMT","

It's been a very weird week for New Media organizations attempting to shove Old Media institutions down their gullets, with most of the oxygen in that particular space being taken up by Netflix's ambitious, and now apparently very real, plans to buy Warner Bros. Discovery for itself. But it's not the only story, as Variety reports this week on an unlikely contender in a brewing battle to see who the next long-term broadcast host for The Oscars might end up being: YouTube.

See, it's getting close to when the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences has to work out a new broadcast contract for its annual Academy Awards, as the current one (with ABC, and which will carry the ceremony through its 100th anniversary) wraps up in 2028. Early reports that Netflix and CBS might be interested in the fight have now faded, but it's left what are apparently three serious contenders in place: ABC, which has hosted the Oscars for the vast majority of its television history; NBCUniversal, whose NBC was the first network to ever broadcast the event, and which would love to jam the Oscars together with its 2028 Los Angeles Olympics coverage; and the Google-owned online video service, YouTube. Which, as Variety‘s analysis points out, already profits pretty heavily from the yearly event, because basically any time anything actually interesting happens during the show, the whole country ditches the host network and races to YouTube's servers to see the clip. So why not make it a formal arrangement?

(It's worth noting that last year marked the first-ever online broadcast of the show, as Disney's Hulu ran the event parallel with ABC. Meanwhile, Disney inadvertently underscored what a huge presence YouTube has become in TV earlier this year when it got into that big, ugly carriage fight with the service.)

Per the prevailing analysis, the final winner in the competition is going to be determined on strictly economic lines, i.e., “Who's willing to hand over the biggest stack of cash for the honor?” Sources quoted in the Variety piece state that ABC spends about $120 million per year on the Oscars, which is the kind of number we don't really like to look at head-on, lest life-threatening shock set in. But it's also true that the show's ratings are not what they used to be; after steadily dropping in the 2010s, they crashed and burned during the pandemic lockdowns, and have only risen back slowly in the years since. (Notably, they actually dipped a bit with this year's show, suggesting we might have hit a plateau.) All three “actively interested” parties in the bidding are well aware of those numbers, and are apparently extremely leery of over-paying for the annual spectacle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The WGA is not a fan of Netflix ""swallowing"" WBD","https://www.avclub.com/unions-react-netflix-warner-bros-discovery-acquistion","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 01:13:00 GMT","

In perhaps the most unsurprising joint statement of the day, both branches of the Writers Guild of America, the WGA East and WGA West, have denounced Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. In fact, they believe that this is what “antitrust laws were designed to prevent.” Arguing that Netflix's “swallowing” of Warner Bros., HBO, and HBO Max would harm all entertainment workers, the unions call on the merger to be blocked. Here's the unions' complete statement:

“The world's largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent. The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers. Industry workers along with the public are already impacted by only a few powerful companies maintaining tight control over what consumers can watch on television, on streaming, and in theaters. This merger must be blocked.”

Other unions have been a little softer on the deal. While the Teamsters are clear on their “position that greed-fueled consolidation of corporate power” is a threat to union jobs, the Directors Guild of America is waiting for more information before forming an opinion. “We will be meeting with Netflix to outline our concerns and better understand their vision for the future of the company,” a DGA spokesperson told Deadline. The Producers Guild of America was similarly in let's-hear-em-out mode, stating that it was “rightfully concerned” about the acquisition. In a statement, the guild said, “As we navigate dynamic times of economic and technological change, our industry, together with policymakers, must find a way forward that protects producers' livelihoods and real theatrical distribution, and that fosters creativity, promotes opportunities for workers and artists, empowers consumers with choices, and upholds freedom of speech. This is the test that the Netflix deal must pass.”

As for SAG-AFTRA, it pointed out that the deal “reaffirms the true value of legacy media companies” and that an agreement “must result in more creation and more production.”

“The potential Netflix/Warner Bros transaction is a consolidation that may serve the financial interests of shareholders of both companies, but which raises many serious questions about its impact on the future of the entertainment industry, and especially the human creative talent whose livelihoods and careers depend on it,” SAG said in a statement. “This $82B transaction reaffirms the true value of legacy media companies and the long-term economic prosperity they create due in large part to the contribution of the creative talent who are at the core of their success. A deal that is in the interest of SAG-AFTRA members and all other workers in the entertainment industry must result in more creation and more production, not less. It must do so in an environment of respect for the talent involved. Any decision about SAG-AFTRA's position on this transaction will be made with the best interests of SAG-AFTRA members as the standard and following a complete and thorough analysis of the details of the deal, with particular focus on jobs and production commitments.”

The acquisition still isn't a done deal, with regulatory hurdles in both the U.S. and Europe blocking an immediate sale. There's also the Trump administration, which reportedly views the acquisition with “heavy skepticism.” Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren put it bluntly, “This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare.”

“A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said in a statement. “Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,” Warren said. “The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.”

Longtime HGTV star Mike Holmes and his family are grieving the loss of their friend and co-star, electrical expert Frank Cozzolino, who appeared on their shows for over two decades. On December 5, 2025, Holmes posted photos on social media of himself with Cozzolino, writing that he was “devastated by the passing of my good friend.” 

“Frank made us better,” Holmes wrote in a beautiful tribute. “His impact will live on in every home he helped. Frank could walk into the toughest electrical disaster, crack a joke in his style, and suddenly the whole room felt lighter. That's just who he was. Frank wasn't just good at what he did — he really cared. He cared about doing it right. He cared about the people he worked with. He cared about every homeowner he helped. Frank will forever be part of the Holmes family. Miss you buddy.” 

Cozzolino, a Canadian contractor who ran his own business, Solutions Electrical & Maintenance, had appeared on Holmes' home renovation series since 2003, per IMDb, including dozens of episodes of “Holmes on Holmes” and “Holmes Family Rescue,” as recently as 2024.  

On the morning of December 5, an administrator for his company's Facebook page wrote in a post, “Good morning, Some may have seen a post about some sad news. Unfortunately, it is true, Frank Cozzolino did pass away last night. This page will be converted to ‘In memory of Frank'”

A cause of death was not provided, but Cozzolino did undergo a liver transplant in August 2017. He shared on Instagram at the time, “In 2012 I was told I would not live past 5 years with my liver. On August 24th 2017 I was given a second chance at life. I am forever thankful and blessed that Organ Donation exists.”

Holmes and his kids — HGTV's Sherry Holmes and Mike Holmes Jr. — were close friends with Cozzolino, whose Instagram feed includes photos of them at birthday parties, boating, and even before Sherry's wedding in 2018. 

Holmes Jr. expressed his sadness over Cozzolino's death in a post after his dad did, writing, “Rest in peace Frank. You were a fighter. It's hard to believe you're gone. You were one of a kind.”

Fans have flooded social media with comments on Holmes and Holmes Jr.'s posts including one who wrote. “Sad to hear this. Frank was awesome to watch. Condolences to his family and yours.”

Another wrote, “Very sad to hear. Hell of an electrician and teacher to many. Enjoyed watching him on TV explain the correct way to do things. Rest easy Frank! Prayers for his family and friends!”

One fan wrote on Holmes' post, “Aww, so sorry for your loss. 😞 I only know him from watching your show and he seemed like a very stand up wonderful man.”

On Facebook, a post from Trimbow Window Manufacturing said that Cozzolino is survived by two daughters. The post said, “It's sad to hear about the passing of our friend Frank Cozzolino. It was a privilege and pleasure to work alongside him on all Holmes projects, making it right for so many deserving people. He was a gentle, kind, passionate and caring person. Our condolences to his daughters Alexandria and Filomena. Rest In Peace, Frank.”

In November, Holmes let HGTV fans know that a new season of “Holmes Family Rescue” will air in 2026. It's not known if Cozzolino filmed any of those episodes. 

So sorry to hear of his passing. He only mentions his daughters, did his wife died? They were both there when Mike renovated their home

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Miley Cyrus Reveals Her Rare Phobia — ‘It Is Impacting My Everyday Life'","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/miley-cyrus-paper-phobia/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 03:03:31 GMT","

Miley Cyrus may not be afraid to perform her music on a stage in front of countless people, but she does have one fear that happens to be pretty rare. The star has a phobia related to paper. To be exact, she has papyrophobia.

Revealing the fact during an interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Thursday, December 4, the singer revealed that her repulsion to paper is so bad that even seeing it makes her feel ill.

“I hate paper. Looking at it makes me want to vomit,” she said while noting the difficulty this presents when wrapping holiday gifts. She also revealed that she can't read a newspaper and has her fiancé, Maxx Morando, open Amazon packages for her so she doesn't have to touch the cardboard, which is “the worst of it all.”

She added, “The real problem for me is when people have dry hands, and then they touch paper.”

Beyond that, she explained, “When someone sends me a lovely letter, I just don't even open it. I love text messages. No paper. Email. No paper. Phone call. No paper.”

Noting that she's had the issue since she was a child, she said, “It's a phobia, and I need help. It's getting worse, so there does need to be some sort of intervention. I am going to look into some sort of EMDR [psychotherapy], being hypnotized about it because it is impacting my everyday life.”

When Cyrus's interview was shared on YouTube, plenty of people commented to say that they were surprised by the singer's unusual phobia. At the same time, there were others who related to her paper-related issue.

One person wrote, “My son had the same aversion to paper. He had a terrible time doing homework, especially after taking a shower in the evening. I've never heard of anyone else feeling like this.”

“The way she feels about paper, is how i feel about plastic tupperware,” another person added.

Someone else left a comment, saying, “I love how she's gags through half of this interview! Lmfao!! My best friend and I have misophonia which is the same thing with noises like eating chewing or even typing or clicking any noise that drives you NUTS!! I didn't know people had a PAPER-PHOBIA!!!”

If you know someone who suffers from papyrophobia, then you can let them know that what they have is quite unusual and can be addressed.

“It's hard knowing exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like papyrophobia, but it's rare,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. They also note that “[f]emales are more likely than males to experience a phobia disorder.”

The Cleveland Clinic also brought up hypnotherapy, which Cyrus mentioned her interest in, noting, “This therapy induces a hypnotic, trance-like state to help you uncover the root cause of the phobia. Most healthcare providers combine hypnotherapy with psychotherapy to help you address and overcome the fear.”

I have that with pancakes. I can't be with ear shot or nose shot of them. I gag and can't stop. If someone wants to go to restaurant for breakfast I have to tell can't have pancakes. Can't got to IHOP or Dennys I get ill!

8.0

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Spazio Disponibile

Reviewed:

December 6, 2025

The first Voices From the Lake album has taken on a mythical status, like a Selected Ambient Works 85-92 for the Berghain generation. Donato Dozzy and Neel, already masters of trippy, ambient-leaning techno (once called “headfuck techno”) on their own records, hit on some kind of flow state when they made their collaborative debut LP. This was a cerebral style of techno that sounded like it grew out of the forest floor, where rustling leaves and padding paws took the place of kick drums, and chords moved like swaying branches and trees. Since that album, as good a full-length as the genre has birthed, everything attached to the Voices From the Lake name—EPs, a live album, the occasional remix, celebrated live sets—has strengthened their reputation. With II, the duo finally sits down to create a follow-up that breathes the same rarefied air as its predecessor. It doesn't completely match up, but it comes damn close.

From the moment the low end rumbles to life on opener “Eos,” we're back in glorious terra cognita. The duo's bass tone alone is a thing of beauty, like a lightweight alloy that's been hollowed out: You can feel the sub in your chest, but it's never heavy, and the higher frequencies drive the mood and melody as much as the synth leads do. Bass is the duo's secret weapon, the sound that makes their music both propulsive and curiously still, laying down an earthy foundation that feels more organic than synthetic.

Though there's a naturalistic bent to the sounds on II—the percussion knocks like mischievous woodpeckers on the spacey, tranced-out “Montenero,” and there's a suggestion of birdsong in “Mono No Koto”—this is hardly tree-hugging new-age music. The new record is more rooted in deep, dark, dubby dance music, including a bassline on “Montero” that hits like the foreboding strains of amapiano currently played out by DJs like Mark Ernestus. Or the rippling darkwave synths on “Blue Noa,” which has a muscular runner's build, hard and lithe: Think Boy Harsher covering Nitzer Ebb for a late-'90s car commercial. With II, the musicians find new things to do with their chiffon basslines and pitter-patter drums, gently expanding the Voices From the Lake remit without venturing too far out of their enchanted forest.

But if you just want what they were dishing out in 2013, II has plenty of that, too. “Bespin” nails the humid atmospheres of the first record, and “Manuark” races forward but still floats, a track you could sneak into a peak-time DJ set to really make the dance floor bliss out. The most legendary Voices From the Lake cut is “Circe + S.T.,” which brought the original album to its transcendent peak about halfway through, and II has its own analog in “Aquate.” Its forceful bassline splits the difference between wonder and fear, an uncertain fork in the path, topped off with a sing-songy melody worthy of an Olof Dreijer record.

It can be hard to decide what to make of a sequel so faithful to the example set by its predecessor. It's more of the same, but when “the same” felt like divine intervention, shouldn't we be grateful? For me, the answer lies in “Ian,” the closing track, the third time on II that the duo hints towards something new. For all their music's beauty, Dozzy and Neel cloak their emotions with an arm's-length distance that lets you discern the shape of their feelings but not the actual substance. “Ian” holds no such punches, with a dizzy lead that sounds like someone snuck a Rhodes electric piano into their studio. It's unabashedly happy, with one of those indelible melodies that seems momentarily life-changing after a few too many hours on the dancefloor. But Voices From the Lake have always been good at making their music sound that way without any of that baggage: You don't need drugs, alcohol, or delirious exhaustion for it to feel profound. As anyone who's seen their renowned live sets can attest, it's still mythical, like it's beamed in from another world, even when it's happening right in front of you.

Sydney Sweeney has finally addressed the denim drama over her controversial American Eagle ad after months of avoiding the subject, saying in a new interview that she's “against hate and divisiveness.” 


	This past summer, the actress starred in American Eagle's “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” campaign. The pairing of Sweeney — who has blonde hair and blue eyes — with the tagline “has great jeans/genes” led some on the left to accuse the campaign of subtly dog-whistling eugenics and white supremacy, while the right — and even President Trump — applauded the ad.


	“I was honestly surprised by the reaction,” Sweeney told People in a new interview. “I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand. I don't support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign. Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren't true.”


	The ad campaign was widely mocked and scrutinized (by the left) or widely celebrated and defended (by the right), but Sweeney herself sat out much of the controversy, initially refusing to talk about it during press junkets for her movie and sidestepping questions in interviews. “I knew at the end of the day what that ad was for, and it was great jeans, it didn't affect me one way or the other,” Sweeney told GQ in November.

	However, speaking to People while promoting new film The Housemaid, Sweeney finally weighed on the controversy, recognizing “recently” that not speaking about the situation only made matters worse.

	











	“Anyone who knows me knows that I'm always trying to bring people together. I'm against hate and divisiveness,” Sweeney said. “In the past my stance has been to never respond to negative or positive press but recently I have come to realize that my silence regarding this issue has only widened the divide, not closed it. So I hope this new year brings more focus on what connects us instead of what divides us.”

	My grandfather Frank Gustaferro got the word at his uncle Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken, New Jersey. His orders said that he was to report to the SS John Barry departing in a few days. The ship, secretly carrying millions of silver coins to support wartime operations in Saudi Arabia, was torpedoed by the German submarine U-859 on August 28, 1944. Two crewmen died in the blast. The rest, including my grandfather, ended up in the water — temporarily blinded from oil, injured, terrified, clinging to whatever wreckage they could find. They heard Japanese aircraft overhead as they floated in the Indian Ocean. My grandfather braced for the strafing run he assumed was coming. It never came.


	Even in the brutal logic of total war, there were limits. A line existed — a line older than the Geneva Conventions, older than the United Nations, older even than the modern idea of “war crimes” itself. You did not kill shipwrecked men in the water. You did not kill survivors who were out of the fight. You did not shoot the wounded clinging to debris. My grandfather survived because even America's enemies in 1944 understood that basic rule of humanity.

	











	If Donald Trump‘s administration had been in charge that day, I'm not sure my family would exist. 


	The Department of Defense is facing intense scrutiny this week following a Washington Post report that the military — allegedly under orders from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth — conducted a second strike on a wrecked vessel in the Caribbean on September 2, killing defenseless survivors who had already been hit once. According to the Post, Hegseth's initial directive was that all 11 people aboard the suspected drug-smuggling boat should be killed. Hegseth has denied he ordered everyone dead, and The New York Times has since reported Hegseth did not state what action to take if the first strike did not kill everyone on board. Admiral Mitch Bradley reportedly ordered the follow-up strike after the first strike left survivors clinging to the wreckage.

	The Pentagon at first denied the Post's story entirely, but the White House confirmed on Tuesday that a second strike did take place. Hegseth says he did not personally see any survivors after the first strike, or stick around to watch the second one. Trump and his administration have tried to justify the string of boat strikes that began on Sept. 2 by claiming that the United States is in a formal armed conflict with the drug cartels, and Hegseth has cited the “fog of war” to defend the second strike on Sept. 2, but the idea that America is currently at war with the drug runners is dubious, to say the least.


	Lawmakers of both parties have raised alarm about the Post's report last week, and Admiral Bradley briefed Congress behind closed doors on Thursday about what happened on Sept. 2. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said after the briefing that Bradley was “very clear” that there was no order to “kill them all.” Democrats, however, still expressed alarm. “What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), referring to the full video of the strikes against the boat. “You have two individuals and clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who were killed by the United States.”


	“Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors,” Himes added.


	If the military did deliberately kill the strike's survivors, it is not a close call, a new legal theory, or a murky extension of post-9/11 counterterrorism doctrine. It's a war crime, if not outright murder. This is bad for America, and bad for our troops. 


	It is a strange and shameful feeling to realize that the novice and low-ranking Japanese pilots my grandfather feared in 1944 may have shown more restraint, more discipline, and more humanity in those crucial minutes over the Indian Ocean than the man currently sitting at the top of the Pentagon.

	The Imperial Japanese military, for all its many and well-documented atrocities, still had pilots and sailors who chose not to fire on American sailors who posed no threat. There are cases of American Navy sailors being spared by Japanese pilots and ship crews, as documented in James D. Hornfischer's The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors.


	The international conflict law prohibiting such attacks, known as hors de combat, doesn't care whether the people in the water were alleged drug smugglers, enemy fighters, or simply unlucky. America is built on the premise that “all men are created equal” — even those we fight. Humanity is the line that prevents war from collapsing into a massacre.

	The Senate and House Armed Services Committees will need to determine whether Hegseth gave an unlawful order — and whether Admiral Bradley carried it out. But the moral dimension doesn't require a classified annex. If the United States military killed shipwrecked survivors because the secretary of Defense allegedly ordered “no survivors,” that is not a new frontier. It's a step backward into barbarism.


	It is up to both parties to do the right thing, especially the party in power. Only by holding ourselves accountable can we restore the dignity and agency that men and women who lived and died at sea, defending America, earned through their sacrifice.

	A puck floats through the air. Blades wait frozen on the ice. And the eyes of two lovers keeping their years-long relationship secret from family, friends, and the thousands of cheering fans around them meet in the middle of a National Hockey League game. 


	This is the world of Heated Rivalry, a queer hockey romance novel that has gone from an if-you-know-you-know treasure to one of the most popular shows on HBO Max. By some measures, it's been an unlikely journey. Created by the Canadian streaming service Crave and starring relative newcomers Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov, the adaption of this BookTok hit follows two professional hockey players as they navigate a secret relationship in the midst of a highly publicized athletic rivalry. Its defining draw appears to be the multiple steamy, NSFW scenes that occur every episode, and since the series' Nov. 28 premiere, Heated Rivalry has become a word-of-mouth sensation. It has remained in HBO Max's Top 10 shows, racked up millions of interactions and mentions on social media, and driven such high demand for the book that physical copies are out of stock on Amazon. Heated Rivalry is a hit. But even the people responsible for making it aren't entirely sure why. 

	











Heated Rivalry creator Jacob Tierney is best known for co-writing and directing the offbeat cult-favorite sitcom Letterkenny (and executive producing its popular spinoff Shoresy). A love story might not seem like his milieu, but Tierney tells Rolling Stone he became obsessed with Heated Rivalry after offhandedly checking out the audiobook. He thought it would be a quick read to help fix his pandemic-induced short attention span — and as a gay man, he's always down to read a queer story. Now, he calls it his “gateway drug” into the world of romance.

	“My first discovery was like, ‘Oh, my God, these books are so smutty.' I'd be walking my dog and [thinking], ‘If you knew what was happening in my ears right now,'” Tierney says. “But what stood out to me in retrospect is that [Heated Rivalry] accomplishes a different task than these books usually do. This is not about somebody coming out, it's about two people figuring out they are allowed to be in love. And that zig where the other books zag really stuck with me.”

	Unlike your typical binge watch, Heated Rivalry takes place over an almost nine-year span, often jumping months or years at a time during each episode. But the central story remains fixed on the relationship between hockey stars Hollander and Rozanov. Because the two are widely known as professional nemeses, they can't actually hang out or mimic anything even close to public friendship. Instead, most of the book's action develops in secret encounters the men have between games, sponsorship events, and award ceremonies. On the ice, they're enemies. But behind closed doors, Hollander and Rozanov can't keep their hands off of each other. 


	Tierney says that he always felt a sense of ownership over the book, a feeling he thinks many readers share by the time they turn the last page. After reading it and exploring other works in the genre, he still thought of it as “his” book. So when he read a Washington Post article about how popular romance was becoming — an audience of mainly female readers that Hollywood wasn't taking seriously — he knew he wasn't alone. And when the article mentioned Heated Rivalry by name, he immediately called up one of his producing partners. “I was like, ‘I think we have to option a bunch of gay hockey porn,'” Tierney says. “Because if somebody else does it, I think I will be very upset.” His next step: sliding into author Rachel Reid's Instagram DMs and begging to option her book. 


	“That was the beginning of it,” Reid tells Rolling Stone. “We had a Zoom call the next day to talk about his ideas, and that's when I really got a good sense of how much he loved these books, how much he understood them and the characters, and how important it was for him to get the story right. I felt really confident after that this was going to be told correctly.”

	Both Tierney and Reid say the show moved quickly once it was greenlit in 2024. But the road to that point was incredibly long and drawn out, mostly because Tierney refused to make any concessions to TV executives about dialing down the show's sex scenes. While there's no full-frontal nudity in the series, the material is what Tierney calls “defiantly sexual,” using careful camera angles, strategically arranged limbs, and moody lighting to hide genitalia while painting a pretty clear picture of exactly what's happening. 

	











	“I'm a gay man and this is a gay show. [The smut] and the story are not separate,” Tierney says. “It's about two people learning about who they are and what their relationship is through fucking. The only times they're being honest with each other is when they're having sex. Otherwise, it's loads of bluster. It's loads of pretending. It's loads of two people who don't, frankly, understand what they're feeling and who don't really get it takes a long time for their emotions to catch up to what their bodies are doing.” 


	While the show might seem to have come out of nowhere, the popularity of Heated Rivalry didn't emerge from a bubble. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, hockey romance has been one of the fastest-growing niches in the online book community — to the point where it's created some PR nightmares for actual NHL teams. Heated Rivalry is one of eight hockey romance books Reid has published since 2018. But she tells Rolling Stone the genre has exploded in a way she never expected when she started. She knows people love hockey romances — she just can't pinpoint exactly why. 


	“One of the main reasons I've heard from readers outside of Canada is that hockey is a sport they don't have a lot of knowledge about, so it's kind of relaxing. It's almost like science fiction — it's a sport that doesn't seem real,” Reid says. “It's a violent sport that's very emotional and passionate. And that makes it seem intriguing to people and a good setting for romance.” 


	It's unclear how much of the show's success is coming from book fanatics versus those discovering it organically on HBO. But Storrie, one half of the leading duo, says messages and online comments from old and new fans seem to point to the popularity coming from the palpable chemistry between himself and Williams. He says that the show wouldn't be possible without his new friendship with Williams, especially given the show's primary shooting location: one character or the other's bed. 


	“We have to be literally on top of each other for so long and take it seriously and trust each other and remember the choreography,” Storrie tells Rolling Stone. “It makes it so much easier when you really like and respect the person and also feel understood by them.” 


	In its Peak TV era, HBO has leaned into the risqué only in its more highbrow or prestige titles — think Euphoria, The Wire, Game of Thrones, or The Sopranos. But Heated Rivalry, with its seemingly scrappy budget and unknown cast, feels like a relative outlier, something you're likelier to find next to The Hunting Wives in Netflix's catalogue than on the cable giant that just gave us moody awards-bait like Task and The Pitt. (Perhaps the move presaged Netflix's just-announced purchase of HBO Max parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)

	From a showrunner's perspective, Tierney doesn't feel any pressure to dissect exactly what has made Heated Rivalry take off. Nor does he feel the need to justify the sweaty and steamy situations in which his two main characters find themselves. He's just grateful that he got to make a show that feels true to the book that got him out of a reading slump — and excited to find out who else will join his league. 


	“The baked-in audience that loves these books, they don't love these books despite the sex. They love these books because of the sex,” Tierney says. “It's because of how [the sex] reflects real intimacy for these characters. Also there's no horny TV anymore. Why can't this be fun and sexy? Why not?”

	On the evening before Thanksgiving, the president of the United States took to his social media platform to claim in a lengthy screed that immigration was destroying the country. In one spurious example Donald Trump offered in his Truth Social post, he warned, falsely, that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia” were “completely taking over the state” of Minnesota, with dangerous migrant gangs roving the streets as citizens cowered in fear at home. 


	Trump laid the blame squarely on Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic Party's 2024 nominee for vice president. “The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,” Trump fumed.


	In the not-too-recent past, it would have been unthinkable for a president to attack his political opponent using a derogatory term for people with intellectual disabilities. Even a Republican, Indiana State Sen. Mike Bohacek, rebuked Trump for his language in a Facebook post, saying it was reason enough to oppose a GOP-favored redistricting measure in his state. “I have been an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities since the birth of my second daughter,” who has Down syndrome, he wrote, noting that Trump's “choices of words have consequences.” (Trump, naturally, doubled down on his statement days later.)

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The president's epithet didn't come out of thin air. Across the internet, during the 2024 election and in the first year of his second term, MAGA influencers have increasingly used the R-word to insult and scandalize conscientious “woke” liberals, normalizing a slur that had been largely purged from the national vocabulary. The trend reflects not only a coarsening of public discourse under Trump but new depths of callousness and cruelty in America, with disability advocates warning of the term's dehumanizing effect. Elon Musk alone has dropped the word more than 30 times on his X account since early 2024, while Joe Rogan has said that its return represents an important win for right-wingers. “The word ‘retarded' is back, and it's one of the great culture victories,” the podcaster crowed in an April episode of his show.

	Luvell Anderson, head of the philosophy department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, has written extensively on the lexical category of slurs. He describes the Trumpworld's pushback against the elimination of the R-word as part of the larger project of asserting ideology. “The attempted reintroduction of ‘retarded' into the public language by people on the far right has less to do with changing meaning and more to do with an attempted shift in values,” he explains. “From the far right's perspective, reintroducing a word we are taught not to say is a rebellious act meant to take back power. Open defiance is a clear sign that the old gatekeepers are no longer in charge.”


	So, how exactly did we get here? To understand that, we have to chart the history and evolution of this troublesome term over hundreds of years.


	“Retard” is a verb derived from the Latin verb “retardere,” meaning “to make slow,” or “to delay.” To hinder something or someone's progress is to “retard” it. “Retarded” is a corresponding adjective referring to whomever or whatever has been slowed down, and “retardant” describes that which is capable of inhibiting in this way: a “flame retardant” substance, for example, helps to reduce or halt the spread of fire. English and other languages included versions of these words as far back as the 15th century.


	By the 19th century, clinical psychologists were applying old words such as “idiot” and “imbecile” to categorize people with intellectual disabilities, and sometimes inventing new ones. (In 1910, the American eugenicist Henry H. Goddard coined the term “moron,” suggesting it as a replacement for the description “feeble-minded,” which he found too vague for his liking.) To receive one of these designations from a doctor in this era was to be marked as unfit for society and a candidate for potential institution and sterilization.

	As those words were adopted for epithets of abuse outside clinical settings, some in the medical community sought to move toward less loaded language. The first known use of “retarded” to characterize the intellectually disabled dates to 1895, with “mental retardation” slowly but surely replacing the previous terminology in medical literature over the course of the 20th century. This was reflected in the names of advocacy groups, including the National Association for Retarded Children and the American Association on Mental Retardation, which have since been renamed (as Arc of the United States and the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, respectively) in recognition of the rise in the harmful use of “retard” as a slur. But “retarded” did remain accepted scientific language into the 1980s and 1990s.

	











	John McWhorter, an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University who examined profanity and slurs in his 2021 book Nine Nasty Words, says that the R-word was partially meant to be a neutralizing solution to words like “imbecile” becoming offensive slang. “My sense is that ‘moron' and ‘idiot' were the ones shelved for the more euphemistic ‘retarded,' which originally would have felt like just ‘slowed down by factors beyond their control,'” he tells Rolling Stone. “But once ‘retarded' felt like ‘moron,' we started using terms like ‘special needs' — and note what that term is starting to feel like in public discourse.”


	The issue with simply switching from something like “idiot” to the R-word, McWhorter explains, is that the replacement term enters a “euphemism treadmill” and will eventually acquire the stigma of the last word.  


	“A word takes on unpleasant associations,” he says. “Those who wish to use a word with fewer associations, such as to protect a group of people, suggest a new term. Problem is, that term after a while takes on the same associations. ‘Bum' is changed to ‘homeless,' but when ‘homeless' feels as mean as ‘bum,' we change it to ‘unhoused' — but that term will soon feel the same way.” There has been a similar progression, McWhorter notes, from “crippled” to “handicapped” to “disabled.”


	As such, the R-word gained traction as a slang put-down through the middle of the 20th century, almost as soon as it was default medical terminology, and by the 1970s, disability activists were campaigning to retire the word. (It is probably no coincidence that Musk and Rogan, two outspoken fans of the epithet, are Gen Xers who were born right around a time when popular culture had fully embraced it for bullying purposes.)


	Anderson says that what happened with the R-word is hardly unique. “The process of words moving from neutral to pejorative is called pejoration,” he explains. “This happens all the time. For example, it also happened with ‘idiot' and ‘feeble-minded,' both terms that were used in a neutral way but then shifted to something more negative. ‘Negro' is another term that comes to mind that has gone through this process.” 


	“The status and meaning of expressions has much to do with shifting language ideologies,” Anderson adds, reflecting the values, morals, and politics of a social world. “Often, we come to feel positively or negatively about an expression, or expect words to be used in specific contexts and ways because of language ideologies.” That the R-word came to serve as a common disparagement for people who are not intellectually disabled revealed a societal lack of empathy and care for those who are. 

	











	In 2009, the U.S. saw a renewed call to force the R-word out of circulation: youth activists working with the Special Olympics launched a campaign called Spread the Word to End the Word to mark that year's winter games. Students across the country were encouraged to sign a pledge to stop their derogatory use of the term. (Eventually, the campaign expanded into a general movement for inclusion and celebration of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.) 


	The following year, Rahm Emanuel, then White House chief of staff under President Obama, was embroiled in a scandal when it emerged that he had used the term in a private meeting the previous summer. He apologized to a number of disability rights activists, including Special Olympics Chief Executive Tim Shriver, and said he would not only take the Spread the Word to End the Word pledge but ensure that the Obama administration would work with the organization on efforts to remove the R-word from the text of federal laws.


	In October 2010, Obama signed legislation to that effect. The measure, known as Rosa's Law, was named for Rosa Marcellino, a nine-year-old with Down syndrome who along with her parents successfully fought to remove the term “mental retardation” from health and education records in her home state of Maryland. The federal law likewise amended government documentation, removing “mental retardation” and “mentally retarded” in favor of “intellectual disability” and “individual with an intellectual disability.” Several states had already begun making this revision, as had bureaucratic agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


	All told, it seemed as if the world was moving on from a term that had fully transformed into a harmful slur. There were signs, however, that some would not be giving it up. After a 2012 presidential debate, right-wing commentator Ann Coulter called Obama a “retard” on Twitter, sparking outrage and demands for a public apology from disability activists. Coulter doubled down on her remarks in a CNN interview. “I was not referring to someone with Down syndrome. I was referring to the president of the United States,” she said, explaining that she viewed the word as a synonym for “loser.” 


	“Do you call people with mental disabilities retards?” she asked. “Because I don't. I think that's a nasty thing to do.”      

	











	Trump's 2016 presidential run brought moments of shocking incivility from the insurgent candidate. Almost a year after he took a moment at a South Carolina rally to perform a mocking impression of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has the congenital joint condition arthrogryposis, a poll found that voters still judged it his most offensive moment on the campaign trail. While in office, Trump regularly lobbed profanities, apparently regarding them as a natural element of his populist appeal.


	It was not until 2024, however — during an election that saw Trump relentlessly attack Joe Biden as a president in steep cognitive decline — that MAGA culture warriors made a concerted effort to revive the term as a standard verbal jab. They were aided in this by Musk's 2022 acquisition of Twitter, which he rebranded as X and stripped of various moderation policies, reinstating extremists, conspiracy theorists, and peddlers of misinformation who had been banned under those guidelines. He began using the R-word himself on the platform and engaging with like-minded users, including an anonymous far-right “Retard Finder” profile based in Australia that appends the slur to pictures of U.S. liberals and Democrats. (The account was opened in December 2024 and now has more than 800,000 followers.)


	In January, researchers at Montclair State University tracked the use of the R-word in the days after Musk responded “F u retard” to a Finnish researcher who posted on X that month that he was “rapidly becoming the largest spreader of disinformation in human history.” They demonstrated a more than 200 percent spike in posts containing the word over the following two days — 312,642 examples in all.


	But it wasn't just Musk driving these trends, according to the study's authors. “While it might be tempting to view an event such as this as an isolated one-off, indications are that the widespread dissemination of hateful and marginalizing content may be an increasingly prominent feature on social media,” they wrote, observing that Facebook parent Meta had recently dismantled some of its safeguards against dehumanizing language, apparently in concession to the political climate about to be ushered in with a second Trump term.


	This week, the paper's co-authors — Bond Benton, a communications professor, and justice studies professor Daniela Peterka-Benton — released new findings that showed a sharp rise in use of the R-word on X in the days after Trump applied it to Walz. The effect was quite similar to the trend they identified in the wake of Musk's January R-word post: a 225.7 percent increase in usage, or 1.12 million R-word posts in the week following Trump's Truth Social diatribe.   

	











	“A lot of people face similar stressors in society right now, from cultural challenges to economic challenges to perceptions that they're being marginalized in some way,” Benton tells Rolling Stone. “When you can say a word that you know is going to be hurtful to a lot of people, there could be a sort of power in that: you go from being vulnerable to being perceived as dangerous.” Benton believes right-wingers may be seeking “validation” by making others angry in this way. He also points out that this slur is surging in popularity at the same time that MAGA figures “are saying that the cost of compassion has hurt our country.” It may be no coincidence that they're specifically marginizaling a group that relies on the social safety nets they want to do away with.

	“Not using the R-word has sort of become synonymous with ‘wokeness,'” observes Peterka-Benton. Using it today, she says, is about “regaining the power to decide” what can be said publicly while “completely disregarding the harm that has been done to the disability community.” Peterka-Benton adds that heated discourse around such slurs can also act as “a diversion from bigger problems, from economic inequality to lingering questions about Trump's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And, she says, as with the demonization of undocumented migrants, to keep repeating the R-word means “being the bullies in the room against against populations that are inherently not as strong as the mainstream.” 


	Whatever its ideological value to the far right, though, the R-world may also simply be a way of compensating for the Trump administration's failure to deliver on key promises. Grocery prices are up, limited disclosures about Epstein haven't led to prosecutions of Democrats, the county is inching toward a mad war with Venezuela, and millions are set to lose Medicaid coverage — but you are free to throw the word “retarded” around online. As one X user summarized recent polling data that shows Trump's disapproval rating has topped 60 percent: “You wanted a return to 2019 America but all you got is the r-word pass.” And it's already looking as if that wasn't quite the deal of a lifetime.

	After winning the Eurovision Song Contest, Italian outfit Måneskin became the hottest rock band in the world. They sold out arenas and stadiums all over and nabbed a Best New Artist nomination at the 2023 Grammy Awards in the process. Their first album in the aftermath of their Eurovision win, 2023's Rush!, became a global chart-topper as well.


	Since wrapping the Rush! world tour in the summer 2024 with a string of festival dates, the band put a halt to their global domination to pursue solo projects. They're still together, just on an official hiatus for the time being as they try new sounds, drop albums and go on their own tours. Here's what the members of Måneskin are up to these days.


	The band's frontman began rolling out his debut album Funny Little Fears in 2024 with piano ballad “Silverlines.” He released the full-length album this past May, showcasing a more suave pop sound than what his band was known for. 


	This fall, he expanded Funny Little Fears with more songs, including “Talk to Me” featuring Tyla and Nile Rodgers. He also embarked on a world tour that will wrap this December in the U.S.

	











	Outside of music, he has been busy with a superstar girlfriend on his arms. Since early 2024, he's been in a relationship with actress and pop star Dove Cameron. He recently inspired her single “Whatever You Like.”


	Måneskin's bassist got an early start on her solo career, appearing on Duran Duran's 2023 cover of the Talking Heads' “Psycho Killer.” In 2024, she began touring the world as a DJ, exploring more electronic music than the glam rock she made with her band. Her debut single was in collaboration with Brazilian star Anitta titled “Get Up Bitch! Shake Ya Ass,” which was released in 2024.

	











	Over the last year, she's been dropping a series of singles, some as collaborations with other LGBTQ+ artists like Pablo Vittar, Tommy Genesis, and Ashnikko. She's also released some remixes, including a non-official one of Charli XCX and Billie Eilish's “Guess.”

	De Angelis has yet to announce plans for an EP or album release or more 2026 tour dates.


	Guitarist Raggi is keeping the rock ‘n' roll spirit of the band alive with his solo debut. Out Dec. 5, Masquerade‘s eight tracks were produced by legend Tom Morello and feature guests such as Beck, Chad Smith, Nic Cester, and Matt Sorum. Rolling Stone got an exclusive look at the making of the record below.


	“Seeing so many musical icons come together reminded me that music knows no boundaries; that you have to follow your instinct and simply do what you feel,” said Raggi about his debut album in a press release. “I feel as if those who made music history are placing a hand on my shoulder, saying: ‘You're on the right path.'”

	Raggi has yet to announce a tour in support of the album, but he played a pre-release show in Los Angeles at the Whisky. Morello declared that Raggi was “carrying the rock ‘n roll baton to a new generation.”


	The band's drummer has, so far, stepped out of the limelight in the time since his band announced a hiatus. Since scoring a 2024 documentary about mental health titled Ogni Pensiero Vola, Torchio has kept a low profile. In June, however, he did share some images of himself in the studio with some friends.

Flying saucers, strange lights in the sky and objects that look like alien spaceships… every year Brits report hundreds of sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and have been doing so for more than eight decades.

Great Britain is considered to be one of the most active UFO hotspots in the world, despite the fact that government officials have long insisted they are not concerned about reports of strange activity in the sky.

Ufologists would disagree. They suggest the British government's own files tell a very different story - one that finally came to light in 2008 - when the Ministry of Defence finally released its UFO files.

British author, researcher and TV presenter Lynn Picknett who writes about the paranormal says: “The MOD released 60,000 files on the subject. Which basically backs up the assertion over the years that they've been researching all sorts of anomalous phenomena.”

In fact the British Ministry of Defence has files on military personnel encountering UFOs going back over 80 years, according to a new programme on UFOs coming to Sky History.

One of the most famous sightings occurred at a Royal Air Force base where American soldiers were stationed, Rendlesham Forest, on December 26, 1980. Shortly after midnight, military personnel at RAF Woodbridge, 80 miles northeast of London, detected a strange object on their radar.

Andrew Collins, a science and history writer says: “Airmen were sent out in a vehicle to investigate, and came across this clearing in which was this otherworldly object surrounded with light. It rose up slightly, then moved backwards and disappeared. Over the next few nights, more and more sightings occurred. The whole episode was written up and recorded by the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Halt which was very unusual.”

It's one of the most discussed UFO events on record, but just one of many that have been reported near British military bases. On August 13th, 1956, British Royal Air Force officers stationed at RAF Bentwaters claimed they saw fifteen unidentified flying objects on their radar screen racing along the coastline.

Nick Pope, a former British Ministry of Defence (MoD) employee who investigated UFOs for the government from 1991 to 1994 and is now a leading commentator on the subject says: “Military jets were scrambled to try and intercept these things. At one point, one of the objects was recorded at speeds of around 4,000 miles an hour.

“That was way faster than anything anyone had at the time. And reliable witnesses, the pilots saw them. They're simultaneously tracked on radar. At one point, these things are going in formation, and then they appear to converge and form a single object.”

If the British military has witnessed so many unexplainable events, why has the government always professed to have no interest in UFOs Ufologists say the answer can be found by examining the earliest British military encounters on record which were reported during World War II.

UFO investigator and podcaster Dan Zetterstrom says: “Files released show that Prime Minister Churchill was being briefed on these encounters during World War II. He was worried that any release of information would lead to mass hysteria, public panic.

“So, he covered up every UFO sighting that happened. He put a blanket secrecy ban on reporting on UFOs for 50 years. But while Winston Churchill wanted to hide UFO sightings from the public, he also felt it was important to study them, and initiated government funded projects to do just that.”

While many ufologists suspect the British government is still keeping their most explosive UFO files close to their chest, civilian research groups have investigated thousands of unexplained incidents. Some of the most intriguing occurred in a single town over the course of a decade: Warminster, England.

On Christmas Eve, 1964, local resident Mildred Head was startled awake by an unnerving noise coming from above her bedroom. Lynn Picknett explains: “It sounded like thousands upon thousands of tiles being ripped off and then thrown back on, which was utterly terrifying and also there was a vibration going through the house.”

The only explanation Mildred could come up with was that the noise may have been the result of military testing at a nearby Royal Air Force Base. That was until her neighbour, Marjorie Bay had a strange experience of her own.

Nick adds: “The very next day, Marjorie Bay was going to church when she was assaulted by a series of strange vibrations that she felt reverberating through her body, and shortly afterwards, dozens of other witnesses in and around Warminster reported the same thing. It was as if some unseen force was just taking a hold of people and shaking them.”

After residents reported hearing humming or droning noises and seeing strange lights in the sky, more than 300 assembled at their local town hall demanding answers. National papers took an interest and people started flocking to Warminster for nightly sky watches where others also witnessed these mysterious lights in the sky.

David Clarke recalls: “There was a classic photograph of a disc shaped object that was taken by Gordon Faulkner. And the Daily Mirror immediately put it on the front page, big splash. From that point onwards Warminster became the place to go and see flying saucers. It was the first sort of UFO hotspot in the British Isles.”

One area of Great Britain that has experienced UFO sightings on a near daily basis from ancient times right up until the present day, is Yorkshire. Private investigator Paul Sinclair and his team began researching and surveilling the area in 2009, setting up cameras around the clifftops along the North Sea. During one night in 2020, what they captured was particularly intriguing.

“We saw an object rise out of the water. I started filming. The entire sequence of events lasted about 90 seconds. We estimated the speed to cover six miles in 90 seconds was about 240 miles per hour before it seems to turn in and drop into the sea. So we've got an object that's gone below the surface, risen from the sea, traveled six miles and then gone below the surface.

""We have footage of objects beneath the surface of the water. Or luminous light beneath the surface. And we've no explanation for that. We've filmed that on three occasions.”

Ancient Aliens Britain's UFO Files is available to watch on Sky History platforms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","These researchers say they have serious questions about UFOs, aliens","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/12/06/scientists-study-ufo-uap/87602420007/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 16:38:00 GMT","

A group of researchers say it's time for academia to get serious about studying UFOs.

The movement, championed by the Society for UAP Studies, is wrapping up an international conference aimed at establishing a new discipline dedicated to studying unidentified anomalous phenomena (or UAPs, the more formal term for UFOs).

Michael Cifone, the society's co-founder and president, said he's interested in what he calls ""the empirical weird.""

His catch-all phrase encompasses things that blur the lines between the real and the possible, phenomena that defy easy explanation: the spiritual, the paranormal, the parapsychological and UAPs.

Cifone, who holds a Ph.D. in the philosophy of science from the University of Maryland, College Park, is hoping the study of UAPs can become the subject of serious, rigorous academic study, with the same scientific objectivity of any discipline.

The Society for UAP Studies knows it's a tall order that requires an open mind and an unusual amount of collaboration. Studying UAPs should be scientific, but can't be done in a lab — so researchers would have to collaborate in a study of the physical and theoretical.

Cifone spoke with USA TODAY one day before the Dec. 4 start of the international conference of the Society for UAP Studies. He's the nonprofit's executive director and co-founder along with Michael Silberstein, a philosophy professor at Elizabethtown College. Cifone is currently a research fellow at the Center for Alternative Rationalities in Global Perspectives at Friedrich-Alexander University in Germany.

The Society for UAP Studies' board of advisors, advisory council and leaders include dozens of academics from all over the world, representing a variety of disciplines including philosophy, law, the sciences and humanities.

""We're not necessarily taking a position"" on whether UAPs are evidence of extraterrestrial life, or what their existence could mean for humanity's understanding of its place in the universe, he said. ""But we are interested in taking on these topics that don't fit neatly anywhere. As academics, our skill is in establishing a framework so we're not simply speculating, but situating it within historical, cultural and scientific frameworks.""

Cifone wasn't initially interested much in the celestial or the supernatural, he said, beyond watching ""The X Files"" and having a passing curiosity. But when the world shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic, he found himself watching a YouTube video featuring Kevin Knuth, a professor and former NASA research scientist and physicist who's studied quantum information, robotics, planets and UAPs.

Intrigued and realizing that their academic circles often overlapped, Cifone set out to learn more about Knuth's work, reading his writings in scientific and academic journals.

At some point, he realized that ""while (the study of UAPs) was a topic of ridicule, there was still something strange and odd for which there seemed to be some good anecdotal evidence and witness evidence, evidence that was not easily dismissible by conventional analysis.""

It wasn't just Knuth, and it wasn't just ordinary people reporting strange, unexplained sights. In 2004, U.S. Navy pilots and radar operators aboard the U.S.S. Nimitz and the U.S.S. Princeton reported seeing ""anomalous aerial vehicles,” or AAVs high above where commercial and military craft can fly, performing maneuvers that seemed impossible to their trained eyes. In 2024, Congress conducted hearings on the issue, and the Pentagon, while saying it found no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial beings, also said there were ""definitely anomalies.""

Congress held additional hearings earlier in 2025 based on hundreds of reports of UAPs. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office determined the data instead show a ""continued geographic collection bias based on locations near U.S. military assets and sensors operating globally.""

During the Society for UAP Studies' conference (its second), keynote speaker Steve Fuller, an author and professor at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, said that he is ""completely agnostic about whether (extraterrestrial) creatures are already here or if these blips on the screen"" are evidence of intelligent life. But, he said, we (the global ""we"") should prepare for and be open to the possibility. Fuller discussed the nature of humanity, and how we might fit into a galactic or universal collective.

Cifone, in his interview with USA TODAY, said the society's goals are to bring scientific and academic rigor to phenomena that to many is still a fringe idea. They're not trying to convince anyone, including themselves.

""We like to emphasize positional neutrality,"" he said, ""the methodology and standards of evidence"" that would be a part of any other academic pursuit.

He acknowledged the challenges — starting an entirely new higher education discipline requires not just the professionals willing to do it, but also resources and institutional backing. The society is funded now through private and philanthropic donations and receives no government backing (he declined to name any funders, explaining he didn't ask permission to name them publicly).

He's taking a long-term view, and said thus far, he's encountered little resistance.

""It's a self-selecting group,"" he said. ""People who interact with me are already interested and they like that it's science, scholarship and research first. The subject is the thing we do. We're the people doing the work. We're focused on the research for an enduring and rigorous understanding of the phenomena in all its aspects.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","Aliens over the Central Coast? This documentary on UFOs seems to think so","https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article313374375.html","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Have you seen something from another world in the skies above the Central Coast?

It's entirely possible, according to a new documentary from director Dan Farah — who produced films such as “Ready Player One” and “Call Jane” — on the possibility of alien life that focuses on recent disclosures of U.S. government programs that have studied, tracked and even potentially recovered extraterrestrial craft and beings.

Released in March, “The Age of Disclosure” follows Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense employee and U.S. Army veteran who has become a prominent voice in the world of UFOs — or, as some enthusiasts call them, unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs — as the U.S. government declassifies some information on UAPs and holds hearings on the matter over the past five years.

The film also features commentary on UAP hearings from several high-ranking current and former members of the U.S. government, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; and former CIA Director John Brennan.

Though many of Elizondo's claims are disputed by UFO skeptics, scientists and government authorities, the new documentary includes a pair of accounts of potential UAP sightings here on the Central Coast — specifically surrounding Vandenberg Air Force Base, now referred to as Vandenberg Space Force Base.

In the documentary, retired Air Force Lieutenant Bob Jacobs said he saw a UAP while he was working at Vandenberg Air Force Base, though the exact date was not included in the documentary.

Around 60 cameras were pointed at the ignition point of an Atlas D missile carrying a dummy warhead that was launched from Vandenberg, recording the ignition and launch process, Jacobs said.

But once the missile took flight, an unidentified object entered the frame of the recording, he said.

Jacobs said the UAP circled the missile, hitting it with beams of light at several angles, and then exited the camera's frame in the same direction it came — all while everything being filmed was moving at around 8,000 to 9,000 miles per hour.

“There's nothing of ours that could have done that,” Jacobs said in the film. “What could have done that?”

Jacobs isn't alone in his claims of UAP sightings around Vandenberg.

In another instance, two individuals — retired Air Force Security Forces members Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Chaz King — shared similar accounts of a pair of 2003 UAP sighting while working at Vandenberg.

“On Oct. 14, 2003, I showed up to work at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and immediately everybody just started to tell me about this UFO incident that had happened earlier that morning,” Nuccetelli said in the documentary.

The first sighting had been reported by a trio of Boeing contractors, who said they saw a “gigantic red square object” hovering over the launchpad the previous evening, Nuccetelli said.

“It was making no noise, it had no obvious signs of propulsion, and it was just hovering silently,” Nuccetelli said in the film. “It was a very serious security breach of the area.”

Neither witnessed the incident firsthand, but said they spent much of the following day driving around the base, searching for other objects like the square.

“Later that night, myself and five security forces members, we observed a bright light approaching the base,” King said in the documentary. “As it got closer, the light was no longer visible, and it was massive, the size of a football field, almost rectangular in shape.”

King said the mysterious matte black rectangle appeared to float in the sky without any propulsion systems, and lacked windows.

After the security forces members had observed it for around 45 seconds, it “shot off, thousands of miles an hour, up the coast,” King said in the film.

Nuccetelli said he spoke with a dozen other individuals at different vantage points, all of whom repeated King's story.

Because no photographic or video evidence of these claims are publicly available, at the end of the day, verifying their accuracy comes down to just one question: Do you believe?

Have you seen something from another world in the skies above the Central Coast?

It's entirely possible, according to a new documentary from director Dan Farah — who produced films such as “Ready Player One” and “Call Jane” — on the possibility of alien life that focuses on recent disclosures of U.S. government programs that have studied, tracked and even potentially recovered extraterrestrial craft and beings.

Released in March, “The Age of Disclosure” follows Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense employee and U.S. Army veteran who has become a prominent voice in the world of UFOs — or, as some enthusiasts call them, unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs — as the U.S. government declassifies some information on UAPs and holds hearings on the matter over the past five years.

Uranus in false color, imaged by Voyager 2 in 1986.

A new study may help to solve a 39-year-old mystery, suggesting that Uranus is not so bizarre after all; Voyager 2 just imaged it during an unusual gust of solar ""wind"".

The iconic Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, launched in 1977 and still going to this day, were sent with the primary objective of studying the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.

But on their way (eventually) out of the Solar System, due to a fortunate planetary alignment which only occurs every 175 years, Voyager 2 went on to be the only spacecraft to visit Uranus and Neptune, arriving January 24, 1986. The spacecraft became the first, and so far only, mission to take photographs of Uranus. As well as discovering a new moon, named ""Puck"", the spacecraft took the first measurements of the planet's magnetosphere – the protective region around a planet dominated by the planet's magnetic field, which shields planets from plasma in the solar wind. Here, it presented scientists with a new mystery.

""Inside the planet's magnetosphere were electron radiation belts with an intensity second only to Jupiter's notoriously brutal radiation belts. But there was apparently no source of energized particles to feed those active belts; in fact, the rest of Uranus' magnetosphere was almost devoid of plasma,"" NASA explains. 

""The missing plasma also puzzled scientists because they knew that the five major Uranian moons in the magnetic bubble should have produced water ions, as icy moons around other outer planets do. They concluded that the moons must be inert with no ongoing activity.""

That mystery is now very old, having puzzled scientists for four decades: How could Uranus support such an intense electron belt?

""While the ion radiation belt intensity was below expectations, the electron belt intensities were significantly higher than anticipated, reaching the Kennel-Petschek limit for the system,"" the authors of the new study explain. ""The Kennel-Petschek limit is the point at which runaway wave growth would subsequently scatter particles into the loss-cone, thereby limiting the maximum energetic particle intensity that could stably exist. As a result of this discrepancy between the ion and electron intensities compared to their Kennel-Petschek limits, studies have posed a seeming mystery regarding how the Uranian system could support such intense electron belt with a meager ion belt.""

Recently, a new idea has been suggested that Voyager 2 simply flew past the planet at an unfortunate time.

""It was recently noted that a co-rotating interaction region (CIR), a large-scale solar wind structures that form at the boundary between high-speed streams from coronal holes and preceding slow solar wind streams, was passing over Uranus at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby,"" the team explains. ""As noted in Jasinski et al. (2024), the passage of the CIR may have caused plasma in the inner magnetosphere to be vacated by the time of Voyager 2's passage through the system.""

Fortunately, in the intervening decades, we have had a much better look at the workings of our own magnetosphere.

""Science has come a long way since the Voyager 2 flyby,"" Southwest Research Institute's Dr Robert Allen, lead author of the paper, explained in a statement. ""We decided to take a comparative approach looking at the Voyager 2 data and compare it to Earth observations we've made in the decades since.""

Comparing the data seen by Voyager 2 to observations of the Earth's magnetosphere, the team puts the unusual Uranus electron belt observations down to chorus waves. 

""Chorus waves are a class of frequency-chirping, whistler-mode plasma waves that are routinely observed in Earth's near-space environment,"" NASA explains. ""Chorus waves play a key role in various physical processes including the formation of the Earth's Van Allen radiation belts, the pulsating aurora, and the deposition of particle energy into Earth's upper atmosphere.""

At the time, scientists thought that chorus waves would scatter electrons, which would then be lost to Uranus's atmosphere. But since then, it has been found that under certain conditions, they can accelerate electrons and feed them with more energy. Comparing Earth and Uranus observations, they found this to be a reasonable explanation.

""The Voyager 2 Uranus flyby and the 7.7 MeV electron event at Earth in 2019 share several similarities. Both occurred during solar minimum when CIRs are more prevalent in the heliosphere and during times when CIRs are seen to be repeatedly passing over the planetary magnetospheres,"" the team explains. ""Also, both events are characterized by strong chorus emissions concurrent to high fluxes of relativistic electrons, which were potentially driven by convection and substorm activity observed for both Earth and Uranus, potentially seeding the inner magnetosphere.""

Unfortunately, Voyager only caught a brief glimpse of Uranus, and since then, no mission has returned to it. The team, along with many others, would like to take another look.

""In 2019, Earth experienced one of these events, which caused an immense amount of radiation belt electron acceleration,"" Dr Sarah Vines, a co-author of the paper, added. ""If a similar mechanism interacted with the Uranian system, it would explain why Voyager 2 saw all this unexpected additional energy.""

The team suggests that a new mission to the planet should take repeated measurements of it, to help our understanding of its magnetosphere under more usual conditions.

""This is just one more reason to send a mission targeting Uranus,"" Allen added. ""The findings have some important implications for similar systems, such as Neptune's.""

The study is published in Geophysical Research Letters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Spartacus: House of Ashur Creator Reveals If The Supernatural Will Appear In the Show","https://thedirect.com/article/spartacus-house-of-ashur-creator-reveals-if-the-supernatural-will-appear-in-the-show","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 02:50:29 GMT","

Starz pulled the rug out from under Spartacus fans when they announced House of Ashur, a show that takes place in an alternate what-if timeline where Nick E. Tarabay's Ashur survives the events of the original show and kills Spartacus. The show's first episode even gets supernatural to set this premise up, taking the original Ashur, who had just died, straight from the Underworld itself and plucking him in another timeline that gives him a second chance.

The Direct sat down with Spartacus: House of Ashur showrunner Steven S. DeKnight, who also worked on Netflix's Daredevil, where he spoke about the chances of seeing more supernatural elements on the show, and revealed whether or not the titular Spartacus is actually dead in this new timeline.

When asked if Spartacus: House of Ashur's intro might open up the doors for some more supernatural elements, DeKnight confirmed that ""you're not going to see that again in the body of the show."" He further clarified how ""that's no the show"" and ""that's purely the intro""

As for the fate of Spartacus himself, the show's concept declares he is dead. However, the first episode of House of Ashur offers hope that Liam McIntyre's hero might not actually be dead.

Sadly, despite that, DeKnight confirmed to THe Direct without a shadow of a doubt that ""he's dead."" The showrunner also added that ""Everyone who died in the original series, except Ashur, they're dead.""

More of The Direct's interview with Spartacus: House of Ashur showrunner Steven S. DeKnight can be read below. House of Ashur is now streaming on Starz.

Steven S. DeKnight: No, that's the one thing. You're not going to see that again in the body of the show. Because there was some talk, some questions from Starz and Lionsgate, as we were working on on the script, is, are we going to see other supernatural things happen? And no, that's not the show. That's purely the intro. I want it to be the same show as the original show, where you don't see any of that, except for the opening, where you know, this is what would have happened if the Fates had woven a different path for Ashur.

Steven S. DeKnight: Well, thank you. It's a big swing, and honestly, we didn't know how it would work. And that opening. My God, we rewrote and reworked that opening like 20 times to get it just right so it could appeal to the legacy fans and also give just enough information, but not too much information to overwhelm a new audience. So finding that sweet spot was really tricky.

Steven S. DeKnight: Back in the original show, there was a line in 'Spartacus: Vengeance' that the writers' room and I always were talking about and saying, wouldn't have been great if we had did that. It's when Ashur, I think it's in the last episode of 'Vengeance,' where Ashur tells Lucretia that he's going to help Glaber bring down Spartacus, and then he's going to inherit Batiatus' Ludus and her, and it's going to be the rise of the House of Ashur. And we always thought, man, that would have been a fun show to work on, that would have been really cool, but we killed him, so we can't do that now.

The showrunner went on to list some of the alternate ideas for a Spartacus spinoff series, which included a show about ""Caesar, Crassus, Pompey, and the Triumvirate and the overthrowing of the Republic:""

DeKnight: So when it came around where Lionsgate and Starz approached me about resurrecting 'Spartacus'--originally, I think the question was, do you want to reboot Spartacus? It's like, No, I'm not going to tell that story again. I wouldn't touch that. But they said, Well, what about something kind of in that world, in that vein? So I started kicking around different ideas. Of course, first it was the obvious suspects. It was, well, a show about Caesar. Well, Caesar has been done, you know, everybody knows Caesar. And then it was, well, what about Caesar, Crassus, Pompey, and the Triumvirate and the overthrowing of the Republic? And I thought that sounds really great and really expensive. I want to make sure the show has legs. And then I was kicking around briefly, Anthony and Cleopatra, but it had the same issue of basically expense. An incredibly expensive series to do right.

Of course, all roads inevitably lead back to House of Ashur:

DeKnight: So I came back to this idea of, well, hell. What if we just did the House of Ashur? What if I had, you know, Lucretia went over the cliff with a baby and in the same episode Ashur got his head lopped off, what if he ends up in the underworld with her, and she has this whole thing about The Fates? And, you know, this was just one thing that could have happened. And then I got really excited, because I thought, I love this character of Ashur, and, you know, he's a horrible person, but in 'Gods of the Arena,' you kind of see why he's a horrible person. Really, the guy just needed a hug, you know, he just wanted love, and he was just kicked in the crotch by everybody, and it turned him bitter and mean, and he figured, all right, if that's what you want, that's what you're going to get.

With as unlikable of a guy that Ashur is, one of the key challenges for DeKnight was trying to figure out how you make audiences root for someone like that:

DeKnight: But I was really excited by the idea of being given a second chance. Could he be a better person? And he certainly tries. Whether or not he succeeds, we'll find out... And then the immediate problem was that he was such a bastard in the original show. How do you make the audience root for him? And of course, the answer was to introduce people who are worse. You introduce the Roman elites, who are way worse than he is. So that was basically the genesis. I'm still shocked that Lionsgate and Starz, because when I sent them my proposal, I thought there's no way they're gonna go for this. And they said, 'Yeah, that sounds great. Let's do it.' And here we are.

Steven S. DeKnight: Oh, no, he's dead. He's dead... Some characters hope he's alive, and other characters clearly say, if he were alive, we would have heard about it, man. So that's one thing the fans are always asking me. It's like Gannicus, we didn't technically see him die. And I have to tell everybody, no, he's dead. Everyone who died in the original series, except Ashur, they're dead, because I didn't want to be changing too many things, and I really didn't want to affect the ending of the original series, which I thought was just right. Like people ask me, 'Are we going to see Agron and Nasir in their goat farm?' And my answer is, always, I love the way their story ended. I don't want to upset them or their goats, so I'm leaving them to their peace.

DeKnight: That was the other thing that really excited me, because in the original show, Rob Tapert and I had always talked about bringing in the female Gladiators, the Gladiatrixes, but historically, they didn't arrive until about 80 years later, right about so. So instead, you know, once the war broke out, we could have women fighting, which we really loved, and that was the other thing that I loved about this concept, is that Ashur being alive, one of the first things in history that he changes is he brings in the gladiators early because he's desperate and he needs a gimmick.

So that starts the dominoes falling, and towards later in the series, and as the series progresses, you'll see the female gladiators really catch on. So we'll have more of them. And there are other things, you know, we want to take historical events that people know and start to change them and alter them all, because Ashur is alive. Him being alive just changes everything, while still pulling from actual historical things that are going on.

Steven S. DeKnight: Yeah, it's a little both. I mean, we come into it about six months after the defeat of Spartacus and his rebels, and Ashur has been given everything he ever dreamed of, which he discovers is a big burden, and he's struggling because he's in this weird place.

He helped the Romans defeat Spartacus and his rebels, but he's also an ex slave, ex Gladiator, so while they may be thankful, they don't trust him and he's not a Roman citizen, which they look down upon, so he's in this really precarious place where he's got to really scramble and use all of his wits and his devious nature to try to keep what he has and expand what he has so he's he's got his back up against it from the very beginning.

Whether it's wildly speculating about Charlie Kirk's murder or forcing Brigitte Macron to prove that she is a woman, the far-right podcaster and conspiracy theorist has millions of listeners hooked on her unique brand of dangerous misinformation. So, how has Candace Owens been allowed to become so powerful, asks Katie Rosseinsky

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

For right-wing firebrand Candace Owens, conspiracy theories are a form of “mind yoga”, a way of bending the mind “like a pretzel”. They're also extremely compelling, for her millions of social media followers and podcast listeners at least, and extremely lucrative, helping the 36-year-old American build a staggering media empire in under a decade.  

Coronavirus and the vaccines. The moon landings. Climate change. The #MeToo case against Harvey Weinstein. Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal battle. All these disparate subjects have received Owens' signature treatment. On her eponymous podcast, she is the queen of the “just asking questions” approach: positioning herself as an investigating crusader who is bold enough to probe the topics that she believes the mainstream media don't want you to know about. 

She is part one-woman outrage machine, part millennial version of a medieval mystic; she has certainly worked out how to cleverly monetise the human impulse to “uncover” so-called “truths” and to feel like we are somehow in possession of a secret knowledge that explains how the world works. But her latest forays into so-called “mind yoga” are tying her in ever more complex knots that set her apart from even the most fact-averse of her fellow microphone-toting far-right truthers. 

In the summer, French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte filed a defamation lawsuit against Owens, who has regularly and fervently spouted bizarre claims that the first lady was born male; the couple have accused her of mounting “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. Last month, Owens made the even stranger allegations that the Macrons had attempted to orchestrate her assassination (the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group, the organisation that Owens claimed was involved in the “plot”, told French media that these allegations were fake news). 

And in recent weeks, Owens has dragged herself and her followers even further down the rabbit hole by stirring up conspiracies around the death of her one-time boss, Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist and founder of conservative student group Turning Point, who was shot dead in September. Among her inflammatory claims? The suggestion that his death was somehow an “inside job” involving Turning Point employees. 

On Wednesday (3 December), Kirk's longtime producer Blake Neff finally called Owens out for spending months “attacking Charlie's closest friends”, who, he said, “have had to endure harassment from people who have gotten whipped up by what Candace is saying”. Owens is now playing an even higher stakes game, running the risk of finally alienating one-time allies on her end of the political spectrum, while also surely aware that her most devoted core of fans will expect wilder theories to come. 

So how did Owens become one of the most influential – and arguably, one of the most dangerous – woman on the internet? Her early days didn't exactly lay obvious foundations for a hard-right pivot. The third of four children, she spent her childhood in Stamford, Connecticut and, following her parents' divorce, was brought up by her grandparents. At school, she experienced racist bullying; when she was in her senior year, she received death threats from some white classmates, including the son of Stamford's then-mayor. Her family sued the Stamford Board of Education, eventually gaining a $37,500 settlement.

Around this time, she developed “an abiding interest in current affairs”, as a Tatler profile would later put it, with her political sympathies initially skewing towards the Democrats. After dropping out of a journalism degree at the University of Rhode Island, Owens interned in the fashion cupboard at America Vogue (“There was not some kind of formal hierarchy, but it was very clear that she was running the show,” a fellow intern recalled in Vanity Fair). 

She then worked her way up the ranks in administration in a New York private equity firm, before co-founding a marketing agency. Dig back into the agency's blog archives and you will find Owens mouthing off about “the bat-s**t-crazy antics of the Republican Tea Party”. But her politics would soon change drastically. In 2016, she launched a Kickstarter campaign for a platform called Social Autopsy, a searchable database of internet trolls (there is, of course, a certain irony to Owens initially touting herself as some kind of anti-cyber bullying champion). 

She is part one-woman outrage machine, part millennial version of a medieval mystic

Inevitably, it stoked criticism: wouldn't this just amount to doxxing, the typically malicious act of posting another person's private details on the internet? Owens ended up on the receiving end of online hate herself, and blamed left-wing activists. “I became a conservative overnight,” she later reflected. “I realised that liberals were actually the racists. Liberals were actually the trolls.” 

Not long after, she started posting on YouTube: her first video was a sketch in which she “came out” to her parents as a conservative. Owens positioned herself as a supporter of Trump, who was then in the early stages of his first presidency, and decried ideas around identity politics, structural racism and the Black Lives Matter movement. She particularly vehemently opposed any suggestion that African-Americans should perceive themselves as victims – and still does. 

Owens crossed paths with Kirk at a conservative conference in Florida late in 2017. “Within 30 seconds of seeing her on stage, I said to myself, “Oh my goodness, I have not seen a talent like this in my six years of politics,” Kirk later told The Washington Post. He immediately hired her to work in communications for Turning Point, and they spent the next few years touring colleges, spreading the conservative gospel. 

Around this time, Owens launched the BLEXIT Foundation, an organisation encouraging a “Black exit” from the Democrats, urging Black voters to throw their support behind the Republican party instead. Kanye West publicly supported her, writing “I love the way Candace Owens thinks” on Twitter. And she and Kirk also took their Turning Point mission overseas.

At an event in London in December 2018, Owens ended up appearing to suggest that if Hitler had simply stuck to Germany, his policies would have been “fine”. “Whenever we say ‘nationalism', the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler,” she said. “He was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine.” The “problem”, she added, was that he “had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalise.” Owens would later claim that her words had been taken out of context by “leftist journalists”, and stated that there is “no excuse or defence ever” for “everything that [Hitler] did”. 

Owens left Turning Point in 2019, but her profile continued to grow and grow. 2021 saw the launch of Candace, an online show for the conservative platform Daily Wire, co-founded by another right-wing controversy magnet, Ben Shapiro; it featured sit-down interviews with the likes of Trump, but she also used her platform to weigh in on pop culture and lifestyle topics (such as her vehement belief that women should not wear leggings outside of the gym, because doing so is indicative of “the decline of our culture”). 

But in 2024, Owens parted ways with Daily Wire, reportedly over her anti-Semitic comments (although she would later claim this was a “smear campaign” and a “ridiculous storyline”). Owens' great talent, though, is for turning controversy into content, and it wasn't long before she returned with her own venture, a self-titled podcast. Since launching in June of last year, its ascent has been dizzying: in October 2025, it ranked as the number one show across platforms in terms of downloads and views per episode, with an average of around 3.5 million downloads per show, according to analytics from Podscribe. 

The right-wing podcast sphere is booming in a way that the left can't seem to match. Just a quick glance at the US charts demonstrates the dominance of controversial conservative-skewing figures such as Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson and Theo Von. According to a Media Matters report from 2024, right-leaning online shows had nearly five times as many followers and subscribers as their left-wing equivalents. Controversy and conspiracy pay off: the more outrageous the content, the more the listeners keep coming back (not for nothing was “ragebait” announced as the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year).

It's a model that Owens has honed to perfection. Outrage drives clicks, listens and views. It keeps fans coming back. And this in turn makes advertisers sit up and take note. Her husband George Farmer, the British son of a multi-millionaire Tory peer and hedge fund manager, oversees the business side of the operation, and told Bloomberg that her advertisers “have reported seeing returns of two-to-one on dollars spent with us, and up to five-to-one reported in some cases”. 

Her huge listener base mean that the podcast can inevitably charge higher advertising rates; recent analysis from Fortune magazine suggested that her company generates up to $10m in revenues per year. And according to Farmer, only one advertiser has pulled out over the past year; the show now has almost 60 sponsors, Bloomberg reports. In 2023, her anti-trans YouTube videos were demonetised, and last year, she was temporarily suspended after violating hate speech policies, but she has since returned with a vengeance. And even if these bigger sites did ban her, she would probably follow in the footsteps of other “cancelled” right-wing figures and simply move to a new platform.

What's particularly shrewd, though, is the way Owens has a knack for throwing herself into topics that are guaranteed to creep onto your social feed. Take actor Blake Lively's legal battle against her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. Earlier this year, Owens covered the story in obsessive detail, responding to suggestions and “clues” from followers with all the zeal of a TikTok sleuth. 

Elsewhere, she borrows the aesthetic of your classic lifestyle influencer. Her website, Club Candace, doesn't exactly look like the online home of a conservative firebrand; instead of Maga red and shouty graphics, it's all swirly, cursive fonts and glowing photos of Owens. But then you look closer at the merch she's selling: the “Candace Intelligence Agency” T-shirts ($35), the “we don't know-know, but we know” sweater ($60), a slogan that gets to the heart of Owens' fast-and-loose attitude to facts, and the “conspiracy theorist” mug ($16). 

And yet with the Macron lawsuit looming, Owens may have met her match. For all the successes of her podcast, she is now facing a major legal battle. She has been asking fans to donate to her legal fund, and estimates she will need around $5m, but that feels like a conservative estimate. Should she lose, she could face millions in legal fees alone. The case of fellow right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones feels particularly pertinent here: Jones was ordered to pay around $1.4bn in total damages after the families of Sandy Hook elementary school shooting victims won two separate defamation suits against him. He has since been declared bankrupt (although he is still broadcasting).

In American defamation cases against public figures, though, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove “actual malice” , or essentially to show that the defendant knew the information they were sharing was untrue. This can be tricky to prove. In 2021, Owens was hit with a separate defamation suit by the former Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik. She claimed that Owens had smeared her with false allegations of drug use, fraud and working as a “madame” in a strip club, but the case was tossed out by a judge; Klacik ended up being required to pay her $115,000 to cover legal fees. 

Using Kirk's death as another trending topic to boost her profile looks like an ill-advised move, too. Owens is far from the only podcaster to indulge in bizarre conspiracy theories, but her personal link to Kirk, coupled with her willingness to exploit that for clicks and listens, makes the whole spectacle feel extremely murky. In aiming for Turning Point, too, she risks splitting her support base. Here, she is not going after the “establishment” or the “elite”, those bogey people of conspiratorial thinking, but her own political allies. And the signs are that Turning Point are not going to let her get away with it. 

But Candace is unlikely to let this knock her off course. For her, a backlash is likely to be seen as just another opportunity. In this respect, she is the Trump era pundit par excellence: scandals that would have ended other careers only seem to give her more fodder to feed back to her devoted followers. Until now, Owens, with all her despicable theories, has made notoriety her superpower. In today's topsy-turvy cultural climate, being the ragebait queen has served her well. It remains to be seen, however, if they make her undefeatable.

NASA and ESA both shared new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS this week, as the agencies gear up for the mysterious object's closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19.

The celebrity comet 3I/ATLAS is showing itself out of our solar system for good — but not before the cosmic paparazzi at Earth's space agencies snap some of the clearest photos of it yet.

Discovered in late June and confirmed to be the third known interstellar object in July, 3I/ATLAS has spent the past several months zooming through the inner solar system at an estimated 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h). The massive, jet-spewing snowball made its closest approaches to Mars and the sun in October. It is due for its closest encounter with Earth on Dec. 19, when it will be about 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) away — nearly twice the distance between our planet and the sun.

As the comet careens toward this astronomical milestone, spacecraft managed by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are snagging as many close-up observations as possible. This week, both agencies shared new images of the comet — proving that its recent flyby of the sun has left it very bright and active as it spews large amounts of sublimated gas and dust into space.

 




On Thursday (Dec. 4), NASA shared the latest image of 3I/ATLAS taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The glowing white dot at the center of the image shows the comet's nucleus (its main body) and coma, the bright atmosphere of gas and dust that wraps around the comet before getting funneled into its tail. In the background, stars are stretched into long streaks as Hubble's camera stays fixed on the fast-moving comet.

Comets typically brighten as they approach the sun, when the ice within them heats up and sublimates. Solar radiation pushes this gas into a tail that stretches away from the sun. Meanwhile, the warmest, sun-facing side of the comet may erupt with jets of gas and dust angled toward our star. Both of these features are faintly visible in the new Hubble image.

NASA snapped this image on Nov. 30, when Hubble was about 178 million miles (286 million km) from the comet. This is considerably closer than when Hubble first imaged the comet in late July. Although that first view showed little more than a blue blur, it nevertheless allowed scientists to constrain 3I/ATLAS' size to somewhere between 1,400 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide — likely the largest interstellar object seen to date.

New data from this image, including details of the coma's composition, has yet to be released but is likely on the way.

Also on Thursday, ESA shared its latest view of the comet, taken by the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) orbiter on its way to study Jupiter's moons for signs of life. Juice snapped the image Nov. 2, just days after 3I/ATLAS' close approach to the sun.

Located even closer to its target than Hubble (only 41 million miles, or 66 million km, away), Juice shows us a comet brimming with activity.

""Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails,"" an ESA spokesperson wrote in a statement. ""The comet's 'plasma tail' — made up of electrically charged gas, stretches out towards the top of the frame. We may also be able to see a fainter 'dust tail' — made up of tiny solid particles — stretching to the lower left of the frame.""

 




Juice observed 3I/ATLAS with five scientific instruments on two days. But besides this teaser image, we don't yet know what those instruments saw; the full data set won't reach Earth until late February 2026, according to ESA. That's because Juice is currently using its main antenna as a heat shield to protect it during its close pass of the sun, and relying on its smaller, less efficient antenna to beam its observations back to us.

—Mars orbiter narrows down the exact path of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by 'ten-fold,' surprising scientists

—Astronomers detect first 'radio signal' from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS — but it wasn't aliens

While there's little we can learn from NASA's and ESA's new images without the full complement of scientific data, it's a good reminder that human space exploration pays off in unexpected ways. Hubble and Juice number among a dozen spacecraft that have observed 3I/ATLAS from around the solar system, including Mars rovers, solar orbiters, asteroid trackers and space telescopes that were never intended to track comets.

And there's more to come: As 3I/ATLAS draws closer to Earth, the James Webb Space Telescope will take another look at it, while countless scientific observatories and amateur astronomers will have their chance to watch it as well. When you're dealing with a mysterious intruder from parts unknown, every observation matters.

Vladimir Putin's visit to New Delhi was heavy with symbolism and carefully calibrated optics, signaling to the US and its allies that India will pursue its own course towards Moscow.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin wrapped up his two-day India visit on Friday, insisting Moscow was ""ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast-growing Indian economy.""

""Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything that is required for the development of India's energy,"" Putin said at a joint press conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Both Putin and Modi agreed that the partnership between Moscow and New Delhi remained ""steady like the North Star"" through eight decades of global turbulence.

Modi also announced that Russia and India were working to conclude a free trade deal with the Eurasian Economic Union, a single market bloc that includes Russia and four other former Soviet nations.

Everything about the visit — including Modi's breach of protocol when he personally welcomed and embraced Putin on the tarmac at Palam Airport on Thursday — was carefully set up to show India's relationship with Russia remains solid despite outside pressure.

Putin's arrival marked his first visit to India since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

It comes as the US is imposing trade tariffs on India to pressure it to ditch Russian oil, and as other Western nations urge New Delhi to put more diplomatic effort towards ending the conflict in Ukraine.

In fact, ahead of Putin's visit, envoys from the UK, France, and Germany published a rare joint op-ed in an Indian newspaper, criticizing Russia for prolonging the war and urging accountability.

The Russian leader's visit has also grown into a symbol of New Delhi's defiance as it pursues ""strategic autonomy"" in its foreign affairs.

Both countries inked several agreements on migration, labor mobility, port access, shipping, and health and food safety sectors during Putin's stay in New Delhi. India hopes to significantly boost its exports to Russia in terms of pharmaceuticals, food, and consumer goods.

Ahead of the visit, the Kremlin signaled that the two sides would also discuss alternative ways of payment to bypass Western sanctions. In New Delhi, Putin announced that bilateral trade grew 12% last year, setting a new record, and is expected to exceed $100 (€95.4 billion) soon. Putin also specified that 96% of payments are now conducted in Indian rupees and Russian rubles.

Commenting on the Ukraine war, Modi said India ""has advocated for peace on the Ukraine issue from the very beginning."" 

""We welcome all efforts being made for a peaceful and lasting resolution of this matter.""

Modi's comments are in line with New Delhi's careful tightrope walk, which has sought to promote a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict while managing the competing demands of Russia as a key defense partner and the West as a vital trade partner.

This diplomatic stance has sparked anger in Washington, but Russia expert Rajan Kumar from Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) believes the US will not object too strongly to Putin's visit.

Kumar notes that the US itself is pursuing backdoor diplomatic channels to negotiate a peace settlement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

""This parallel engagement by the US creates a pragmatic understanding of India's position in maintaining dialogue with Russia,"" Kumar told DW.

However, Kumar cautions that India could lose its room for maneuver.

""Should diplomatic efforts fail to produce a resolution to the war, India could face increased pressure from Western powers, potentially resulting in additional sanctions or other restrictive measures aimed at limiting its ties with Moscow,"" he said.

In turn, foreign policy expert C Raja Mohan argues that India should navigate pressure by maintaining robust Russia ties in energy and defense, while also deepening economic cooperation with the US and Europe.

""The ongoing Ukraine negotiations could lead to an opportunity to restructure relations among the US, Europe, and Russia,"" says Mohan, arguing that India needs to strategically strengthen its ties with all three powers during this period of geopolitical realignment.

""The Ukraine conflict has revealed limitations in the West's ability to defeat Russia militarily near its borders, leading to shifts in negotiating positions,"" said Mohan, a visiting professor at Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies.

Despite New Delhi's assertive attitude towards Western pressure, measures taken by Washington and its allies have already had measurable impact. Data from October 2025 shows India has reduced its Russian oil imports by 38%, marking the biggest decline so far.

This decrease coincides with India boosting purchases from the Middle East and Africa.

The EU also has levers it can pull in New Delhi, including the not-yet-finalized free trade deal with India. However, Kumar notes that Brussels' options are limited to the the bloc's own strategic and economic vulnerabilities in the current geopolitical climate.

The analyst believes EU members will maintain a separation between security matters and trade policy.

""This pragmatic approach stems from the EU's own economic interests, especially as the bloc seeks to offset the impact of tariffs recently imposed by the Trump administration, making the India trade deal increasingly valuable to European economies,"" said Kumar.

Ajay Bisaria, a seasoned former diplomat, emphasized that President Putin's visit to India is part of a well-established annual summit tradition dating back 25 years, serving as a key platform for ongoing diplomatic engagement.

Bisaria also argues that the delicate phase of Ukraine peace negotiations is likely temper strong US and EU criticism of India's decision to host Putin.

""In short, while the US and EU will watch the summit closely, their response is expected to be restrained and pragmatic rather than confrontational,"" added Bisaria.

Amitabh Mattoo, Dean of the School of International Studies of JNU, said that that Washington, Brussels, and London should be asking a fundamental question ""Why did they lose India?""

""After more than a decade of deepening ties, the US failed to invest in and nurture the relationship, allowing it to weaken. In contrast, Russia remains a trusted ally that has consistently stood by India, underpinning their special and privileged partnership,"" Mattoo told DW.

Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz will also be present for talks on guaranteeing Ukraine's postwar security

Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Downing Street on Monday for an in-person meeting with Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz in a show of support for Ukraine.

Starmer will use the meeting with the leaders from Ukraine, France and Germany to discuss the continuing talks between US and Ukrainian officials aimed at finding an agreement on guaranteeing Ukraine's postwar security.

The four leaders took part in a virtual meeting of the “coalition of the willing” about two weeks ago, where they discussed plans to provide a European peacekeeping force that could be deployed to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire.

In a statement about the meeting released by the European Council, the trio expressed full support for “President Trump's comments that the current line of contact must be the starting point for any talks”.

The draft peace deal, quietly brokered between US and Russian officials, has been criticised for leaving Ukraine in a weak and vulnerable position. The initial draft plan, which was reportedly developed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev, would have forced draconian measures on Ukraine that would have given Russia unprecedented control over the country's military and political sovereignty, conditions that were seen as a surrender by Kyiv.

The peace plan was significantly amended by Ukraine last month, removing some of Russia's maximalist demands. Though for now, the conflict continues. On Friday night, Russia launched a drone and missile attack on Ukraine's power and transport infrastructure.

The Ukrainian military said Russia had launched 653 drones and 51 missiles on Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces downed 585 drones and 30 missiles, the military said.

Zelensky has said Ukraine's energy infrastructure was the main target for hundreds of Russian drones and about 50 missiles, with Ukrainian officials accusing Moscow of seeking to “weaponise” the cold by denying civilians access to heat and power.

Meanwhile, US and Ukrainian officials will conduct a third day of talks in Florida as Trump's administration pushes Kyiv to accept an American-backed peace plan.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has already rejected some parts of the plan, with Ukraine's territorial integrity and measures to deter future Russian attacks proving big sticking points for Moscow.

Starmer has repeatedly stressed that Ukraine must determine its own future, and said the coalition of the willing's peacekeeping force would play a “vital role” in guaranteeing the country's security.

In its new national security strategy, published overnight on Saturday, the White House said it was committed to Ukraine's survival as a “viable state”. But the strategy also prioritised improving relations with Moscow, stating that ending the war is a core US interest to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia”.

​On Saturday evening, Zelenskyy said he had held a “very substantive and constructive” call with the US envoys Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

“Ukraine is committed to continuing to work honestly with the American side to bring about real peace,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram. “We agreed on the next steps and the format of the talks with America.”

Zelenskyy, who was in Kyiv, joined the call with the senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov, and Andriy Gnatov, the chief of staff of Kyiv's armed forces, both of whom were in Miami for the talks with the US side.

The two Americans – Witkoff and Kushner, Trump's son-in-law – had been in talks with Umerov and Gnatov since Thursday.

Zelenskyy said the call with Witkoff and Kushner “focused on many aspects and quickly discussed key issues that could guarantee an end to the bloodshed and remove the threat of a third Russian invasion, as well as the threat of Russia failing to fulfil its promises, as has happened many times in the past”.

He said he was waiting a “detailed report” from Umerov and Gnatov.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

“Imagine how they behave when encountering defenseless members of our community,” Grijalva said.

In what Arizona's attorney general slammed as an “unacceptable and outrageous” act of “unchecked aggression,” a federal immigration officer fired pepper spray toward recently sworn-in Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva during a Friday raid on a Tucson restaurant.

Grijalva (D-Ariz.) wrote on social media that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers “just conducted a raid by Taco Giro in Tucson — a small mom-and-pop restaurant that has served our community for years.”

“When I presented myself as a member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,” she added.

Grijalva said in a video uploaded to the post that she was “sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others, when I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress.”

The video shows Grijalva among a group of protesters who verbally confronted federal agents over the raid. Following an order to “clear,” an agent is seen firing what appears to be a pepper ball at the ground very near the congresswoman's feet. Video footage also shows agents deploying gas against the crowd.

ICE is a lawless agency under this Administration – operating with no transparency, no accountability, and open disregard for basic due process. No family in our community should live in fear, and I will not rest until we get clear answers and accountability. pic.twitter.com/Z2mUuRxHuX

“They're targeting small mom-and-pop businesses that don't have the financial resources to fight back,” Grijalva told reporters after the incident. “They're targeting small businesses and people that are helping in our communities in order to try to fill the quota that [President Donald] Trump has given them.”

Mocking the incident on social media, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin contended that Grijalva “wasn't pepper sprayed.”

“She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement,” she added. “In fact, two law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that [Grijalva] joined.”

McLaughlin provided no further details regarding the nature of those injuries.

Democrats in Arizona and beyond condemned Friday's incident, with US Sen. Ruben Gallego writing on social media that Grijalva “was doing her job, standing up for her community.”

“Pepper spraying a sitting member of Congress is disgraceful, unacceptable, and absolutely not what we voted for,” he added. “Period.”

PRESS RELEASE: 'Disgraceful and Cowardly"" – House Dem Leaders Condemn ICE Pepper Spraying of Congresswoman Grijalva #azleg pic.twitter.com/6grALc2bvp

Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said on social media: “This is unacceptable and outrageous. Enforcing the rule of law does not mean pepper spraying a member of Congress for simply asking questions. Effective law enforcement requires restraint and accountability, not unchecked aggression.”

Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) also weighed in on social media, calling the incident “outrageous.”

“Rep. Grijalva was completely within her rights to stand up for her constituents,” she added. “ICE is completely lawless.”

Friday's incident follows federal agents' violent removal of Sen. Alexa Padilla (D-Calif.) from a June press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Congresswoman LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) was federally indicted in June for allegedly “forcibly impeding and interfering with federal officers” during an oversight visit at a privately operated migrant detention center in Newark, New Jersey and subsequent confrontation with ICE agents outside of the lockup in which US Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez, both New Jersey Democrats, were also involved.

Violent assaults by federal agents on suspected undocumented immigrants — including US citizens — protesters, journalists, and others are a regular occurrence amid the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign.

“If federal agents are brazen enough to fire pellets directly at a member of Congress, imagine how they behave when encountering defenseless members of our community,” Grijalva said late Friday on social media. “It's time for Congress to rein in this rogue agency NOW.”

            The “Wicked” musical and its offshoot movies are meant to celebrate diversity and preach radical acceptance in the face of rising fascism. The protagonist, the witch Elphaba, is consistently misjudged for her bright green skin.
    


            As “Wicked: For Good” has filled theaters and its publicity tour has circled the world, though, some fans have focused on a different matter of appearances: the women starring in the movie are really, really, really skinny — enough to draw attention and enthusiasm in the circles of the internet where users celebrate and promote eating disorders. Pictures of the “Wicked” leads, in strapless or backless red-carpet outfits that showcase their thinness, are shared as motivation for people to starve themselves or restrict eating.
    


Professional medical help and medication are often a vital part of the eating disorder recovery process. If you or a loved one are coping with an eating disorder, contact the National Alliance for Eating Disorders helpline for support at 866-662-1235.



            “I need to know her BMI so bad,” wrote one Tumblr user, of Ariana Grande, who plays the good witch, Glinda.
    


            “She's so goals,” wrote another user, along with a photo of Grande's exposed scapulas and upper chest from the “Wicked: For Good” premiere. Nearly 800 users liked the post.
    


            Oona Hanson, a parent coach specializing in eating disorders, has had parents reach out over concern about the images, even if they or their kids are excited about the movie.
    


            “Regardless of what the actual medical or health status is of these actresses, which we don't know, the ultra-thin images, I think, are very painful and can be triggering to someone who has, let's say, seen their child become emaciated from an eating disorder,” she said. “Or they know their child was looking at images that look a lot like these press tour photos.”
    


            Contemporary culture holds that it's inappropriate to discuss the bodies, and especially the weight of the bodies, of public figures. Yet images of famous bodies are still globally marketed commodities, alongside all the shared social media photos of everyone else, and people have never stopped absorbing and responding to what they see.
    


            And so, on and off social media, people are speculating about the apparent weight loss of Grande and her co-stars Cynthia Erivo and Michelle Yeoh, and debating its implications. Are they healthy? Is the movie safe for kids to watch? The actors themselves have not explicitly addressed the perceived change, although Grande pointedly reshared an interview from 2024 where she criticized constant speculation around her body, calling it “dangerous for all parties.”
    


            If young people try to match what they're seeing, though, they risk being hazardously underfed themselves. As a movie marketed toward young people, around a holiday season centered on food, “Wicked: For Good” has found itself at the center of a national conversation about weight loss, eating disorders (or ED), and the endless pursuit of thinness.
    


            “We can't just keep saying it's not your body, you can't comment on it, when not commenting on it is leading to a rise in ED culture, a rise in restrictive eating, a rise in literally just everyone wanting to be smaller,” musician Teniola Keck, who previously struggled with disordered eating, said on TikTok.
    


            Hollywood has always had a love affair with thinness, but by the 2010s, society seemed to be changing. People embraced the ideas of “body positivity” and “body neutrality” — entertainers come in all shapes in sizes, ad campaigns and media prioritize diverse body types, and resisting the urge to comment on a person's weight has become commonplace.
    


            None of that seemed to stop the pendulum from swinging. Coinciding with the rise of GLP-1 medications, skinny is now in. On fashion runways, fewer than 1 percent of looks presented in the recent season were on models considered plus-size. The weight-loss hashtag #SkinnyTok has gone viral; celebrities are mysteriously shrinking before our eyes. Serena Williams, whose athletic build made her both a target of disparagement and an exemplar of physical excellence during her career, has begun promoting GLP-1s for weight loss in retirement, calling it “health care.”
    


            All of this has left people constantly, fervently talking about bodies without even being able to agree about how to talk about bodies. After losing weight, singer Meghan Trainor — who became famous in 2014 for “bringing booty back” — released a song called “Still Don't Care” earlier this month, seemingly addressing the contention: “That's the same sh*t I've heard my whole life / Said I was too thick, then I got way too thin.” That her lyrics mirror Britney Spears' “Piece of Me” from 2007 only underscores the cyclical nature of our culture's weight obsession.
    


            Other entertainers have had more nuanced responses. Days after Trainor released her new song, Lizzo wrote about how her own body was changing, after she found exercise and Pilates in the midst of severe depression. In a public newsletter, she grappled with the timing of it all, going through her own weight loss for her own reasons when “extended sizes are being magically erased from websites. Plus sized models are no longer getting booked for modeling gigs. And all of our big girls are not-so big anymore.”
    


            Still, Lizzo wrote, if women want to change, they should be allowed to change, even as society has “a lot of work to do, to undo the effects of the ozempic boom.”
    


            It is this conversation that the “Wicked” cast landed at the center of. People can want to change their bodies. People can change their bodies. But what happens when that change is potentially harmful to others? How does anyone discuss it? Should anyone discuss it?
    


            Talking about people's bodies can be a trigger for those struggling with eating disorders, said Brianna Campos, a body image coach and therapist; the rampant media attention and before and after photos of the cast only add to that.
    


            That the conversation is about their bodies more than about their performances in the movie shows how relentless the social forces focusing on women's appearances are, Campos said. Diet culture masquerading as health and wellness profits from people obsessing over their weight.
    


            “Unless we fit the super unrealistic standard of what society says for us, you can't win. There is actually no winning,” Campos said.
    


            For Alexa Cohen, a mental health counselor for patients struggling with eating disorders, the stars' bodies were all she could think about while watching “Wicked: For Good.” As a person in recovery herself, she noticed the way the movie seemingly emphasized Grande's figure. For her patients, even those that have only seen the discourse online, seeing these “really thin and malnourished characters” be idolized can trigger their own illnesses — especially given that the actors looked different before.
    


            “I think seeing that change for them can set them back a little bit,” Cohen said. “Seeing that that can happen to somebody's body, and that they want it to happen to their body.”
    


            Studies show that eating disorders have skyrocketed since the beginning of the pandemic, said Jason Nagata, professor of pediatrics at University of California, San Francisco and adolescent eating disorder specialist. At his hospital in San Francisco, hospitalizations and referrals for eating disorders doubled. Even if not diagnosed with an eating disorder, about two-thirds of teenagers nationally are trying to change their weight or change their appearance somehow, Nagata said. Despite surface-level shifts, body dissatisfaction is “widespread.” Media is part of that.
    


            “Media portrayals matter, and are actually one of the biggest influences that we know, in the eating disorders field, to anyone's body image,” Nagata said. “But I think that teenagers and young adults are particularly susceptible.”
    


            As so many celebrities embrace GLP-1s for weight loss — either quietly or publicly — or just suddenly appear smaller, our culture's desire to be skinny is exposed again, even as our rhetoric had seemingly shifted. As with “Wicked,” that larger trend has also dragged discussion of bodies back into the forefront. The entertainment industry has always put pressure on performers to look a certain way. Those in the public eye are not immune to society's subliminal, and now not-so-subliminal, messaging about bodies. None of us are.
    


            “There's always going to be talk,” Cohen said. “But I feel like it's constant now.”
    


            In a world that's so anti-fat, decisions around weight don't happen in a vacuum, Hanson said. When constantly being told your body is wrong, is not desirable, or is not worthy of care or respect, it's hard to say changing weight is a truly individual choice.
    


            “Our preferences and desires are shaped by our culture,” Hanson said. “It's really hard to tease apart what you actually want for your own body versus what the culture is telling you you have to achieve, in order to have access to all these things that we promise people if they look a certain way.”

            Apple for decades has been known for a consistent string of design-forward, tech-defining consumer products that have shaped how people use technology.
    


            Now the company known for its steadiness is going through a shakeup at the top, as both Apple and the tech industry at large are at a crossroads.
    


            Apple announced the departures of three executive team members in less than a week. Meta poached a key Apple design leader. And speculation is mounting that Tim Cook may be preparing to step aside as CEO.
    


            The changes come as critics say Apple, once a tech leader, is behind in the next big wave: artificial intelligence. For one of the world's most valuable tech companies, a change in leadership could mean a change in how it conceives, designs and creates products used around the world every single day.
    


            “The only thing we can read into this is that we're headed to a time of increased volatility for Apple,” said Robert Siegel, a longtime venture capitalist and lecturer at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.
    


            Apple stock (AAPL) is up roughly 12% this year, a much smaller jump than the 30% increase it saw in 2024.
    


            Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            Planned departures for the following Apple executives were announced just this week:
    


            Apple is bringing in Meta chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead to lead government affairs after Adams retires and serve as its new general counsel. The environment and social initiatives teams will now report to Sabih Khan, Apple's chief operating officer. Amar Subramanya, Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, will be Apple's new vice president of AI.
    


            And earlier this year, Jeff Williams stepped back from his role as Apple's chief operating officer.
    


            Apple isn't the only tech giant making structural changes. Meta on Thursday said it's shifting some investment away from its Metaverse virtual reality project and towards AI glasses and wearables. Amazon laid off 14,000 people in October as part of a push to move faster in AI by operating more leanly. And Google last year combined its hardware and software teams to better integrate AI into its products across the board.
    


            But Apple is known for having a uniquely tight-knit company culture driven by secrecy.
    


            “This is against the typical culture of Apple. But they need to rip the Band-Aid off,” said Dan Ives, global head of tech research for Wedbush Securities. “Because the AI strategy has been invisible, and it's going to define Cook's legacy, how he handles this chapter.”
    


            The leadership shakeup comes as questions about Apple's future loom.
    


            Apple delayed a major update to its Siri voice assistant that was expected to bring it closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, turning Siri from a question-and-answer machine into an assistant that can act on a user's behalf and incorporate information from a person's phone to personalize responses.
    


            But that upgrade has been pushed off until next year, and Apple's other AI updates for iPhones, Macs and iPads have been minimal this year.
    


            And Apple's expensive Vision Pro headset, the first new computing category the company has introduced since the decade-old Apple Watch, is still a niche product.
    


            At the same time, Meta, Google, Samsung and OpenAI have announced significant product expansions in AI this year – from Meta's new Ray-Ban Display smart glasses to Google and Samsung's Gemini-powered headset and OpenAI's push into shopping and web browsers. Google's Gemini 3 model has also been making waves since its November launch.
    


            Wall Street wants answers about Apple's AI strategy. In a July earnings call, analysts asked Apple about Siri's role in driving new products and whether AI chatbots are threatening Apple's relevance in internet searches. Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, even said during his testimony in a Google antitrust hearing that people may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.
    


            Now Dye, largely the face of Apple's design studio following the 2019 departure of former design chief Jony Ive, is joining Meta to help shape what the company sees as the next wave of computing. And Ive is helping OpenAI create its first hardware product.



            Dye's decision to join Meta is “more of a direct threat to Apple” compared to the other announced departures, said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund.
    


            Despite facing pressure in AI, iPhone 17 sales have been strong and are only expected to climb higher next year. Apple is expected to surpass Samsung in smartphone shipments this year for the first time since 2011, according to Counterpoint Research. The company is also one of the few to cross the $4 trillion market capitalization threshold, along with AI giants Nvidia and Microsoft.
    


            And change isn't always a bad thing, according to Siegel, especially while industries are going through transitions as the tech sector currently is with AI. Bringing in new hires or promoting people from within can “give a different point of view when a company can get trapped in a way of thinking and doing things,” he said.
    


            That could be just what Apple needs, as some analysts say the clock is ticking for Apple to make bigger leaps in AI.
    


            “You can't have a fourth industrial revolution and watch the AI party through the windows on the outside,” said Ives. “And clearly they need massive changes in leadership.”

Russia unleashed a major missile and drone barrage on Ukraine overnight into Saturday, after U.S. and Ukrainian officials said they'll meet on Saturday for a third day of talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia unleashed a major missile and drone barrage on Ukraine overnight into Saturday, after U.S. and Ukrainian officials said they'll meet Saturday for a third day of talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war.

Russia used 653 drones and 51 missiles in the wide-reaching overnight attack on Ukraine, which triggered air raid alerts across the country and came as Ukraine marked Armed Forces Day, the country's air force said Saturday morning. 

Ukrainian forces shot down and neutralized 585 drones and 30 missiles, the air force said, adding that 29 locations were struck.

At least eight people were wounded in the attacks, Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko said.

Among these, at least three people were wounded in the Kyiv region, according to local officials. Drone sightings were reported as far west as Ukraine's Lviv region.

Russia carried out a “massive missile-drone attack” on power stations and other energy infrastructure in several Ukrainian regions, Ukraine's national energy operator, Ukrenergo, wrote on Telegram.

Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all off-site power overnight, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday, citing its Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. 

The plant is in an area that has been under Russian control since early in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and is not in service, but it needs reliable power to cool its six shutdown reactors and spent fuel, to avoid any catastrophic nuclear incidents.




Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that energy facilities were the main targets of the attacks, also noting that a drone strike had “burned down” the train station in the city of Fastiv, located in the Kyiv region.

Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses had shot down 116 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight into Saturday.

Russian Telegram news channel Astra said Ukraine struck Russia's Ryazan Oil Refinery, sharing footage appearing to show a fire breaking out and plumes of smoke rising above the refinery. The Associated Press could not independently verify the video.

The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces later said Ukrainian forces had struck the refinery. Ryazan regional Gov. Pavel Malkov said a residential building had been damaged in a drone attack and that drone debris had fallen on the grounds of an “industrial facility,” but did not mention the refinery.

Months of Ukrainian long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries have aimed to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue the war. Meanwhile, Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia is trying to cripple the Ukrainian power grid and deny civilians access to heat, light and running water for a fourth consecutive winter, in what Ukrainian officials call “weaponizing” the cold.

The latest round of attacks came as U.S. President Donald Trump's advisers and Ukrainian officials said they'll meet for a third day of talks on Saturday, after making progress on finding agreement on a security framework for postwar Ukraine. 

Following Friday's talks, the two sides also offered the sober assessment that any “real progress toward any agreement” ultimately will depend “on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace.”

The statement from U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as Ukrainian negotiators Rustem Umerov and Andriy Hnatov came after they met for a second day in Florida on Friday. They offered only broad brushstrokes about the progress they say has been made as Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a U.S.-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war. Zelenskyy wrote on X on Saturday that he had been given an update over the phone from Florida.

Separately, officials in London said the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany would participate in a meeting with Zelenskyy in London on Monday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — All around the globe, eyes focused Friday on the stage where World Cup paths were sorted, nations' names chosen one by one in a draw that determined Argentina and Lionel Messi will start their title defense against Algeria and the U.S. will open against Paraguay.

Twenty-seven months after qualifying began, teams from five-time champion Brazil to newcomers Cape Verde, Curaçao, Jordan and Uzbekistan learned their group-stage opponents in the expanded 48-nation, 104-game tournament that starts June 11 in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

“Exciting for the island, for the people there. They're so proud,” said Dick Advocaat, the 78-year-old Dutchman leading Curaçao, a Caribbean country with a population of 150,000, into an opener against four-time champion Germany.

On a day that began with snow falling on the nation's capital, the ceremony at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts included U.S. President Donald Trump receiving a newly created peace prize awarded by FIFA, soccer's governing body. Trump, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney picked up plastic spheres containing their own nations' names from bowls — Sheinbaum drew more applause from those gathered in the hall than Trump.




FIFA's lead-in show, featuring music and stars from sports and entertainment, was almost as long as a soccer match, starting in the 87th minute. Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal, Aaron Judge and Wayne Gretzky took part. New Zealand was the last orb picked.

“Just watching Americans on stage and the president giving speeches and performances, it made it feel like an American event already,” said U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams, who watched from England, where he plays for the Premier League club Bournemouth. “And I think we know the expectation of what it's going to be like when we go there and there's going to be halftime shows and there's going to be celebrities and the big draw of what America brings to sports.”




Three-time champion Argentina opens on June 16 at either Kansas City, Missouri, or Santa Clara, California. Specific sites for all group stage games and kickoff times were to be announced Saturday. The Albiceleste then face Austria and Jordan in Group J. Argentina surprisingly lost its 2022 opener to Saudi Arabia before going on to win the final over France on penalty kicks.

The United States has its opponent for the opening match of next year's World Cup hosted in North America. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports.

Messi, who turns 39 during the tournament, hasn't committed yet to playing but it would be shocking if he decided against appearing in a record sixth World Cup.

“We are just awaiting for him to decide,” coach Lionel Scaloni said. “In principle, everything is going well.”

The U.S., which reached the semifinals at the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and the quarterfinals in 2002, starts Group D against Paraguay on June 12 in Inglewood, California. The Americans play Australia seven days later at Seattle, then face Turkey, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo — one will emerge next year from playoffs — on June 25 back at SoFi Stadium. 

The Americans had friendlies against Turkey in June, Australia in October and Paraguay last month.

“We know them but they know us,” U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said.

Brimming with confidence, he defined success as: “Win the World Cup.”

Mexico hosts the tournament opener at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on June 11 against South Africa in Group A, a rematch of the 1-1 tie at the 2010 opener in Johannesburg. El Tri then meets South Korea and closes the first round against the Czech Republic, Ireland, Denmark or North Macedonia. 

Forty-two of the teams have been determined; 22 are competing in playoffs for six berths that will be decided March 31.

Winners and second-place nations from the 12 groups advance to the new round of 32 along with the top eight third-place teams. All games from the quarterfinals on will be in the U.S., culminating in the July 19 final at East Rutherford, New Jersey.

England, which won its only title in 1966, plays Croatia, Ghana and Panama in Group L. Players from Chelsea and Manchester City experienced summer U.S. conditions at this year's Club World Cup.

“It doesn't make it any easier when it comes again to blame the heat and fight against humidity and altitude and different time zones,” England manager Thomas Tuchel said. “It's just what it is. We have to find a way to dig in. We have to find a way to accept it and build a high tolerance to all these obstacles.”

Brazil opens against 2022 semifinalist Morocco, then plays Haiti and Scotland in Group C.

“It is a difficult group,” coach Carlo Ancelotti said.

Top-ranked Spain, the 2010 champion, faces Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay in Group H, while Germany follows its Curaçao match by playing Ivory Coast and Ecuador in Group E.

“It is always difficult to play as a European team against a South American team,” Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said.

Two-time champion France starts June 16 against Senegal at East Rutherford, New Jersey, or Foxborough, Massachusetts. With Les Bleus coming off their first world title, they lost 1-0 to the Lions of Teranga in the 2002 opener at Seoul, South Korea. France then faces Bolivia, Iraq or Suriname in Group I and closes perhaps the most daunting group against Norway in a matchup of Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland,

Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, like Messi expected to play in a sixth World Cup, has Group K matches against Uzbekistan, Colombia and Congo, Jamaica or New Caledonia. If Portugal and Argentina win their groups, Ronaldo and Messi could meet in a quarterfinal at Arrowhead Stadium.

Other groups include:

G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand.

B: Canada, Switzerland, Qatar and Italy, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Wales or Northern Ireland.

F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia and Sweden, Ukraine, Albania and Poland.

“Without knowing who the third opponent is, it can get difficult — specifically if Italy advances,” Canada coach Jesse Marsch said.

No team has repeated as champion since Brazil won in 1958 and '62, and only eight nations have won soccer's biggest prize. Italy has four titles and Uruguay two.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino gave Trump a large gold-colored peace prize trophy and a gold-colored medal hanging from a blue ribbon, which Trump draped around his neck. Standing next to Trump, Infantino lavished praise.

“This is truly one of the great honors of my life,” Trump said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","How a massive TV merger could raise bills and test Trump","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3906164/nexstar-tegna-local-tv-merger-trump-affordability/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

A proposed merger that would form the biggest local TV company the country has ever seen risks driving up monthly TV bills for tens of millions of Americans, undercutting President Donald Trump's affordability drive ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 

The proposed merger between Nexstar Media Group and Tegna would put nearly 80% of U.S. households under one broadcaster's reach, giving the combined company major influence over the retransmission fees that drive cable and live-TV bills.

The deal is advancing just as Trump has made affordability the centerpiece of his agenda after Republican losses in the 2025 off-year elections. But critics warn the merger, which depends on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) loosening long-standing media ownership limits, would do the opposite by driving up monthly TV bills for tens of millions of Americans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

An industry insider put it more bluntly, calling the timing “politically baffling.” 

“It seems like a bad idea to me,” the person said. “There is a lot of concern about affordability, and you're going to hear even more of it between now and the election. Moving forward with something that raises costs isn't a wise political move.”

Beyond the effect on consumer costs, journalists and media analysts warn the merger could trigger major newsroom consolidation and layoffs across the country, shrinking local reporting at a moment when many communities are already losing their only source of local news.

Under current federal rules, no broadcaster is allowed to own enough TV stations to reach more than 39% of U.S. households. But since June, the FCC, at the direction of Commissioner Brendan Carr, has been reviewing whether to keep, raise, or eliminate that Reagan-era ownership cap. The Nexstar-Tegna merger cannot move forward unless the agency changes that limit, making the ownership-cap review one of the most consequential and least understood regulatory decisions now underway in Washington.

In September, the FCC began its required four-year review of broadcast ownership rules and is now seeking public comment on whether limits like the national ownership cap should stay in place. Whatever the agency decides will directly determine whether the Nexstar-Tegna merger moves forward.

Nexstar already owns more than 200 stations, the largest of any broadcaster. Tegna owns 64 more. If the FCC relaxes the cap and signs off on the merger, the combined company would control 265 stations across 44 states and Washington, D.C., giving Nexstar nearly twice the national reach that current rules allow and dramatically reshaping the landscape of local television. 

Supporters of changing the rules say the Nexstar-Tegna merger is exposing a bigger issue: the national ownership cap itself. The FCC's 39% limit was created decades ago, when most Americans relied on a handful of broadcast channels and the internet didn't exist. Back then, regulators worried that too much ownership in too few hands would reduce local voices.

Today, industry groups argue the world has flipped. They say local TV stations are now competing with an entirely different set of giants, TikTok, YouTube, Netflix, and national cable networks, none of which face any ownership limits at all. Under those conditions, they argue, broadcasters are being forced to compete under rules written for a media landscape that disappeared years ago. 

The National Association of Broadcasters, which is not taking a position on the Nexstar-Tegna merger, has been one of the loudest voices calling for the FCC to modernize these limits so local stations can grow, invest in newsrooms, and keep live sports accessible on free over-the-air channels.

“Local broadcasters are not asking for special treatment; we are asking for the ability to compete in today's media landscape,” NAB president and CEO Curtis LeGeyt said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner. 

 “Lifting the arbitrary 39% limit … will allow station groups to invest in local journalism, sports rights and the technology that keeps communities informed during emergencies, especially in smaller markets,” he added.

TRUMP ADVISES THAT ANYONE BURNING AMERICAN FLAG WILL BE IMPRISONED FOR A YEAR 

In an interview at the Milken Institute earlier this year, FCC Chair Brendan Carr echoed those concerns, calling the national ownership cap “an arcane, artificial limit” that prevents local broadcasters from competing on equal footing with tech and streaming giants. Carr argued the rules were built for “a media marketplace that no longer exists,” and said modernizing them would help sustain local reporting at a time when many communities are losing their last remaining news sources.

NAB notes newspapers continue to shut down at a rapid pace, leaving many communities with no local reporters. They say broadcast stations are increasingly the only source of vetted, on-the-ground journalism, but can't expand or share resources across markets because of ownership caps written for the analog era.

The FCC's broader review of media ownership rules, now underway, will determine whether those limits stay in place. That decision will directly affect whether the Nexstar-Tegna merger is allowed to move forward.

A combined Nexstar-Tegna would command enormous leverage in one of the most sensitive parts of the TV business: retransmission fees, the payments cable, satellite, and live-TV streaming providers  must pay local stations to carry their channels. Those fees aren't absorbed by the companies; they are passed directly onto customers' monthly bills.

Those fees have exploded in recent years. According to an American Television Alliance analysis, broadcasters are now charging customers 2,000% more for “free” over-the-air TV than they did in 2010, even though far fewer people are actually watching broadcast channels today. The average household went from paying about $1.47 a month in retransmission fees to about $21.71, a massive jump that outpaces almost anything else in the economy. 

At the same time, consolidation has accelerated. In 2011, the five largest station owners controlled 128 stations. Today, they control nearly 700. As ownership has concentrated, retransmission fees have soared by more than 1,300%, increases that land squarely on consumers.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS

Blackouts, when negotiations break down and broadcasters pull their channels, have also surged. There have been more than 2,400 blackouts since 2010, cutting viewers off from news, sports, and major events. They almost always end the same way: with higher fees that customers ultimately pay.

Sinclair, one of the largest station groups in the country, told investors this fall that large-scale consolidation across the broadcast industry would unlock $600 million to $900 million in annual “synergies,” with the biggest gains coming from “distribution revenue optimization.” In plain terms, analysts say, that means higher retransmission fees.

Sinclair has also signaled it wants to take part in this wave of consolidation. The company is widely reported to be exploring a major transaction, potentially with E.W. Scripps, underscoring just how financially attractive the post-merger landscape could be for big station owners.

On its quarterly earnings call, Nexstar told investors the Tegna deal would produce roughly $300 million a year in combined savings and new revenue. The company's CFO added that in broadcast mergers, nearly half of the expected “synergies” usually come from net retransmission revenue,  the money broadcasters earn from carriage agreements with cable, satellite, and live-TV streaming providers. Nexstar never said those fees would increase, but the comments made clear that a major share of the financial benefit from the merger is tied to retransmission-related revenue.

A communications-industry insider said a merged company controlling two or even three of the major network affiliates in dozens of markets would have “outsized power” in fee negotiations.

“If you're a cable or streaming provider and [Nexstar owns] two or three major stations in your city, you can't lose all of them at once, your customers would revolt,” the insider said. “That kind of leverage inevitably drives prices up, and consumers pay the difference.”

A broadcast law attorney agreed, noting that when one owner controls multiple Big Four affiliates in a market, “the threat isn't losing one major network, it's losing two.” Providers, he said, “have no real alternative,” and higher fees trickle down to households because “that's how the system is designed.”

Consumers won't see any of this happening. Retransmission contracts are confidential, and providers rarely break out which stations are responsible for increases. Lines labeled “broadcast TV fee” reveal nothing about why the amount changes or who set it.

“Most people aren't going to know why their bill went up,” the attorney said. “The agreements are confidential, the increases are buried in line items, and to the average viewer, the whole process is completely opaque.”

DEMOCRATS NEED TO TEMPER THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF A 2026 BLUE WAVE

He summed up the dynamic this way: “The big get bigger. And when they get bigger, they get more leverage. That leverage translates into higher fees, and those fees show up on your bill.” 

Nexstar disputes the idea that consolidation will drive up viewers' bills. In a statement provided to the Washington Examiner, the company said the content its stations provide “includes valuable programming for cable, satellite, and streaming platforms — live sports, including the Olympics and NFL, popular prime-time entertainment shows, and local news and weather reports, and the fees we charge are commensurate with that value and the marketplace.”

When Nikki Davidson joined WOI-TV in Des Moines in 2014, the station had just been swept into Nexstar's latest buyout from Citadel. As a weekend anchor and weekday reporter, she immediately noticed how the newsroom shifted under its new corporate owner. Within days, she said, staff had already given Nexstar a nickname that stuck: “Death Star.”

Davidson said the newsroom's early optimism didn't last. Reporters were expected to produce more stories with fewer people, overtime was discouraged as workloads increased, and staffing cuts meant many journalists were covering assignments alone. 

“Good journalism takes time, and nobody had time,” she said. “When you're juggling multiple stories a day by yourself, being thorough becomes almost impossible.” 

HEGSETH SLAMS BIDEN'S ‘KID GLOVES APPROACH' TO NARCO-TERRORISM IN DEFENSE OF DRUG BOAT STRIKES

The pressure took a toll. Despite anchoring, reporting, and routinely landing lead stories, Davidson said she went into debt and ultimately left for a higher-paying job six hours away. She now works as an independent journalist. “I loved local news, but the system made it unsustainable,” she said. 

Her willingness to speak openly is rare. Many TV journalists are locked into strict contracts and noncompete clauses that can require thousands of dollars to break, leaving them fearful of challenging the country's largest station owner. 

“Everyone talks about these problems in private,” Davidson said. “But when one company owns so much of the industry, people worry about their careers if they speak up.”

Her experience reflects a broader pattern that has followed Nexstar acquisitions for more than a decade. When Nexstar bought Newport Television's stations in 2012, layoffs followed in Salt Lake City, Little Rock, and Syracuse, eliminating entire departments at some stations and cutting veteran staff with decades of experience. Similar reductions hit KLRT, KARK, and WSYR, where consolidation meant fewer photographers, fewer editors, and a heavier workload for those who remained.

In late 2024, Nexstar confirmed a company-wide workforce reduction of 2%, roughly 260 jobs, with the bulk of cuts again concentrated in its local television stations. “While it is difficult to make these sorts of changes … they will impact less than 2% of our workforce,” the company said at the time.

Davidson worries the proposed Nexstar–Tegna merger would replicate that pattern on a national scale. “You can't stretch newsrooms thinner and pretend the journalism won't suffer,” she said. “Communities will feel the impact.”

Concerns about working conditions have also surfaced in filings before federal regulators. In an Aug. 5 submission to the FCC, the National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians and the Communications Workers of America said a survey of Nexstar employees painted a troubling picture. According to the filing, a majority of respondents reported earning less than a living wage for their metro area, many said they rely on family help or public assistance to get by, and more than half said they had delayed medical treatment or buying groceries because they could not afford them.

Nexstar strongly disputes the idea that consolidation harms newsroom quality or working conditions. In a statement, spokesman Gary Weitman said the company “has a lengthy track record of providing attractive, competitive compensation packages and safe, secure working environments for our employees, including those represented by unions.” He said Nexstar intends to “protect and preserve local broadcast journalism as a critical element” of its programming and argued that the company's scale allows it to invest in local newsrooms, technology, and community-focused reporting.

TRUMP PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS: NOTABLE ACTS OF CLEMENCY IN HIS SECOND TERM

Weitman said Nexstar's growth strengthens, rather than undermines, the journalism its stations provide, pushing back on suggestions that the company's expansion is detrimental to reporters or viewers. 

Carr said in October that the commission had made no final decision on whether to lift the national ownership cap, the move required for the merger to proceed.

The stakes around that decision have only grown. Carr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on December 17, where lawmakers in both parties are expected to press him on the ownership-cap review as well as his recent demand that ABC suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live! over comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That move drew bipartisan criticism for appearing to use regulatory power in a speech dispute, an unusual controversy to surface amid an ownership review.

President Donald Trump has also expressed unease with loosening ownership limits. In a recent Truth Social post, he warned that changing the cap could strengthen networks he frequently criticizes.

For now, the merger is in a holding pattern while regulators work through the formal review process. The FCC has set its deadlines, challenges to the deal are due by December 31, replies by late January, and only after that will commissioners start weighing the full record. The agency hasn't given any hint of when it will make a final call, and these decisions often take time once the comment window closes. 

TRUMP SIGNALS CAUTION ON RAISING MEDIA OWNERSHIP LIMITS

The Justice Department is also reviewing the deal on the antitrust side, but it hasn't released a public timeline either. Both agencies have to sign off before anything can move forward.

The Washington Examiner has reached out to both the FCC and the White House for comment.

The FCC's decision early next year will determine far more than whether one merger goes forward. If regulators lift the ownership cap, Nexstar's takeover of Tegna becomes possible and could reshape the economics of local broadcasting for years. If they do not, the deal collapses immediately and the debate over media consolidation shifts back to Congress, where members of both parties are already signaling interest in tighter oversight. Either way, the decision will be felt on monthly bills, in local newsrooms, and across the political fight lines heading into 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The crypto market entered another volatile session today as several major developments converged. SpaceX shifted another large Bitcoin stack. Chainlink whales intensified accumulation. Tapzi, with its best crypto presale, advanced its early momentum while investors hunted for high-growth altcoins to invest in.

Besides these events, traders prepared for critical macro data and an options expiry that could inject fresh turbulence. Each sector now sends signals that shape sentiment across the entire ecosystem. Consequently, many investors want clarity about where the strongest opportunities may emerge next as the best altcoins to buy now.

Tapzi continues to draw rising interest due to its strong position in Web3 gaming. The platform builds a Skill-to-Earn model that rewards player performance instead of luck. This idea appeals to competitive gamers who want real fairness. It also appeals to investors who want long-term sustainability with the best altcoins to buy now for holding.



Tapzi introduces classic games such as Chess, Checkers, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Tic Tac Toe. These games run on smart contracts and require players to stake $TAPZI to enter PvP matches. The winner collects the pool. Hence, rewards come from actual gameplay and not inflationary emissions.

Furthermore, Tapzi sets its token supply at 5 billion with structured vesting. This keeps the economy transparent and predictable. Free Mode simplifies onboarding and helps casual players join without friction.

Additionally, developers gain tools, SDKs, staking modules, and a path to launch new skill-based titles. The platform also targets major investor regions across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. This helps Tapzi reach both gaming communities and capital-heavy markets. Tapzi Price: The presale price sits at $0.0035, while the launch price is set at $0.01. This early gap adds speculative interest for early buyers of this best gaming crypto to invest in.

A major market shift is forming inside Web3 gaming. Many GameFi platforms lost momentum due to bots, high inflation, and casino-style mechanics. Tapzi uses a different approach that removes unsustainable systems.

Consequently, retention improves as players gain reasons to return. Moreover, prize pools grow as the player base expands. This strengthens long-term token demand.



The global gaming market could pass $400 billion by 2028. Over 1.5 billion mobile gamers remain unlinked from Web3. This gap gives Tapzi massive room to scale. Significantly, Tapzi focuses on user experience by removing gas fees during gameplay. These details encourage mainstream adoption.

Many analysts believe the next crypto to explode may emerge from utility-driven gaming. Therefore, Tapzi sits in a strong position as interest continues to rise. Developers also want simpler tools, and Tapzi offers a launchpad specifically for them. This creates a circular ecosystem where more games attract more players and larger prize pools.

Elon Musk's SpaceX moved another batch of Bitcoin worth nearly $100 million. Arkham Intelligence tracked 1,083 BTC sent into new wallets. This marks the eighth observed transfer. Many traders think the company rotates funds for improved organization and custody. The latest activity occurred as Bitcoin fell near $91,000 ahead of key inflation data.

SpaceX still holds more than 5,000 BTC worth over $460 million. These movements follow a consistent pattern over recent months. Besides the transfer to Coinbase Prime, several hundred coins moved to fresh on-chain addresses. These addresses remain untouched after previous rotations.

Consequently, traders continue to speculate about SpaceX's long-term strategy. Some think the firm may prepare for institutional-grade custody. Others believe the company builds a deeper Bitcoin treasury structure. However, no evidence supports selling pressure from these movements. Most coins remain under the control of the main wallet cluster.

Chainlink shows signs of stabilization despite recent fluctuations. The token trades near $13.49 after a mild decline during the past 24 hours. However, the broader seven-day performance remains positive. Many traders now watch whale accumulation activity for early signals.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that whales bought over 4.7 million LINK within two days. This level of accumulation historically builds strong momentum. Additionally, Chainlink continues to secure partnerships across industries that need reliable off-chain data.



Source

Moreover, the oracle network now plays a major role inside the DeFi stack. Many protocols rely on Chainlink for accurate external data. This gives LINK long-term demand outside market hype. Hence, each accumulation event strengthens confidence among institutional and retail traders.

Chainlink whales often accumulate during uncertain conditions. This behavior usually precedes increased volatility and renewed upside interest. Consequently, traders monitor LINK closely as accumulation rises while the broader market shows cautious optimism.

Today's market narrative blends gaming innovation, whale accumulation, and major corporate Bitcoin activity. Tapzi stands out due to its sustainable Skill-to-Earn design, developer ecosystem, and strong presale structure.

Chainlink gains renewed strength from heavy whale buying and persistent network demand. SpaceX's ongoing Bitcoin rotations continue to draw attention as markets look for clues into institutional strategy.

Moreover, the broader environment remains sensitive to macro updates and options expiries. Hence, investors continue to evaluate the best altcoins to invest in with strong fundamentals and clear utility. Tapzi, Chainlink, and Bitcoin now form three major focal points as the crypto market enters another critical phase.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Milk Mocha's NFT Strategy: Collectibles With Real Demand Power","https://blockchainreporter.net/milk-mochas-nft-strategy-collectibles-with-real-demand-power/","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 19:03:06 GMT","

NFT seasons come and go, but few systems create lasting token demand the way Milk Mocha plan to. Their approach is straightforward but extremely effective: every NFT collection can only be minted with $HUGS. No credit cards, no ETH, no other tokens. That alone builds a solid utility base, and it's one reason many early buyers see this as one of the best presale crypto opportunities. The presale isn't just about accumulating tokens, it's about preparing to secure valuable NFTs, upgrades, and in-world benefits that fans and collectors already want. This isn't hype-driven collecting; it's access-driven ownership that ties future value to genuine ecosystem use. Fans aren't showing up to flip JPEGs, they're here to earn privileges, unlock experiences, and fuel scarcity with every token spent.

In most projects, NFTs are optional. Sometimes they're paid with native tokens, sometimes not. Here, they're locked into the economy permanently, $HUGS or nothing. That design decision does two big things:• Guarantees token demand every time a new collection drops• Aligns NFT excitement directly with token circulationCollectors and gamers already see it, early token supply equals future NFT firepower. The NFT collections are not meant as standalone art sales. They are designed as entry passes to content, perks, and early drops across the Milk Mocha world. That's why this best presale crypto narrative hits differently, the NFTs are proof of participation and access, not speculation objects. This means each drop becomes an event, each event becomes a demand spike, and the demand cycle repeats as the universe grows. It's a system designed to stay active, not fade.

The NFT economy here has depth. A token spent doesn't just buy art, it buys advantages. Holders gain access to:• Exclusive mini-games• Special playable perks• Priority access to merch releases• Early entry into seasonal events• Cosmetic and rarity unlocks

These aren't vanity passes, they're functional assets inside a growing entertainment world. And when NFTs tie into experiences, players naturally hold them longer and interact more. Add to that a cute IP millions already love, and you get behavior based on joy, not just profit-chasing. Investors searching for the best presale crypto rarely get to see an ecosystem where NFT demand comes from nostalgia, gameplay, brand loyalty, AND deflationary mechanics. $HUGS has all of those factors, which is why the presale is drawing not only Web3 traders but mainstream fans too.

Here's where things get fun, and deflationary. Instead of simply holding NFTs, players can strengthen them by burning $HUGS. Burn to advance. Burn to unlock new traits. Burn to show status.This creates a strategic tension:• Mint NFTs OR burn tokens to upgrade them• Spend $HUGS OR hold for future opportunities• Choose personal power OR circulating scarcityNo matter which choice users make, supply shrinks. Token burning becomes part of gameplay identity. That's a powerful mechanic, and it's self-driven by user pride and customization. Fast-moving traders ask what the best presale crypto is, while passionate communities ask how they can stand out inside the ecosystem they love. $HUGS taps into the second mindset, the one that sticks through cycles. People burn when they care. People participate when they feel connected. And this system ensures both behaviors feed token value over time.

The brilliance of Milk Mocha's NFT system isn't just the exclusivity or the burns, it's the emotional factor layered into the economics. Fans already want to own Milk Mocha collectibles. Crypto users already want functional NFTs. Now both groups meet inside one marketplace, powered entirely by $HUGS.The result is:• Built-in buyer demand• Deflation that accelerates with fandom• Token spending tied to fun, not speculation• NFT ownership tied to identity and status

That's why this presale isn't chasing hype, it's capturing love. Each NFT season will spark new waves of demand, each upgrade burns more supply, and each participant becomes part of a growing lore-driven community. This is the type of foundation long-term holders look for when choosing the best presale crypto opportunity, not just charts, but culture backed by real token mechanics.

Milk Mocha don't treat NFTs as hype tools, they treat them as membership, achievement, and world-building tools. Every design choice pushes users to engage, spend, upgrade, and stay connected. Scarcity rises with every mint and every burn, while holders gain identity and experiences instead of static assets. This deflation-plus-utility loop is attracting collectors, gamers, and emotional brand fans all at once, a rare blend. And it's why many see $HUGS as one of the best presale crypto plays right now. It's not just a token, it's a ticket into a universe where scarcity grows and joy fuels participation.

by Todd Bishop on Dec 6, 2025 at 10:23 amDecember 6, 2025 at 10:53 am

LAS VEGAS — Speaking this week on the Amazon Web Services re:Invent stage, AWS executive Colleen Aubrey delivered a prediction that doubled as a wake-up call for companies still thinking of AI as just another tool.

“I believe that over the next few years, agentic teammates can be essential to every team — as essential as the people sitting right next to you,” Aubrey said during the Wednesday keynote. “They will fundamentally transform how companies build and deliver for their customers.”

But what does that look like in practice? On her own team, for example, she challenged groups that once had 50 people taking nine months to deliver a new product to do the same with 10 people working for three months.

Meanwhile, non-engineers such as finance analysts are building working prototypes using AI tools, contributing code in Amazon's Kiro agentic development tool alongside engineers and feeding those prototypes into Amazon's famous PR/FAQ planning process on weekly cycles.

Those are some of the details that Aubrey shared when we sat down with her after the keynote at the GeekWire Studios booth in the re:Invent expo hall to dig into the themes from her talk. Aubrey is senior vice president of Applied AI Solutions at AWS, overseeing the company's push into business applications for call centers, supply chains, and other sectors.

Continue reading for takeaways from the conversation, watch the video below, and listen to the conversation starting in the second segment of this week's GeekWire Podcast. 

The ‘teammate' mental model changes everything. Aubrey draws a clear line between single-purpose AI tools that do one thing well and the agentic teammates she sees emerging — systems that take responsibility for whole objectives, and require a different kind of management. 

“I think people will increasingly be managers of AI,” she said. “The days of having to do the individual keystrokes ourselves, I think, are fast fading. And in fact, everyone is going to be a manager now. You have to think about prioritization, delegation, and auditing. What's the quality of our feedback, providing coaching. What are the guardrails?”

Amazon Connect crosses $1 billion. AWS's call center platform reached $1 billion in annual revenue on a run rate basis, with Aubrey noting it has accelerated year-over-year growth for two consecutive years. 

This week at re:Invent, the team announced 29 new capabilities across four areas: Nova Sonic voice interaction that Aubrey says is “very close to being indistinguishable” from human conversation; agents that complete tasks on behalf of customers; clickstream intelligence for product recommendations; and observability tools for inspecting AI reasoning. 

One interesting detail: Aubrey said she's often surprised by Nova Sonic's sophistication and empathy in complex conversations — and equally surprised when it fails at basic tasks like spelling an address correctly. 

“There's still work to do to really polish that,” she said.

The ROI question gets a “yes and no.” Asked whether companies are seeing the business value to justify AI agent investments, Aubrey offered a nuanced response. “I observe companies to struggle to realize the business impact,” she said. But she said the value often shows up as eliminating bottlenecks — clearing backlogs, erasing technical debt, accelerating security patching — rather than immediate revenue gains. 

“I'm not going to see the impact on my P&L today,” she said, “but if I fast forward a year, I'm going to have a product in market where real customers are using and getting real value, and we're learning and iterating where I might not have even been halfway there in the past.” 

Her advice for companies still hesitating: “If you don't start today, that's a one way door decision… I think you have to start the journey today. I would suggest people get focused, they get moving, because if you don't, I think that becomes existential.”

Trust requires observability. Aubrey says companies won't get full value from AI teammates if they can't see how they're reasoning. 

“If you don't trust an AI teammate, then you're never going to realize the full benefit,” she said. “You're not going to give them the hard tasks, you're not going to invest in their development.” 

The solution is treating AI inspection the same way you'd manage a human colleague: understand why it took an action, audit the quality, and iterate. 

“You can refine your knowledge bases. You can refine your workflows. You can refine your guardrails, and then confidently keep iterating… the same way we do with each other. We keep iterating, we keep learning, and we keep getting better,” she said.

Product updates: Beyond Connect, Aubrey offered updates on other parts of her portfolio of Amazon's applied AI solutions. 

She teased “a few other new investment areas” expected to come in early 2026.

Some of it I recognize as being an artefact of the time, when conciseness really mattered. But it's still obnoxious in 2025.The whole thing reminds me of D&D, which is full of classes & spells that only exist in modern D&D because of One Guy who happened to be at the table with Gygax, who really wanted to be a wuxia guy he saw in a movie, or because he really wanted a spell to be applicable for that one night at the table, and now it's hard-coded into the game.

Perl is not that good a language though for practical purposes. The same way, a breadboard contraption is not what you want to ship as your hardware product, but without it, and the mistakes made and addressed while tinkering with it, the sleek consumer-grade PCB won't be possible to design.

With a team where everybody wrote it in a similar style, Perl did perfectly well. Mod_perl was fast. I liked Perl.Then Django came out, and then Numpy, and Perl lost. But Python is still so incredibly slow....

Idk about Haskell, but I used Erlang which is also purely functional. No matter how long I used it and tried to appreciate its elegance, it became clear this isn't a convenient way to do things generally. But it was designed well, unlike Scala.

Perl lets every developer write Perl in their own idiosyncratic way.And every developer does.It makes for very un-fun times when I'm having to read a file that's been authored by ten developers over ten years, each of whom with varying opinions and skill levels.I guess in 2026, it'll be 11 developers writing it over 11 years. My sincere apologies to those who come after me, and my sincere fuck-you to those who came before me. :)

This is why Perl was quite fit for the job at the dawn, or, rather, the detonation phase of the Internet explosion in late 1080s and early 1990s, along with Lisp and Smalltalk that promote similar DIY wizardry values. But once the industry actually appeared and started to mature, more teamwork-friendly languages like Java, PHP, and Python started to take over.

Things that are cheap to check should be checked first unless they are really unlikely. You change the numbers game from trying to make the biggest cleaving lines possible, to smaller bites that can be done rapidly (and perhaps more importantly, mentally cheaply).Code smells chum the waters. Because where there is smoke sometimes there is fire, and code smells often hide bugs. You get into Tony Hoare's Turing award speech; either no bugs are obvious, or there are no obvious bugs.So I end up making the change easy and then making the easy change because we have more code each week so the existing code needs to be simpler if someone is going to continue to understand the entire thing.Perl doesn't seem to have figured this out at all.

Unfortunately, as a former Perl dev, it makes a lot of other environments feel bland. Often more productive yes, but bland nonetheless. Of the newer languages, Nim does have that non-bland feel. Whether it ends up with significant adoption when Rust and Golang are well established is a different story.

Perl was an early dynamic (garbage collected) “scripting language” but no more advanced than its contemporary python in this regard.It had the weird sigils due to a poor design choice.It had the many global cryptic variables and implicit variables due to a poor design choice.It has the weird use of explicit references because of the bad design choice to flatten lists within lists to one giant list.It actually was the one thing you said it wasn't - a good practical general language at least within web and sysadmin worlds. At least until better competitors came along and built up library ecosystems.

reply

His point about references is no small thing. Other dynamic languages don't make users think much about the distinction between references and values at the syntax level. With Perl you needed to use “->” arrow operator frequently if and only if you were using references. So getting at a map inside an array or vice versa had its own syntax vs reading a string in a map or array.Also it had bolted on, awkward OO on top of the bolted on, awkward params passing.  You literally had to shift “self” (or “this”) off a magical array variable (@_).By default it wouldn't warn if you tried to read from an undeclared variable or tried to use one in a conditional or assign from one. You had to declare “use strict;” for that. Which wasn't hard! But these awkward things piled up, a bunch of small cuts. Don't forget “use warnings;” also, another thing to put at the top of every Perl file.To the extent its awkward syntax came out of aping of shell and common Unix cli tools, you could maybe see it as cultural issue if you squint.But any language in the mid 90s was infected with the “rtfm” priesthood vibe the author writes about, because the internet then was disproportionately populated by those sysop types, especially the part that can answer programming language questions on usenet, which is basically where you had to ask back then.So for example Rails won for technical reasons, it is much more concise with fewer footguns than its Perl equivalents. I was actively coding web stuff in Perl when it came along and early switched. It wasn't a cultural thing, having choice in Perl was fine (and ruby has sadly never grown much culture outside Rails - it could really use some). It probably did help that it came along in the mid aughts by which time you could ask questions on the web instead of Usenet. And it used YouTube for that first rails demo. So ruby did end up with a less sysopy culture but that had more to do with the timing of its success than the success itself.

But, shell scripting has already become somewhat of an arcane skill. I think the article nailed that Perl was just too hard to learn for the value it provided to survive. Python is not nearly as, erm, expressive as perl for working in that space, but it is much easier to learn, both in terms of reading and writing. In other words, it encourages broadly maintainable code. Ruby is quite similar (although I think people massively overstate how much the language itself generally encourages understandable semantics)

GvR explicitly describes the motivation behind Python in similar terms (I can probably find a timestamp in that recent documentary for this).

Python is a crappy shell scripting language because the syntax around pipe and subprocess is really clunky.Perl managed to have decent data structures and also have decent syntax around subprocess calls.But I feel like the Python invoke module gives me everything I need wrt subprocess calls.

Because of this, in practice, the amount of system administration mantainence and care needed for perl programs is far, far less than other languages like python where you actually do have to go in and re-write it all the time due to dep hell and rapid changes/improvements to the language. For corporate application use cases these re-writes are happening anyway all the time so it doesn't matter. But for system administration it's a significant difference.

A shift to Python or Ruby is fundamentally a shift to a different set of core cognitive patterns. This influences how problems are solved and how sense is made of the world, with the programming languages being tools to facilitate and, more often than not, shepherd thought processes.The culture shift we have seen with corporations and socialized practices for collaboration, coding conventions, and more coincides with the decline of a language that does in fact have a culture that demands you RTFM. Now, the dominant culture in tech is one that either centralizes solutions to extract and rent seek or that pretends that complexity and nuance does not exist so as to move as quickly as possible, externalizing the consequences until later.If you've been on this forum for a while, what I am saying should seem familiar, because the foundations have already been laid out in ""The Pervert's Guide to Computer Programming"", which applies Lacanian psychoanalysis to cognitive patterns present in various languages[1][2].

In many ways it was easier because so much hay was made about it there was a lot of knowledge and tooling.

Imagine if the same interpreter supported both Python 3 and Python 2. Python 3 code could import a Python 2 module, or vice versa. Codebases could migrate somewhat more incrementally. Python 2 code's idea of a ""string"" would be bytes, and python 3's idea of a ""string"" would be unicode, but both can speak the other's language, they just have different names for things, so you can migrate.

reply

They should've just used Python 2's strings as UTF-8.  No need to break every existing program, just deprecate and discourage the old Python Unicode type.  The new Unicode type (Python 3's string) is a complicated mess, and anyone who thinks it is simple and clean isn't aware of what's going on under the hood.Having your strings be a simple array of bytes, which might be UTF-8 or WTF-8, seems to be working out pretty well for Go.

The original intent was you could see var types with them - $scalar, @array, %hash.They immediately broke this by deciding the sigil would apply to the value /extracted/ from the data structure. So you declared array @foo but accessed an element as $foo[1]. What? There's a logic there but already you're violating many people's expectations so why even have them. The sigils are now confusing many people instead of clarifying anything.The sigil idea then /completely/ failed when they introduced references and “complex data structures” (nesting arrays within arrays like every other language - in Perl this was a special thing because they had been flattening lists by default so no way to put one inside another).So now to get at a hash in a hash you used not % but $ since a reference is a scalar. $hash1->$hash2->{“key”}. Versus $hash3{“key”} for a simple hash. Just awful noisy syntax. Due to poor language design up front.

The sigils are now confusing many people instead of clarifying anything.The sigil idea then /completely/ failed when they introduced references and “complex data structures” (nesting arrays within arrays like every other language - in Perl this was a special thing because they had been flattening lists by default so no way to put one inside another).So now to get at a hash in a hash you used not % but $ since a reference is a scalar. $hash1->$hash2->{“key”}. Versus $hash3{“key”} for a simple hash. Just awful noisy syntax. Due to poor language design up front.

This perl syntax caused some kind of rejection on almost physical level. It was same for many of my friends. ""Zen of python"" was a breath of fresh air.

reply

Technically you are allowed to use % like so: %{$hash1->{“hash2”}}. Which, just - lol.

This kind of ubiquitous availablility (from early popularity) combined with the huge drop-off in popularity due to raku/etc, lead to a unique and very valuable situation unmatched by any other comparable language. Perl just works everywhere. No containers, no dep hell, no specific versions of the language needed. Perl is Perl and it does what it always has reliably.I love it. The decline was a savior.

By comparison, Python can barely go one version without both introducing new things and removing old things from the language, so anything written in Python is only safe for a a fragile, narrow window of versions, and anything written for it needs to keep being updated just to stay where it is.Python interpreter: if you can tell ""print"" is being used as a keyword rather than a function call, in order to scold the programmer for doing that, you can equally just perform the function call.

Overwhelmingly, what gets removed is from the standard library, and it's extremely old stuff. As recently as 3.11 you could use `distutils` (the predecessor to Setuptools). And in 3.12 you could still use `pipes` (a predecessor to `subprocess` that nobody ever talked about even when `subprocess` was new; `subprocess` was viewed as directly replacing DIY with `os.system` and the `os.exec` family). And `sunau`. And `telnetlib`.Can you show me a real-world package that was held back because the code needed a feature or semantics from the interpreter* of a 3.x Python version that was going EOL?> Python interpreter: if you can tell ""print"" is being used as a keyword rather than a function call, in order to scold the programmer for doing that, you can equally just perform the function call.No, that doesn't work because the statement form has radically different semantics. You'd need to keep the entire grammar for it (and decide what to do if someone tries to embed a ""print statement"" in a larger expression). Plus the function calls can usually be parsed as the statement form with entirely permissible parentheses, so you have to decide whether a file that uses the statement should switch everything over to the legacy parsing. Plus the function call affords syntax that doesn't work with the original statement form, so you have to decide whether to accept those as well, or else how to report the error. Plus in 2.7, surrounding parentheses are not redundant, and change the meaning:  $ py2.7 
  Python 2.7.18 (default, Feb 20 2025, 09:47:11) 
  [GCC 13.3.0] on linux2
  Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
  >>> print('foo', 'bar')
  ('foo', 'bar')
  >>> print 'foo', 'bar'
  foo bar

The incompatible bytes/string handling is also a fundamental shift. You would at least need a pragma.

Using venvs is trivial (and orders of magnitude more lightweight than a container). And virtually every popular package has a policy of supporting at least all currently supported Python versions with each new release.You need to set up a venv because of how the language is designed, and how it has always worked since the beginning. Python doesn't accommodate multiple versions of a package in the same runtime environment, full stop. The syntax doesn't provide for version numbers on imports. Imports are cached by symbolic name and everyone is explicitly expected to rely on this for program correctness (i.e., your library can have global state and the client will get a singleton module object). People just didn't notice/care because the entire ""ecosystem"" concept didn't exist yet.I have at least one local from-source build of every Python from 3.3-3.14 inclusive (plus 2.7); it's easy to do. But I have them explicitly for testing, not because using someone else's project forces me to. The ecosystem is just not like that unless perhaps you are specifically using some sort of PyTorch/CUDA/Tensorflow related stack.> It's the standard now because system Python can't do it.Your system Python absolutely can have packages installed into it. The restrictions are because your Linux distro wants to be able to manage the system environment. The system package manager shouldn't have to grok files that it didn't put there, and system tools shouldn't have to risk picking up a dependency you put there. Please read https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/, especially the motivation and rationale sections.> major breakages in point version upgradesI can think of exactly one (`async` becoming a keyword, breaking Tensorflow that was using it as a parameter name). And they responded to that by introducing the concept of soft keywords. Beyond that, it's just not a thing for your code to become syntactically invalid or to change in semantics because of a 3.x point version change. It's just the standard library that has changes or removals. You can trivially fix this by vendoring the old code.

Taking custom loops to a whole 'nother level.

We're back with another classic from TrashBench, the ingenious modder who has previously dunked GPUs into transmission fluid to cool them. Perhaps that's not very convenient, so why not try something far more feasible and, maybe even genuinely practical? Taking an air cooler, dismantling it, and turning it into a Frankenstein AIO that can tame GPUs like it's a walk in the park.

Our journey starts with a Thermalright Peerless Assassin, a competent cooler on its own, but clearly, there's room for improvement. One by one, the fins from its heatsink are removed until the heatpipes running through the finstack are exposed just enough. Then, a disc cutter is carefully run through the top to get access to the magic sauce.

For those unaware, the heatpipes inside an air cooler are hollow, with a small amount of liquid inside that evaporates and condenses during heat cycles, acting as a phase-change system. That's enough to cool a CPU when combined with fans on either side. So, when we cut the tops off the pipes, we see channels inside leading directly to the base plate, which enables this madness.

Thin water tubes are connected and secured to these pipes, and once initial leaks are fixed, a pump at the other end successfully injects green-colored water through them, bringing this custom apparatus to life. It's time for testing, and an MSI RTX 3070 is the first recipient of this honor.

After being stripped down to expose the die, the DIY cooler is retrofitted on top with surprising conviction, and the whole thing is put on a test bench. On the side is a portable ice chiller, on which a 12V diaphragm pump is mounted to power the entire setup. Once turned on, ice-cold water flows through the heat pipes, touching the 3070's GPU, which sits at a casual -14 degrees Celsius.

 




Owing to his name, TrashBench runs a bunch of games and benchmarks on this new below-zero RTX 3070, and compared to the stock results, we see an average 10% uplift across the board. The unlocked cooling headroom enables a +320 MHz overclock that delivers decent improvements, but it's not drastic.

 




This is where the GTX 960 comes in.

The same story follows: the graphics card is disassembled, and its stock cooler/shroud is replaced with our mighty water-injected cooler. But the results here are far more impressive; Cyberpunk 2077 shows a massive 21% increase in FPS, while COD: Black Ops 7 demonstrates a 220 MHz uplift in boost clocks. Overall, across all tests, the GTX 960 saw a ~17% performance bump.

TrashBench doesn't declare the experiment a success or a failure at the end. Still, we're pretty confident in singing its praises — this seems like a legit upgrade to an existing air cooler, turning it into a pseudo AIO that can help overclock GPUs without requiring a full-blown liquid nitrogen setup. It's wild but just accessible enough to be something truly special, adding the ""fun"" in functional.

ATLANTA — The countdown to the World Cup is on and the U.S Men's National Team learned who they will be facing in the group stage.

Someone who knows the World Cup well? Former Atlanta United goalkeeper Brad Guzan made the USMNT roster for the 2010 World Cup and played in the 2014 World Cup. 

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]

Guzan visited our WSB-TV studios and spoke to Channel 2's Linda Stouffer on his experience and what to expect in Atlanta.

“What is it really like to be at the World Cup?” Stouffer asked Guzan.

“It's something that you're proud to represent your team. You're proud to put that jersey on. But when you have backing of the entire country during that one moment ... that gives you goosebumps. That gives you chills, that's what you strive for as a kid, the ultimate dream.”

That ultimate dream will be playing out over eight matches in Atlanta next summer. Atlanta will host five group stage matches, a Round of 32, a Round of 16 and a semifinal match. We'll find out the schedule on Saturday. 

But there's all the additional events in and outside Mercedes-Benz Stadium too. It's a place that Guzan called home for nine seasons with Atlanta United. 

“We know the stadium itself is brilliant from a fans' perspective,” Guzan said. “But from a players perspective, it's unbelievable to go in there, to walk out of the tunnel to feel the emotional as you go out on the field. Something that they'll cherish forever.”

MetLife Stadium will play host to powerhouses France, Germany, and England during its five group-stage matches at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as revealed during the competition's schedule reveal on Saturday afternoon. 

The newly expanded field of 48 nations was divided into 12 four-team groups on Friday at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. It was already known that MetLife Stadium, located just a stone's throw away from New York City, would host matches from Groups C, E, I, and L in the opening two weeks of the tournament.

Here is the local, full schedule of the festivities descending upon the Meadowlands:
MetLife Stadium 2026 World Cup group stage schedule

Saturday, June 13: Brazil vs. Morocco, 6 p.m. ET (Group C)
Tuesday, June 16: France vs. Senegal, 3 p.m. (Group I)
Monday, June 22: Norway vs. Senegal, 8 p.m. (Group I) 
Thursday, June 25: Ecuador vs. Germany, 4 p.m. (Group E)
Saturday, June 27: Panama vs. England, 5 p.m. (Group L)

MetLife Stadium could not have asked for a bigger opening match. Brazil is the most successful nation at the World Cup, with five titles, while Morocco is the most successful African country, having been the first from the continent to reach the semifinals three years ago in Qatar.

Kylian Mbappe and France will face Sadio Mane and Senegal in a rematch of the 2002 World Cup opener in South Korea, which featured one of the biggest upsets in the competition's history when Papa Bouba Diop's goal lifted the African nation over, at the time, the defending world champions.
“It certainly was a long night,” Manolo Zubiria, 2026 FIFA World Cup chief tournament officer, said. “The minute the last team was drawn, it was already from earlier on, a large group of FIFA colleagues present who tried to put together this puzzle. As you can imagine, so many different factors played a part. We tried to strike the right balance when looking at the preparation and recovery these teams have to do… We tried to minimize travel for the teams and their fans and try to best expose this competition to the world, try to find the right kick-off times… ultimately, that's what we achieved through the night.”
The group stage is, of course, just an appetizer of MetLife Stadium's role as one of the host sites. Following a Round of 32 and Round of 16 match, the home of the Giants and Jets will play host to the World Cup Final — the largest singular sporting event on the planet.

Seattle Sports

The matchups and kickoff times for the four group-stage World Cup matches in Seattle next summer were announced by FIFA on Saturday morning.

The headliner is the United States-Australia matchup, which will take place July 19 at noon.

The other three group-stage matches in Seattle are Belgium vs. Egypt (June 15 at noon), Qatar vs. one of the European playoff winners (June 24 at noon) and Egypt vs. Iran (June 26 at 8 p.m.).

Seattle also will host a pair of knockout-stage matches – a round-of-32 match on July 1 and a round-of-16 match on July 6.

Seattle is one of 16 North American cities that will host the 2026 World Cup.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew react to USMNT's 2026 FIFA World Cup group draw. (3:17)

WASHINGTON -- FIFA announced the start times for the tournament's 104 matches on Saturday, a day after the draw for the expanded 48-nation tournament, with the final set to kick off at 3 p.m. ET on July 19.

The kickoff time for the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, allows for prime-time viewing in continental Europe, where it will be 9 p.m., and Britain, where it will be 8 p.m.

The average 3 p.m. temperature over the past 30 years in East Rutherford on July 19 is 83 degrees with a RealFeel index of 89, according to AccuWeather.

Nine of the 10 World Cup finals from 1978 through 2014 started in the 2-3:30 p.m. ET range. The exception was in 2002 in Japan, which began at 7 a.m. ET. The 2018 final started at 11 a.m. ET and the 2022 championship of a tournament shifted to winter in Qatar at 10 a.m. ET.

The 1994 final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, kicked off at 3:30 p.m. ET.

The World Cup opener at Mexico City on June 11 between El Tri and South Africa will start at 3 p.m. ET.

Semifinals will start at 3 p.m. ET on July 14 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and 3 p.m. the following day at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, both of which have retractable roofs.

FIFA announced on Feb. 4 last year that the final was scheduled for New Jersey, and that June 12 revealed site-specific matchups for games in the new round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals and semifinals.

Seventy-eight games will be in the U.S., including all from the quarterfinals on, and 13 apiece in Canada and Mexico.

During an event at the Capital Hilton, FIFA also announced sites of the 54 group stage games not finalized with Friday's draw, which fixed venues for only Groups A, B and D, which include co-hosts Mexico, Canada and the United States.

South Korea is the only team other than Canada and Mexico with no games in the U.S., playing its opener in Guadalajara against the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland or North Macedonia, then facing El Tri at the same venue and finishing the round against South Africa in Monterrey.

The U.S. first-round games will be a 9 p.m. ET start against Paraguay at Inglewood on June 12, a 3 p.m. ET kickoff vs. Australia at Seattle seven days later, and a 7 p.m. start on June 25 at SoFi against Turkiye, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo.

President Donald Trump praises the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., on Friday while speaking to Republican lawmakers and members of his Cabinet at a White House event.

President Donald Trump praised the success of the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., on Friday, where he was honored with the first-ever FIFA Peace Prize at the event meant to set the stage for the global sporting event coming to the United States next year. 

Speaking ahead of a private concert by Andrea Bocelli at the White House, the president thanked the Italian tenor for his opening performance at the Kennedy Center. Trump also remarked on the success of the draw and claimed that more than ""a billion people"" tuned in to watch the participating nations learn their fate for the tournament beginning in June.

""He was so good today at the FIFA Award,"" Trump began, speaking about Bocelli. ""It was an award for me, I can tell you. But it was a draw. And they say over a billion people were watching and there was no way you could beat tonight what you did today because that was one of the greatest openings to an event that I've ever seen. And he was in rare form."" 

""What you did this morning was incredible, so thank you very much.""

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The U.S. got a favorable draw in the group stage for the 2026 World Cup. Their first match is against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium on June 12 -- one of eight matches being played in Inglewood.

They'll go on to then face Australia on June 19 in Seattle. Defending champion Argentina will open the World Cup against Algeria.

With the World Cup almost six months away, the countdown is officially on for many soccer fans in Los Angeles.

""I think the environment is going to be so much fun for the fans, both outside the stadium and inside the stadium. There's really not a bad seat. I'm excited to be one of those fans cheering the U.S. on,"" said FIFA Women's World Cup champion Mia Hamm.





The L.A. Host Committee has been planning for the World Cup for eight years, and there will be eight matches held in Los Angeles over the course of the 39-day tournament.

Tourism is one of the many drivers of L.A.'s economy, with over 540,000 residents who earn a living in tourism.

""Because this is the largest World Cup in history, you have to first look at the economic impacts. We're expecting to see over half a billion dollars of new revenues for our local business community because of the World Cup, and thousands of new jobs. That's an amazing opportunity,"" said Adam Burke, the president and CEO of the L.A. Tourism and Convention Board.

Host nations for the 2026 World Cup are the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The U.S. has positive recent experience against Paraguay and australia, having beaten both teams 2-1 in recent games.

""Only 65,000 people will get tickets to a match at SoFi Stadium. We have a much bigger population here, plus a much bigger population of people that are going to visit our city,"" said Kathryn Schloessman, the CEO of the L.A. 2026 World Cup Host Committee. ""Many people will come to our city and not even go to a match. We want to make sure they have a great experience.""

""We're actually putting together a 39-day programming calendar that highlights all parts of L.A. so that fans from around the world can take advantage of all that L.A. has to offer. That includes the official fan fest, the watch parties, and so many activations, including our arts and cultural community,"" Burke said.





At the Soccer+ sports shop in Pasadena, the owner and some of his customers said they watched the World Cup Draw live.

Josef Momjian has had his shop in Pasadena for nearly 40 years.

""The advantage is that they're playing at home,"" Momjian said of the U.S.' chances in the first round. ""The crowd, the fans, they're going to be behind them to win something. I believe, at least, they pass the group, and we'll see how it goes from there.

The U.S.' group includes Paraguay, Australia and a team from a playoff match.

Mexico will host the first match of next summer's World Cup against South Africa. Canada's first match will be against a playoff team to be determined.

The conversation is buzzing on who will do well, and can the U.S. do well in this field?

""I think they're going to have a tougher time than Mexico making it to the next round, because they have, I think, tougher opponents,"" said Felipe Velasco from Pasadena.

World Cup merchandise, from jerseys to balls, is already on sale at Southland sports shops.

Andrew Velasco says he hopes the world's best footballers coming to North America will make the world's most popular sport even more popular here in the U.S.

""It kind of represents a lot of what America is. It's just a blend of people from different parts of the world celebrating where they're from, and being able to celebrate it here means a lot to a lot of people,"" Andrew Velasco said.

The last time the World Cup football was played in the United States was 1994. The last World Cup at 32 teams, but this time around, 48 countries will be represented. Every single country that will compete in the tournament next summer has representation in Southern California.","{'href': 'https://abc7.com', 'title': 'ABC7 Los Angeles'}","soccer"

The winger, who has been a steady contributor for the MLS Cup hopefuls, talked to GOAL about his impressive season since returning to North America

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Emmanuel Sabbi knew Vancouver had what it takes from early on. All of the signs were there: a manager in Jesper Sorensen who was locked in and invested, a motivated squad, and a fanbase that was truly willing to get behind the team. 

""When I got here, I saw the firepower we had. It's been next man up mentality since Day 1, since I got here, and we've really shown that, and it looked prevalent early. You know, our coach demands a lot from us,"" he tells GOAL. 

But could he have ever hoped that they would be playing in MLS Cup? That's less certain. Still, the work has been put in:

""So it's just a testament of hard work, and the reality now is here,"" he says. 

And it's deserved, in truth. Vancouver started hot, stayed hot, and then got that extra piece in Thomas Muller to take them over the line. Sabbi, meanwhile, has been a mainstay. He tallied double-digit goal contributions with seven goals and three assists for the Whitecaps and has been a steady presence in attacking areas all year. Where that lands him remains to be seen. He has one cap for the USMNT. There could yet be others. But first, there is a trophy to win. And it's a big one.

Sabbi joined  GOAL Convo, a weekly Q&A with central figures in North American soccer, and talked about Vancouver's improvement, playing against Lionel Messi, and why he hopes to be in the USMNT conversation in the future. 

NOTE: This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity. GOAL's Alex Labidou contributed reporting to this story

GOAL: You're playing in MLS Cup, a massive final. What's going through your head?

SABBI: Yeah, I didn't really know what I was coming to. But yeah, I'm here, talked to Jesper [Sorensen] and Ryan Gauld, and got a real gist of what Vancouver is like, and ultimately made my decision to come. And it's been a great season.

GOAL: What has surprised you the most about playing in MLS?

SABBI: The pace, honestly. The pace is really, really high here. There are great, tremendous players around and, yeah, it's very pacey here. So I really like that.

GOAL: Do you think that suits your game?

SABBI: Definitely. You've just got to get into it, right? I mean, I came, got a little injury, and then just had to get up to speed. And once I got up to speed, it was really amazing to be in MLS.

GOAL: When you came into the season, did you in the back of your mind say, 'MLS Cup is a reality,' or when did it start to really hit you that this is a contending team?

SABBI: When I got here, I saw the firepower we had. It's been next man up mentality since Day 1, since I got here, and we've really shown that, and it looked prevalent early. You know, our coach demands a lot from us. And also, we demand a lot from each other. Honestly, it looks like we would get here from all the games that we've played and how we perform. So it's just a testament of hard work, and the reality now is here. 

GOAL: What makes Jesper Sorensen so unique as a manager? You always hear from players like, 'oh, this guy, he's, he's laid back,' or 'this guy is he's super tactically driven or focused.' What makes him special?

SABBI: He kind of has everything, honestly: tactically, he's sound mentally, he's prepared for every game. I think all-around, he's a great coach. He helps the young ones as well, as you've seen a lot of young players play and played a big role. So I think all-around, he is a great coach. He helps everyone. He's also into our personal lives. And it's really nice to have a coach like that.

GOAL: Who is your favorite player?

SABBI: [Laughs] Lionel Messi. 

GOAL: You played against Messi in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. What's it like playing against him?

SABBI: I mean, it's the best player of all time, and you're standing on the pitch with him and playing against him and trying to defend him. And, you know, it's surreal. 

GOAL: What's your earliest Messi memory?

SABBI: Honestly, his first goal was insane. And just getting a pass from Ronaldinho like that, and just finishing it the way he did. It's insane. It's incredible to see that he's still doing it today, and yeah, hopefully he doesn't go against us! 

GOAL: You've been capped before. Do you ever think about the possibility of being on the national team again? 

SABBI: I hope so. My job was to try to have good performances and be consistent. And I hope that, you know, the national team has seen that, that I'm a candidate to try to make my mark there as well. And I'm just grateful for the opportunity to come back and play in MLS and show how good I am and that I'm ready.

GOAL: Was that part of your decision to come back to MLS, to get a little more visibility? 

SABBI: Not really. I think the national team looks at all the leagues, honestly. And it was just a different choice for my family and me, and I listened to my family and talked to my agent, and then had a couple of calls with Vancouver, and that's how it became possible.

GOAL: MLS Commissioner Don Garber talked about it a little bit yesterday, but obviously, with the team having been listed for sale earlier this year and just the future of your team being speculated about, what are your feelings about Vancouver as a market, and like, what are your feelings about all the things that you've been probably hearing?

SABBI: I don't really know how it is. But I mean, we're a tremendous team. I love Vancouver; my wife and family love the city, so I'm just happy to be here, honestly.

GOAL: And what's the atmosphere like at BC Place?

SABBI: Electric! I mean, you've seen the games, right? 

GOAL: If you were to win, how big would it be for not only Vancouver, but Canada as a whole?

SABBI: I'll be tremendously big for Canada. I mean, Toronto has already done it, and we're just looking to put our name on there too, and by God's grace, we're here today, and so all we have to do is lock in and do what we've been doing, and hopefully we can lift that thing.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

2025 Abu Dhabi GP FP1: Lindblad and Iwasa join seven other rookies in first practice

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen set an unbeatable lap time to take pole position for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen secured a critical pole position for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, pipping Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri to the top spot to put himself in the best place to chase down his fifth world title.

The Dutchman, who is 12 points away from Norris' lead in the Standings, took provisional pole after the first laps in Q3, which proved to be enough – no one could beat his time except him as he went even faster on his second lap, ending the session on 1m 22.207s.

Norris' final effort saw him beat his team mate by just 0.029s in another incredibly competitive session, with Mercedes' George Russell taking fourth place ahead of a much improved Charles Leclerc.

Elsewhere, the second Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton suffered his third consecutive Q1 exit after recovering from a crash in FP3, leaving him to start the race from 16th place.

2025 Abu Dhabi GP FP1: Lindblad and Iwasa join seven other rookies in first practice

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

George Russell missed out on a spot in the top three for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as he battled to tame his Mercedes in Qualifying.

George Russell downplayed Mercedes' chances of progressing to the podium in Abu Dhabi as he once again found himself on the outskirts of the top-three fight, settling for fourth place in Qualifying.

The Briton looked to be firmly in the mix for a front row start as he ended Q2 on top, but as his rivals battled it out for pole position on fresh tyres, he could only get within 0.438s of Max Verstappen's pace-setting lap time.

With the three drivers ahead of him all in contention for this season's championship, Russell isn't quite targeting the same ambition, but he appeared constantly aware of how their competition could benefit him. Preparing for his final lap of the session, he asked his race engineer to let him out behind Verstappen as he would “probably give me a tow” in order to stop a McLaren driver from taking a front row spot.

The tactic didn't quite work out, and he was further hindered by the rear of his car feeling unstable in Q3 – onboards showed him fighting to stay on the track and avoid the barriers, contributing to his eventual P4 finish.

“Obviously we were near the top of the leaderboard in Q1 and at the top in Q2, but those three around me were on the old tyres and they were matching my lap times,” he later said. “We knew they were going to be a step ahead, and I knew that I had to do something special just to even be in the fight.

“I wasn't very happy with Q3 but honestly, anything higher than P4 was not really a possibility today so we'll take it.

“I don't think that we're in the fight with those three again, but I can't imagine Max is just going to sit there and let them all drive off into the sunset and finish 1-2-3. There could be opportunities – we'll play it by ear.

“For sure, the team are going to be up all night making plans, but I'm pretty confident those plans are going to be pretty different by Lap 1, Lap 2, every single lap of the race. It'll be an interesting one.”

His team mate Kimi Antonelli similarly dropped down in the order as Qualifying went on, going from third in Q1 to 14th in Q2 after putting an eventful FP3 behind him. In the pit lane, the Italian was released straight into Yuki Tsunoda's path and the two collided, damaging both cars.

The change in performance throughout Qualifying left Antonelli searching for answers as he explained: “It's obviously very frustrating. I struggled a lot with the rear in Q2 and it was just difficult. In Q1 I went much quicker than Q2. I'm just really struggling to understand what happened there.

“I think it's not going to be an easy race tomorrow. Degradation is going to be big. I just need to maximise the result and try to do the best race possible.”

2025 Abu Dhabi GP FP1: Lindblad and Iwasa join seven other rookies in first practice

After 23 Grands Prix in 2025, the title fight goes down to the wire in Abu Dhabi

Max Verstappen clinched pole position in Qualifying for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver outpacing titles rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Max Verstappen will start the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix from pole position, the Red Bull driver setting a stunning lap in Q3 to hold off the challenge of McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

While Piastri and George Russell had led the way in Q1 and Q2 respectively, Verstappen laid down a gauntlet during the opening runs of the top-10 shootout, the Dutchman going quickest before improving with his final effort to post a scintillating 1m 22.207s lap.

Both McLarens attempted to claim top spot on their final efforts, but Norris had to settle for second after clocking a lap 0.201s slower. Piastri, meanwhile, took third place as the top three prepare to battle for the World Championship on Sunday.

Russell ended the session in fourth for Mercedes, while Charles Leclerc claimed fifth and Fernando Alonso took a solid sixth in the Aston Martin. Gabriel Bortoleto put in a good drive for Kick Sauber in seventh, with Haas' Esteban Ocon, the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda – in his final Qualifying for Red Bull – completing the top 10.

FORMULA 1 ETIHAD AIRWAYS ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX 2025

Despite strong pace through the weekend so far, Haas' Ollie Bearman missed the cut for Q2 – as did Carlos Sainz, the Williams man ending up in P12 one week on from his podium in Qatar.

Liam Lawson followed in 13th for Racing Bulls, while Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli departed Q2 in 14th place – the Italian having reported struggles with the rear of his car – ahead of the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll in 15th.

The big story from Q1 was another early exit for Lewis Hamilton, the Ferrari driver finding himself down in P16 just hours after a crash into the barriers during third practice. There was also disappointment for Williams' Alex Albon, who will line up one spot behind in P17.

A good showing for Nico Hulkenberg on Friday did not follow through come Qualifying, with the Kick Sauber man winding up in 18th, while the Alpine pair of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto brought up the rear in 19th and 20th respectively.

After an eventful practice session earlier in the day – topped by the Mercedes of Russell – the attentions of the paddock switched to the final Qualifying of the year, a crucial session in that it would set the starting order for the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

As Q1 got underway under the floodlights at 1800 local time, Hamilton was amongst the first on track with the medium tyres bolted on, the Ferrari driver seemingly doing a shake down of his car following his crash out of Free Practice 3 a few hours prior.

With others joining the action a few minutes in – the majority running the soft compound, the exception being Hamilton's team mate Leclerc on the mediums – it was Russell who had gone fastest following the opening runs via an effort of 1m 23.247s.

The margins were incredibly fine, however, with Bearman only 0.007s behind in second while Piastri was a further one thousandth of a second adrift of the Haas. Verstappen placed in fourth, ahead of Hamilton, Alonso and championship leader Norris.

At the other end of the timesheets, Ocon, Albon, Leclerc, Gasly and Colapinto – the latter yet to get a lap on the board after having both of his times deleted for exceeding track limits – were the names at risk in the elimination zone. Gasly and Stroll had also fallen victim to track limits, with each also seeing one of their laps erased.

Following a brief lull, the pack prepared to return to the track for their last runs as the session entered its final minutes. Title contenders Norris, Verstappen and Piastri were all sporting fresh soft tyres – and this seemed to pay off for the latter, who went quickest on a 1m 22.605s.

This put the Australian two-tenths clear of Verstappen, while Norris was just over half a second away in sixth place, with Antonelli, Alonso and Leclerc ahead of him. Meanwhile others were trying to guarantee their spot in Q2, with Gasly improving before being pushed back down the order by Stroll.

Also finding themselves in the danger zone were Albon, Hulkenberg and Colapinto – and while Hamilton initially looked to have avoided the bottom five, improvements from others saw the Briton end up in 16th place, resulting in another Q1 exit.

Knocked out: Hamilton, Albon, Hulkenberg, Gasly, Colapinto

As the dust settled on Q1, 15 minutes went on the clock to kickstart Q2 at the Yas Marina Circuit. Verstappen was the first to head out, the Dutchman enjoying a quiet track as he set a banker lap on used soft tyres.

Others soon started to join the fray – and when everybody had set a time, Russell was again the man on top thanks to his lap of 1m 22.730s, giving him an advantage of 0.022s over second-placed Verstappen, while Norris was only 0.074s behind Russell in third.

Piastri and Alonso followed in fourth and fifth respectively, but those less at ease in the danger zone were Hadjar, Tsunoda, Antonelli, Bearman and Lawson. A queue had formed in the pit lane as the field readied themselves for their final runs – yet Verstappen was not amongst them, Red Bull seemingly feeling safe enough to stay in the garage.

While Bortoleto surged up to an eye-catching fourth, fellow rookie Antonelli could not do enough to avoid elimination, the Mercedes driver being pushed down to P14. Hadjar climbed up into the top 10, which then knocked out team mate Lawson.

There were also contrasting fortunes at Haas, with Ocon moving into ninth just as Bearman missed the cut in 11th. Tsunoda made it through in 10th, but it was not such a good day for Sainz and Stroll, both exiting in 12th and 15th respectively.

Knocked out: Bearman, Sainz, Lawson, Antonelli, Stroll

Tsunoda was the first to emerge as the top-10 shootout began, but it was the other Red Bull of Verstappen that topped the timesheets once the first runs had been completed, the World Champion going quickest on an impressive 1m 22.295s.

In his final weekend racing for the squad, Tsunoda played a team role by giving Verstappen a tow, with the Dutchman subsequently beating closest challenger Piastri by 0.327s. Norris was four-and-a-half tenths back in third, followed by Leclerc and Russell.

Ahead of the decisive closing runs, Russell asked his team if they could get him behind Verstappen to get a tow of his own. McLaren, meanwhile, would be looking for a way to beat the four-time World Champion.

As the all-important last Qualifying laps of 2025 came in, Verstappen went even quicker on a 1m 22.207s. Piastri closed the gap down, but at 0.230s adrift it was not enough to beat the Dutch driver – and while Norris could not clinch pole either, the Briton outpaced his team mate to slot into second, 0.201 adrift of Verstappen.

This put Piastri in third, with Russell the nearest to the title contenders in fourth. Leclerc ended a tough recent run for Ferrari with P5, while a slightly mixed-up top 10 was rounded out by Alonso, Bortoleto, Ocon, Hadjar and Tsunoda.

""In Q2 I stayed on scrubbed tyres, and I think those laps already felt quite decent,"" said Verstappen. ""Of course then in Q3, around here track temp is coming down, you know that you can push a bit more, and that's exactly what we did. We found a bit more lap time and of course I'm incredibly happy to be in first. That's the only thing that we can do, right? That's the only thing that we can control. I try to just maximise everything we have, what we have with the car, and we definitely did that in Qualifying.""

The 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is set to begin at 1700 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from the Yas Marina Circuit.

					By Rosy Cordero 

Associate Editor, TV


Alexandria Stapleton may be a new name to many who are discovering her following the release of Netflix‘s Sean Combs: The Reckoning, which she directed and executive produced. But she's hardly a newbie to the industry.


	Stapleton is a director and producer whose career spans more than 15 years. Across that time, she's explored subjects across sports, music, pop culture, and social justice. Before she collaborated with Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson on the smash hit documentary about the rapper and music mogul Combs, she directed an episode of the three-part HBO documentary God Save Texas, her home state, and the Paramount+ doc How Music Got Free, which she produced with SpringHill and Eminem. Some of her documentary subjects she's explored include Roger Corman, Reggie Jackson, and Chelsea Handler.

	We recently spoke to Jackson, who sings Stapleton's praises for her work on Sean Combs: The Reckoning, and their working relationship. For example, she would show footage she was working on, and he would share insight into what was going on in the world of hip hop at that time.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix released the documentary on Tuesday, December 2. Deadline caught up with Stapleton the following day, just shortly after the streamer confirmed that the project had hit No. 1, where it has remained and spread to the top of the charts globally. 


	All four parts of the docuseries are available to stream now.


DEADLINE: Congratulations on all your success. I opened up an email this morning that said the documentary hit No. 1, which is a feat in and of itself, especially as the first part of the final season of Stranger Things is also at the top of the charts. What is your reaction to this news?












ALEXANDRIA STAPLETON: It's very surreal. Very surreal. I needed to believe 50, whom I told that I'd feel very blessed to be in the Top 10. I woke up this morning to my phone going crazy, and I was like, “Wow!” It's a testament to our amazing team that put this together because we worked so hard, and to the voices we spotlighted, as well.


DEADLINE: Would you say this proves there's a hunger for programming like this and for your approach to keeping the story balanced?


STAPLETON: I'm just starting to reflect on it, because it's just been nuts. I think that this was the only [documentary] that was made by people from the culture. 50 and I, this is our culture, you know, the culture of hip hop. Being a Black woman making a film like this, I took the opportunity very seriously. We wanted to make something for people like us, but that could also speak to a broader audience. With the viewership being what it is, it's crossing barriers, which was our goal. I'm hearing reactions from people who say they didn't know about a lot of the stuff we covered, or who even really knew much about who [Combs] is. 


	Not to knock outsiders making things, because that can also be an incredible experience, but I think the nuances and some of these details were overlooked in past projects, because [those involved] weren't really considering the culture.


DEADLINE: Following the release of the documentary, Combs threatened legal action over the explosive footage your team acquired that showed him in the days leading up to his arrest. How would you say this speaks to the strength of what was released in the documentary?


STAPLETON: I don't know what's in his head or why he's reacting the way that he is. I couldn't answer that. But we all could see that when the project came out, it included things that were probably a surprise to him. I don't know how to really answer that, but I think that perhaps he, or someone in his camp, was able to see that this was going to be a different project.


DEADLINE: I was surprised to see the murders of rappers Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace (aka Biggie, Notorious BIG) covered in the doc, because I didn't think there was anything new left to report. How did you tackle finding new information about a topic that's been covered extensively?


STAPLETON: I agree with you. I have seen a million things done on this subject matter as well. I didn't know when I started this that it was going to be a part of it. I was conducting interviews, meeting people, and doing research on other things when it began to pull me in. I think it hits different for a few different reasons, like how the storytellers here are people you recognize, [while in other docs] you hear the same version of the story from the same people. The other is that people underestimate the power of telling a story in chronological order and researching the events that led up to it. It's been mostly about how the three hated each other, but nobody took the time to dig deeper beyond Vegas or the Source Awards, like going back to how Suge Knight worked with Andre Harrell and knew Sean [Combs]. Suge had been Al B. Sure's bodyguard. People don't understand how much Suge Knight was tied into that world.


DEADLINE: There's certainly still a need for new information. In 2023, just shy of three decades after Shakur's slaying, Duane “Keefe D” Davis was arrested and charged with the rapper's murder. His trial is set for February.












STAPLETON: I think when Keefe D was arrested, that made some noise, but people were still lost in it. His story still hasn't been entirely told on a big platform, as of yet. 


DEADLINE: In the final episode, you spotlight producer Lil Rod and Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, both of whom have alleged that Combs mentally, physically, and sexually abused them. Lil Rod was unable to share the extent of his claims, whether from fear or anxiety, or possibly something else. Burrowes shared a bit more but was visibly shaken. Why was it important to amplify their voices, especially in those moments when their voices were shaking?


STAPLETON: It was very important for every alleged victim here to share their truth. But I think when you're talking about the world of hip hop, and the kind of tropes of how hip hop handles sexuality, it's complicated. For both of them, and especially in my conversations with Kirk, I think that they understood that [what allegedly happened to them] has nothing to do with sexuality. Sexual violence against any gender shouldn't be tolerated. I hope this film will help the community become a more open place and that there is more acceptance of victims.


DEADLINE: Yes, because men can be victims too.


STAPLETON: Yeah, and men should feel okay to share their stories as part of their healing process if they choose to. Perhaps there will be people who are going to watch this who find peace from seeing Kirk and Lil Rod sharing their stories. With all the alleged victims here, we didn't push them for details.


DEADLINE: I was at a party the other night, and everyone was discussing The Reckoning. The word “fearless” kept coming up when talking about you, not only for your willingness to tackle this particular subject, but also for knowing how dangerous the exploration could be. How do you feel about the word “fearless” being used to describe you?


STAPLETON: I think sometimes it ebbs and flows. I do believe that by the nature of the content and what people were sharing with me and understanding their fear, definitely, I have had moments where it would be natural for me to have fear. But I have so much faith in audiences and the community and people. And I think the more that, as a documentarian, we choose to do films like this, what helps me to shed my fear, is understanding that when people are siloed and can't share stories, it feels like, “Oh, I'm alone, and I'm the only person that knows this.” 


	A lot of people who are in this series lived in fear because they were siloed, their voices were muted and silenced, and they were cut off from a community of people. In the aftermath of the indictment and the arrest, people are starting to find each other. My role is just to put this together and present it to an audience so that we can all pull back the layers and understand that there was more to this story. The best way to combat fear was for me to make the film.


DEADLINE: When we last spoke before the premiere, you said you'd consider tackling another Diddy project in the future if everything aligned. In discussing the possibility of further exploration for a new project, the general consensus was that you will probably call it a day after this. What say you?


STAPLETON: I think I would be willing to. There are a couple of parts of the story that I would love to know more about and to work on further. The story has all these different offshoots, places that you can go because it covers so much in so many decades. There are a couple of other worlds that I think would be interesting to get into, but right now I need a little rest and to finish up some other projects.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Matt Reeves, Ben Stiller defend Paul Dano from Tarantino ""limpest dick"" comments","https://www.avclub.com/matt-reeves-ben-stiller-defend-paul-dano-tarantino","Sat, 06 Dec 2025 18:37:47 GMT","

Earlier this week, Quentin Tarantino went on the attack, striking, with his most powerful weapons—his very large mouth, and the powerfully nasal voice that lurks within it—at society's biggest active problem at the moment: Paul Dano's performance in 2007 Oscar-winner There Will Be Blood. As we reported previously, Tarantino went no-holds-barred on Dano in an appearance on Bret Easton Ellis' podcast, calling him “a big, giant flaw” in Paul Thomas Anderson's movie, “the weakest fucking actor in SAG,” and, of course, “the limpest dick in the world.”

Which was a pretty wild swing, not just because Dano is a perfectly fine, and often a very good, performer, but also because this level of weirdly personal attack falls pretty far outside regular Hollywood norms. To the point that a whole lot of people—almost none of whom have actually namechecked Tarantino's comments, which also took swipes at Matthew Lillard and Owen Wilson—have spoken up to assert that, no, Paul Dano is not the world's limpest dick. For instance: Matt Reeves, who directed Dano as the jittery Riddler in his 2022 comic book noir flick The Batman, who recently stated on Twitter that Dano is “An incredible actor, and an incredible person.” Or Ben Stiller, who directed Dano in 2018 Showtime crime drama Escape At Dannemora, who self-censored himself with “Paul Dano is f-ing brilliant.” (Shang-Chi star Simu Liu, who's never worked with Dano, but who has chimed in before when Tarantino runs his mouth, wrote that, “idk man i think paul dano is an incredible actor.”)

We do think it's kind of amusing that all of these observations are being offered seemingly out of the blue, with no one acknowledging that they're responding to Tarantino's unexpected tirade. (Alec Baldwin got the closest, writing, “If you don't love Paul Dano, shh.”) Per Entertainment Weekly, the most interesting, and specific, defense came from Dano's There Will Be Blood co-star Colleen Foy, who said on Threads that she actually sat behind Tarantino at the film's cast and crew screening, and that “He was legit vibing with Paul's performance. His recent comments are incongruent with his reaction that night.”

As we go to press, no high-profile Hollywood celebrities have similarly spoken up in defense of Matthew Lillard's dick.

Fan-favourite Robert Irwin is trading “Dancing With The Stars” ballroom for the jungle. Irwin's television journey is nowhere near slowing down. Fresh off his DWTS win, the 22-year-old conservationist is already stepping into his next chapter on screen, and it's a role that carries both excitement and familiarity.

Irwin is returning to I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here (Australia), but not as a contestant braving the jungle. Instead, he will once again guide viewers through the series as co-host alongside Julia Morris, bringing the same warmth and enthusiasm fans have come to expect from him.

Irwin first took on hosting duties in Season 10, filling the spot previously held by Dr. Chris Brown. He returned for Season 11 in 2025, and now he's officially back for Season 12, premiering January 18, 2026, on Channel 10 AU.

The show teased his return with a playful Instagram announcement, writing, “A brand new bunch of celebs are trading the luxury life for the jungle life on Jan 18! 🤩🦁🐊.”

The long-running reality competition is known for dropping celebrities into a rugged jungle camp, where they must face survival challenges and earn viewer votes to stay in the game. One contestant is eliminated at a time until the last remaining celebrity is crowned the season's King or Queen of the Jungle.

Irwin, of course, grew up in wild spaces and learned from his late father, Steve Irwin. His comfort outdoors made him a natural fit for the co-host role, where he guides viewers through each episode with humor, heart, and wildlife expertise.

The show remains unavailable to stream in the United States, so American fans will have to wait or get creative to get their Robert Irwin fix.

Irwin's Dancing with the Stars win introduced him to millions of new fans. Since then, he has continued to grow his presence both on-screen and at home in Australia.

He recently opened up about his work at the Crocodile Hunter Lodge at Australia Zoo, a project inspired by his father's “legacy and love for wild places.”

“It has been quite the passion project that we've been working on back home in Australia Zoo,” he said.

The lodge, which opened in 2022, offers eco-luxury accommodations surrounded by nature and wildlife. It reflects the Irwin family's mission to connect people with conservation.

For fans who can't make the trip to Australia, Irwin still found a way to reach them. Supporters can now purchase the Robert Irwin 2026 calendar, which benefits Australia Zoo. 

The collection features photographs that highlight everything viewers admire about him: his kindness, his enthusiasm and his unwavering dedication to wildlife conservation.

With “I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here” returning, a Dancing with the Stars championship behind him and new conservation projects taking shape, Irwin is stepping into one of the busiest and most meaningful chapters of his career.

And if his past is any indication, he's only just getting started and fans for sure are in for a wild ride!

Wagner Moura, star of the new film “The Secret Agent,” was presented with IndieWire Honors‘ Performance Award during a December 4 ceremony at Nya West in Los Angeles. While accepting the award, the Brazilian actor was both playful — dancing a samba as he walked up to the stage — and serious, giving a speech about the legacy of fascism in his home country.

“The Secret Agent” is set in 1977, during the military dictatorship that controlled Brazil for 21 years, and stars Moura as a professor attempting to escape persecution from the authoritarian government. Director Kleber Mendonça Filho, also known for the films “Aquarius” and “Bacurau,” was present to support Moura, who gave the filmmaker a shout out during his speech.

“He's extraordinary,” the actor said, thanking Filho. “This amazing artist, this very Brazilian artist, and also an extraordinary friend.”

Moura also thanked Neon, as well as Brazilian audiences, for their support of the film, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival before releasing in the U.S. in November.

 










“It's really cool to be among so many artists you admire. Thank you, Neon. You guys are awesome. Thanks for all the effort and hard work you're putting in this film, in this Brazilian film,” Moura said. “I want to thank, of course, my friends, my family, all Brazilians around the world, and Brazilians that feel represented by this film. It means a lot to us.”

Referencing the film's storyline, Moura said that he was born in the middle of the Brazilian military dictatorship and related to his character's struggles to stick to his values in the face of oppression. He then offered a message of hope, comparing where his country is now to where it once was, while alluding to current political issues in the U.S.

“I'm very proud to say that, right now, Brazilian democracy is in very, very good shape,” Moura said. “There is hope. Let's all stick with our values.”

Following the premiere of “The Secret Agent” at Cannes, Moura received the festival's Best Actor award for his leading role in the film. He has since received a nomination at the Gotham Awards for Outstanding Lead Performance, and won the New York Film Critics Circle's Best Actor award.

The event took place on Thursday, December 4, in Los Angeles with an intimate cocktail reception and awards ceremony. Stay tuned for more exclusive editorial and social content from the night, including video interviews, outtakes, and more.

							By 

	Chris Parton



	An eclectic cast of country, roots, and Latin artists turned out to tribute Raul Malo at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium Friday night, Dec. 5, lifting up an ahead-of-his-time trailblazer as he battles cancer.


	Diagnosed with an incurable form of brain cancer in September, the golden-voiced frontman of the Mavericks was honored with a joyful, yet deeply bittersweet three-hour sendup, as more than a dozen friends took the stage for the first of two sold-out nights. Dubbed Dance the Night Away: A 35-Year Musical Legacy Celebrating the Mavericks & Honoring Raul Malo, the show both highlighted the band's unique contribution to country — infusing it with Latin influence — and awarded the American Eagle Award from the National Music Council of the United States to Malo.


	Presented by chairman Charlie Saunders halfway through the night, the honor went to Malo for his “lifelong commitment to the preservation of the multilingual American music repertoire,” and for his work as a steadfast champion of music education. Previous winners include icons like Stephen Sondheim, Quincy Jones, Dizzy Gillispe, and Kris Kristofferson.

	











	“The American Eagle Award is given to not only celebrate excellence, because a lot of people are excellent, especially in this business,” Saunders said onstage. “It goes to the people who were excellent and then went way beyond that in terms of making us proud to be Americans and representatives of the American culture.”


	A Florida-born singer, songwriter, and guitarist with Cuban roots, Malo co-founded and led the Mavericks through their commercial heyday in the 1990s, evolving to fuse neo-traditional country, classic pop, and rock with Latin elements of Tex-Mex, afro-Cuban, and more — often with brassy horns and strutting, syncopated rhythms. The band's sound foreshadowed the growing popularity of Latin influence in the American mainstream. Meanwhile, Malo's vibrato vocal and magnetic stage presence won the band critical acclaim and fans across the world — plus the respect of their peers, many of whom were present at the Ryman Friday night.

	Unfortunately, Malo was not. Rushed to a Nashville emergency room on Thursday, Malo sent a letter to fans. Longtime champion and label head Scott Borchetta read it for the crowd after praising a band who refused to follow any creative north star but their own.


	“Music has been the guiding force of my entire life,” Malo wrote in part. “In these past months, I've had to fight battles I've never imagined. But on the hardest of days, music remained my companion. Your letters, your stories of how a song helped you through loss, heartbreak, joy, those became our songs. You all carried me more than you know. To my family band, the National Music Council, my musical collaborators, and every fan around the world: Thank you for giving my voice a place to live, even when my body cannot be the one delivering it. I accept this award with profound gratitude and with the hope that the music we create continues to inspire, to heal and bring people together.”


	The Mavericks accepted the award on Malo's behalf. During the show, veteran artists like Jeff Hanna (of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), Jim Lauderdale, and Steve Earle took turns on stage, performing alongside the band in Malo's absence. Each held him up as a friend.


	“Raul, I love to make you laugh,” Lauderdale said after a performance of “There Goes My Heart.” “I can't think of anything funny right now, but I am grateful to you. You've created one of the greatest bands ever. You've created one of the greatest batch of songs that's ever been sung.”


	Younger artists and admirers like Maggie Rose and JD McPherson were also on hand, and each honored Malo as a creative powerhouse while praising “one of the greatest live bands in the world.” All through the night the Mavericks put everything they had into each song – 10 members matching deep, hard grooves and dusky border-town twang with crisp horns and smooth swagger. People danced in the wings of the stage while fans roared in the Ryman's pews, offering credence to the band's title.

	“In my humble opinion Raul Malo is the best singer Nashville has ever seen,” noted Rose. “So, if I'm shaking up here trying to cover his songs, you know why.”


	Others like Asleep at the Wheel founder Ray Benson highlighted Malo's rebellious side, sharing a hazy memory of a joint shared in a Grammy Awards bathroom. The band won one Grammy in its time (in 1995, Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for “Here Comes the Rain”), along with CMA and ACM Awards.

	











	Meanwhile, Rodney Crowell delivered a personal message in tribute to Malo and the band, comparing their spirit to that of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Malo was “willing to tell the powers that be … they could kiss his ass,” Crowell said.


	Joyful musical highlights included Seth Walker kicking off the night with “Back in Your Arms Again,” while James Otto summoned Malo's baritone with a soulful run through “Come Unto Me.” It culminated in a fiery accordion duel between current band member Percy Cardona and longtime Mavericks associate Michael Guerra. Jaime Hanna found a hard-rocking pocket on “Every Little Thing About You,” the solo song he and Malo co-wrote for Malo's 2001 Today album, and Chuck Mead celebrated the Mavericks' “hillbilly” side with Hank Williams' “Hey Good Lookin'.”


	Emily West, Jesse Dayton, Jimmie Vaughan, Joshua Ray Walker, and Javier Mendoza also appeared – all using Malo's personal microphone.


	“It's everything I can do to keep this together,” guitarist Eddie Perez said of the emotional moment.


	Founding bassist Robert Reynolds echoed that sentiment. He appeared during the award presentation to retell the story of meeting Malo in Miami, and starting the Mavericks. Reynolds said Malo's vibrant energy changed the course of his life.


	“I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Raul. And I never thought I'd have to be here doing it this way. That's the hard part,” he said, nearly choking up. “We were kids thumbing through the history … of American music. And I meet this simpatico guy with a huge smile hair down to his [back], curly hair with a cowboy hat driving a Mercedes-Benz.”


	In June of 2024, just after the release of the Mavericks's Moon & Stars album, Malo was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. He also underwent chemotherapy and surgery to remove a liver tumor, but insisted the Mavericks return to the road. They did so until September of 2025, when Malo shared news that his condition had worsened.


	Known as LMD (or leptomeningeal disease, which he quipped on Instagram stands for “get this shit out of my head”), the cancer had spread to the membranes surrounding Malo's brain and spinal cord. It's a condition for which there is currently no cure, and the Mavericks canceled all concert dates — except these two at the Ryman.


	After Reynolds learned of Malo's illness, he traveled to Nashville to meet his old friend.


	“I came down, I was not ready for this,” Reynolds said onstage. “But I walked in and I was greeted by that smile I had met 35 years earlier. He was still on fire for it. And he said, ‘I may not sing again, but I can produce records and write songs.' That's what we talked about.”

	











	For the first time in years, Reynolds rejoined the Mavericks to finish the show. Grooving at center stage, back in his element, Reynolds tapped out the thumping rhythm to “All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down.


	The two-night stand is dubbed “Dance the Night Away” for a track off the band's 1998 album, Trampoline, and Friday took on the song's message as its mantra. It never became a hit on the U.S. charts but is now the Mavericks' best streamer, and a prime example of their singular style. With a shuffling samba rhythm and brassy blasts of joy, its lyrics lay out a dive-bar oasis filled with “senoritas who can sway,” calling on listeners to let their worries go. Performed as an ensemble, it became the show's emotional climax, and a fitting send-off.

	Perez capped the night as the band gathered, arm in arm. “Thank you so much. We are and always will be the Mavericks,” he said.


	A portion of the night's proceeds will benefit Stand Up to Cancer. Night two of the Mavericks' Dance the Night Away will continue at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium on Saturday and, like Friday's show, will stream on Nugs.net.

NASA and ESA both shared new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS this week, as the agencies gear up for the mysterious object's closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19.

The celebrity comet 3I/ATLAS is showing itself out of our solar system for good — but not before the cosmic paparazzi at Earth's space agencies snap some of the clearest photos of it yet.

Discovered in late June and confirmed to be the third known interstellar object in July, 3I/ATLAS has spent the past several months zooming through the inner solar system at an estimated 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h). The massive, jet-spewing snowball made its closest approaches to Mars and the sun in October. It is due for its closest encounter with Earth on Dec. 19, when it will be about 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) away — nearly twice the distance between our planet and the sun.

As the comet careens toward this astronomical milestone, spacecraft managed by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are snagging as many close-up observations as possible. This week, both agencies shared new images of the comet — proving that its recent flyby of the sun has left it very bright and active as it spews large amounts of sublimated gas and dust into space.

 




On Thursday (Dec. 4), NASA shared the latest image of 3I/ATLAS taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The glowing white dot at the center of the image shows the comet's nucleus (its main body) and coma, the bright atmosphere of gas and dust that wraps around the comet before getting funneled into its tail. In the background, stars are stretched into long streaks as Hubble's camera stays fixed on the fast-moving comet.

Comets typically brighten as they approach the sun, when the ice within them heats up and sublimates. Solar radiation pushes this gas into a tail that stretches away from the sun. Meanwhile, the warmest, sun-facing side of the comet may erupt with jets of gas and dust angled toward our star. Both of these features are faintly visible in the new Hubble image.

NASA snapped this image on Nov. 30, when Hubble was about 178 million miles (286 million km) from the comet. This is considerably closer than when Hubble first imaged the comet in late July. Although that first view showed little more than a blue blur, it nevertheless allowed scientists to constrain 3I/ATLAS' size to somewhere between 1,400 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide — likely the largest interstellar object seen to date.

New data from this image, including details of the coma's composition, has yet to be released but is likely on the way.

Also on Thursday, ESA shared its latest view of the comet, taken by the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) orbiter on its way to study Jupiter's moons for signs of life. Juice snapped the image Nov. 2, just days after 3I/ATLAS' close approach to the sun.

Located even closer to its target than Hubble (only 41 million miles, or 66 million km, away), Juice shows us a comet brimming with activity.

""Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails,"" an ESA spokesperson wrote in a statement. ""The comet's 'plasma tail' — made up of electrically charged gas, stretches out towards the top of the frame. We may also be able to see a fainter 'dust tail' — made up of tiny solid particles — stretching to the lower left of the frame.""

 




Juice observed 3I/ATLAS with five scientific instruments on two days. But besides this teaser image, we don't yet know what those instruments saw; the full data set won't reach Earth until late February 2026, according to ESA. That's because Juice is currently using its main antenna as a heat shield to protect it during its close pass of the sun, and relying on its smaller, less efficient antenna to beam its observations back to us.

—Mars orbiter narrows down the exact path of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by 'ten-fold,' surprising scientists

—Astronomers detect first 'radio signal' from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS — but it wasn't aliens

While there's little we can learn from NASA's and ESA's new images without the full complement of scientific data, it's a good reminder that human space exploration pays off in unexpected ways. Hubble and Juice number among a dozen spacecraft that have observed 3I/ATLAS from around the solar system, including Mars rovers, solar orbiters, asteroid trackers and space telescopes that were never intended to track comets.

And there's more to come: As 3I/ATLAS draws closer to Earth, the James Webb Space Telescope will take another look at it, while countless scientific observatories and amateur astronomers will have their chance to watch it as well. When you're dealing with a mysterious intruder from parts unknown, every observation matters.

It's only been a day since Netflix announced an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros., and the acquisition has already been described as sending Hollywood into “full-blown panic mode,” “possibly a death blow to theatrical filmmaking,” and maybe even “the end of Hollywood” itself.

Some of the firmest opposition has come from the Writers Guild of America, which issued a statement declaring, “This merger must be blocked.”

“The world's largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the WGA said. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.”

While statements from other Hollywood unions were not quite as unequivocal, they still suggested that there are  “many serious questions” about the acquisition's “impact on the future of the entertainment industry” (as the actors union SAG-AFTRA put it).

The deal came after a competitive process in which Paramount and Comcast also bids. Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy acquire the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division.

Initially, Paramount was seen as the frontrunner, with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount's lawyers sent an angry letter complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner.

This deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, would presumably face significant regulatory scrutiny, and not just from Trump appointees. Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts and longtime critic of Big Tech — put out a statement of her own describing the deal as “an anti-monopoly nightmare.”

“A Netflix-Warner Bros. [merger] would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.

She also argued that antitrust enforcement — including the review process for this deal — must be conducted “fairly and transparently” rather than used to “invite influence-peddling and bribery.”

If the government ultimately blocks the acquisition, Netflix would be required to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It's not clear whether Warner Bros. would then continue operating as an independent company or would reconsider the previous acquisition offers.

Netflix held an analyst call to discuss the deal on Friday morning, and while many of the questions were focused on the financial impact on both companies, executives also attempted to address larger concerns.

For example, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he's “highly confident in the regulatory process.”

“This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth,” he added. “And our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but really confident that we're going to get all the necessary approvals that we need.”

Sarandos also said that Netflix intends to keep HBO “operating largely as it is.” And although it's not something Netflix has done in the past, Warner Bros. would also continue producing TV shows for other networks and streaming services, he said: “We want to keep that successful business operating.”

As for how HBO and HBO Max would be packaged with or folded into the Netflix app, co-CEO Greg Peters said it's too early to get into specifics, but he said, “Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful for consumers. We think that the offering could constitute and would constitute a part of our plans and how we structure those for consumers.”

Beyond general concerns around consolidation, perhaps the biggest question is to what extent Netflix will support theatrical releases for the combined entity's films — especially after Warner Bros. had a record-setting run of box office success this year, while Netflix's theatrical releases only last for a couple weeks and skip major theatrical chains because of the limited exclusive window. (This was reportedly the deciding factor wjhen “Stranger Things” creators the Duffer Brothers signed an exclusive deal with Paramount.)

For his part, Sarandos said he “wouldn't look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or for Warner movies for that matter,” and he noted that Netflix has released 30 movies in theaters this year (though again, usually on fewer screens and for a limited period of time).

Similarly, “everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros,” he said. But in the long term, he suggested that “the windows will evolve” so that movies come to streaming more quickly.

“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don't really think of that consumer friendly,” he said.
