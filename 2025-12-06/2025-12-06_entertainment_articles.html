                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this week, Quentin Tarantino went on the attack, striking, with his most powerful weapons—his very large mouth, and the powerfully nasal voice that lurks within it—at society's biggest active problem at the moment: Paul Dano's performance in 2007 Oscar-winner There Will Be Blood. Which was a pretty wild swing, not just because Dano is a perfectly fine, and often a very good, performer, but also because this level of weirdly personal attack falls pretty far outside regular Hollywood norms. To the point that a whole lot of people—almost none of whom have actually namechecked Tarantino's comments, which also took swipes at Matthew Lillard and Owen Wilson—have spoken up to assert that, no, Paul Dano is not the world's limpest dick. For instance: Matt Reeves, who directed Dano as the jittery Riddler in his 2022 comic book noir flick The Batman, who recently stated on Twitter that Dano is “An incredible actor, and an incredible person.” Or Ben Stiller, who directed Dano in 2018 Showtime crime drama Escape At Dannemora, who self-censored himself with “Paul Dano is f-ing brilliant.” (Shang-Chi star Simu Liu, who's never worked with Dano, but who has chimed in before when Tarantino runs his mouth, wrote that, “idk man i think paul dano is an incredible actor.”) (Alec Baldwin got the closest, writing, “If you don't love Paul Dano, shh.”) Per Entertainment Weekly, the most interesting, and specific, defense came from Dano's There Will Be Blood co-star Colleen Foy, who said on Threads that she actually sat behind Tarantino at the film's cast and crew screening, and that “He was legit vibing with Paul's performance. As we go to press, no high-profile Hollywood celebrities have similarly spoken up in defense of Matthew Lillard's dick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An eclectic cast of country, roots, and Latin artists turned out to tribute Raul Malo at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium Friday night, Dec. 5, lifting up an ahead-of-his-time trailblazer as he battles cancer. Previous winners include icons like Stephen Sondheim, Quincy Jones, Dizzy Gillispe, and Kris Kristofferson. “The American Eagle Award is given to not only celebrate excellence, because a lot of people are excellent, especially in this business,” Saunders said onstage. “It goes to the people who were excellent and then went way beyond that in terms of making us proud to be Americans and representatives of the American culture.” Longtime champion and label head Scott Borchetta read it for the crowd after praising a band who refused to follow any creative north star but their own. “Music has been the guiding force of my entire life,” Malo wrote in part. But on the hardest of days, music remained my companion. I accept this award with profound gratitude and with the hope that the music we create continues to inspire, to heal and bring people together.” Younger artists and admirers like Maggie Rose and JD McPherson were also on hand, and each honored Malo as a creative powerhouse while praising “one of the greatest live bands in the world.” All through the night the Mavericks put everything they had into each song – 10 members matching deep, hard grooves and dusky border-town twang with crisp horns and smooth swagger. The Mavericks' Raul Malo Says His Cancer Has ‘Taken a Turn' The Mavericks Just May Be Americana's Most Resilient Band Raul Malo, Singer of the Mavericks, Says He's Been Diagnosed With Cancer “In my humble opinion Raul Malo is the best singer Nashville has ever seen,” noted Rose. “So, if I'm shaking up here trying to cover his songs, you know why.” The band won one Grammy in its time (in 1995, Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for “Here Comes the Rain”), along with CMA and ACM Awards. Meanwhile, Rodney Crowell delivered a personal message in tribute to Malo and the band, comparing their spirit to that of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Malo was “willing to tell the powers that be … they could kiss his ass,” Crowell said. Joyful musical highlights included Seth Walker kicking off the night with “Back in Your Arms Again,” while James Otto summoned Malo's baritone with a soulful run through “Come Unto Me.” It culminated in a fiery accordion duel between current band member Percy Cardona and longtime Mavericks associate Michael Guerra. Jaime Hanna found a hard-rocking pocket on “Every Little Thing About You,” the solo song he and Malo co-wrote for Malo's 2001 Today album, and Chuck Mead celebrated the Mavericks' “hillbilly” side with Hank Williams' “Hey Good Lookin'.” Emily West, Jesse Dayton, Jimmie Vaughan, Joshua Ray Walker, and Javier Mendoza also appeared – all using Malo's personal microphone. “It's everything I can do to keep this together,” guitarist Eddie Perez said of the emotional moment. Reynolds said Malo's vibrant energy changed the course of his life. “I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Raul. That's the hard part,” he said, nearly choking up. “We were kids thumbing through the history … of American music. In June of 2024, just after the release of the Mavericks's Moon & Stars album, Malo was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. They did so until September of 2025, when Malo shared news that his condition had worsened. Known as LMD (or leptomeningeal disease, which he quipped on Instagram stands for “get this shit out of my head”), the cancer had spread to the membranes surrounding Malo's brain and spinal cord. It's a condition for which there is currently no cure, and the Mavericks canceled all concert dates — except these two at the Ryman. Grooving at center stage, back in his element, Reynolds tapped out the thumping rhythm to “All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down. It never became a hit on the U.S. charts but is now the Mavericks' best streamer, and a prime example of their singular style. With a shuffling samba rhythm and brassy blasts of joy, its lyrics lay out a dive-bar oasis filled with “senoritas who can sway,” calling on listeners to let their worries go. Performed as an ensemble, it became the show's emotional climax, and a fitting send-off. Rock's Greatest Bootlegger: A New Pink Floyd Box Set Legitimizes an Outlaw 's Funeral Back to Rapper's Estate, Bad Boy Co-Founder Says Dear Pete Hegseth, I'm Grateful the Japanese Navy Spared My Grandfather's Life We are and always will be the Mavericks,” he said. A portion of the night's proceeds will benefit Stand Up to Cancer. Night two of the Mavericks' Dance the Night Away will continue at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium on Saturday and, like Friday's show, will stream on Nugs.net. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexandria Stapleton may be a new name to many who are discovering her following the release of Netflix‘s Sean Combs: The Reckoning, which she directed and executive produced. But she's hardly a newbie to the industry. Stapleton is a director and producer whose career spans more than 15 years. Before she collaborated with Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson on the smash hit documentary about the rapper and music mogul Combs, she directed an episode of the three-part HBO documentary God Save Texas, her home state, and the Paramount+ doc How Music Got Free, which she produced with SpringHill and Eminem. Some of her documentary subjects she's explored include Roger Corman, Reggie Jackson, and Chelsea Handler. French Cinema Boss Addresses WBD-Netflix Deal As  Execs At Red Sea Film Festival Take Stock: "You Can't Have Your Cake & Eat It" 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast & Streaming We recently spoke to Jackson, who sings Stapleton's praises for her work on Sean Combs: The Reckoning, and their working relationship. For example, she would show footage she was working on, and he would share insight into what was going on in the world of hip hop at that time. All four parts of the docuseries are available to stream now. I opened up an email this morning that said the documentary hit No. I woke up this morning to my phone going crazy, and I was like, “Wow!” It's a testament to our amazing team that put this together because we worked so hard, and to the voices we spotlighted, as well. DEADLINE: Would you say this proves there's a hunger for programming like this and for your approach to keeping the story balanced? We wanted to make something for people like us, but that could also speak to a broader audience. I'm hearing reactions from people who say they didn't know about a lot of the stuff we covered, or who even really knew much about who [Combs] is. Not to knock outsiders making things, because that can also be an incredible experience, but I think the nuances and some of these details were overlooked in past projects, because [those involved] weren't really considering the culture. STAPLETON: I don't know what's in his head or why he's reacting the way that he is. But we all could see that when the project came out, it included things that were probably a surprise to him. I don't know how to really answer that, but I think that perhaps he, or someone in his camp, was able to see that this was going to be a different project. DEADLINE: I was surprised to see the murders of rappers Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace (aka Biggie, Notorious BIG) covered in the doc, because I didn't think there was anything new left to report. How did you tackle finding new information about a topic that's been covered extensively? I have seen a million things done on this subject matter as well. I didn't know when I started this that it was going to be a part of it. I was conducting interviews, meeting people, and doing research on other things when it began to pull me in. It's been mostly about how the three hated each other, but nobody took the time to dig deeper beyond Vegas or the Source Awards, like going back to how Suge Knight worked with Andre Harrell and knew Sean [Combs]. People don't understand how much Suge Knight was tied into that world. DEADLINE: There's certainly still a need for new information. In 2023, just shy of three decades after Shakur's slaying, Duane “Keefe D” Davis was arrested and charged with the rapper's murder. STAPLETON: I think when Keefe D was arrested, that made some noise, but people were still lost in it. His story still hasn't been entirely told on a big platform, as of yet. DEADLINE: In the final episode, you spotlight producer Lil Rod and Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, both of whom have alleged that Combs mentally, physically, and sexually abused them. Lil Rod was unable to share the extent of his claims, whether from fear or anxiety, or possibly something else. Burrowes shared a bit more but was visibly shaken. Why was it important to amplify their voices, especially in those moments when their voices were shaking? STAPLETON: It was very important for every alleged victim here to share their truth. For both of them, and especially in my conversations with Kirk, I think that they understood that [what allegedly happened to them] has nothing to do with sexuality. Sexual violence against any gender shouldn't be tolerated. I hope this film will help the community become a more open place and that there is more acceptance of victims. DEADLINE: Yes, because men can be victims too. STAPLETON: Yeah, and men should feel okay to share their stories as part of their healing process if they choose to. Perhaps there will be people who are going to watch this who find peace from seeing Kirk and Lil Rod sharing their stories. With all the alleged victims here, we didn't push them for details. The word “fearless” kept coming up when talking about you, not only for your willingness to tackle this particular subject, but also for knowing how dangerous the exploration could be. STAPLETON: I think sometimes it ebbs and flows. I do believe that by the nature of the content and what people were sharing with me and understanding their fear, definitely, I have had moments where it would be natural for me to have fear. And I think the more that, as a documentarian, we choose to do films like this, what helps me to shed my fear, is understanding that when people are siloed and can't share stories, it feels like, “Oh, I'm alone, and I'm the only person that knows this.” A lot of people who are in this series lived in fear because they were siloed, their voices were muted and silenced, and they were cut off from a community of people. My role is just to put this together and present it to an audience so that we can all pull back the layers and understand that there was more to this story. DEADLINE: When we last spoke before the premiere, you said you'd consider tackling another Diddy project in the future if everything aligned. In discussing the possibility of further exploration for a new project, the general consensus was that you will probably call it a day after this. There are a couple of parts of the story that I would love to know more about and to work on further. The story has all these different offshoots, places that you can go because it covers so much in so many decades. There are a couple of other worlds that I think would be interesting to get into, but right now I need a little rest and to finish up some other projects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Best International Feature Film category is never short on surprises, and 2025 has no shortage of firsts. A total of 14 submissions will take part in today's Contenders Film: International, Deadline's annual virtual panel showcase, which begins at 9 a.m. PT. Many of the titles in display this year will be familiar to those tracking the major film festivals — Sundance, Berlin, Cannes, Venice, Toronto and San Sebastián all continue to dominate the space — but if you aren't au fait with the byzantine world of accreditation apartheid and lanyards, Deadline is here to help. Like many of the people in the movies we've chosen, you're about to go on a journey of discovery, as we speak to the films' stars, directors, producers and screenwriters to find out what makes their movies so special. Representing Poland, Agnieszka Holland presents the playful Franz, a biography of the tragically short-lived Czech writer whose surreal bureaucratic nightmares gave rise to the descriptor “Kafka-esque.” From Switzerland comes Late Shift by Petra Volpe, the kinetic, almost real-time study of an overworked nurse dealing with more than she can handle. And Iraq's Hasan Hadi serves up President's Cake, a 1990s-set drama in which a young girl is forced into celebrating Saddam Hussein's birthday. Father, by Tereza Nvotová, features the powerful story of a Slovakian parent who accidentally leaves his infant daughter in the back of his car on a boiling-hot day. Shai Carmeli-Pollak's The Sea represents Israel with its timely story of a young Palestinian boy making his way to the seaside through a largely hostile country. And from Argentina comes the moving political drama Belén, directed by and starring Dolores Fonzi, which highlights a scandal from 2014 that saw an innocent woman wrongly imprisoned for murder after suffering a miscarriage. There's an unexpectedly poignant tone to Anselm Chan's The Last Dance, an intimate odd-couple story from Hong Kong in which a down-at-heel wedding arranger faces pushback when he decides to become a funeral director. Bigger in scope is All That's Left of You from Jordan, in which Cherien Dabis tells a very personal story spanning three generations of a Palestine family displaced from their homeland in 1948. After that, for a little light relief, South Korea's Park Chan-wook reteams with star Lee Byung-hun for No Other Choice, a murderously funny satire about the effects of downsizing. True crime and far-right politics merge in Francesco Costabile's Familia from Italy, and a rare comedy comes from Finland in Teemu Nikki's 100 Liters of Gold, about two sisters who accidentally get high on their own supply of homebrew. Finally, we have Céspedes' Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo from Chile, a child's-eye tale of acceptance and loss set in the early 1980s.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lauren Sánchez turned heads in a luxurious leather coat minidress that retails for nearly $10,000 for her date night with her husband, Jeff Bezos. The newlyweds were photographed stepping out at Bird Streets Club in Los Angeles on Friday night. The popular Alaïa Edition structured coat ($9,970) — which features an asymmetrical zipper and an oversized shearling collar and cuffs — hugged the former journalist's curves, giving her ample figure as she braved the chilly December weather. For the accessories, Sánchez, 55, kept things light with a Chloé small Paddington leather shoulder bag ($2,290) and a pair of dark shades. She also sported some dainty diamond earrings and a small silver necklace. The Amazon billionaire, 61, stood by his wife's side in an all-black ensemble, featuring his signature black T-shirt and matching pants.

In 2022, Kylie Jenner made headlines when she also wore the vintage 1987 Alaïa piece as a minidress during her trip to Aspen. Jenner, 28, completed the outfit with black shades and gloves, a furry black bucket hat and a structural pyramid bag. The Kylie Cosmetics founder attended Bezos and Sánchez's star-studded Italian wedding in June alongside the rest of her famous family, including sisters Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian, and their mom, Kris Jenner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In one spurious example Donald Trump offered in his Truth Social post, he warned, falsely, that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia” were “completely taking over the state” of Minnesota, with dangerous migrant gangs roving the streets as citizens cowered in fear at home. Tim Walz, the Democratic Party's 2024 nominee for vice president. “The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,” Trump fumed. In the not-too-recent past, it would have been unthinkable for a president to attack his political opponent using a derogatory term for people with intellectual disabilities. “I have been an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities since the birth of my second daughter,” who has Down syndrome, he wrote, noting that Trump's “choices of words have consequences.” (Trump, naturally, doubled down on his statement days later.) The president's epithet didn't come out of thin air. Elon Musk alone has dropped the word more than 30 times on his X account since early 2024, while Joe Rogan has said that its return represents an important win for right-wingers. “From the far right's perspective, reintroducing a word we are taught not to say is a rebellious act meant to take back power. Open defiance is a clear sign that the old gatekeepers are no longer in charge.” “Retarded” is a corresponding adjective referring to whomever or whatever has been slowed down, and “retardant” describes that which is capable of inhibiting in this way: a “flame retardant” substance, for example, helps to reduce or halt the spread of fire. By the 19th century, clinical psychologists were applying old words such as “idiot” and “imbecile” to categorize people with intellectual disabilities, and sometimes inventing new ones. To receive one of these designations from a doctor in this era was to be marked as unfit for society and a candidate for potential institution and sterilization. Dear Pete Hegseth, I'm Grateful the Japanese Navy Spared My Grandfather's Life Trump Is Trying to Legalize Corruption by Abusing His Pardon Power Jimmy Kimmel Roasts Trump Appearing to Fight Off Sleep During Viral Cabinet Meeting Sabrina Carpenter Slams 'Evil and Disgusting' White House Video That Sets 'Juno' to ICE Raids As those words were adopted for epithets of abuse outside clinical settings, some in the medical community sought to move toward less loaded language. But “retarded” did remain accepted scientific language into the 1980s and 1990s. John McWhorter, an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University who examined profanity and slurs in his 2021 book Nine Nasty Words, says that the R-word was partially meant to be a neutralizing solution to words like “imbecile” becoming offensive slang. “My sense is that ‘moron' and ‘idiot' were the ones shelved for the more euphemistic ‘retarded,' which originally would have felt like just ‘slowed down by factors beyond their control,'” he tells Rolling Stone. Problem is, that term after a while takes on the same associations. (It is probably no coincidence that Musk and Rogan, two outspoken fans of the epithet, are Gen Xers who were born right around a time when popular culture had fully embraced it for bullying purposes.) Anderson says that what happened with the R-word is hardly unique. “The process of words moving from neutral to pejorative is called pejoration,” he explains. For example, it also happened with ‘idiot' and ‘feeble-minded,' both terms that were used in a neutral way but then shifted to something more negative. “The status and meaning of expressions has much to do with shifting language ideologies,” Anderson adds, reflecting the values, morals, and politics of a social world. “Often, we come to feel positively or negatively about an expression, or expect words to be used in specific contexts and ways because of language ideologies.” That the R-word came to serve as a common disparagement for people who are not intellectually disabled revealed a societal lack of empathy and care for those who are. The measure, known as Rosa's Law, was named for Rosa Marcellino, a nine-year-old with Down syndrome who along with her parents successfully fought to remove the term “mental retardation” from health and education records in her home state of Maryland. The federal law likewise amended government documentation, removing “mental retardation” and “mentally retarded” in favor of “intellectual disability” and “individual with an intellectual disability.” Several states had already begun making this revision, as had bureaucratic agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were signs, however, that some would not be giving it up. Coulter doubled down on her remarks in a CNN interview. “I was not referring to someone with Down syndrome. “Do you call people with mental disabilities retards?” she asked. Trump's 2016 presidential run brought moments of shocking incivility from the insurgent candidate. While in office, Trump regularly lobbed profanities, apparently regarding them as a natural element of his populist appeal. It was not until 2024, however — during an election that saw Trump relentlessly attack Joe Biden as a president in steep cognitive decline — that MAGA culture warriors made a concerted effort to revive the term as a standard verbal jab. They were aided in this by Musk's 2022 acquisition of Twitter, which he rebranded as X and stripped of various moderation policies, reinstating extremists, conspiracy theorists, and peddlers of misinformation who had been banned under those guidelines. (The account was opened in December 2024 and now has more than 800,000 followers.) But it wasn't just Musk driving these trends, according to the study's authors. “While it might be tempting to view an event such as this as an isolated one-off, indications are that the widespread dissemination of hateful and marginalizing content may be an increasingly prominent feature on social media,” they wrote, observing that Facebook parent Meta had recently dismantled some of its safeguards against dehumanizing language, apparently in concession to the political climate about to be ushered in with a second Trump term. This week, the paper's co-authors — Bond Benton, a communications professor, and justice studies professor Daniela Peterka-Benton — released new findings that showed a sharp rise in use of the R-word on X in the days after Trump applied it to Walz. “A lot of people face similar stressors in society right now, from cultural challenges to economic challenges to perceptions that they're being marginalized in some way,” Benton tells Rolling Stone. “When you can say a word that you know is going to be hurtful to a lot of people, there could be a sort of power in that: you go from being vulnerable to being perceived as dangerous.” Benton believes right-wingers may be seeking “validation” by making others angry in this way. Rock's Greatest Bootlegger: A New Pink Floyd Box Set Legitimizes an Outlaw 's Funeral Back to Rapper's Estate, Bad Boy Co-Founder Says Dear Pete Hegseth, I'm Grateful the Japanese Navy Spared My Grandfather's Life “Not using the R-word has sort of become synonymous with ‘wokeness,'” observes Peterka-Benton. Using it today, she says, is about “regaining the power to decide” what can be said publicly while “completely disregarding the harm that has been done to the disability community.” Peterka-Benton adds that heated discourse around such slurs can also act as “a diversion from bigger problems, from economic inequality to lingering questions about Trump's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Grocery prices are up, limited disclosures about Epstein haven't led to prosecutions of Democrats, the county is inching toward a mad war with Venezuela, and millions are set to lose Medicaid coverage — but you are free to throw the word “retarded” around online. As one X user summarized recent polling data that shows Trump's disapproval rating has topped 60 percent: “You wanted a return to 2019 America but all you got is the r-word pass.” And it's already looking as if that wasn't quite the deal of a lifetime.

On December 5, 2025, Holmes posted photos on social media of himself with Cozzolino, writing that he was “devastated by the passing of my good friend.” “Frank made us better,” Holmes wrote in a beautiful tribute. “His impact will live on in every home he helped. Frank could walk into the toughest electrical disaster, crack a joke in his style, and suddenly the whole room felt lighter. Frank will forever be part of the Holmes family. On the morning of December 5, an administrator for his company's Facebook page wrote in a post, “Good morning, Some may have seen a post about some sad news. Unfortunately, it is true, Frank Cozzolino did pass away last night. This page will be converted to ‘In memory of Frank'” He shared on Instagram at the time, “In 2012 I was told I would not live past 5 years with my liver. On August 24th 2017 I was given a second chance at life. I am forever thankful and blessed that Organ Donation exists.” Holmes and his kids — HGTV's Sherry Holmes and Mike Holmes Jr. — were close friends with Cozzolino, whose Instagram feed includes photos of them at birthday parties, boating, and even before Sherry's wedding in 2018. Hell of an electrician and teacher to many. Enjoyed watching him on TV explain the correct way to do things. One fan wrote on Holmes' post, “Aww, so sorry for your loss. 😞 I only know him from watching your show and he seemed like a very stand up wonderful man.” On Facebook, a post from Trimbow Window Manufacturing said that Cozzolino is survived by two daughters. It was a privilege and pleasure to work alongside him on all Holmes projects, making it right for so many deserving people. He was a gentle, kind, passionate and caring person. Our condolences to his daughters Alexandria and Filomena. It's not known if Cozzolino filmed any of those episodes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Miley Cyrus may not be afraid to perform her music on a stage in front of countless people, but she does have one fear that happens to be pretty rare. Revealing the fact during an interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Thursday, December 4, the singer revealed that her repulsion to paper is so bad that even seeing it makes her feel ill. Looking at it makes me want to vomit,” she said while noting the difficulty this presents when wrapping holiday gifts. She also revealed that she can't read a newspaper and has her fiancé, Maxx Morando, open Amazon packages for her so she doesn't have to touch the cardboard, which is “the worst of it all.” She added, “The real problem for me is when people have dry hands, and then they touch paper.” Beyond that, she explained, “When someone sends me a lovely letter, I just don't even open it. It's getting worse, so there does need to be some sort of intervention. I am going to look into some sort of EMDR [psychotherapy], being hypnotized about it because it is impacting my everyday life.” When Cyrus's interview was shared on YouTube, plenty of people commented to say that they were surprised by the singer's unusual phobia. At the same time, there were others who related to her paper-related issue. One person wrote, “My son had the same aversion to paper. I've never heard of anyone else feeling like this.” Someone else left a comment, saying, “I love how she's gags through half of this interview! My best friend and I have misophonia which is the same thing with noises like eating chewing or even typing or clicking any noise that drives you NUTS!! If you know someone who suffers from papyrophobia, then you can let them know that what they have is quite unusual and can be addressed. “It's hard knowing exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like papyrophobia, but it's rare,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. They also note that “[f]emales are more likely than males to experience a phobia disorder.” Most healthcare providers combine hypnotherapy with psychotherapy to help you address and overcome the fear.” Can't got to IHOP or Dennys I get ill!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a move that no one could have anticipated without, at bare minimum, the possession of an extremely rudimentary brainstem, Vanity Fair has announced today that it's “parting ways” with reporter Olivia Nuzzi. What the statement did not say was all the very obvious stuff about Nuzzi's recent work as the magazine's West Coast Editor—a job she's currently held for all of three months—i.e., that it's been completely, massively overshadowed by drama in her personal life, and specifically her widely reported “personal relationship” with current Secretary Of Health And Human Services Robert F. Kennedy. That “emotional and digital in nature” affair, with a subject she'd been covering as a reporter, already lead Nuzzi's previous employer, New York magazine, to “part ways” with her back in 2024. But Vanity Fair‘s editors presumably thought that the Kennedy thing was very literally old news; that the story had been aired out enough to transform it from a huge question of journalistic ethics and judgment into an amusing anecdote about a harmless moral whoopsie of the past. But that was before Nuzzi's ex, former New Yorker and Politico correspondent Ryan Lizza, began publishing Substack articles a few weeks ago claiming that Nuzzi's relationship with Kennedy went a lot deeper than whatever the hell “emotional and digital in nature” covers, and that she'd also been operating essentially as an operative for the Kennedy political campaign—most damningly with an accusation that she'd been running “catch and kill” operations to stop negative stories about Kennedy from being published. (It's worth noting, if only in passing, that Lizza is a complicated figure here in his own right, having been dismissed from The New Yorker back in 2017 after a #MeToo allegation; for what it's worth, Nuzzi has denounced his series of recent writings about her as “obsessive and violating fan fiction-slash-revenge porn.”) The point is that Lizza's allegations have been sticking in people's brains—including, apparently, the sort of people who have sway at Vanity Fair. (Even if the whole thing carries an air of a frog being righteously indignant that it now has to “part ways” with the scorpion that jammed a venomous stinger through its neck two minutes into their trip across the river.) At least one highly negative review has already drubbed the book as a “tell-nothing memoir” that also serves as a handy “portrait of losing your soul”—but we're guessing that isn't actually going to hurt book sales too badly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dakota Johnson dazzled in a sheer white lace gown as she attended the Red Sea International Film Festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Johnson, 36, kept her look somewhat conservative as the dress featured a large lace ruffle skirt around her pelvic area. Though, she still managed to show plenty of legs and skin on the upper half of her body. She completed her look with a pair of white heels from Paris Texas and Chopard jewelry. Johnson and her longtime stylist, Kate Young, have been known to have a certain affinity for sheer looks. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

The intricate black lace dress featured a high neckline. She covered her intimate parts underneath with a black balconette bra ($128) and cheeky underwear ($52) by Fleur du Mal. She finished her look with a pair of strappy black high-heeled sandals and several diamond and emerald jewelry pieces designed by Jessica McCormack. She let the dress take center stage as she paired the ensemble with skin-colored underwear and a simple glittering necklace.</p>
