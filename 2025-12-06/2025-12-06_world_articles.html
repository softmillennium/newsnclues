Grijalva (D-Ariz.) wrote on social media that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers “just conducted a raid by Taco Giro in Tucson — a small mom-and-pop restaurant that has served our community for years.” Grijalva said in a video uploaded to the post that she was “sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others, when I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress.” “They're targeting small businesses and people that are helping in our communities in order to try to fill the quota that [President Donald] Trump has given them.” Mocking the incident on social media, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin contended that Grijalva “wasn't pepper sprayed.” “In fact, two law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that [Grijalva] joined.” “Pepper spraying a sitting member of Congress is disgraceful, unacceptable, and absolutely not what we voted for,” he added. PRESS RELEASE: 'Disgraceful and Cowardly" – House Dem Leaders Condemn ICE Pepper Spraying of Congresswoman Grijalva #azleg pic.twitter.com/6grALc2bvp Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said on social media: “This is unacceptable and outrageous. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) also weighed in on social media, calling the incident “outrageous.” Friday's incident follows federal agents' violent removal of Sen. Alexa Padilla (D-Calif.) from a June press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Congresswoman LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) was federally indicted in June for allegedly “forcibly impeding and interfering with federal officers” during an oversight visit at a privately operated migrant detention center in Newark, New Jersey and subsequent confrontation with ICE agents outside of the lockup in which US Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez, both New Jersey Democrats, were also involved. Violent assaults by federal agents on suspected undocumented immigrants — including US citizens — protesters, journalists, and others are a regular occurrence amid the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. “If federal agents are brazen enough to fire pellets directly at a member of Congress, imagine how they behave when encountering defenseless members of our community,” Grijalva said late Friday on social media.

While temporary repairs have been carried out, "timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential"  to ensure Ukraine's long-term nuclear safety,  IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said. Further temporary repair work to the shield will begin next year with support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), clearing the path for its "full restoration" post-war. Back in April, the then-Environment Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk warned that the sarcophagus had partially lost its functionality and needed to be repaired to prevent leaks. Russia's drone strike caused a fire that burned the outer cladding of the shelter, although it did not cause a spike in radiation levels. Monitoring efforts have been in place, with an IAEA mission permanently located at the plant. Russian troops continue to occupy the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, sparking fears of another nuclear disaster that would have devastating consequences for Ukraine and its neighbors. "Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace. We agreed on the next steps and formats for talks with the United States," Zelensky wrote on Dec. 6. Russia failed to break Ukraine's army on the battlefield, and now it's trying to do it through a peace plan that would cap Ukraine's forces at 600,000. Some argue that Ukraine would shrink its army — currently estimated at about 800,000 — after the war anyway. The cyberattack took down over 700 computers and servers and deleted accounts of more than 1,000 Eltrans+ users, HUR claimed. Three people have been injured in a Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv Oblast overnight on Dec. 6, local officials reported. The Kyiv Independent will also present a curated photo exhibition If the ban goes through, Russia would likely have to expand its shadow fleet to transport crude oil instead. Ukraine's Air Assault Forces said on Dec. 5 that neither Pokrovsk nor its sister city Myrnohrad is encircled, stressing that defense units are expanding logistics routes and maintaining control over key positions in the area. The Trump administration on Dec. 4 extended a waiver that lets Lukoil-branded gas stations abroad stay in business, softening elements of the sanctions imposed on the firm in October. Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, said its drones hit a Russian Su-24 tactical bomber as past of a series of eight "accurate strikes" on military targets inside Russian-occupied Crimea on Dec. 5.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has hailed a new economic deal with the United Arab Emirates as a way to “attract billions of dollars in investments into Canada.” The $50 billion agreement — $70-billion in Canadian dollars — was announced as Carney travelled to Abu Dhabi in November for talks with Emirati leaders, and comes as Canada attempts to diversify its economic partners as it contends with effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Yet back in Canada, human rights advocates and legal experts have condemned the Canadian government for deepening ties to the UAE as it stands accused of fueling mass atrocities in Sudan. “Carney is selling out our principles — including Canada's commitment to the basic rules of international law and to human rights — to make money,” said Mark Kersten, an assistant professor specializing in international law at University of the Fraser Valley. Human rights advocates and legal experts have condemned the Canadian government for deepening ties to the UAE as it stands accused of fueling mass atrocities in Sudan. Earlier this year, media outlets reported on a leaked document written by a panel of UN experts that said cargo flights were routinely bringing weapons from the UAE to Chad. U.S. lawmakers also have acknowledged the UAE's role in fueling the war in Sudan, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying during his Senate confirmation hearing in January that the country was “openly supporting an entity that is carrying out a genocide.” In 2024, Canadian exports of military goods and technology to the UAE totalled just over $5 million ($7 million in Canadian dollars), according to government records. Yet despite the relatively small sum, rights groups say any amount of weapons that could be funneled into the conflict in Sudan is too many. Yet both cases are an apparent violation of a UN arms embargo on Sudan that was put in place more than two decades ago to try to prevent ethnic cleansing and other atrocities in Darfur. The RSF grew out of the Janjaweed, an Arab militia aligned with former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, which was a main target of that 2004 arms embargo. The ATT bans signatories from transferring weapons to another country if there is a plausible risk they could be used in violations of international humanitarian law, such as war crimes. “This prohibits any person in Canada or any Canadian outside Canada from knowingly exporting arms and related material, wherever situated, to Sudan or to any person in Sudan,” a spokesperson said in an email. The UN Genocide Convention imposes an obligation on signatories — such as Canada — to prevent genocide whenever a risk of such violence exists. But the department did not comment on Truthout's specific questions on whether it is reviewing any Canadian companies whose weapons have been reported in the hands of RSF fighters. Global Affairs Canada said it has a “robust risk assessment framework” to evaluate weapons export or brokering permit applications. “Canada has made no exceptions to this legal requirement,” the spokesperson said. “If these laws are violated, we will ensure those responsible face legal consequences that could include fines, seizure of goods and criminal prosecution.” Separately, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said late last month that she was “very seriously” looking into the reports of Canadian weapons being used by the RSF. But the legal experts who spoke to Truthout said reports about Canadian-made weapons ending up in Sudan go back years — and action is long overdue. “We've seen vehicles produced by STREIT appearing in places where they shouldn't be for over a decade now, including in Sudan,” said Kelsey Gallagher, a researcher at anti-war group Project Ploughshares. The STREIT Group did not respond to Truthout's request for comment. Canada must do more to strengthen its arms export regime, including putting more robust systems in place to oversee how Canadian weapons are ultimately being used, Gallagher said. This sentiment was echoed by Kersten at University of the Fraser Valley, who said that even if weapons are manufactured abroad, there are steps that the Canadian government can take. “The evidence is that we're talking about significant volumes of Canadian weapons fueled into contexts of genocide, both in Gaza and in Sudan.” The UN Genocide Convention also imposes an obligation on signatories — such as Canada — to prevent genocide whenever a risk of such violence exists. “Given the dynamics of the violence, it would be implausible to argue that there is no risk of genocide in Darfur,” Kersten said. Michael Bueckert, vice president of advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, is not optimistic that Canada will take real action, however. Instead, Bueckert said Carney and his government have signaled that they are prioritizing “corporate profits over human rights” around the world. The prime minister — who took office after winning elections in April — has sought to grow trade relationships with a range of countries amid fraught U.S.-Canada ties. That includes India, which just last year was accused by Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, of being involved in the killing of a Canadian Sikh activist on Canadian soil. “The evidence is that we're talking about significant volumes of Canadian weapons fueled into contexts of genocide, both in Gaza and in Sudan,” Bueckert told Truthout. “But so far, we've seen the smallest amount of lip service that the Canadian government can get away with and no real indication that they're going to be taking action,” Bueckert said. “Clearly, Canada wants to put a lot of emphasis on a strategic economic partnership with the UAE and that's the most important thing.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa has accused Israel of exporting crises to other countries and “fighting ghosts,” amid persistent incursions and air strikes by Israeli forces into southern Syria. Al-Sharaa was speaking at the Doha Forum in Qatar on Saturday, in a conversation with CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour. Israeli forces crossed into southern Syria a year ago, as the Assad regime fell, and continue to occupy the strategic heights of Mount Hermon. Syria was adamant about respecting the 1974 agreement and would not accept an alternative buffer zone, Al-Sharaa said. “We demand Israel to go back to the pre-December 8 (2024) lines,” he said, adding that the United States was taking part in negotiations. Attempts to revise the agreement would “send us into a serious and dangerous place,” he said. “Who will be protecting this buffer zone or this demilitarized zone if the Syrian army or Syrian forces aren't going to be there?” he asked. “Syria has suffered massive violations of our airspace, and we've been victim of over 1,000 air strikes and over 400 incursions” since the revolution a year ago, Al-Sharaa said. At least 13 people were killed during an Israeli military raid in southern Syria late last month. Al-Sharaa's rebel forces entered the Syrian capital last December, forcing then President Bashar al-Assad to flee. Al-Sharaa repeated that his government would hold to account those involved in abuses earlier this year in Syria's coastal zone, when hundreds of minority Alawites were killed. As to elections, Al-Sharaa said his current mandate would be for a further four years, while a constitution is drafted and institutions built. At that point, elections would take place, he said. An indirect parliamentary election held in October was marred by concerns about representation of women and minorities. Only a small fraction of the population was able to vote. Syria's jihadist-turned-president caps extraordinary transformation with White House visit “There was a great understanding, and I believe we're at the 95% point,” he said. “There was a great understanding, and I believe we're at the 95% point,” he said. “People were receiving an hour and a half of electricity per day, and now we have reached 12 to 14 hours per day and hopefully this year we will be self-sufficient in terms of electricity,” Al-Sharaa said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz will also be present for talks on guaranteeing Ukraine's postwar security Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Downing Street on Monday for an in-person meeting with Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz in a show of support for Ukraine. Starmer will use the meeting with the leaders from Ukraine, France and Germany to discuss the continuing talks between US and Ukrainian officials aimed at finding an agreement on guaranteeing Ukraine's postwar security. The draft peace deal, quietly brokered between US and Russian officials, has been criticised for leaving Ukraine in a weak and vulnerable position. The initial draft plan, which was reportedly developed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev, would have forced draconian measures on Ukraine that would have given Russia unprecedented control over the country's military and political sovereignty, conditions that were seen as a surrender by Kyiv. The peace plan was significantly amended by Ukraine last month, removing some of Russia's maximalist demands. The Ukrainian military said Russia had launched 653 drones and 51 missiles on Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces downed 585 drones and 30 missiles, the military said. Zelensky has said Ukraine's energy infrastructure was the main target for hundreds of Russian drones and about 50 missiles, with Ukrainian officials accusing Moscow of seeking to “weaponise” the cold by denying civilians access to heat and power. Meanwhile, US and Ukrainian officials will conduct a third day of talks in Florida as Trump's administration pushes Kyiv to accept an American-backed peace plan. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has already rejected some parts of the plan, with Ukraine's territorial integrity and measures to deter future Russian attacks proving big sticking points for Moscow. In its new national security strategy, published overnight on Saturday, the White House said it was committed to Ukraine's survival as a “viable state”. But the strategy also prioritised improving relations with Moscow, stating that ending the war is a core US interest to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia”. ​On Saturday evening, Zelenskyy said he had held a “very substantive and constructive” call with the US envoys Witkoff and Jared Kushner.</p>

            At least 11 people were killed on Saturday including a three-year-old boy, after gunshots were fired at an illegal bar in the South African city of Pretoria, police said, adding that a manhunt was launched for three suspects who were not identified.
    


            Another 14 people were wounded during the incident in the Saulsville township, they said in a statement.
    


            Police didn't say whether the shooting occurred inside or outside the illegal bar, known locally as a “shebeen.”
    


            “Three minors are among those deceased, which include 3- and 12-year-old boys (and a) 16-year-old female,” the South African Police Service said.
    


            South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, averaging about 60 a day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This is a momentous event, for it [RT] grants millions of Indian citizens clearer, more direct access to insights about contemporary Russia,” Vladimir Putin said. Commenting on RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan's remarks that RT's broadcasts are being shut down in many “ill-intentioned countries,” the Russian president stated: “This is not out of malice, it is out of fear, fear of the truth. Because Russia Today is a source of truthful and reliable information, focused on serving the interests of its viewers and listeners.” He added: “Russia Today's mission is not merely to promote Russia, its culture, and its positions on domestic and international issues. Above all, Russia Today strives to convey truthful information about our country and about what is happening in the world. This is the absolute value of Russia Today; this is what distinguishes it from the propaganda machinery of many Western media outlets, which essentially relay the positions of their governments.” As part of President Putin's visit to India, an Addendum to the Memorandum of Understanding between RT and Indian public service broadcaster Prasar Bharati was signed, further expanding cooperation in the media sphere. This marks a new phase in the partnership between RT and Prasar Bharati, strengthening not only media collaboration but also broader bilateral relations amid a complex international environment. RT India will air four daily news bulletins alongside documentaries, interviews with government officials, business leaders, and cultural figures, as well as public affairs programming tailored to a broad Indian audience. The channel will prioritize in-depth coverage of key developments in Russian-Indian relations and the growing role of both nations in a multipolar world. The channel's flagship geopolitical talk show will be hosted by former Indian Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid. Rungjun Sharma, the head of News at RT India, will present a weekly program dedicated to Russian-Indian relations. The Indian politician, diplomat, author, and chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, already hosts his own show on RT called ‘Imperial Receipts with Dr. Shashi Tharoor'. It also represents a landmark moment in relations between the two friendly nations. RT India will serve as a vital platform for highlighting the strategic nature of Russian-Indian cooperation, built over decades on mutual respect, trust, and open dialogue. In 2026, RT also plans to launch a dedicated Hindi-language news website, catering to over 500 million Hindi speakers in India. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 650 drones target locations across Ukraine including western regions with sirens sounding in eastern Poland Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine in the early hours of Saturday as US and Ukrainian officials continued talks in Miami which the White House hopes will bring an end to the conflict. Russia used more than 650 drones and 51 missiles overnight, Ukraine's armed forces said, with drones targeting locations across the country, including in western regions hundreds of miles from the frontline. Warning sirens also sounded in parts of eastern Poland, close to the Ukrainian border. Russia's defence ministry said it had shot down 116 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory, while there were unconfirmed reports on Telegram that Ukraine had hit an oil refinery in the city of Ryazan. Talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators are due to continue for a third day in Miami on Saturday, after a meeting between Vladimir Putin, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow earlier in the week. Washington's plans involve Ukraine surrendering land in return for vague security guarantees and would be hard for Kyiv to accept in the current moment. European nations have been blindsided by some of the US efforts and have been scrambling to stay part of the process. “The US is still our biggest ally,” said Kallas, speaking at a diplomatic conference in Qatar. “I think we haven't always seen eye to eye on different topics, but I think the overall principle is still there.</p>

BRUSSELS, December 6. /TASS/. The European Union (EU) continues to consider the United States its main ally despite the new American National Security Strategy, which harshly criticizes the EU, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas said.

"The US is still our biggest ally. I think we haven't always seen eye to eye on different topics, but I think the overall principle is still there. We are the biggest allies and we should stick together," she said at the Doha Forum in Qatar.

The updated US National Security Strategy published on December 5 expresses, among other things, the concern that Europe will become unrecognizable in 20 years and is on the verge of destruction as a civilization due to the subversive policies of the leadership of the European Union and other supranational structures. In this regard, the American administration expressed doubts that a number of European countries would have the necessary economic and military potential to remain Washington's reliable allies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eleanor McCain, pictured in 2017, has triggered an agreement that she says requires her siblings, cousins and their offspring to purchase her stake in the holding company that owns McCain Foods.Galit Rodan/The Canadian Press Thirty-one years after brothers Wallace and Harrison McCain fought for control of McCain Foods Ltd. – a battle for the world's largest French fry maker that Harrison won – Wallace's daughter, Eleanor McCain, has kicked off a showdown with her relatives by demanding they buy her out of one of the country's largest privately owned companies. Eleanor, a 56-year-old musician who lives in Toronto, recently triggered an agreement that she says requires her siblings, cousins and their offspring to purchase her stake in the holding company that owns McCain Foods. Based on the value of comparable publicly traded food companies, McCain Foods is worth at least $20-billion and Eleanor's investment could be worth more than $1-billion. Family control affords six-generation Burnbrae Farms freedom to invest in long-term goals “Eleanor McCain is seeking to exit her stake in the company co-founded by her father to focus on philanthropy, and for portfolio diversification and estate-planning purposes,” Wojtek Dabrowski, a spokesperson for Ms. McCain, said in a statement. McCain has consistently engaged constructively, in good faith, and would like to conclude this matter in a fair, timely and confidential fashion,” the statement said. Eleanor's relatives have refused her request to cash her out for reasons sources trace back to the 1990s dispute over succession between the co-founders, who both died more than a decade ago. The multiyear contest between Wallace and Harrison McCain, ultimately decided in October, 1994, after 10 weeks of arbitration in a Fredericton courtroom, left wounds that have not healed after 31 years, the sources said. Harrison McCain's offspring are still angry with some of Wallace's children. The fight is also rooted in the challenge of setting a value on each family member's stake in McCain Foods, which is growing rapidly as ownership moves into a fourth generation of the founding family, sources say. Each side has hired corporate lawyers from firms such as Torys LLP and Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP to sort out what everyone involved describes as a messy relationship, and a family shareholder agreement that is open to interpretation. His father's push to designate Michael the next chief executive officer of McCain Foods, succeeding Harrison McCain, sparked the fight for control. His stakes in the two companies are worth approximately $1.4-billion. Eleanor McCain has never worked at the family company. After earning an undergraduate degree in music at New Brunswick's Mount Allison University, she built a career performing as a singer and released seven albums. Maple Leaf Foods spins off its pork business to focus on high-protein goods She also owns properties in Peggy's Cove, N.S., and plans to build an art gallery and museum in the tourist town if she can win government approvals. Heirs of Wallace and Harrison McCain – who died in 2004 – each have two seats on the holding company board. McCain Foods is overseen by a separate, operating company board. Prior to his death in 2004, Harrison McCain created a “thick document” and a two-tier board structure meant to guide the family's affairs, said Eleanor McCain's brother Scott McCain in a 2018 interview with former Globe and Mail reporter Gordon Pitts. He worked with his father and brother at Maple Leaf until retiring in 2014. After leaving Maple Leaf, Scott McCain reconciled with his relatives and he is now chair of the operating company's board. Eleanor McCain and her relatives are at odds over a food giant that ranks as one of Canada's few global champions. It sources potatoes from a network of 3,500 independent farmers, spread across 16 countries. McCain Foods started out with four shareholders, all sons of a potato farmer. Two older brothers, Robert and Andrew McCain, chipped in $20,000 each to support their siblings. While McCain Foods is private, other publicly traded companies with comparable sales, such as cheese maker Saputo Inc., cereal producer Kellogg's and chocolatier Hershey Co., are worth between $17-billion and $51-billion. McCain Foods' largest publicly traded peer is Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., based in Eagle, Idaho. In 1995, shortly after the family split, Harrison McCain stepped down as CEO of the company he co-founded and brought in outside leaders with global experience. McCain Foods recruited its current CEO, Mr. Koeune, from French food giant Danone SA. Two-thirds of businesses don't have a succession plan. Family-owned companies that successfully pass control from one generation to the next consistently have clear shareholder agreements that include rules for paying out anyone who wants to exit, according to a study led by Peter Jaskiewicz, chair in family enterprise at the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa. The two key elements of these family agreements are how they deal with ownership and leadership across generations, according to Dr. Jaskiewicz, who chose to study the dynamics of private companies after his parents' family business failed to navigate succession issues. In Europe and Asia, his study showed there are multiple examples of successful 20-plus generation family companies, with thousands of shareholders, all guided by written contracts. Their ranks include the Mars family, whose 114-year-old candy and pet food empire is worth more than US$100-billion, and the Cargill-MacMillan clan, whose stake in agriculture company Cargill Inc., founded in 1865, is valued at US$61-billion.

LONDON, December 6. /TASS/. The possible confiscation of frozen Russian assets in the European Union could impact the euro's role as a global reserve currency, the Financial Times (FT) newspaper wrote.

Euro-denominated assets account for around 20% of foreign exchange reserves held by central banks worldwide, according to the publication. In this respect, the euro is second only to the US dollar, which accounts for almost 60% of global foreign exchange reserves. However, if the EU decides to seize Russia's frozen assets, central banks and private investors will begin to doubt whether it is worth buying European securities.

That said, although the European Central Bank has expressed skepticism about the asset seizure scheme, pointing out its risks, some EU countries that have long opposed it have changed their position and now support such a move, the paper added.</p>

OTSU — The world karuta championship, using the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu poetry anthology, was held at Omi Jingu Shrine in Otsu for the first time in six years. Twelve teams from 10 countries and regions, including Japan, Egypt, South Korea and Taiwan, participated in the games. The tournament was a team competition in which three players from each team competed to collect cards, vying for the most wins. Omi Jingu is considered the “holy ground of karuta” because it enshrines Emperor Tenji (626-671). All three Japanese members were fourth-year students, who entered the tournament wanting to create lasting memories. “It's rare to have the chance to play against people from overseas in Japan,” said vice captain Ayaka Nagatani, who was enjoying interacting with players from the other teams. Thai team captain Memee Dantavornjaroen, who has played karuta for 17 years, said, “I want to aim for victory next time and enjoy karuta with a smile as I'm a Thai person.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

He noted that Ukrainian units in central Pokrovsk are actively holding back Russian attempts to advance. Logistical access to neighboring Myrnohrad has become more difficult, he acknowledged, but movement into the city continues. “Units continue to enter the settlement and carry out their tasks,” Lasiichuk said. The fortress city of Pokrovsk has long been one of the most hotly contested areas of the front line, with Ukrainian troops holding off a major Russian assault for a year. While strikes on both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been recorded in the northern low-density residential neighborhoods of Pokrovsk, the front-line contact zone and proper territorial control is difficult to establish.

Russia failed to break Ukraine's army on the battlefield, and now it's trying to do it through a peace plan that would cap Ukraine's forces at 600,000. Some argue that Ukraine would shrink its army — currently estimated at about 800,000 — after the war anyway.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Carney turned on the charm with Donald Trump at the FIFA World Cup draw as he engaged in frequent banter throughout the event, hunkered down for a 45-minute meeting afterward and drew plaudits for Canada's “friendship” from the famously mercurial U.S. President. At the FIFA draw, Mr. Trump received a peace prize created especially for him, bragged about the World Cup's ticket sales and was serenaded by the Village People and Andrea Bocelli, two of his favourite musical acts. Opinion: Gretzky gave us a spectacle of meme-able proportions at the World Cup draw Mr. Carney, Mr. Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whose countries are co-hosting next summer's soccer tournament, sat next to each other for most of the event, which unfolded at the Kennedy Center. The trio smiled and chatted throughout, with Mr. Carney occasionally leaning across Ms. Sheinbaum – who sat in the middle – to get closer to Mr. Trump. Both Canada and Mexico are fighting to preserve the trade pact, which Mr. Trump has mused about quitting when it comes up for review next year, and trying to negotiate an end to the U.S. President's tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and other goods. Mr. Trump broke off negotiations with Canada on tariffs in October because of a pro-free-trade ad aired in the U.S. by the Ontario government. Mr. Infantino's courtship of Mr. Trump has been contentious, with critics charging that it goes far beyond maintaining good relations with a host country and veers into the territory of endorsing his controversial policy agenda. Mr. Gretzky, another figure who has taken flak for his close relationship with Mr. Trump, served as one of four sports personalities to perform the draw itself, alongside former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, NFL legend Tom Brady and New York Yankee slugger Aaron Judge. The former Edmonton Oiler great, who wore a Maple Leaf pin, has golfed with Mr. Trump and hung out at Mar-a-Lago this year, even as the President threatened to annex Canada as the U.S.'s “51st state” and encouraged Mr. Gretzky to run for “governor.” On Friday, Mr. Gretzky mostly attracted attention on social media for mispronouncing the names of various countries in the draw, rendering Curaçao as “Curocko,” for instance. In his brief public comments, Mr. Carney lauded Canada's multicultural diversity, which Mr. Trump's own Vice-President, JD Vance, criticized last month as “immigration insanity” leading to a “stagnating country.” Mexico has jumped past Canada to become the U.S.'s top customer “There's more than 200 nationalities in Canada, more than 200 nationalities in FIFA, the top 48 are coming to North America,” Mr. Carney said, referring to the countries qualifying for the tournament. Ms. Sheinbaum, meanwhile, made a point of championing Mexico's “extraordinary, hard-working people.” Mr. Trump frequently portrays Mexican migrants as violent criminals to justify his crackdown on immigration. While neither Mr. Carney nor Ms. Sheinbaum has worked to woo Mr. Trump the way Mr. Infantino has, they have been studiously careful to maintain a chummy rapport, lest they be hit with even more tariffs.

WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) – The 2026 World Cup will kick off on June 11 with joint-hosts Mexico playing South Africa at the Azteca Stadium – iconic venue of the 1970 and 1986 finals – followed by South Korea against a playoff winner after the complex draw was made on Friday. The U.S., courtesy of their top seeding, got a dream draw and will play Paraguay, Australia and a playoff winner. The draw for the expanded 48-team tournament, with six berths still to be filled via a series of playoffs, was hugely complicated due to various geographical sub-clauses. Former England defender and MC Rio Ferdinand routinely returned balls to the metaphorical pot after “computer said no'. Defending champions Argentina were grouped with Algeria, Austria and debutants Jordan, while five-times winners Brazil will play Morocco – semi-finalists in 2022 – Haiti and Scotland. Norway and one of the playoff winners complete their group. England will start against Croatia, who beat them in the 2018 semi-finals, and also face Panama, who they thrashed 6-1 in the group stage in the same tournament, and Ghana. World number-one-ranked Spain have a dream draw alongside first-timers Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay. The Netherlands are with Japan, Tunisia and a playoff winner, Belgium have Egypt, Iran and New Zealand, while Portugal face debutants Uzbekistan, Colombia and a playoff winner. A newly introduced seeding system ensured that the current top four in the world – Spain, Argentina, France and England – cannot meet until the semi-final stage if they win their groups, but that has not ruled out a host of potential blockbuster clashes along the way. England's pathway to the showpiece match has a very Latin – and difficult – look with Mexico, Brazil, who they have never beaten at the World Cup, and Argentina in the way of a first final appearance since their sole triumph in 1966. Mexico have a favourable group but will be looking beyond that in the hope of at least matching their performance as hosts in 1986 when they reached the quarter-finals. Since then they suffered a remarkable seven consecutive last-16 exits and then failed to get out of their group in 2022. The U.S. have a winnable group and their Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino sounded upbeat. “But before that we need to play and be motivated with these guys that are going to be really tough.” Remarkably, despite playing each other 106 times, Brazil and Argentina have met in the World Cup knockout stage only once, when the Argentines won 1-0 in the 1990 Round of 16, but they could be on course for a seismic semi-final showdown next year.
