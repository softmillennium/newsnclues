                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia unleashed a major missile and drone barrage on Ukraine overnight into Saturday, after U.S. and Ukrainian officials said they'll meet on Saturday for a third day of talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war. Workers and military inspect Ukrainian Fire Point's Flamingo missiles during handover to the military in an undisclosed location in Ukraine Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia unleashed a major missile and drone barrage on Ukraine overnight into Saturday, after U.S. and Ukrainian officials said they'll meet Saturday for a third day of talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war. Russia used 653 drones and 51 missiles in the wide-reaching overnight attack on Ukraine, which triggered air raid alerts across the country and came as Ukraine marked Armed Forces Day, the country's air force said Saturday morning. At least eight people were wounded in the attacks, Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko said. Among these, at least three people were wounded in the Kyiv region, according to local officials. Russia carried out a “massive missile-drone attack” on power stations and other energy infrastructure in several Ukrainian regions, Ukraine's national energy operator, Ukrenergo, wrote on Telegram. Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all off-site power overnight, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday, citing its Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. The plant is in an area that has been under Russian control since early in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and is not in service, but it needs reliable power to cool its six shutdown reactors and spent fuel, to avoid any catastrophic nuclear incidents. Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses had shot down 116 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight into Saturday. Russian Telegram news channel Astra said Ukraine struck Russia's Ryazan Oil Refinery, sharing footage appearing to show a fire breaking out and plumes of smoke rising above the refinery. Pavel Malkov said a residential building had been damaged in a drone attack and that drone debris had fallen on the grounds of an “industrial facility,” but did not mention the refinery. Months of Ukrainian long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries have aimed to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue the war. Meanwhile, Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia is trying to cripple the Ukrainian power grid and deny civilians access to heat, light and running water for a fourth consecutive winter, in what Ukrainian officials call “weaponizing” the cold. The latest round of attacks came as U.S. President Donald Trump's advisers and Ukrainian officials said they'll meet for a third day of talks on Saturday, after making progress on finding agreement on a security framework for postwar Ukraine. Following Friday's talks, the two sides also offered the sober assessment that any “real progress toward any agreement” ultimately will depend “on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace.” The statement from U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as Ukrainian negotiators Rustem Umerov and Andriy Hnatov came after they met for a second day in Florida on Friday. They offered only broad brushstrokes about the progress they say has been made as Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a U.S.-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney holds their countries' name during the draw for the 2026 soccer World Cup at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino hold up country names during the draw for the 2026 soccer World Cup at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. ▶ Follow live updates on the 2025 FIFA World Cup draw WASHINGTON (AP) — All around the globe, eyes focused Friday on the stage where World Cup paths were sorted, nations' names chosen one by one in a draw that determined Argentina and Lionel Messi will start their title defense against Algeria and the U.S. will open against Paraguay. Twenty-seven months after qualifying began, teams from five-time champion Brazil to newcomers Cape Verde, Curaçao, Jordan and Uzbekistan learned their group-stage opponents in the expanded 48-nation, 104-game tournament that starts June 11 in the United States, Canada and Mexico. They're so proud,” said Dick Advocaat, the 78-year-old Dutchman leading Curaçao, a Caribbean country with a population of 150,000, into an opener against four-time champion Germany. Trump, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney picked up plastic spheres containing their own nations' names from bowls — Sheinbaum drew more applause from those gathered in the hall than Trump. FIFA's lead-in show, featuring music and stars from sports and entertainment, was almost as long as a soccer match, starting in the 87th minute. Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal, Aaron Judge and Wayne Gretzky took part. “Just watching Americans on stage and the president giving speeches and performances, it made it feel like an American event already,” said U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams, who watched from England, where he plays for the Premier League club Bournemouth. “And I think we know the expectation of what it's going to be like when we go there and there's going to be halftime shows and there's going to be celebrities and the big draw of what America brings to sports.” Three-time champion Argentina opens on June 16 at either Kansas City, Missouri, or Santa Clara, California. Specific sites for all group stage games and kickoff times were to be announced Saturday. The Albiceleste then face Austria and Jordan in Group J. Argentina surprisingly lost its 2022 opener to Saudi Arabia before going on to win the final over France on penalty kicks. Messi, who turns 39 during the tournament, hasn't committed yet to playing but it would be shocking if he decided against appearing in a record sixth World Cup. “We are just awaiting for him to decide,” coach Lionel Scaloni said. The Americans play Australia seven days later at Seattle, then face Turkey, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo — one will emerge next year from playoffs — on June 25 back at SoFi Stadium. Brimming with confidence, he defined success as: “Win the World Cup.” Mexico hosts the tournament opener at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on June 11 against South Africa in Group A, a rematch of the 1-1 tie at the 2010 opener in Johannesburg. El Tri then meets South Korea and closes the first round against the Czech Republic, Ireland, Denmark or North Macedonia. Forty-two of the teams have been determined; 22 are competing in playoffs for six berths that will be decided March 31. England, which won its only title in 1966, plays Croatia, Ghana and Panama in Group L. Players from Chelsea and Manchester City experienced summer U.S. conditions at this year's Club World Cup. “It doesn't make it any easier when it comes again to blame the heat and fight against humidity and altitude and different time zones,” England manager Thomas Tuchel said. Brazil opens against 2022 semifinalist Morocco, then plays Haiti and Scotland in Group C. “It is a difficult group,” coach Carlo Ancelotti said. Top-ranked Spain, the 2010 champion, faces Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay in Group H, while Germany follows its Curaçao match by playing Ivory Coast and Ecuador in Group E. “It is always difficult to play as a European team against a South American team,” Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said. Two-time champion France starts June 16 against Senegal at East Rutherford, New Jersey, or Foxborough, Massachusetts. With Les Bleus coming off their first world title, they lost 1-0 to the Lions of Teranga in the 2002 opener at Seoul, South Korea. France then faces Bolivia, Iraq or Suriname in Group I and closes perhaps the most daunting group against Norway in a matchup of Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, like Messi expected to play in a sixth World Cup, has Group K matches against Uzbekistan, Colombia and Congo, Jamaica or New Caledonia. B: Canada, Switzerland, Qatar and Italy, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Wales or Northern Ireland. “Without knowing who the third opponent is, it can get difficult — specifically if Italy advances,” Canada coach Jesse Marsch said. No team has repeated as champion since Brazil won in 1958 and '62, and only eight nations have won soccer's biggest prize.</p>

Fox News Digital visited Cedar–Riverside and the bustling Karmel Mall to hear from Somali residents and workers, about life America's largest Somali community. MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. – Minnesota is home to the nation's largest Somali community — a rapidly expanding Muslim population that has become a flashpoint in national debates over integration, welfare fraud and how the group is reshaping the state's historically Scandinavian, Christian cultural landscape. That scrutiny intensified this week after President Donald Trump blasted Somali Minnesotans as welfare abusers who have been raiding state coffers for years. "I hear they ripped off — Somalians ripped off that state for billions of dollars, billions every year. Somebody says, ‘Oh, that's not politically correct.' I don't want them in our country. Their country's no good for a reason. Women walk along a street in Minneapolis' Cedar–Riverside neighborhood, home to one of the largest Somali communities in the U.S. (Michael Dorgan/Fox News Digital) Women walk along a tree-lined street in Minneapolis' Cedar–Riverside neighborhood. A man wearing traditional Islamic clothing walks past Riverside Plaza in Minneapolis' Cedar–Riverside neighborhood. Trump and members of his administration have also accused the population of committing immigration fraud in order to bring friends and relatives to the U.S. and again claimed Rep. Ilhan Omar married her brother — a charge she has repeatedly denied. For years, accusations of crime and gang activity — and the fact that a small cohort of Somali Minnesotans traveled overseas to join al-Shabaab — have cast a long shadow over the community's efforts to assimilate. Many Somali residents told Fox News Digital that they are angered that the entire community has been saddled with what they say is an unfair reputation, blaming a small minority of fraudsters and criminals for the negative attention against the group as a whole. At first glance, the choice can seem perplexing: families from an East African nation putting down roots in a state known for subzero winters and harsh conditions. One local leader told Fox News Digital the true number is likely closer to 160,000. Like many immigrant groups before them, Somalis have brought their own customs and traditions — and have made their mark on the neighborhoods where they've settled. The Riverside Plaza apartment complex in Minneapolis' Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, a densely populated area home to one of the nation's largest Somali communities. Advocates say Somalis have woven themselves into Minnesota life — running restaurants and working in nursing, trucking, factories and filling shopping centers like the Somali-themed Karmel Mall in Minneapolis. They argue the community's true story is one of hard work, civic pride, and assimilation — not the isolated crimes that grab headlines. The largest cluster of Somalis in Minneapolis is in Cedar–Riverside, a neighborhood just south and west of downtown that has earned the nickname "Little Mogadishu," a nod to Somalia's capital city. When Fox News Digital visited Cedar–Riverside, the area felt almost hollowed out — run-down, like a poverty-stricken inner-city neighborhood. On a Saturday afternoon, the streets were quiet, lined with shuttered storefronts and once-lively bars from years past, while a handful of East African restaurants carried on with a steady flow of local patrons. Some closed shops with faded English signs now displayed "coming soon" notices in Arabic. Its once-vibrant multicolored panels have faded with time, mirroring the on-the-ground sense of wear and age — a reflection of the neighborhood's shifting fortunes. Outside, beside a street sign reading "Somali St," a woman dressed in bright green offered bottles of water for sale to passing drivers while flocks of pigeons flapped and spiraled up outside the towers. From left: Abdi Fatah Hassan, Andrew Henrichs, Zakariah Mohamed, Daniel Williams, and Luke Freeman share their views on the Somali community and life in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis. Campaign signs for Minneapolis mayoral and city council candidates, including Omar Fateh and Jacob Frey, line a fence in Cedar–Riverside. Pedestrians walk along Cedar Avenue near a mosque in Minneapolis' Cedar–Riverside neighborhood. The Islamic call to prayer rang out from a nearby mosque occupying an older commercial building, echoing over an empty street and through the concrete courtyards — a sound that felt both peaceful and eerie in the stillness. Men gathered outside the mosque, some wearing kufis for Friday prayers, while women passed by in hijabs and abayas — a sight still unfamiliar to many Americans, though now a regular part of daily life in Minneapolis. The day before, the liveliest scene unfolded as people entered and left another mosque on a corner street, its windows boarded up, while political yard signs for mayoral candidate Omar Fateh dotted the grass outside, as did ones for Council Member Jamal Osma. Both are progressives like Ilhan Omar, who has become the community's most visible national figure. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR–Minnesota, said that faith remains central to Somali life, but also serves as a bridge to their new home. "It helps us build discipline and community, and it's part of why Somalis have been able to succeed here." The sight of Muslim garb is a striking change for a neighborhood that was once a European immigrant enclave and, more recently, a hub for students and music lovers drawn to the University of Minnesota's West Bank and Augsburg University campuses nearby. Many of the old watering holes — like Palmer's Bar, which predates World War I — have struggled and closed amid changing demographics, shifting drinking habits and declining foot traffic. In the 1990s, Minnesota had only a handful of mosques. Today, there are about 90 statewide, Hussein said.

A "Welcome to the West Bank" directory sign in Minneapolis' Cedar–Riverside area is seen covered in graffiti and a defaced poster. The Cedar Cultural Center — one of the last survivors of the West Bank's old music corridor — still hosts musicians and artists, a reminder that Cedar–Riverside hasn't entirely lost its creative pulse. A few residents appeared high on drugs, huddled in doorways, the signs of addiction hard to miss. In the evening, a group of Somali volunteers wearing orange high-visibility vests gathered in the town square, offering medical help to those who had overdosed or fallen ill. One man said he had served time in jail for a gang-related crime, but denied being part of one. Another young man said he had just moved from South Dakota to rebuild his life after being jailed for murder, but was let out after being wrongly accused. "As soon as we entered the neighborhood, it was instantly like the demographics changed," Luke Freeman, a young white man who was visiting the city from Wisconsin with a friend, told Fox News Digital. The pair said they had heard about "Little Mogadishu" and wanted to check it out, complimenting a meal they had just finished at a local East African restaurant. Most older Somali residents, known as "elders," spoke little English but were welcoming, although women were far more reluctant. Some admitted they wanted to be more westernized to blend in; another boasted that his rap video had millions of views on YouTube. A "Coming soon" sign with Arabic writing is posted on a former outdoor retailer along Cedar Avenue in Minneapolis' Cedar–Riverside.

A storefront on Cedar Avenue displays signs for Omar Fateh's mayoral campaign in Minneapolis. ‘Minnesota nice,' as we call it," said Abdi Fatah Hassan, who came to the U.S. in 2004 at age 13. "Thank God I'm in a great community. It's close-knit, kind of feels like back home. Most of us are hardworking, honest Americans — patriots, you could say." "Somalis in Minnesota are hard-working folks — many of them work two jobs, and yet about 75% are still poor," he said. "There are entrepreneurs, successful restaurants, people in trucking, IT, and even corporate America, making significant changes. But those positive stories don't get much attention." About 36% of Somali Minnesotans lived below the poverty line from 2019 to 2023 — more than triple the U.S. poverty rate of 11.1% — according to Minnesota Compass, a statewide data project. Somali-headed households reported a median income of around $43,600 during that period, far below the national median of $78,538. Hussein added that Somali Minnesotans are a "very young community, still maturing politically and socially," but already shaping neighborhoods through small businesses and civic engagement.

The Dar Al-Hijrah Mosque in Minneapolis' Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, a longstanding religious and cultural hub for the city's Somali community. Hussein's point was borne out at Karmel Mall, about three miles southwest of Cedar–Riverside, a multi-story complex buzzing with activity. The mall houses more than 200 Somali- or East African–owned businesses with modest-looking stores. Its floors are mazes of narrow corridors packed with African clothing stalls, salons, barbers, jewelry stores and halal eateries. When Fox News Digital visited the mall on a recent Saturday evening, shoppers were eager to discuss life as Somali Americans. "Somali people are giving, loving, strong in their roots and they adapt to other cultures," Hussain said with a bright smile. "We came from Somalia to America directly post-war. We were one of the first people to come out and build a halal community and money-transfer businesses," he said of his family. But America's a melting pot — we're trying to get our own foot into our roots while embracing the country that accepted us." A small framed sign above one of his mirrors read, "In God We Trust." He beamed with excitement when asked about it. From left: hair stylist Ferdowsa Omar, hair stylist Najma Mohammad and barber Mahmoud Hussain work in the Karmel Mall in Minneapolis. She came to the United States from Somalia at age 19 on a scholarship, pointing out that not everyone arriving from Somalia is a refugee and that Somali women are thriving in fields once closed to them. "First of all, we're black in tech. So you see, there's a lot of categories of minority that we fall under… You've got to have the skills which means you got put in the effort." Laughs and giggles spilled outside the half-closed shutter door, but nonetheless they too wanted to share their lived experiences growing up in Minneapolis. Somali American barber Mahmoud Hussain trims a young customer's hair at a barbershop inside the Karmel Mall in Minneapolis. "Most people think just because some people are bad and Somali, that every Somali is bad — which is just a stereotype. Most of us are here to make a difference in the world and to make our parents proud." "In the beginning, it was kind of hard not knowing the language, but as I grew older, I found myself because I grew up with my people," Omar said. "Some people didn't know what hijab was, and when we were young, they used to look at us like they were confused, but they were always respectful about it." As the stores began closing, the first floor remained full of chatter as men sat around tables sipping coffee. Back in Cedar–Riverside, behind the concrete towers, two soccer games unfolded on an all-weather field under the floodlights played by Somali men in their 20s and 30s. For most Somali Minnesotans, this is ordinary life — work, prayer and play. "Minnesota has had thirty years with the Somali community — and ninety-five percent of it has been positive," CAIR's Hussein said. Our children were born here — they are Minnesotans now."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It's not a good airport at all,” President Donald Trump said of Dulles International Airport outside Washington DC, at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. Operational for 60 years, Dulles regularly makes it on worst airport lists, largely due to one of its most unusual features: the people movers, more formally known as “mobile lounges,” used to ferry passengers between gates and planes. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later called out the airport for its “jet fuel smell.” He's announced that his department is inviting proposals and public-private partnership plans to construct new terminals and concourses there. It may have few modern fans, but the story of Dulles' design and evolution is an interesting one, explains Bob van der Linden, commercial aviation curator for the National Air and Space Museum. Dulles was built because during World War II, it became clear that Washington National Airport wasn't able to accommodate the area's growth in air traffic. The Washington Airport Act of 1950 paved the way for work to begin, once a location had been chosen. “They were thinking about an area in Burke, Virginia, or taking over an Air Force base — that didn't work,” van der Linden said. “They settled on Chantilly, Virginia, which was quiet, open farmland.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower selected the vast 10,000-acre site in 1958. Then the name was chosen — in honor of John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State in Eisenhower's administration. Massive runways were built in anticipation of faster, bigger aircraft as the supersonic age beckoned. First, Fairfax County, Virginia, right on the airport's doorstep, experienced significant commercial and residential growth over the years and Dulles proved to be a convenient transport option for its expanding population. Second, airline deregulation in 1978 allowed airlines to set up “hub and spoke” route networks, connecting large air hubs like Dulles to smaller cities and drastically increasing air traffic. Finally, airport expansion in 1999 saw the opening of a new midfield concourse terminal that increased capacity. He referred to it as “the best thing I have done.” Sarrinen was praised by Trump earlier this week as “one of the greatest architects in the world,” calling his efforts at Dulles “a great building at a bad airport,” while teasing an “amazing plan” for the airport's reimagining. For many, Dulles' main flaw, said van der Linden, is what made it original in the first place: it's reliance on the people-moving mobile lounges. Created by a partnership of Chrysler and train makers Budd Company, they could accommodate about 100 people. Today they're still in operation for international arrivals and Air Force flights. “Those mobile lounges just weren't quite that useful anymore, and we needed ways to deal with it with increased traffic.” Over the last 40 years, there's been a major push by aviation officials to modernize Dulles, van der Linden said. But until now, little progress has been made. That could soon change if Trump delivers on this week's promise to “make it into as good as there is in the country.” Dulles sudden elevation on Trump's to-do list comes after last month's incident when a mobile lounge crashed into a concourse, injuring 18 people. Other incidents have happened in the past, including one involving a Southwest Airlines ramp agent who was killed in 2012, according to The Washington Post. In early October, Trump made an unplanned stop to Dulles, which the White House said was for the president to assess “potential future projects.” The DOT submitted a request this week for information in approaching the design, financing and construction of a new terminal. United Airlines, which uses Dulles as one of its hubs, released a statement in the wake of this week's comments from the administration. Adding new facilities shouldn't be technically challenging, according to van der Linden.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Annette Groos holds a sign before the start of a rally featuring former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at the Statehouse in Indianapolis, Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025 for Indiana Democrats amid pressure from President Donald Trump on Republicans who control the state's legislature to redistrict congressional seats. Indiana Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, poses at his company's office, Friday, Dec. 5, 2025, in Huntington, Ind. A general exterior view of the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis, April 23, 2025. Spencer Deery's son was getting ready for school when someone tried to provoke police into swarming his home by reporting a fake emergency. Jean Leising faced a pipe bomb scare that was emailed to local law enforcement. It's a bewildering and frightening experience for lawmakers who consider themselves loyal party members and never imagined they would be doing their jobs under the same shadow of violence that has darkened American political life in recent years. Leising described it as “a very dangerous and intimidating process.” Now Trump's campaign faces its greatest test yet in a stubborn pocket of Midwestern conservatism. Mike Braun and the House of Representatives are on board, the proposal may fall short with senators who value their civic traditions and independence over what they fear would be short-term partisan gain. “When you have the president of the United States and your governor sending signals, you want to listen to them,” said Rogers, who has not declared her position on the redistricting push. “But it doesn't mean you'll compromise your values.” On Friday, Trump posted a list of senators who “need encouragement to make the right decision,” and the conservative campaign organization Turning Point Action said it would spend heavily to unseat anyone who voted “no.” The police in his hometown of West Lafayette knew the senator was a potential target for “swatting,” a dangerous type of hoax when someone reports a fake emergency to provoke an aggressive response from law enforcement. So when Deery was targeted last month while his son and others were waiting for their daily bus ride to school, officers did not rush to the scene. Deery was one of the first senators to publicly oppose the mid-decade redistricting, arguing it interferes with voters' right to hold lawmakers accountable through elections. “The country would be an uglier place for it,” he said just days after Vice President JD Vance visited the state in August, the first of two trips to talk with lawmakers about approving new maps. Republican leaders in the Indiana Senate said in mid-November that they would not hold a vote on the matter because there was not enough support for it. Trump lashed out on social media, calling the senators weak and pathetic. “Any Republican that votes against this important redistricting, potentially having an impact on America itself, should be PRIMARIED,” he wrote. She opposes redistricting, saying “it has the taint of cheating.” Not even the plan's supporters are immune to threats. Republican Sen. Andy Zay said his vehicle-leasing business was targeted with a pipe bomb scare on the same day he learned that he would face a primary challenger who accuses Zay of being insufficiently conservative. Zay, who has spent a decade in the Senate, believes the threat was related to his criticism of Trump's effort to pressure lawmakers. But the White House has not heeded his suggestions to build public support for redistricting through a media campaign. “For those who have made a decision to stand up for history and tradition, the tactics of persuasion do not embolden them to change their viewpoint.” Trump easily won Indiana in all his presidential campaigns, and its leaders are unquestionably conservative. But Indiana's political culture never became saturated with the sensibilities of Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement. Some 21% of Republican voters backed Nikki Haley over Trump in last year's presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had already suspended her campaign two months earlier. Trump also holds a grudge against Indiana's Mike Pence, who served the state as a congressman and governor before becoming Trump's first vice president. A devout evangelical, Pence loyally accommodated Trump's indiscretions and scandals but refused to go along with Trump's attempt on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's victory. “Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what was necessary,” Trump posted online after an angry crowd of his supporters breached the U.S. Capitol. Pence has not taken a public stance on his home state's redistricting effort. But the governor before him, Republican Mitch Daniels, recently said it was “clearly wrong.” “We need to do things in a civil manner and have polite discourse,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A second burial area for infants has been found at the site of a former so-called Mother and Baby home in western Ireland in what forensic experts said Friday marks a “significant” discovery in the ongoing excavation of the institution's grounds. Their bodies are believed to have been disposed into a mass grave. The discovery was made by local historian Catherine Corless in 2014, who found that 796 babies had died at the County Galway institution without burial records and that they had been placed in a decommissioned sewage tank. This summer, an excavation overseen by the independent body Office of the Director of Authorised Intervention in Tuam (ODAIT), began. In its latest update, ODAIT said that forensic experts found “consistent evidence” of the second burial ground. “There were no surface or ground level indications of the possibility of a burial ground at this location prior to excavation,” it said. Director Daniel MacSweeney told national broadcaster RTE Friday that the second burial area is about 50 to 100 meters away from the septic tank. Their remains have since been coffined and sent for forensic analysis. The Tuam institution was one of dozens of “homes” where pregnant girls and unmarried women in Ireland were sent to give birth in secret for much of the 20th century. Women were often forcibly separated from their children. Some infants were rehomed, in Ireland, the United Kingdom or as far away as the United States, Canada and Australia, but hundreds died and their remains discarded – their mothers often never knowing what truly happened to their babies. In 2015, the Irish government set up an investigation into 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes, which found “significant quantities” of human remains on the Tuam site. The inquiry found an “appalling level of infant mortality” in the institutions and said that no alarm was raised by the state over them, even though it was “known to local and national authorities” and “recorded in official publications.” Prior to 1960, mother and baby homes “did not save the lives of ‘illegitimate' children; in fact, they appear to have significantly reduced their prospects of survival,” it said. The forensic works at Tuam are expected to last for two years. EDITOR'S NOTE:  If you have information to share in relation to this story, ODAIT can be contacted here.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. The essential fact of life here is that more people want to live in New York than there are homes that we allow to exist. New Yorkers talk about the competition for apartments — or for slots in decent schools or tables at decent restaurants or virtually anything save tickets to your friend's improv show — as if it is a Hobbesian war of all against all. In arguments about immigration (“they're taking our jobs”), housing (“we're full”), college admissions, culture war skirmishes over who gets “replaced” and who gets “canceled,” the underlying picture is the same: If some group advances, someone else has to lose. Social scientists have a name for this: zero-sum thinking, which is the belief that when one individual or group gains, it's usually coming at the expense of others. But there's a more hopeful way to read this research: Zero-sum thinking is not a fixed feature of human nature. And right now, our stories are more zero-sum than they should be. For most of human history, it was basically correct, as the chart below demonstrates. Anthropologist George Foster argued that many peasant communities were organized around an “image of limited good”: land, wealth, status, even good luck were assumed to exist in fixed amounts, so any gain for one person was understood as a loss for someone else. The last two centuries of industrialization and technological innovation broke that logic; for the first time in history, large societies could become much richer over time, and most people's material standard of living could rise together. They found big variation: Some societies strongly endorse the idea that social life is win-lose, others much less so. High zero-sum scores tend to show up in places like Angola or Mexico with histories of conflict, instability, and low growth — the kinds of conditions where the world really does feel like a fixed pie. A recent paper by economists Sahil Chinoy and his colleagues tries to measure zero-sum thinking in the US today and link it to politics. They surveyed more than 20,000 Americans, asking how strongly they agreed with statements like “In the economy, when some people become rich, it must be at the expense of others.” A few key patterns jump out from their data. Zero-sum beliefs tend to stay consistent across different subjects: people who see race relations as zero-sum also tend to see economic competition and immigration that way, suggesting this is more of a general worldview than a narrow, considered opinion on any one issue. Respondents who score higher on zero-sum thinking are more supportive of redistribution and affirmative action and more skeptical of immigration, even after you account for where they fall on the usual left-right ideological spectrum. When the authors look across countries, they find that people who experienced faster economic growth between ages 18 and 25 are significantly less zero-sum decades later — a hint that maturing in an era of abundance, or the lack of it, leaves a lasting mark on how we think politics and the economy work. Psychologist Shai Davidai recently ran 10 studies with more than 3,600 participants and found that when people perceive economic inequality as high — when the gap between rich and poor feels large, like, I don't know, in New York City — they become more likely to see success as zero-sum. All this gets multiplied by living through a “vibecession”: years of headlines about economic crises layered on top of real problems in housing, childcare, and status competition for what feels like a fixed or shrinking number of elite slots. It's not hard to see how you get a generation that experiences the economy less as “how do we grow the pie?” and more as “which group stole my slice?” Zero-sum thinking seems like it should go hand-in-hand with egalitarian politics. If you believe the rich got rich by taking from everyone else, you're probably more open to taxes and redistribution. At the same time, however, many of the same respondents are more skeptical of immigration and other policies that economists see as pro-growth, like free trade. If you're convinced the pie is fixed, you'll resist immigration, block new housing, and treat technological progress as a threat rather than a source of abundance — even when those are exactly the changes that would create more opportunity for everyone. In a genuinely stagnant, low-growth world, this might be rational. Seeing that future through a zero-sum lens is like inheriting a pizza place and using it only to argue over the last slice of yesterday's pie. Putting aside the fact that our idea of what we should be able to “afford” has inflated along with prices and wages over the years, there's no doubt that the anger is very real, and that whichever party can best seize on the issue stands to win next November. Of course people start to think in zero-sum terms if the things they need most are rationed rather than expanded. That's why growth matters so much more than a quarterly GDP number. When societies actually deliver sustained, broad-based gains in living standards, people learn, from experience, that it is possible for many groups to move forward at once. Growth doesn't magically erase inequality or status competition, but it gives politics room to breathe. A country that builds more housing, that uses technology to make essentials cheaper instead of just shinier, that treats immigration and innovation as ways to enlarge the pie rather than carve it up differently, is a country where zero-sum thinking slowly loses its grip. New York will probably always feel a little like the zero-sum capital of the world; that's why if you make it here, you can make it anywhere. But if we can recognize how much of that scarcity is manmade, the easier it becomes to imagine a politics organized around adding slices to the pie, not just fighting over the last piece.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington. A worker shovels snow and ice in front of the Supreme Court building during the first snowfall of the winter season on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Chief Justice John Roberts has led the Supreme Court ‘s conservative majority on a steady march of increasing the power of the presidency, starting well before Donald Trump's time in the White House. The justices could take the next step in a case being argued Monday that calls for a unanimous 90-year-old decision limiting executive authority to be overturned. The court's conservatives, liberal Justice Elena Kagan noted in September, seem to be “raring to take that action.” They already have allowed Trump, in the opening months of the Republican's second term, to fire almost everyone he has wanted, despite the court's 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor that prohibits the president from removing the heads of independent agencies without cause. The only officials who have so far survived efforts to remove them are Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, and Shira Perlmutter, a copyright official with the Library of Congress. The court already has suggested that it will view the Fed differently from other independent agencies, and Trump has said he wants her out because of allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook says she did nothing wrong. Humphrey's Executor has long been a target of the conservative legal movement that has embraced an expansive view of presidential power known as the unitary executive. The decision ushered in an era of powerful independent federal agencies charged with regulating labor relations, employment discrimination, the air waves and much else. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a 1988 dissent that has taken on mythical status among conservatives, “this does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power.” Since 2010 and under Roberts' leadership, the Supreme Court has steadily whittled away at laws restricting the president's ability to fire people. But according to legal historians and even a prominent proponent of the originalism approach to interpreting the Constitution that is favored by conservatives, Roberts may be wrong about the history underpinning the unitary executive. “Both the text and the history of Article II are far more equivocal than the current Court has been suggesting,” wrote Caleb Nelson, a University of Virginia law professor who once served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas. Jane Manners, a Fordham University law professor, said she and other historians filed briefs with the court to provide history and context about the removal power in the country's early years that also could lead the court to revise its views. “I'm not holding my breath,” she said. The Justice Department argues Trump can fire board members for any reason as he works to carry out his agenda and that the precedent should be tossed aside. “Humphrey's Executor was always egregiously wrong,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote earlier this year that fired employees who win in court can likely get back pay, but not reinstatement. That might affect Cook's ability to remain in her job. The court will hear separate arguments in January about whether Cook can remain in her job as her court case challenging her firing proceeds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The “Wicked” musical and its offshoot movies are meant to celebrate diversity and preach radical acceptance in the face of rising fascism. Pictures of the “Wicked” leads, in strapless or backless red-carpet outfits that showcase their thinness, are shared as motivation for people to starve themselves or restrict eating. Professional medical help and medication are often a vital part of the eating disorder recovery process. If you or a loved one are coping with an eating disorder, contact the National Alliance for Eating Disorders helpline for support at 866-662-1235. “I need to know her BMI so bad,” wrote one Tumblr user, of Ariana Grande, who plays the good witch, Glinda. “She's so goals,” wrote another user, along with a photo of Grande's exposed scapulas and upper chest from the “Wicked: For Good” premiere. Oona Hanson, a parent coach specializing in eating disorders, has had parents reach out over concern about the images, even if they or their kids are excited about the movie. “Regardless of what the actual medical or health status is of these actresses, which we don't know, the ultra-thin images, I think, are very painful and can be triggering to someone who has, let's say, seen their child become emaciated from an eating disorder,” she said. “Or they know their child was looking at images that look a lot like these press tour photos.” Yet images of famous bodies are still globally marketed commodities, alongside all the shared social media photos of everyone else, and people have never stopped absorbing and responding to what they see. The actors themselves have not explicitly addressed the perceived change, although Grande pointedly reshared an interview from 2024 where she criticized constant speculation around her body, calling it “dangerous for all parties.” As a movie marketed toward young people, around a holiday season centered on food, “Wicked: For Good” has found itself at the center of a national conversation about weight loss, eating disorders (or ED), and the endless pursuit of thinness. “We can't just keep saying it's not your body, you can't comment on it, when not commenting on it is leading to a rise in ED culture, a rise in restrictive eating, a rise in literally just everyone wanting to be smaller,” musician Teniola Keck, who previously struggled with disordered eating, said on TikTok. Hollywood has always had a love affair with thinness, but by the 2010s, society seemed to be changing. People embraced the ideas of “body positivity” and “body neutrality” — entertainers come in all shapes in sizes, ad campaigns and media prioritize diverse body types, and resisting the urge to comment on a person's weight has become commonplace. None of that seemed to stop the pendulum from swinging. Coinciding with the rise of GLP-1 medications, skinny is now in. The weight-loss hashtag #SkinnyTok has gone viral; celebrities are mysteriously shrinking before our eyes. Serena Williams, whose athletic build made her both a target of disparagement and an exemplar of physical excellence during her career, has begun promoting GLP-1s for weight loss in retirement, calling it “health care.” After losing weight, singer Meghan Trainor — who became famous in 2014 for “bringing booty back” — released a song called “Still Don't Care” earlier this month, seemingly addressing the contention: “That's the same sh*t I've heard my whole life / Said I was too thick, then I got way too thin.” That her lyrics mirror Britney Spears' “Piece of Me” from 2007 only underscores the cyclical nature of our culture's weight obsession. Days after Trainor released her new song, Lizzo wrote about how her own body was changing, after she found exercise and Pilates in the midst of severe depression. In a public newsletter, she grappled with the timing of it all, going through her own weight loss for her own reasons when “extended sizes are being magically erased from websites. Plus sized models are no longer getting booked for modeling gigs. But what happens when that change is potentially harmful to others? Talking about people's bodies can be a trigger for those struggling with eating disorders, said Brianna Campos, a body image coach and therapist; the rampant media attention and before and after photos of the cast only add to that. Diet culture masquerading as health and wellness profits from people obsessing over their weight. “Unless we fit the super unrealistic standard of what society says for us, you can't win. For Alexa Cohen, a mental health counselor for patients struggling with eating disorders, the stars' bodies were all she could think about while watching “Wicked: For Good.” As a person in recovery herself, she noticed the way the movie seemingly emphasized Grande's figure. For her patients, even those that have only seen the discourse online, seeing these “really thin and malnourished characters” be idolized can trigger their own illnesses — especially given that the actors looked different before. At his hospital in San Francisco, hospitalizations and referrals for eating disorders doubled. Even if not diagnosed with an eating disorder, about two-thirds of teenagers nationally are trying to change their weight or change their appearance somehow, Nagata said. “Media portrayals matter, and are actually one of the biggest influences that we know, in the eating disorders field, to anyone's body image,” Nagata said. “But I think that teenagers and young adults are particularly susceptible.” As so many celebrities embrace GLP-1s for weight loss — either quietly or publicly — or just suddenly appear smaller, our culture's desire to be skinny is exposed again, even as our rhetoric had seemingly shifted. As with “Wicked,” that larger trend has also dragged discussion of bodies back into the forefront. The entertainment industry has always put pressure on performers to look a certain way. Those in the public eye are not immune to society's subliminal, and now not-so-subliminal, messaging about bodies. “It's really hard to tease apart what you actually want for your own body versus what the culture is telling you you have to achieve, in order to have access to all these things that we promise people if they look a certain way.”</p>

Hollywood legendary actor Lorenzo Lamas endorses Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco for California governor after he says Gov. Gavin Newsom has had a "devastating" impact on the state. EXCLUSIVE: Hollywood icon Lorenzo Lamas is endorsing a pro-law enforcement Republican for California governor after he says that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has had a "devastating" impact on the state. Lamas, who is best known for his action roles in the 80's and 90's, told Fox News Digital he is endorsing Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco for governor, saying, "The impact on the state of California with the current [Newsom] administration is nothing short of devastating." Lamas said that "over the years I've been very careful about voicing an opinion politically," noting that "sometimes it can affect who you work for, depending on a company's or studio's political point of view." "But I think we're at a point now, not just in California, but I think nationwide, that we have to start at least voicing what we feel is wrong with what's happening," he explained. Riverside Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco (left) received an endorsement from Hollywood star Lorenzo Lamas (right) for California governor. (Gilbert Flores via Getty; Chad Bianco campaign) Lamas said he was motivated to finally speak out after long watching his home state be mismanaged despite its enormous economy and abundant natural resources. "We have to figure out what we're going to do with the people that are disenfranchised and living on the streets, the programs that supposedly are budgeted for these folks, where is that money? Regarding the several devastating natural disasters the state has experienced in recent years, Lamas said, "I grew up in Pacific Palisades, that fire devastated my hometown. The home I grew up in burned down. Many of them were second, third generation people. It takes years to get rebuilding plans approved. There's just so much red tape, so much bureaucracy, and Chad wants to just eliminate it." Meanwhile, Lamas said that he believes Bianco, who has framed his candidacy around cost of living and public safety issues, "is the man that can really turn this thing around." "We've got to have a governor that's pro-law enforcement, that's going to keep our moms and our daughters safe on the streets," he said, explaining, "I have two daughters that live in Los Angeles, and there I tell them, every single day [that] their heads got to be on a swivel. You see all the crime that's rampant, not just in California, but all around the country. Bianco is facing a steep uphill battle to win as a Republican in deep blue California. On the Democratic side of the aisle, California Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Rep. Katie Porter, both progressives and vocal critics of President Donald Trump, are running to replace Newsom, who is term-limited. Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on May 15, 2024 in Washington, DC. On whether he believes California is ready to send a Republican to the governor's mansion, Lamas answered, "What I see in Chad is a tremendous gift of being able to present his agenda with a commonsense foundation, and that's going to appeal to anybody with half of a brain." And I think it's time that California votes for commonsense, and the only person that I really feel can bring that to our state is Chad Bianco." A spokesperson for Newsom brushed off Lamas' criticism, sending Fox News Digital a one-word response, simply asking, "Who?" Bianco has also been endorsed by UFC legends Royce Gracie and Dan Henderson. Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has been conspicuously absent from Washington since her shock announcement that she would step down from Congress, missing a full week's worth of votes as she prepares for an early retirement. Greene, who announced her resignation last month amid a messy political divorce from President Donald Trump, has missed all nine roll-call votes taken since lawmakers returned from a Thanksgiving recess on Monday. However, with just eight legislative days remaining before lawmakers leave again for Christmas, her absence has frustrated Republicans who already felt she was abandoning the party. Greene is resigning on Jan. 5, a full year before the end of the current Congress and weeks before Republicans' House majority is shaved down to almost zero due to a handful of special elections next year. He is one of three dozen House members to announce their departure at the end of next year, and Bacon had briefly considered retiring early himself. On social media, she egged on Rep. Elise Stefanik's (R-NY) very public fight with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and will next week be speaking with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), another House rabble-rouser who denied reports that she may follow Greene into early retirement. Greene is one of six members, two Republicans and four Democrats, to miss every House vote this week, according to a tally by longtime correspondent Jamie Dupree. Greene's shrinking footprint on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, follows an escalating set of clashes with Trump, who threatened to run a primary challenge against her next year for bucking him repeatedly on policy. For years, Greene was one of Trump's most loyal foot soldiers in Washington, but says she became disenchanted by his military interventions abroad. “It's all so absurd and completely unserious,” Greene said in announcing her retirement on Nov. 21. “I refuse to be a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better.”</p>

Longtime broadcaster Ed Randall is working with some of the biggest names in sports to raise cancer awareness. A teenage girl who spent her final years advocating for young people battling cancer is forever memorialized in history, thanks to a key bill passed by the House of Representatives. Mikaela Naylon was just 16 when she died five years after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who helped lead the landmark legislation that became her namesake, said Mikaela spent much of that time fighting to give fellow children a chance to survive cancer. He told Fox News Digital that he viewed childhood cancer patients as "the best advocates" for their cause, calling them his "better angels." The House of Representatives memorialized Mikaela Naylon on Monday after she passed away following a five-year battle with osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. "Mikaela was a great example of that," McCaul said. She wasn't feeling very well, and I could tell. The Mikaela Naylon Give Kids A Chance Act is aimed at expanding children's access to existing cancer therapy trials, as well as incentivizing development of treatments and solutions for pediatric cancer. It reauthorizes funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support pediatric disease research through fiscal year 2027, and extends the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) ability to expedite review of drugs aimed at helping certain pediatric illnesses. "It's probably one of the most rewarding things I've done is to not only draw awareness to childhood cancer by forming the [Childhood Cancer Caucus] and then having an annual summit, but to be able to pass legislation that results in saving children's lives. I don't think there's anything more important than that," McCaul said. His bill passed the House unanimously on Monday, with both Republicans and Democrats speaking out in strong support for the legislation. Mikaela's family was in attendance to watch both its passage and the speeches lawmakers gave in favor of it. But it helped fill kind of a void, an emptiness they have right now. And they're very proud of that, that her legacy is carried on through this legislation," McCaul, who also gave the Naylon family a tour of the U.S. Capitol, said. Mikaela's parents Kassandra and Doug, and her brother Ayden, told Fox News Digital that she had "faced every day with hope, purpose and a fierce determination to make the world better for the kids who would come after her." "She believed that all children, no matter how rare their diagnosis, deserve access to the most promising treatments and a real chance at life. This legislation reflects that mission," the Naylon family told Fox News Digital. "Their commitment ensures that Mikaela‘s voice, and the voices of so many brave children like her, will forever be heard in the halls of Congress," the family said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A high school senior was charged with federal arson after allegedly setting fire to a sleeping subway passenger in New York early Monday morning. Hiram Carrero, 18, is accused of arson resulting in injury after authorities said he lit a piece of paper and dropped it near a 56-year-old man aboard a northbound 3 train passing 34th Street–Penn Station, the Department of Justice said Friday. Carrero briefly boarded the train before fleeing and taking a bus to Harlem, according to a criminal complaint. He was arrested Thursday in Harlem, where his attorneys said he lives with his disabled mother and acts as her primary caregiver, according to the Associated Press. US District Judge Valerie E. Caproni ordered Carrero detained, citing the “heinousness of the crime,” after prosecutors appealed another magistrate's decision to release him to home confinement under his mother's supervision, the AP reported. Carrero was not required to enter a plea during his arraignment in Manhattan federal court. She was set on fire and no one knows her name. Carrero's lawyer, Jennifer Brown, acknowledged “the allegations are extremely serious,” but argued he is a “very young man with no (criminal record) and a mother willing to take him in.” “The New York City subway is the heart of our City, with millions of people who live and work here relying on it every day,” US Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement. “New Yorkers have the right to be safe and feel safe when they ride the subway, and our Office is committed to that result.” “This attack is among the most serious acts of violence a person can commit, and it has no place in our city—above or below ground,” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch added. If convicted, Carrero faces a minimum of seven years in prison. The case is being prosecuted federally because it was investigated by a federal task force and does not involve state charges.</p>

As long as we keep the faith … and remember who the hell we are. Former President Joe Biden delivering a speech at the International LGBTQ+ Leaders Conference in Washington, D.C.
