                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market entered another volatile session today as several major developments converged. Besides these events, traders prepared for critical macro data and an options expiry that could inject fresh turbulence. Each sector now sends signals that shape sentiment across the entire ecosystem. Consequently, many investors want clarity about where the strongest opportunities may emerge next as the best altcoins to buy now. The platform builds a Skill-to-Earn model that rewards player performance instead of luck. This idea appeals to competitive gamers who want real fairness. Tapzi introduces classic games such as Chess, Checkers, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Tic Tac Toe. Hence, rewards come from actual gameplay and not inflationary emissions. Furthermore, Tapzi sets its token supply at 5 billion with structured vesting. Free Mode simplifies onboarding and helps casual players join without friction. Additionally, developers gain tools, SDKs, staking modules, and a path to launch new skill-based titles. This helps Tapzi reach both gaming communities and capital-heavy markets. Many GameFi platforms lost momentum due to bots, high inflation, and casino-style mechanics. Tapzi uses a different approach that removes unsustainable systems. Consequently, retention improves as players gain reasons to return. Moreover, prize pools grow as the player base expands. The global gaming market could pass $400 billion by 2028. Significantly, Tapzi focuses on user experience by removing gas fees during gameplay. Many analysts believe the next crypto to explode may emerge from utility-driven gaming. Therefore, Tapzi sits in a strong position as interest continues to rise. Developers also want simpler tools, and Tapzi offers a launchpad specifically for them. Elon Musk's SpaceX moved another batch of Bitcoin worth nearly $100 million. Many traders think the company rotates funds for improved organization and custody. The latest activity occurred as Bitcoin fell near $91,000 ahead of key inflation data. SpaceX still holds more than 5,000 BTC worth over $460 million. These movements follow a consistent pattern over recent months. Consequently, traders continue to speculate about SpaceX's long-term strategy. Some think the firm may prepare for institutional-grade custody. Others believe the company builds a deeper Bitcoin treasury structure. However, no evidence supports selling pressure from these movements. Many traders now watch whale accumulation activity for early signals. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that whales bought over 4.7 million LINK within two days. Additionally, Chainlink continues to secure partnerships across industries that need reliable off-chain data. Many protocols rely on Chainlink for accurate external data. Hence, each accumulation event strengthens confidence among institutional and retail traders. This behavior usually precedes increased volatility and renewed upside interest. Consequently, traders monitor LINK closely as accumulation rises while the broader market shows cautious optimism. Today's market narrative blends gaming innovation, whale accumulation, and major corporate Bitcoin activity. Tapzi stands out due to its sustainable Skill-to-Earn design, developer ecosystem, and strong presale structure. Chainlink gains renewed strength from heavy whale buying and persistent network demand. SpaceX's ongoing Bitcoin rotations continue to draw attention as markets look for clues into institutional strategy. Moreover, the broader environment remains sensitive to macro updates and options expiries. Tapzi, Chainlink, and Bitcoin now form three major focal points as the crypto market enters another critical phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But when it comes to mining cryptocurrencies, things get a little stranger. As Bloomberg reports, local law enforcement is hunting down about 14,000 illegal Bitcoin mining operations in Malaysia, which they say have stolen around $1.1 billion in electricity over the last five years. Police have resorted to using drones and even handheld sensors that can pick up irregular power use to catch them in their act, a bizarre game of cat-and-mouse that highlights how lucrative mining the digital token can be — if the power is on someone else's dime, at least. Bitcoin rallied this year, hitting a record high of over $126,000 in October. Besides causing over a billion dollars in losses for Malaysia's state-owned energy company Tenaga Nasional, illegal mining operations could wreak havoc on the country's grid as well. “The risk of allowing such activities to happen is no longer about stealing,” Malaysia's deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, Akmal Nasir, who chairs a special task force specifically set up to crack down on illegal Bitcoin mining, told Bloomberg. Rolling power outages in Iran last year, for instance, sparked a heated debate over the role of illegal Bitcoin mining. Kuwait similarly cracked down on crypto mining earlier this year amid a “major” power crisis that has led to blackouts. Worldwide, Bitcoin mining operations chew through a gargantuan amount of power, consuming more electricity than an entire country each year. To cash in on the trend, illegal operations are cropping up across Malaysia, turning abandoned malls and industrial spaces into crypto mining sites. But for many, the benefits of running their hardware with stolen power have outweighed the risks of getting caught in Malaysia. “Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Nasir told Bloomberg. “I don't see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.” More on Bitcoin: Crypto Company Creates Bizarre Drug Articles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company said on December 5 that it will drop “Global” from its name and operate as Input Output Group. It plans to expand into quantum computing, digital identity, fintech, and healthcare. He described the new phase as an effort to build a global technology group capable of addressing complex problems across fintech, privacy, artificial intelligence, and healthcare. Hoskinson added that the firm will continue to support Cardano's core development. “As Input Output Group, we are entering a new chapter of expansion, investment, and innovation across the United States, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and emerging markets,” he noted. The shift mirrors a broader trend in the crypto industry as firms diversify into areas that blend distributed systems, data infrastructure, and machine intelligence. That scale, the report said, will shape adjacent fields such as digital identity and quantum computing. Notably, the company has already advanced its privacy technology work through Midnight. The blockchain is designed to support data protection and compliance for institutional users. Meanwhile, the restructuring arrives at a difficult time for Cardano, which has struggled to keep pace with competitors such as Solana and Ethereum. For context, Cardano hosts less than $50 million in stablecoin supply. Considering this, Hoskinson argued that Cardano's slower uptake stems from narrative challenges, not technical limits. It's not a problem of imagination and creativity. Input Output is trying to counter that gap through a new coalition with Cardano's founding organizations. The effort aims to accelerate integrations for tier-one stablecoins and custody providers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Abigail Johnson, who runs Fidelity, says the current financial system is the most complicated web of basically reconciliation processes built on “primitive technology” — and that blockchain will eventually replace it. “It's got to be an evolutionary process and it'll be some combination of competitive forces and regulatory standards that will kind of push it kicking and screaming along,” Johnson said at an A16Z crypto event on December 4. Johnson's critique reveals how even traditional finance leaders see the current system as fundamentally broken. Cue blockchain, a technology that Johnson has been betting on since 2013. But enthusiastic blockchain adoption alone won't push the industry, according to Johnson. If one bank offers instant settlement with a blockchain while competitors take three days using legacy systems, customers will move their business. If one brokerage can custody Bitcoin while another can't, advisors and clients interested in crypto assets will go elsewhere. Fidelity, with Johnson at the helm, experienced those headwinds firsthand. The firm faced “surprisingly immature but very loud” anti-crypto sentiment from traditional finance leaders for years, Johnson said. In the past year, some of Wall Street's biggest banks have begun to experiment with crypto, while digital asset treasuries and exchange-traded funds have deployed billions to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. These mean governments mandate improvements for the characteristics that blockchain enables — be it transparency, settlement speed, or interoperability. Across the world, regulation is already coming into effect. And in Europe, MiCA has been active since late 2024. “But the industry is a democratic place and there's a lot of small players who just don't have the wherewithal to participate in that kind of an upgrade.” And that weakest link is stuck on decades-old technology. Fidelity has been betting on blockchain for over a decade. In 2013, the firm pioneered Bitcoin custody services for its clients, while setting up mining operations. Fidelity recently launched a tokenised money market fund designed to interoperate with stablecoins, allowing clients to earn yield then flip into crypto when needed. And in mid November, the firm saw its new Solana ETF debut. Still, Johnson admitted she underestimated how long the transition would take. “I didn't fully appreciate how slow change really is in our traditional business because there's just so many forces that keep everybody kind of together and tight doing what they've always been doing,” she said.

Instead of treating digital assets as a side industry, the city is weaving them into day-to-day governance in an effort to modernize payments, attract talent, and escape long-standing financial bottlenecks. One of the city's newest initiatives lets residents pay certain local taxes using multiple cryptocurrencies – Dogecoin included. The choice caught global attention not because of the payment rails themselves, but because a meme token has now been given a real administrative role. City officials argue that widespread understanding is essential if digital tools are going to support public services rather than create new risks. While Argentina's capital is working on payments, other countries are exploring different types of blockchain infrastructure. Japan, for instance, is evaluating the XRP Ledger as a potential backbone for a national digital-ID system – an ambitious step that could reshape how citizens verify credentials or access government services. If implemented, analysts say it would be one of the largest zero-knowledge deployments ever attempted by a government. The broader takeaway is simple: governments aren't just watching crypto anymore. Whether through municipal tax systems, nationwide identity frameworks, or partnerships with private firms, blockchain is steadily moving from speculative asset category to practical public-sector technology. An international arrest warrant has been requested for Hayden Davis, co-creator of the LIBRA token, which became the center of a major political scandal in Argentina. Argo Blockchain has successfully paid off a $35 million loan from Galaxy Digital, which it took out in 2022 to avoid bankruptcy during a tough period for cryptocurrencies. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has officially vetoed House Bill 2324, a legislative proposal that aimed to create a state-managed reserve fund for holding seized cryptocurrency assets. Arizona's latest attempt to integrate digital assets into its public finance system faced a mixed outcome this week. In an effort to broaden its investor base, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) will undergo a 3-for-1 stock split on June 16, making shares more affordable for everyday investors. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest doubled down on its crypto exposure this week, snapping up 240,507 shares of BitMine (BMNR) worth roughly $9 million across three of its exchange-traded funds - even as the stock slid nearly 10% on Thursday. Ark Invest has made another significant purchase of Coinbase shares, acquiring a total of 64,358 shares for $11.5 million on Monday, as the stock plummeted by 17.6% during a turbulent market session. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has shaken up its portfolio by snapping up $2.2 million worth of Coinbase shares, signaling a renewed focus on the major crypto exchange. eToro's entrance to the Nasdaq was met with enthusiasm on Wednesday, as shares surged nearly 30% by market close — and Ark Invest wasted no time getting in on the action. ARK Invest has continued to capitalize on the dramatic rise of Circle's stock, unloading a sizable portion of its holdings just weeks after the stablecoin issuer's public debut. Ark Invest sold 12,077 shares of Coinbase—valued at $2.7 million—from its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) on Wednesday. Ark Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has significantly increased its stake in Robinhood by purchasing 45,792 shares, valued at over $800,000, during a recent market downturn. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is doubling down on crypto exposure, ramping up its purchases of Coinbase and Bitcoin-linked ETFs as the firm positions for what it believes will be a near-term easing in market stress. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has expanded its position in Tom Lee's Ether treasury firm BitMine, while trimming one of its long-standing bets on Tesla. ARK Invest has quietly deepened its exposure to Solana by adding a staked SOL investment to two of its tech-focused ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the blockchain's long-term potential. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest spent the past week lightening its stake in Circle Internet Group just as the stable-coin issuer's share price went vertical. On Thursday, Ark Invest, led by Kathy Wood, made some interesting trades, the most significant of which was the sale of Tesla Inc (TSLA) shares.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the tenth installment of the Professor Coin column, in which I bring important insights from published academic literature on cryptocurrencies to the Decrypt readership. In this article, I discuss how crypto's relationship with equities has evolved. Not so long ago, Bitcoin was marketed as the ultimate diversifier—an asset supposedly immune to whatever was happening in equity markets. Early academic work backed that up: Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) showed that major cryptocurrencies had minimal exposure to standard stock, bond and FX risk factors, and that their returns were mainly driven by crypto-specific forces like momentum and investor attention, not equity markets. Fast-forward to the last couple of years, and that story looks very different. A growing literature now finds that crypto and equities are tightly intertwined, especially during stress. For a fintech audience, the key message is simple: you can't treat crypto as “off-grid” risk anymore. It behaves more and more like a high-beta tech sector—with some nasty tail behaviour on top. A recent survey by Adelopo et al (2025) and co-authors reviews the evidence on how cryptocurrencies interact with traditional financial markets. They document clear time-varying and non-linear linkages between crypto and stock markets, with particularly strong connections during major macro and geopolitical events like COVID-19 or the Russia–Ukraine war. Studies looking specifically at technology and blockchain-linked stocks confirm this. Umar et al (2021) finds strong connectedness between cryptocurrency markets and the technology sector while Frankovic (2022) shows that Australian “cryptocurrency-linked stocks” experience significant return spillovers from crypto prices, especially for firms more deeply involved in blockchain activity. In other words, listed equity is now a transmission channel for crypto risk. Several recent papers make the “crypto ↔ equity” link very explicit: Global spillovers: Vuković (2025) uses a Bayesian Global VAR to show that adverse shocks originating in the cryptocurrency market depress stock markets, bond indices, exchange rates and volatility indices across a wide set of countries—not just the U.S. They find that cryptocurrencies have become important senders and receivers of shocks, with stronger ties to equities in recent years and particularly during turbulent periods. They find significant dynamic risk spillovers from crypto to these stock markets, again concentrated in high-volatility episodes. Exchange-level contagion: Sajeev et al (2022) document a contagion effect of Bitcoin on major stock exchanges (NSE India, Shanghai, London and Dow Jones), using volatility spillover and correlation analysis from 2017–2021. An IMF departmental paper on “Spillovers Between Crypto and Equity Markets” finds that Bitcoin shocks can explain a non-trivial share (roughly mid-teens percent) of variation in global equity volatility, and that this influence has strengthened over time as institutional and derivative markets matured. Professor Coin: How Crypto Derivatives Have Impacted Digital Markets Why does Bitcoin now look so much like a high-beta tech stock? Duration and interest-rate sensitivity: Both crypto and growth equities are essentially claims on uncertain future cash flows or network value. When real rates rise, discount factors bite hard—and both sectors sell off together. Investor base and leverage: Retail trading, momentum strategies and derivatives are heavily used in both arenas. Products like futures, options and leveraged ETFs allow shocks in one market to be magnified and replicated in the other. Institutional portfolio construction: As crypto has been added to multi-asset and hedge-fund portfolios, its returns inevitably become entangled with traditional cross-asset positioning. When funds de-risk, everything in the “risky bucket” goes out together. Professor Coin: Do Managed Crypto Funds Outperform the Market? For portfolio construction, the message is uncomfortable but clear: But during stress, when diversification is most valuable, correlations and spillovers spike. Bitcoin and major altcoins behave less like “digital gold” and more like levered proxies for global risk sentiment. That doesn't make crypto useless as an investment—but it does mean that treating a 5–10% crypto allocation as “uncorrelated upside” is no longer defensible based on the data. Going forward, one open question for both academics and practitioners is whether spot ETFs and broader institutional adoption will further tighten these linkages, or whether a new use-case (such as genuine payment or settlement adoption) could create more idiosyncratic drivers again. For now, the evidence points in one direction: when global markets catch a cold, crypto doesn't sit it out anymore—it coughs along with everything else. “On spillover effects between cryptocurrency-linked stocks and cryptocurrencies.” Global Finance Journal, 54, 100719. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfj.2021.100719 IDEAS/RePEc “Connectedness between cryptocurrencies, gold and stock markets: A network approach.” European Journal of Management and Business Economics, 33(4), 466–489. “Connectedness between cryptocurrency and technology sectors: Evidence from implied volatility indices.” Finance Research Letters, 38, 101492.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the past few years, stablecoins have been defined by a narrow reality: essentially a two-horse race between Tether's USDT and Circle's (CRCL) USDC, with most activity concentrated on crypto-native exchanges. What comes next looks materially different, Alchemy co-founder and President Joe Lau told CoinDesk in an interview. The near-term trajectory for stablecoins has lots of directions, Lau said, but one theme dominates: stablecoin adoption is “exploding.” The reason, he argued, is that stablecoins deliver tangible advantages that traditional payments and banking systems struggle to match, most notably 24/7 settlement and digital-native money movement. Banks are increasingly evaluating stablecoins, he said, alongside fintechs building money-movement and payments products. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like fiat currencies or gold. They underpin much of the crypto economy, serving as payment rails and a tool for moving money across borders. Wall Street giant Citi (C) said the stablecoin market is growing faster than expected. Lau also said that regulatory clarity is drawing more traditional players into the sector. As the rules become clearer, he expects broader adoption from traditional finance — banks, neobanks, fintechs focused on moving money, and large payments companies — because stablecoins plug directly into the kinds of use cases those firms already serve. However, Lau sees another major force shaping the future: banks are launching tokenized deposits, which he describes as an “alternative” that complements stablecoins. Today, he said, moving money from a standard bank account can still mean wires, fees and friction. With tokenized deposits, such as JPM Coin, customers can get more stablecoin-like functionality without leaving the bank environment. Lau added that HSBC has also signaled interest in tokenized deposits, and he expects more banks to follow. Stablecoins are more open-ended, he said, because they can settle between any two parties. Tokenized deposits are more closed-loop, he said, because they're typically designed for a bank's own customers. Meanwhile, he said, stablecoin issuers are looking toward becoming more bank-like, driven in part by capital efficiency. However, he also framed tokenized deposits as an early-stage development: only a handful of banks have seriously invested in this so far, he said, and as more do, adoption will grow, and stablecoins and deposit tokens will begin to compete more directly. As the two converge, money becomes both fully compliant and instantly accessible," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's price couldn't maintain above $92,000, and the recent rejection at that level pushed it south hard to just over $88,000 yesterday. Most altcoins have followed suit, with almost all charts deep in the red today. ZEC and CC lead on the way south. However, the bears returned on Monday and initiated a violent leg down that drove BTC to just under $84,000. After losing more than seven grand in hours, bitcoin bounced off almost as quickly and reclaimed the $90,000 line by Tuesday. Most larger-cap alts are in the red as well today. SOL, ADA, LINK, HYPE, DOGE, and XLM are with losses of up to 5%, while SUI, ENA, PEPE, UNI, and DOT have dropped by 6-7%. Even more profound losses come from ZEC and CC, both of which have dumped by double digits. In contrast, BCH and TRX have posted minor gains. The total crypto market cap has shed around $60 billion in a day and is down to $3.130 trillion on CG. Jordan got into crypto in 2016 by trading and investing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colorado made headlines in 2022 when Governor Jared Polis launched the nation's first state cryptocurrency tax payment program, positioning the state as a “crypto-forward” pioneer. Yet two years later, the results paint a stark picture of how little Coloradans actually use digital currencies for legitimate purposes. That represents a microscopic 0.0005% of the state's $11 billion annual income tax collection alone. While Colorado residents actively invest in new and traditional digital assets, they're clearly not using these digital currencies for everyday transactions like paying taxes. Still, much research the best place to buy Polygon (MATIC), a popular blockchain network known for its lowtransaction fees, as well as established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DespitePolygon's utility in decentralised finance applications and its growing ecosystem of blockchainprojects, along with the widespread adoption of other major cryptocurrencies, the gap betweeninvestment interest and practical usage for government payments remains substantial. While people aren't using crypto much for everyday government payments, the state has accidentally shown why good blockchain monitoring is so important. Recent work by companies like Elliptic proves how well new tracking tools can spot and expose bad networks, showing that the crypto compliance industry is getting much better. Finding out that Xinbi Guarantee was registered in Colorado actually shows how well modern blockchain detective work functions. What might have stayed hidden in regular banking was discovered through smart cryptocurrency analysis. This is real progress in the industry's ability to stay transparent and accountable, which are important things that real investors think about when they look for a place to buy cryptocurrency. Colorado's situation shows how regulators are getting better at telling the difference between legitimate cryptocurrency use and criminals. The state's PayPal system for crypto tax payments handled only 48 payments totalling $17,544 in 2024, but it shows a smart approach to digital money integration. As they are immediately turning crypto into dollars, Colorado demonstrates how governments can try new things while keeping their normal ways of working. This balanced approach makes Colorado a state that's interested in crypto but also focused on security, helping make the whole digital asset space more legitimate. Jacob Sims, a Harvard researcher focusing on transnational crime, mentioned that setting up a business in the United States offers credibility to both lawful and unlawful operations alike. According to him, this facade of legitimacy is very important. Xinbi and Huione Guarantee processed over $24 billion in transactions, with both platforms operating publicly on Telegram, demonstrating crypto's global reach. Telegram removed accounts linked to these platforms, and Huione was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury, yet both quickly adjusted, reflecting the rapidly evolving nature of digital currency. Colorado has seen a modest increase in crypto adoption, prompting lawmakers to consider its potential benefits.
