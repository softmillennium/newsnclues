This includes a loaded England squad, who headline the group looking to capture its first World Cup since 1966. They beat England in the 2018 World Cup semifinals, and the rematch is one to watch in Group L. They are joined by Panama and Ghana, completing a group that promises intrigue and tough competition for all four sides. BUY NOW: Get tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup on StubHub Thomas Tuchel will lead England in a major tournament for the first time. The former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach took the reins after Gareth Southgate bowed out with a final defeat to Spain at Euro 2024. Southgate was England's most successful manager since Alf Ramsey masterminded their solitary World Cup success in 1966: under him, England reached consecutive European Championship finals and were beaten in the semifinals and quarterfinals of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The hope from the Football Association is that Tuchel's elite club-level experience will help to get an extra few per cent out of a gifted squad spearheaded by captain and record goal-scorer Harry Kane. Jude Bellingham is one of several enviable attacking options, although England look a touch light in defence. Their legendary captain, now 40 years old, is surely at his last major international competition, hoping to reach 200 career caps in the process. While Croatia lack star power behind Modric's titanic presence, they continue to prove greater than the sum of their parts. In place since 2017, the 59-year-old has led his home country to two World Cup semifinals and one final, a UEFA Nations League final, and a Round of 16 at the Euros. While they still have not won a major title in their country's short history, their group-stage exit at Euro 2024 remains the only blemish on Dalic's otherwise glittering resume. Croatia also benefit from a number of exceptional youth systems at the country's most prominent clubs, as the likes of Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split continue to pump out talented Croatian players who depart for major European clubs before returning to help the national team secure big results. Modric, Josko Gvardiol, and Ivan Perisic are amongst many others who all spent the majority of their youth careers at one of those two clubs. Croatia has some history with its fellow group member, England. In just their second World Cup ever, Panama qualified thanks to the open spots left by the automatic qualification of CONCACAF powers USA, Canada, and Mexico. They were looking set for a place in the intercontinental playoff until Cinderella story Suriname choked on the final day of qualification. Ghana made the most of a relatively favourable draw by plotting an assured path through a CAF qualification section that has seen the likes of Nigeria and Cameroon fall by the wayside. The Black Stars are into their fifth World Cup out of the past six since making their debut in Germany in 2006. Ghana's most famous World Cup run ended in controversy and recriminations after Uruguay's Luis Suarez was sent off for a handball on the line in the quarterfinal at South Africa 2010. Head coach Otto Addo will look to dazzling Premier League wingers Antoine Semenyo and Mohammed Kudus to hopefully spark a memorable summer. The Group L winner will face a best third-place side from either Group E, H, I, J or K in the Round of 32.

To see the easiest and hardest possible draws for your team, try our interactive draw simulator. It lets you explore all your team's possibilities, ranked by difficulty. It's not quite that simple; there are additional rules to make sure no group has more than one team from the same continent (or two, in Europe's case), and to make sure the highest-ranked teams end up on opposite sides of the knockout round bracket if they win their respective groups. If, during the draw, you expect a team to go into one group and it goes into another, one of these rules may be the reason. Finally, there will still be six open spots remaining even after the draw is complete. These will eventually be filled by teams who win a play-in tournament in March — four from Europe and two from the rest of the world. European playoff path A: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Wales or Northern Ireland European playoff path D: Denmark, Ireland, the Czech Republic or North Macedonia Teams don't always field their best lineups depending on injuries, the match calendar or a host of other factors. And, of course, we don't even know which players will be named to the rosters for next year's tournament. But some groups really can be much stronger or weaker than others. Groups labeled as “very weak” are in the bottom 5 percent of strength among all possible draws; groups labeled as “weak” are in the bottom 25 percent. Groups labeled “strong” are in the top 25 percent of strength among all possible draws; groups labeled “very strong” are in the top 5 percent. FIFA has said it will release specific game schedule information on Saturday, about 24 hours after the draw is complete. Pick a team below to see the most current information about when and where they will play: The United States is in Group D with Australia, Paraguay and European playoff path C (one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Turkey or Romania).

Carney says he'll see Trump in Washington during FIFA World Cup draw 'We made the impossible possible,' says Curaçao player heading to World Cup #TheMoment Haiti qualified for first World Cup in over 50 years Canada's opener in Toronto on June 12 will be against the winner of UEFA playoff A, which could be Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland or Italy. If you're looking for more coverage around the politics of today's event, you can find a story on the private meeting between Carney, Sheinbaum and Trump here. If you're looking for our colleague Chris Jones's insight on the jitters of the day, you can read his analysis here. As the day comes to a close, Carney's office has issued a relatively vague statement saying the prime minister “had many occasions for constructive discussions” with both Trump and Sheinbaum. “In their principal discussion, the three leaders met for approximately 45 minutes and they've agreed to keep working together on CUSMA. Canada's third opponent in the round robin, as we've mentioned, will be another European team: either Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland or Italy, depending on who wins a two-round playoff. Canada won't find out until the playoff is decided in March. Too bad, I've got to be a little bit patient,” Marsch said. Meanwhile, soccer players and coaches moved into what's called the mixed zone, a space where media can interview athletes and administrators. Jesse Marsch, Canada's coach, told reporters he's generally pleased with today's draw but knows the team will have to rise to the challenge next summer. The fact we didn't get Norway, that made me happy. The second pot, all those opponents would be a big challenge.” Carney is now headed to the Canadian Embassy for a Christmas tree lighting ceremony, where he will make some brief remarks. U.S. President Donald Trump has resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term, announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the U.S. and those from seven others would face restrictions. The new ban includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The ban includes exemptions for World Cup athletes, coaches, "persons performing a necessary support role" and their immediate relatives, but it still applies to fans from those countries. #TheMoment Haiti qualified for first World Cup in over 50 years Just last month, the tiny island nation of Curaçao, with a population of about 156,000, became the smallest country ever to qualify for this marquee event. The former Dutch colony takes that record from Iceland, which had a population of just over 350,000 when it qualified in 2018. It has actively recruited from its diaspora after getting permission from FIFA within world soccer's rules to change the national-team eligibility of five players since August. Cape Verde, with a population of roughly 525,000, also qualified for the first time this year — the second-least populous country to do so. The former Portuguese colony also turned to its diaspora for recruitment. Haiti is another notable underdog, qualifying for the first time since 1974 despite significant domestic turmoil and the lack of a usable home stadium. Coach Sébastien Migné has managed some of his players from abroad, as Haiti's main airport has regularly been shut down in a country where armed gangs control up to 90 per cent of its capital, Port-au-Prince. Other first-time entrants include Jordan and Uzbekistan, while New Caledonia and Suriname are still in the hunt for a qualifying spot. This year there isn't a clear group of death — though many reports are declaring Group L the most likely candidate. Ghana (72) and Panama (30) are unlikely to challenge the powerhouses. Group F also looks fairly competitive, with the Netherlands (7), Japan (18), Tunisia (40) and the winner of UEFA playoff B — either Ukraine, Poland, Albania or Sweden. Still, there's lots of drama ahead, with some intense matches coming up. Croatia vs. England, a rematch of the 2018 semifinal, will be one to watch. And if Italy qualifies, Canada will have to prepare for a hard battle on home turf. Despite breaking off talks with Canada at the end of October, Trump sounded in good spirits earlier today when talking about his North American trade partners. FIFA estimated nearly 1.42 billion people watched the 2022 final in Qatar between France and Argentina on either television or digital platforms, the highest viewership ever for a World Cup final. Only the Olympics come close to that kind of global viewership. Research conducted for the International Olympic Committee suggests around five billion people watched the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris at some point. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.</p>

"It was an award for me, I can tell you. And they say over a billion people were watching and there was no way you could beat tonight what you did today because that was one of the greatest openings to an event that I've ever seen. The private concert at the White House was attended by Republican lawmakers and members of Trump's Cabinet. The evening followed a day filled with high-profile stars, sports legends, and world leaders in D.C. for the World Cup draw. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney joined Trump on stage to draw their respective nations' names as the three countries prepare to host the international tournament next year.

The event took place in Washington, District of Columbia, on Dec. 5, 2025. FIFA president Gianni Infantino also presented Trump with the first-ever FIFA Peace Prize, which recognized the president for his actions to "promote peace and unity around the world." "This is truly one of the great honors of my life," Trump said, adding that "most important, I just want to thank everybody. The world is a safer place now."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gabriel Jesus has taken another significant stride toward ending his lengthy spell on the sidelines, with the striker set to feature in a friendly against Manchester United with the Arsenal Under-21s on Saturday as part of his carefully managed rehabilitation programme. It marks the latest stage of a gradual return from a devastating anterior cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since January. Speaking in May, Arteta recalled the moment with a mixture of frustration and helplessness. He said: "It's very difficult now to understand that, if I could pause the game and say, Gabriel Jesus, we brought you back to life. You're going to now get injured, so stop. I would stop him, bring another player in and continue to play the game. Unfortunately, we cannot do this in football." Jesus has spent the past 11 months rebuilding his fitness, working through an exhaustive conditioning programme designed to ensure he returns fully prepared rather than rushed back prematurely. After rejoining full training in recent weeks, he was named on the bench for Arsenal's matches against Chelsea and Brentford but did not make it onto the pitch. Instead, the club opted to give him controlled exposure by organising a private friendly as he played behind-closed-doors against Watford in late November. "We took the opportunity; they wanted a bit of exposure to competition, and providing that was very positive." Now, it has been revealed that Jesus is involved in a friendly against United, held at St George's Park. A statement on the Arsenal website read: "Gabriel Jesus and Max Dowman have travelled with the under-21s for a behind-closed-doors friendly against Manchester United at St George's Park as they look to build up their match fitness." For an Arsenal side that has battled through injuries to key attacking figures, Jesus's return will be timely. Havertz is still sidelined, while Leandro Trossard made a return against Aston Villa on Saturday but was forced off again. Whereas, the Gunners are also struggling in defence as their first-choice centre-back pairing of William Saliba and Gabriel are also sidelined. But games keep coming thick and fast with a busy festive schedule set to test Arsenal's squad depth. However, Arteta was not eager to pay much heed to the fixture congestion and said: "The only thing I can say is that whenever it's possible to help and give the players an extra day or hours to fulfil their maximum potential, let's do it. When asked if he was happy with the summer business and the squad that he has at his disposal, Arteta provided a measured response. "We've built a squad that I believe was the best one to give us the possibility to do it," he said. If his performances in training are any indication, Arsenal supporters may not have long to wait before seeing Jesus back in competitive action.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their first match is against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium on June 12 -- one of eight matches being played in Inglewood. Defending champion Argentina will open the World Cup against Algeria. With the World Cup almost six months away, the countdown is officially on for many soccer fans in Los Angeles. I'm excited to be one of those fans cheering the U.S. on," said FIFA Women's World Cup champion Mia Hamm. Host Committee has been planning for the World Cup for eight years, and there will be eight matches held in Los Angeles over the course of the 39-day tournament. Tourism is one of the many drivers of L.A.'s economy, with over 540,000 residents who earn a living in tourism. "Because this is the largest World Cup in history, you have to first look at the economic impacts. We're expecting to see over half a billion dollars of new revenues for our local business community because of the World Cup, and thousands of new jobs. That's an amazing opportunity," said Adam Burke, the president and CEO of the L.A. Tourism and Convention Board. "Only 65,000 people will get tickets to a match at SoFi Stadium. We have a much bigger population here, plus a much bigger population of people that are going to visit our city," said Kathryn Schloessman, the CEO of the L.A. 2026 World Cup Host Committee. We want to make sure they have a great experience." "We're actually putting together a 39-day programming calendar that highlights all parts of L.A. so that fans from around the world can take advantage of all that L.A. has to offer. That includes the official fan fest, the watch parties, and so many activations, including our arts and cultural community," Burke said. Josef Momjian has had his shop in Pasadena for nearly 40 years. I believe, at least, they pass the group, and we'll see how it goes from there. Mexico will host the first match of next summer's World Cup against South Africa. The conversation is buzzing on who will do well, and can the U.S. do well in this field? "I think they're going to have a tougher time than Mexico making it to the next round, because they have, I think, tougher opponents," said Felipe Velasco from Pasadena. World Cup merchandise, from jerseys to balls, is already on sale at Southland sports shops. Andrew Velasco says he hopes the world's best footballers coming to North America will make the world's most popular sport even more popular here in the U.S. It's just a blend of people from different parts of the world celebrating where they're from, and being able to celebrate it here means a lot to a lot of people," Andrew Velasco said. The last World Cup at 32 teams, but this time around, 48 countries will be represented.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guzan visited our WSB-TV studios and spoke to Channel 2's Linda Stouffer on his experience and what to expect in Atlanta. “What is it really like to be at the World Cup?” Stouffer asked Guzan. “It's something that you're proud to represent your team. But when you have backing of the entire country during that one moment ... that gives you goosebumps. That ultimate dream will be playing out over eight matches in Atlanta next summer. But there's all the additional events in and outside Mercedes-Benz Stadium too. It's a place that Guzan called home for nine seasons with Atlanta United. “We know the stadium itself is brilliant from a fans' perspective,” Guzan said. “But from a players perspective, it's unbelievable to go in there, to walk out of the tunnel to feel the emotional as you go out on the field.
