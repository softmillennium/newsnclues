                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If enacted, the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025 would provide "at least" $600 per adult and dependent child, or $2,400 for a family of four, according to a statement from Hawley. The bill allows for a larger rebate if tariff revenue exceeds projections. Whatever the final amount, the benefit would be reduced by 5% for joint filers with an adjusted gross income above $150,000 or single filers earning more than $75,000. The Senate bill comes after President Donald Trump on Friday told reporters the administration was "thinking about a little rebate" for Americans from tariff revenue. More from Personal Finance:Trump's tariffs could soon bring higher food prices for some AmericansAhead of the Fed meeting, here's where borrowing rates standEven many high-earning Americans don't feel wealthy. "Like President Trump proposed, my legislation would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump's tariffs are returning to this country," Hawley said in a statement. However, it's unclear whether the proposal has broad Republican support, particularly among fiscally conservative lawmakers. Earlier this year, Trump and Elon Musk floated a $5,000 dividend check for Americans, funded by savings from the Department of Government of Efficiency. The Treasury Department reported an unexpected surplus for June, with a boost from tariff revenue. The duties reflect a 301% gain from June 2024. The tariff rebate check proposal comes as a chorus of lawmakers and policy experts voice concerns about the federal budget deficit. "I don't think [a rebate] would be particularly good policy," Tax Foundation senior economist Alex Durante told CNBC on Friday. "I would prefer that the revenue was used for deficit reduction rather than just cutting checks to people." Enacted in early July, Trump's "one big beautiful" tax-and-spending package could add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the deficit through 2034, according to a conventional score released by the Congressional Budget Office this week. The motivation for sending the direct payments would be different than they were during the Covid pandemic, when many households were losing income or unable to work, said Joseph Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center's tax and income supports division. Now, the federal government is imposing tariffs that will cost U.S. households, and this would be a way of helping those individuals and families, Rosenberg said. U.S. consumers are expected to pay higher prices via companies negatively impacted by the trade policy. An analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale released Monday found Trump's tariffs could cost U.S. households an average of $2,400 in 2025. Pandemic-era fiscal stimulus contributed to an increase in inflation of about 2.6 percentage points in the U.S., according to 2023 research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Negotiations between JPMorgan and Apple have progressed as earlier contenders for the card including American Express, Synchrony and Barclays have fallen to the side, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about the agreement. A deal for JPMorgan to take over the Apple Card and its huge book of loans would further burnish the bank's reputation as a leader in American finance. With JPMorgan-branded and co-branded cards, the Jamie Dimon-led company is the country's largest issuer by purchase volume. For Goldman, offloading the Apple Card business would help it move past a rocky chapter for CEO David Solomon. Goldman entered the credit card business with great fanfare in 2019 by beating out other issuers for the Apple Card. But the high growth rates of the card, coupled with accounting requirements that forced it to front-load reserves for future losses, caught Goldman flat footed. Solomon, who was facing pressure from partners unhappy about the consumer business, made the call to divest the card business partly out of concern that loan losses would rise in a recession, according to one of the sources. Goldman had $20.5 billion in total credit card loans at the end of March. The bank is also in the process of moving its General Motors card business to Barclays. For Apple, JPMorgan would bring stability after years marked by high growth, but also regulatory scrutiny over how Goldman handled billing and refunds in the business. Goldman had signed up to service the card through at least 2029. JPMorgan is seen as more disciplined than Goldman was in that it will only sign an agreement if concessions are made over how the Apple Card is serviced, among other sticking points, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Benjamin Granger, chief workplace psychologist at software company Qualtrics, your posture, expression and behavior are key to making a good first impression. "When we meet somebody for the first time, what we don't realize fully is that our brains are at work," he says. Subconsciously, those nonverbal cues influence your perception of that person, Granger says. Granger shares more body language tips in Smarter by CNBC Make It's course, How to Ace Your Job Interview. This tip may sound obvious, but "it's amazing what a simple smile can do" to build goodwill with your interviewer, Granger says. Whether you realize it or not, most people can actually tell whether your smile is authentic or forced, he says. According to Granger, a "real, genuine smile" causes small wrinkles at the edges of your eyes. To make a good impression at a job interview, Granger recommends sitting in an "open body posture"  with your shoulders back and hands separated. On the other hand, sitting in a closed body posture with crossed arms or legs might signal that you're uninterested in the conversation, or possibly even hiding something. Additionally, Granger says, make sure that your torso and legs are facing the interviewer squarely. There's an old adage that you can learn a lot about a person through their handshake — and it's absolutely true, Granger says. According to Granger, there are three main types of handshake, each with a different meaning. In an even handshake, you deliver a firm squeeze with your palms parallel to the other person's. "It communicates that you view the other person as your equal," Granger says. Of course, you can't control what kind of handshake your interviewer will give you, but in any case, remember the key principles of open body language, Granger says: "Shoulders back, head up, chin up, be confident." "The number one tip that I wish people would really believe in interviewing is just to be yourself," Granger says. Often, people feel like they have to "put on a show" in interviews, he says. It's natural to want to present the best version of yourself, but your body language will quickly reveal whether or not you are behaving authentically. "If you fake it, they will know," Granger says. Consciously or not, "there's a pretty good chance that the interviewer is going to feel like something's wrong." Instead, head into the interview with a positive, confident attitude. "Assume that this is going to be an exciting experience," Granger says. Get Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Faced with intensifying pressure from President Donald Trump to bring more jobs to the U.S., Apple is opening a manufacturing program in downtown Detroit. The Apple Manufacturing Academy, which is being administered by Michigan State University, will offer workshops on manufacturing and artificial intelligence to small and medium-sized businesses when it opens in August, Apple said on Tuesday. Apple is one of the most admired hardware companies in the world, manufacturing tens of millions of complicated devices each year across a global supply chain. "With this new programming, we're thrilled to help even more businesses implement smart manufacturing so they can unlock amazing opportunities for their companies and our country," Sabih Khan, Apple's newly named chief operating officer, said in the statement. The announcement is part of a public effort by Apple to highlight its U.S. operations and investments to appease Trump, who has called on the company to move iPhone production to the U.S. while he implements tariffs that will likely raise Apple's costs. Apple first promised to open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in February, when it announced plans to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, investing in products, programs and companies. Apple also said it would assemble AI servers in Houston and buy chips from a TSMC factory based in Arizona. While Trump hailed Apple's plans in February, his administration has continued to try and strong-arm the company into assembling iPhones in the U.S., which experts say would be cost prohibitive and take a very long time. In May, Trump said he had a "little problem" with CEO Tim Cook, who had said that Apple expanded production to India to avoid Chinese tariffs. I don't want you building in India," Trump said. Apple runs a similar program focusing on software development, instead of manufacturing. Apple has 18 developer academies around the world, according to its website, notably in countries where the iPhone maker wants to forge a working relationship with governments, such as Brazil, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. Apple said that it would provide consulting services to small businesses through the program, and that the manufacturing academy would also offer some courses virtually later this year.

Read more of Business Insider's coverage on the Manhattan shooting. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed. LePatner attended the elite NYC private school Horace Mann and Yale University. She joined Blackstone in 2014 when its core assets portfolio, which invests in commercial properties like warehouses, office buildings, rental housing, and hotels, was a nascent investment category. Back then, she said that her unit was, "for all intents and purposes, a startup." "I faced all the challenges one could imagine when building a multibillion-dollar business — from hiring to ensuring standards remain high, moving quickly to keep up with growth, and staying ahead of market swings and growing pains," she said. Blackstone President Jon Gray referenced her "tremendous talent" when it was announced she would take leadership of the investment vehicle from former BREIT CEO Frank Cohen, who stepped down in January. LePatner was also involved in developing mentorship opportunities for women at Blackstone. In a video interview on the firm's website, when asked if she feels there are strong opportunities for women to lead in the industry, she said, "I am a big believer of, 'if you can see it, you can be it,'" referencing her high-profile colleagues Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of real estate, and Joan Solotar, the firm's global head of private wealth solutions. A trustee of New York's Met Museum, LePatner also served on boards for The Abraham Joshua Heschel School and the UJA-Federation of New York. The latter honored her at its Wall Street dinner in 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft researchers analyzed which careers are most and least likely to be affected by generative AI and large language models based on an anonymized dataset of 200,000 conversations between users in the United States and the tech giant's Copilot chatbot, formerly known as Bing Copilot. They found that the jobs most likely to be affected involved those providing and communicating information, including translators, historians, and writers. Rival CEOs have disputed Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's view that AI could wipe out up to half of white-collar entry-level jobs in the next five years. Others in tech, such as Mark Cuban, think AI will be a net job creator. The paper doesn't cover whether interpreters and translators (the occupations they found that most overlapped with AI) should be fearful about their future. "Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation," Kiran Tomlinson, a senior researcher at Microsoft who's the lead author of the paper, said in a statement to Business Insider. They could then compare these findings with the types of tasks that are most likely to overlap with an AI chatbot. Their findings echo the growing research and views that AI chatbots will probably have a much greater overlap with office jobs than those requiring physical work or interactions. If this holds true, it means AI would change a different part of the workforce than past technological revolutions. Among the least affected jobs were phlebotomists, nursing assistants, and hazardous materials removal workers. The researchers also cautioned that their data concerns only large language models. "Other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving," they wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a major geopolitical development, Niger has signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia, marking the completion of a broader deal between Moscow and the three military-led governments of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES)—Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Our task is not just to participate in the extraction of uranium, we must create an entire system for the development of a peaceful atom in Niger,” Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev stated via the ministry's official Telegram channel. Tsivilev added that the memorandum outlines collaboration on multiple fronts, including “the construction of nuclear power plants (NPP), nuclear medicine, and joint training of specialists in this field.” The deal highlights Russia's long-term strategy to build a nuclear development ecosystem in Africa's military-led states and signals a new phase of strategic engagement in the Sahel. This deal marks the latest sign of deepening ties between Russia and Africa's transitional governments, which have increasingly turned to Moscow for diplomatic and technological support amid strained relations with Western powers. Last month, the Russian government approved similar civil nuclear cooperation agreements with Mali and Burkina Faso, signaling Moscow's long-term intent to expand its energy partnerships and influence across the strategically important Sahel region. Russia and Burkina Faso concluded their agreement at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), with Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev signing on behalf of Russia, and Burkina Faso's Minister of Energy, Mines and Quarries, Yacouba Zabré Gouba, signing on behalf of Ouagadougou. Likewise, Russia and Mali formalized their cooperation in Moscow, where Likhachev signed the agreement alongside Malian Minister of Energy and Water Resources, Boubacar Diane. For the Alliance of Sahel States (AES)—comprising Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger—this growing nuclear partnership is seen as a bold move toward energy sovereignty and long-term economic resilience, amid persistent power shortages, population growth, and infrastructure gaps.
